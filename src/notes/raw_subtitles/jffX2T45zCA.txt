Eight or 910 countries, Argentina
foremost among them that have aligned
with the United States on issue after
issue in international community events
all over the world.
In fact, these great allies like
Argentina.
But I can go into out of Costa Rica, you
know, I don't want to leave anybody out
of El Salvador, you know, But I think
one of the more promising developments
is later this month, there'll be an
election in Bolivia after 25, 30 years
of anti American hostile government.
Both of the candidates running in that
election, in the runoff election want
strong and better relations with the
United States.
So another transformative opportunity
there.
But so I think this is important.
This is our our hemisphere.
It's where we live.
And having strong neighbors such as and
great progress has been made and will
make more.
Over the last nine months, really over
the last nine months, I believe the
president's for much I want to say this.
Do you imagine soon a free trade
agreement with Argentina?
Could it be possible soon?
Yeah, it will be.
Hello.
We're going to discuss some of it today,
but no where.
We want to help Argentina.
And we want to always help ourselves,
but we want to help Argentina.
And one of the ways we can do they have
great product and we used to do a lot of
trade.
And then
if you look at what the Democrats.
Well, they didn't know.
They didn't honestly, they didn't know
what they were doing.
But a lot of that trade disappeared and
they have great product.
So we will be trading with Argentina
that will be helpful to them.
And so form it's good for us.
Also, this president was trying to try
to draw a wedge between the U.S.
and Argentina by buying soybeans from
Argentina, not U.S.
farmers and and China on the Falklands.
China likes to draw ships, too.
Yeah, sure.
I mean, I guess that's natural.
It's China and it's natural, but
it's not going to stop going to mean
anything in the end.
Mr.
President, we're going to continue
should not continue in the China.
Sure.
And close the space race in Ukraine.
I don't think you should be doing
business much.
You can do some trade, but you certainly
shouldn't be doing beyond that,
certainly shouldn't be doing anything
having to do with the military, with
China.
And if that's what's happening, I'd be
very upset about that.
Yeah, I'm really sure that's got me
surprised.
You do understand What about this one?
Because it's so important for African
countries to go ahead and provide
the the American assistance is not
predicated on this swap with China being
closed.
Any reporting to that effect is
incorrect.
Mr..
You said sorry, but you've said that at
a convenient cost to export to China for
your business on the agenda and this
stuff is so important.
You
know, I was referring more to ports,
military bases, observation facilities
that have been created in Argentina down
the track.
More about this one much more than this
one.
Mr..
Because he was referring to that.
Yeah.
Behind you, please.
Yes, quite impressive for Argentina.
What's the benefits for United States in
helping this way?
Argentina just helping a great
philosophy take over a great country.
Argentina is one of the most beautiful
countries that I've ever seen, and
we want to see it succeed.
Very simple.
I mean, we don't have to do it.
It's not going to make a big difference
for our country, but it will in terms of
South America, if Argentina does well,
you're going to have others following
and a lot of others are following.
You have countries in South America that
two years ago would have never even been
thought of to go as democracies or as
just countries that want to do fair and
balanced trading.
And now all I mean, you mention Bolivia,
but you there are there are numerous
other countries that are coming our way.
And Brazil, as you know, I had a very
good conversation with the president.
I met him at the United Nations before I
went up to speak.
And then I found that he didn't have a
speech because they had no teleprompter.
They turned off my teleprompter
purposely.
It made it impossible for him,
but it didn't silence me.
I spoke with that and it was a good
speech.
But no, I don't think of that.
You go to the United Nations.
I'm speaking in front of 158 leaders and
the whole world.
And I look at my teleprompter and it's
dead.
They killed by teleprompter.
They wouldn't let the man that operated
into the booth.
Can you believe by
having a specific interest in economic
terms, I do have no, I want to see it
succeed.
I think it's going to be great and we
will benefit also.
But it's not that big a benefit because
it's not that big a country, but it's a
very important country and it's a
country that can be very successful.
There are some countries that will never
be successful.
This is a country that has great
potential.
If it has the right leadership and you
have the right leadership.
With this man right here.
Okay, Mr.
President, what do you support,
Dollarization?
I would say that I'll leave that up to
my
my economic people.
But I like I like the dollar.
I'm very strong on the dollar.
And anybody who wants to deal in
dollars, they have an advantage over
people that aren't.
But for the most part, we're keeping it
that way.
I think if Biden would have, you know,
Biden, that group would have gotten
elected, meaning Kamala,
you wouldn't have the dollar is as your
currency anymore.
You wouldn't have a world domination by
the dollar if I didn't win this
election.
And now the domination like BRICS.
I don't anybody wants to be in BRICS.
That's fine.
But we're going to put tariffs on you
nation.
Everybody dropped out.
They're all dropping out of BRICS.
BRICS was an attack on the dollar.
And I said, You want to play that game?
I'm going to put tariffs on your on your
all of your product coming into the U.S.
They said, like I said, we're dropping
out of BRICS.
And BRICS is like, they don't even talk
about it.
Scott, you want to add to that?
But we're very happy with the current
currency arrangement.
Mr.
President.
Chief Minister John Ryan.
First of all, congratulations.
Questions from ABC Fake News after what
you did with STEPHANOPOULOS to the vice
president of the United States.
I don't take questions from ABC Fake
news.
Brian, go ahead.
Yes, sir.
First of all, congratulations on
achieving peace.
You are indeed the peacemaker.
On a lighter note, I think I was going
to be called the peacemaker.
Actually, I did.
I saw some of the actions here.
Just go ahead.
But on a lighter note, Alyssa Fara, she
is one of the host on ABC's show The
View.
She said a while back, I'll quote, If
Trump gets the Israeli hostages out, I
promise I will wear a MAGA hat for one
day on this show and say thank you for
doing it.
Your response?
Well, did she put the hat on?
Well, she hasn't got the hat yet.
Who is it?
Which one?
Elizabeth Warren.
Well, she used to work for me, so she
used to work here.
I'll tell you about Alison.
She worked here.
She gave me the most beautiful letter.
When you know the administration.
The time came up.
The election was rigged.
I left.
She gave me the most beautiful letter
you've ever seen.
I was a great president.
What a great job.
Some of the letters have been quoted.
This is Alyssa,
who I never thought was very
outstanding.
I figured she would not make it.
And she did have a big role here.
And then we had January six, and she
left.
And she left after that or before that.
But she gave me the most beautiful
letters.
And then even months after she left, and
while we weren't here in L.A., she sent
another letter's glowing letter,
beautiful letter.
And then she got hired by The View, and
they gave her a couple of bucks and she
changed her view very quickly.
I never thought she'd make it.
Never thought she had what it took in
any way.
You know what that means.
But she's on The View.
But it just shows what a fraud the View
is, because this woman gave me letters
and statements.
She said I was the greatest president in
her lifetime.
Now, she's not that.
Also, I didn't consider it a great
compliment, but but I've had better.
Can we send her had more recently I've
had the greatest president of them all I
like that much about her is the
president.
Is that include Washington and Lincoln?
Yes, sir.
As I said, I like that phrase.
So I think she's a total I think she's a
godsend for this president.
I'm driving.
How long will it take Hamas to disarm?
And can you guarantee that is going to
happen?
They're going to disarm.
And because they said they were going to
disarm, and if they don't disarm, we
will disarm them.
How will you do that?
I don't have to explain that to you.
But if they don't disarm, we will disarm
them.
They know I'm not playing games.
Okay?
Now we did something monumental.
We got the hostages back.
That was the first thing we had to do.
Above all else, get the hostages back.
Now, they misrepresented it because we
were told they had 26, 24 of dead
hostages, if we can use those terms.
And it seems as though they don't have
that because we're talking about a much
lesser number.
But that's a very tough subject.
I want them back.
That's what they said.
I want them back.
Also, they said they were going to
disarm and initially speaking, they
needed you know, they did take out a
couple of gangs that were very bad,
very, very bad gangs.
And they did take them out and they
killed a number of gang members.
And that didn't bother me much, to be
honest with you.
That's okay.
And so a couple of very bad gangs, you
know, it's no different than other
countries like Venezuela sent their
gangs into us and we took care of those
gangs.
We have.
Washington, D.C.
is one of the safest cities in the
country.
It was one of the worst cities in the
country.
If you go back just a little while ago,
right now, it's safe.
You can walk to work.
Isn't it nice?
But we have
told them we want to disarm and they
will disarm.
And if they don't disarm, we will disarm
them.
And it'll happen quickly and perhaps
violently.
But they will disarm.
Do you understand me?
Yes.
You see, because you always everyone
says, Oh, well, they won't do so.
They will disarm.
And I spoke to Hamas
and I said, You're going to disarm,
right?
Yes, we're going to disarm.
That's what they told me.
They will disarm or we will disarm them.
Got it.
Okay.
What I heard you say quickly, sir, Also,
you said quickly, But what is the
deadline you're going to put on a
reasonable period of time pretty, pretty
quickly.
A reasonable period of time.
Congratulations on the peace you
achieved in the Middle East crisis.
And my question is regarding Argentina.
Does are you from.
I'm from Argentina.
Yes, I like the Argentina.
I like a much better the ABC today than
ABC fake me two years ago.
U.S.
support for Argentina depend on the
results of the upcoming legislative
elections and the ability of the
government to pass long lasting reforms
through Congress.
Well, I think if they don't do that,
we're not going to be around very long.
Scott, can you handle that one, please?
We're confident that the president's
party will and the coalition will do
well in the election.
And
this aid is predicated on robust
policies.
And going back to the failed Peronist
policies would cause a U.S.
rethink.
Same there.
It's a little bit it's a great question.
It's a little like New York.
You know, we are reading in Argentina
about New York.
We have a problem.
We have a communist who's 33 years old,
doesn't know a damn thing, practically.
He's never worked a day in his life.
And he sort of caught on.
Right.
And.
I'm not going to send a lot of money to
New York.
I don't have to.
You know, the money comes all through
the White House.
And if they're going to be sending us
stupid policies, I mean, communist
policies, which has proven for thousands
of years, doesn't work.
We I have to prove it again.
We're not going to ruin one of our great
cities because it will make that great.
We will clean up the crime in about 30
days.
Took 12 days to do Washington, D.C..
So New York is bigger.
And Chicago, we've already made a lot of
progress despite fighting from the
government.
But, well, Chicago is doing great.
Memphis is doing really great.
You know, we have great support there
from the political leaders.
They said, please come in and clean up
crime and we love it.
We've in one week.
Memphis is so good.
It's so much better.
We'll have it within a month.
We'll have that into a safe city again.
And all of these cities, we want to
clean them up.
We don't like that opposition.
But if somebody is going to be a
communist mayor of New York, it's a
fluke because he gets in.
There are a lot of failed of people that
he's running against.
I mean, we have failed.
You have inferior candidates or
something because it's impossible to
think that New York City can have a
communist mayor.
He's a communist.
He's not a socialist, by the way.
There's a big difference.
He's a communist.
He's down and dirty.
He's a communist.
He hates police.
He wants to get rid of all police.
I mean, how can a policeman he hates
Jewish people and yet he's got Jewish
people support.
He hates Jewish people.
So it comes through the White House, the
funding for New York and for everyplace
comes through the White House.
And I'm very generous and I was always
very generous with New York, even when
you had opposition there.
But I was always very generous.
But I wouldn't be generous to a
communist, a guy that's going to take
the money and throw it out the window
because you're talking about hundreds of
billions of dollars and we're not going
to let somebody get into office and
squander the taxpayer money from this
country.
We're not going to let it happen.
So it's a little bit like that with if
you take a look Argentina,
if the president doesn't win, I know the
person that he'd be running against, I
believe probably we probably have the
person a person is extremely far left
and a philosophy that got Argentina into
this problem in the first place.
So we would not be generous with
Argentina if that happened.
If he loses, we are not going to be
generous with Argentina.
Mr.
President.
Can you talk about Argentina, an
important in the Latin America.
What is your plan for Venezuelans?
But is there you the terrorism, the
narco terrorism in the president?
Maduro, what is your plan?
Well, Venezuela's done a couple of
things very badly.
Number one, we get drugs and all of
that, but we get something in a way
worse because they're a big purveyor of
drugs.
But we we have worse.
What they do very well is they send
their criminals into the United States
and they send trendy arugula that you
know very well you're from Venezuela and
they send them in by the thousands,
literally.
And these are the worst of all.
And they empty their prisons into the
United States.
They empty their mental institutions
into the United States.
And because we had a president whose low
IQ, he didn't realize what was going on.
And the people that are high IQ that
surround him, but they happen to be
lunatics, radical left.
They're highly intelligent, radical left
lunatics.
Okay.
So in a way that's worse than having a
guy like Biden.
But they ran the show.
You heard about the the European the
person that or that really operated the
European.
But it was really the people that told
the person that operated the Europe and
what to do.
Those are the people that really were
president.
Okay.
So we're not going to stand for it in
this country.
And
and by the way, that auto pen thing is
under serious investigation.
Just this I don't think you care because
you're from Washington.
You couldn't care less about that.
But I just want to say, because I do the
we've you know, the we've cover a lot of
different subjects.
But the people that are involved in that
auto pen scam, because he barely signed
anything.
I mean, this guy, I don't know how he
can be president, he barely signed it.
But the only thing we can find for sure
is that he signed Hunter's pardon his
pardon.
HUNTER Fine.
And I like that kind of combination.
So.
So we're going to work very much with
the president.
We think he's going to win.
He should win.
And if he does win, we're going to be
very helpful.
And if he doesn't win, we're not going
to waste our time because you have
somebody whose philosophy has no chance
of making Argentina great again.
What's your
advice?
Just to check something you said Hamas
assured you that they would disarm.
Was that a direct conversation or
through like Mr.
Whitcomb Through through my be okay at
the highest level, Once you you're out,
you might find it was a very bad
precedent
for pursuing me.
Later in Argentina, I said political
leaders advice is to hold strong to his
principles because he's right and he's
proving that he was right.
He's got one problem.
He's got people that are giving him
tremendously bad press,
even though they know it's wrong.
He's got to hold true to his principles
because he's going to win.
He's going to win.
He's doing the right thing.
Everybody knows he's doing the right
thing.
But you have a radical left sick culture
that's a very dangerous group of people
and they're trying to make him look bad.
I believe he's going to win out.
We're
trying to give him China exciting news,
but you have to be careful of China.
We have they're going to make money
deals with China.
They have to deal with us, too.
We have to be careful with China.
Look, I have a great relationship with
President Xi, but sometimes he gets
testy because China likes to take
advantage of people and they can't take
advantage of us.
But we have a fair relationship with
China, and I think it'll be fine.
And if it's not, that's okay, too.
You'd have to do you have to do and go
where the punches are thrown.
You you got to put up the blocks.
We have a lot of punches being thrown
and we've been very successful.
Look, we have the most success.
I think we're the most successful we've
ever been as a country.
We have now close, I've been saying 17.
We have, I think close to or maybe even
exceeding $18 trillion going to be
invested in the United States.
That's more money than ever invested in
any country before.
Even countries with much bigger
populations like India or like China.
Nobody's ever had $18 trillion invested
in the country we have.
And that's because of November 5th
election.
Because I won.
Oh, if if she won, you'd be negative.
You know, people getting out of the
country, this country would have been we
would have been in a major depression.
If she won, we would have been 1929.
They'd like to see that anyway.
That's why they keep the government was
ever shut down based on nonsense.
They want to give away 1.5.
Think of it.
They want to give away $1.5 trillion to
people that come into the country
illegally.
And as you know, the borders now are
closed.
But when they hear that they get the
greatest health care package in the
world and they have no money, but they
are living okay in another country
they had.
And they start forming caravans and they
try and come into our country.
But the big problem is they want to give
they want to give health care to people
that should not get health care.
They want to give health care to illegal
immigrants by the by the millions.
Look at Gavin Newsom, what he's done.
He's ruined.
California gives health care to anybody.
