All
 right.
 Hello
 everybody.


Welcome
 back
 to
 another
 episode
 of
 the


market
 close.
 We
 are
 live
 and
 what
 a


crazy
 day
 it
 has
 been.
 Not
 only
 a
 crazy


day,
 but
 a
 crazy
 week.
 Um,
 but
 today
 has


been
 pretty
 wild,
 folks.
 It
 looks
 like,


first
 of
 all,
 we
 got
 a
 lot
 of
 headlines


to
 talk
 about.
 We
 got
 a
 lot
 of
 stuff
 to


discuss.
 We
 had
 Tom
 Lee
 on
 CBC.
 We'll


get
 his
 thoughts
 on
 what's
 going
 on.


Steve
 will
 be
 on
 at
 about
 4:30
 and
 we'll


hear
 from
 him.
 But
 overall,
 equities


look
 like
 they're
 going
 to
 end
 out


green.
 It
 looks
 like
 we
 are
 going
 to
 end


out
 green.
 It
 has
 been
 a
 pretty
 wild
 uh


24
 hours.
 Primarily
 because
 if
 you


happen
 to
 be
 awake
 at
 2:30,
 3:00
 a.m.,


you
 saw
 stocks
 really
 take
 a
 a
 nose


dive.
 S&P
 500
 was
 closer
 to
 655.
 Right


now,
 we're
 at
 664.
 In
 the
 morning,
 you


really
 had
 a
 bunch
 of
 chop.
 I
 think
 we


had
 50
 different
 um
 green
 versus
 red


movements,
 teetering
 and
 tottering
 on


that
 green
 or
 red
 on
 the
 S&P
 500.
 We


almost
 had
 25
 different
 intraday
 highs


versus
 intraday
 lows.
 I
 mean,
 it's
 the


most
 choppiest
 it's
 ever
 been.
 And
 it


looks
 like
 we're
 ending
 out
 up
 0.5%.
 If


we
 do
 end
 out
 at
 664
 on
 the
 S&P
 500,


we'll
 actually
 be
 up
 6%
 for
 the
 week.
 We


started
 at
 660.
 We
 might
 end
 at
 664.
 So


even
 in
 the
 midst
 of
 all
 the
 volatility,


the
 VIX,
 which
 spiked
 up
 all
 the
 way
 to


25,
 closed
 above
 25
 yesterday,
 right
 now


at
 2148,
 down
 about
 15%.
 If
 you
 did
 buy


some
 puts
 on
 the
 VIX
 around
 that
 23
 24


time
 frame,
 those
 are
 working
 out.
 Uh


that
 has
 led
 to
 some
 of
 this
 volatility


coming
 down.
 A
 lot
 of
 that
 volatility


coming
 from
 the
 regional
 banks.
 A
 lot
 of


that
 volatility
 coming
 from
 China.
 We


have
 some
 updates
 on
 all
 that
 stuff.
 But


nonetheless,
 one
 could
 argue
 it
 did


create
 a
 buying
 opportunity
 today
 across


the
 board.
 And
 if
 you
 bought
 anything


and
 let
 me
 know
 in
 the
 chat
 if
 anyone


bought
 anything,
 you
 were
 likely
 getting


a
 little
 bit
 of
 momentum.
 Pounder
 right


there
 178.
 Robin
 Hood
 got
 all
 the
 way


down
 to
 12560.
 That's
 at
 130.
 Nvidia
 got


down
 to
 179.
 That's
 at
 183.
 SoFi,
 we
 got


some
 updates
 on
 SoFi.
 2669
 that
 got
 down


to
 26
 today.
 Grab
 got
 all
 the
 way
 to


554.
 Still
 not
 green
 on
 the
 day,
 but


564.
 So
 that
 is
 up.
 read
 it
 right
 there.


2%
 on
 the
 day
 down.
 Amazon
 still
 down
 to


212.
 That
 got
 all
 the
 way
 to
 211.
 I


mean,
 not
 every
 stock
 recovered.


Bitcoin,
 for
 example,
 got
 to
 103.
 It's


nice
 that
 it's
 at
 106,
 but
 it's
 not


necessarily
 recovering
 back
 into
 the


110s
 like
 it
 was
 in
 a
 couple
 days
 ago.


It
 was
 at
 110,
 112.
 Ethereum,
 as
 well,


just
 at
 3,800.
 Bit
 mine
 got
 all
 the
 way


down
 to
 47.
 I
 did
 buy
 a
 little
 bit
 at


4,950.
 Just
 a
 little
 bit.
 Not
 a
 crazy


amount.
 Just
 a
 little
 bit.
 4950.
 Took
 a


little bit
 of
 a
 nibble,
 but
 that's
 it.


Uh,
 and
 now
 we're
 at
 50.81.
 So,
 I
 mean,


look,
 could
 this
 thing
 collapse
 down


below
 45?
 Yes.
 It
 would
 really
 depend
 on


ETH.
 Do
 I
 think
 ETH
 is
 bottoming
 here?
 I


don't
 know.
 But
 I
 do
 think
 37
 3,800
 is


kind
 of
 where
 it's
 probably
 going
 to
 not


necessarily
 fall
 through
 unless
 you
 have


something
 else
 happen
 in
 the
 macro.
 But,


as
 of
 as
 a
 result
 of
 that,
 you
 got
 BMR


at
 least
 above
 50,
 which
 is
 not
 too
 bad.


Again,
 still
 red
 on
 the
 day,
 but
 only


red
 by
 half
 a
 percent
 versus
 being
 down


at
 the
 47s.
 Coinbase
 green
 on
 the
 day.


Coreweave
 down
 4%.
 This
 one
 did
 bounce


off
 129
 at
 136.
 So
 it's,
 you
 know,


better
 than
 them
 being
 at
 129,
 but
 still


down
 from
 140.
 You
 got
 the
 NASDAQ
 right


there
 up
 about
 7%.
 Then
 you
 got
 Crowd


Strike,
 that's
 a
 0.54%
 on
 the
 day.
 Just


a
 crazy
 week
 and
 a
 crazy
 day.
 Nebas


bounced
 off
 110.
 It's
 at
 114,
 not
 at
 120


like
 it
 was
 in
 the
 morning,
 but
 still


not
 the
 worst
 given
 it's
 at
 110.
 In


terms
 of
 the
 rare
 earths,
 these
 stocks


still
 red
 for
 the
 day.
 CRML
 is
 the
 only


one
 that
 ended
 up
 going
 green.
 The
 rest


of
 them
 are
 red
 for
 the
 week,
 red
 for


the
 day.
 Regional
 banks
 are
 all
 green.


And
 the
 reason
 regional
 banks
 are
 green,


and
 you
 know,
 I
 can't
 stress
 this


enough,
 every
 single
 regional
 bank
 that


reported
 today,
 including
 Truist


Financial,
 said
 their
 credit
 per
 their


their
 provision
 for
 credit
 losses
 were


lower
 by
 about
 50
 to
 $100
 million
 than


what
 Wall
 Street
 expected,
 which
 is


really
 good
 to
 make
 sure
 we
 don't
 have
 a


credit
 problem
 in
 this
 country.
 Key
 Bank


and
 Western
 Alliance
 had
 some
 issues


yesterday,
 but
 one
 could
 argue
 that


those
 are
 isolated
 issues.
 Now,
 maybe


they're
 not.
 I
 don't
 think
 there's


enough
 data,
 but
 based
 on
 the
 data
 we


got
 from
 the
 regional
 banks
 today,
 it


might
 not
 be
 the
 worst
 thing
 in
 the


world.
 So,
 you
 got
 the
 regionals
 that


are
 all
 green
 because
 they're
 kind
 of


rebounding
 from
 the
 fears
 that
 we
 had


yesterday.
 And
 then
 the
 Bitcoin
 miners


turn
 data
 centers,
 those
 are
 all
 red,


pretty
 much
 all
 red.
 I
 mean,
 they're


recovering
 a
 little
 bit.
 Farm's
 not


really
 recovering
 at
 all.
 That
 one,
 I


mean,
 it
 bounced
 at
 468,
 but
 still
 below


$5.
 I
 ran,
 at least
 it's
 not
 at
 54.
 It's


at
 60,
 but
 still
 down
 from
 74
 where
 it


was
 in
 the
 morning.
 Uh,
 and
 then
 Oaklo,


of
 course,
 this
 stock
 is
 just
 always


green.
 So
 Oaklo
 still
 green
 on
 the
 day.


Um,
 so
 it
 was
 just
 one
 of
 those
 days.
 It


was
 one
 of
 those
 days.
 There's
 not
 even


that
 much
 explanation
 for
 it.
 You
 got


some
 quotes
 from
 Trump.
 He
 had
 a
 meeting


with
 Zinsky.
 We'll
 watch
 some
 clips
 of


that.
 You
 have
 the
 regional
 crisis.


Everyone
 gave
 their
 thoughts
 on
 that.
 It


doesn't
 look
 like
 it's
 going to
 be
 that


big
 of
 a
 deal.
 And
 then
 you
 had
 Bent
 in


the
 morning
 talk
 about
 China
 and


basically
 deescalate
 the
 situation
 with


China.
 Even
 Trump
 talked
 about
 China


this
 morning
 and
 said
 that
 he's
 not


going
 to
 put
 100%
 tariffs
 on
 China.


Explicitly.
 He
 said
 that.
 Then
 when
 he


was
 taking
 Q&A
 during
 the
 Ukraine


meeting,
 he
 said
 uh
 he
 reserves
 the


right
 to
 implement
 the
 tariffs
 quicker


than
 on
 November
 1st.
 Again,
 it's
 almost


like
 he's
 just
 saying
 things
 now
 to
 try


to
 gain
 leverage.
 And
 you
 know,
 it
 might


not
 necessarily
 be
 something
 he
 actually


wants
 to
 do,
 but
 I
 think
 you
 have
 all


those
 headlines
 running
 around
 along


with
 the
 fact
 that
 September
 and
 August


were
 really
 good
 and
 you're
 probably


going
 to
 get
 a
 bit
 of
 volatility
 going


into
 October
 seasonally
 and
 after
 you


have
 those
 massive
 runs
 for
 two
 months


in
 a
 row.
 They're
 taking
 a
 bit
 of
 a


breather
 and
 it
 seems
 like
 that's
 what


we've
 got
 going
 here.
 Ra
 says,
 "This


volatility
 makes
 me
 all
 the
 more
 bullish


because
 it's
 just
 manufacturer


manipulation
 trying
 to
 shake
 out
 the


weak
 hands
 before
 record
 earnings."


Yeah,
 I
 mean
 look,
 that's
 another


argument
 that
 I
 think
 is
 very
 fair.
 We


are
 going
 to
 get
 into
 a
 week.
 I
 mean,


we've
 already
 had
 record
 earnings.


Here's
 a
 stat
 for
 you
 guys
 that's
 really


interesting.
 The
 S&P
 500
 on
 a
 price


basis
 is
 up
 0.1%


uh
 over
 the
 not
 not
 the
 stock
 price,
 but


the
 actual
 price
 to
 earnings
 basis
 uh


over
 the
 past
 over
 the
 past
 what
 is
 this


over
 the
 past
 year
 from
 2024.


The
 actual
 earnings
 growth
 is
 11%.
 So,


you
 have
 a
 1%
 movement
 on
 the
 PE
 and
 you


have
 an
 earnings
 growth
 like
 the
 actual


percentage
 of
 the
 growth
 year-over-year.


I
 think
 it's
 like
 from
 270
 to
 295
 or


something
 closer
 to
 11%.
 So,
 all
 of
 the


expansion
 on
 the
 S&P
 500
 has
 not
 been


primarily
 just
 the
 the
 price
 of
 the
 S&P


500
 going
 up.
 It
 really
 has
 been


earnings
 multiples
 expanding
 because
 the


earnings
 have
 been
 good
 enough
 to


justify
 the
 expansion.
 And
 if
 that


continues
 going
 into
 the
 end
 of
 the


year,
 I
 think
 that's
 going
 to
 be


exciting.
 That's
 going
 to
 be
 very,
 very


exciting.
 We
 just
 have
 to
 see
 if
 that
 is


what
 we
 get
 going
 to
 Q3.
 BMR
 right
 there


getting
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 dip
 right
 now


below
 50.
 You
 got
 Google61,
 Grab
 1.28%,


pounder
 going
 flat
 on
 the
 day
 and
 then


Tesla
 2.2%


43847


on
 the
 day.
 S&P
 500
 again
 664.
 This
 is


what
 Trump
 had
 to
 say
 on
 Zalinsky
 and


Ukraine
 during
 the
 meeting
 today.


>> We're
 not
 losing
 people.
 The
 United


States
 is
 not
 We're
 not
 losing
 people.


We're
 not
 spending
 money.
 We're
 getting


paid
 for
 the,
 you
 know,
 ammunition
 and


missiles
 and
 everything
 else
 that
 we're


sending
 to
 the
 European
 European
 Union,


but
 to
 NATO,
 but
 it's
 very
 similar
 if


you
 look
 at
 the
 countries.
 I
 mean,
 it's


very
 similar.
 And
 we
 just
 made
 a
 very


fair
 trade
 deal
 with
 the
 European
 Union


and
 what
 we
 wanted
 and
 we
 made
 a
 very


good
 deal
 with
 NATO,
 too.
 You
 know,
 they


pay
 for
 all
 of
 this.
 That's
 not
 what


we're
 in
 this
 for.
 We're
 in
 it
 to
 save


thousands
 of
 lives
 every
 week.
 thousands


and
 thousands
 of
 lives.
 That's
 why
 we're


in
 it.


>> And
 then
 this
 is
 what
 Trump
 said
 about


his
 meeting
 with
 Putin.


>> To
 be
 determined,
 but
 I
 would
 say
 most


likely
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 uh
 a
 double


meeting.
 It'll
 be
 a
 double
 meeting,
 but


we
 will
 have
 uh
 the
 president
 Zalinski


uh
 in
 touch.
 There's
 a
 lot
 of
 blood
 bad


blood
 with
 the
 two
 presidents,
 and
 I'm


not
 speaking
 out
 of
 turn
 when
 I
 say
 it.


It's
 very
 a
 very
 difficult
 situation.


You
 know,
 we
 just
 settled
 the
 war
 in


after
 thousands
 of
 years.
 I
 guess
 people


say
 anywhere
 from
 500
 to
 3,000
 years.


And
 I
 I
 was
 in
 rooms
 as
 you
 saw
 because


you
 were
 with
 me.
 A
 lot
 of
 you
 were
 with


me
 last
 week
 with
 leaders
 that
 didn't


like
 each
 other,
 but
 they
 were
 able
 to


get
 along.
 Uh


these
 two
 leaders
 do
 not
 like
 each
 other


and


we
 want
 to
 make
 it
 comfortable
 for


everybody.
 So,
 one
 way
 or
 the
 other
 will


be
 involved
 in
 threes,
 but
 it
 may
 be


separated
 to
 be.


>> And
 then
 this
 is
 the
 last
 clip
 right


here
 where
 uh
 Trump
 ended
 up
 letting
 uh


letting
 one
 of
 those
 words
 out.


>> Maduro
 offered
 everything
 in
 it
 in
 his


country,
 all
 the
 natural
 resources.
 He


even
 recorded
 a
 message
 to
 you
 in


English
 recently
 uh
 offering
 mediation.


What
 could
 we
 do
 in
 order
 to
 stop
 that?


>> He
 has
 offered
 everything.
 He's
 offered


everything.
 You're
 right.
 You
 know
 why?


Because
 he
 doesn't
 want
 to
 [ __ ]
 around


with
 the
 United
 States.
 Thank
 you,


everybody.


>> The
 last
 time
 Trump
 used
 that
 word
 was


when
 he
 was
 talking
 about
 the
 Israel


conflict
 and
 he
 said,
 "These
 guys
 don't


know
 what
 the
 f
 they're
 doing."
 So,
 you


could
 tell
 that
 uh
 this
 situation
 is


obviously
 making
 him
 passionate.
 But


that
 overall
 press
 conference
 didn't


necessarily
 have
 that
 much
 of
 an
 impact


on
 the
 market.


I
 mean
 based
 on
 what
 he
 said
 and
 based


on
 how
 he
 answered
 the
 questions,


markets
 didn't
 care
 that
 much.
 So


overall,
 whatever
 volatile
 events
 people


expected
 today
 in
 regards
 to
 Trump


talking,
 options
 expiring,
 etc.
 I
 mean,


he
 got
 the
 chop
 back
 and
 forth,
 but
 you


do
 have
 the
 S&P
 500
 that
 looks
 like
 it


still
 will
 close
 up
 about
 0.56%
 on
 the


day.
 Here's
 another
 stat
 that's
 really


important
 to
 understand,
 or
 maybe
 not


really
 a
 stat,
 but
 more
 so
 the
 the
 logic


underlying
 the
 statistic.
 All
 of
 us
 have


heard
 that
 Q4
 historically
 you
 tend
 to


get
 a
 4.7%
 rally.
 A
 4.7%
 rally
 uh
 every


time
 you
 know
 Q
 I
 mean
 historically
 Q4


tends
 to
 average
 out
 almost
 a
 5%
 gain.


Something
 I
 heard
 today
 kind
 of
 kind
 of


made
 me
 think
 about
 this
 and
 I
 mean
 this


could
 be
 bearish
 or
 this
 could
 be


bullish
 the
 way
 you
 interpret
 it.
 But


one
 of
 the
 reasons
 Q4
 tends
 to
 be
 so


good
 is
 because
 August
 and
 September


tend
 to
 suck.


So
 what
 happened
 this
 year?
 August
 and


September
 didn't
 suck.
 And
 so
 it
 makes


you
 wonder
 a
 little
 bit.
 Okay,
 the


reason
 Q4
 ends
 to
 be
 it
 tends
 to
 be
 so


good
 is
 because
 it
 it
 kind
 of
 gets
 a


setup
 from
 a
 crappy
 August
 and
 September


and
 then
 you
 get
 a
 rally
 into
 alltime


highs
 and
 you
 get
 all
 this
 money
 piling


in
 towards
 the
 end
 of
 the
 year.
 If
 the


all-time
 high
 has
 already
 been
 hit
 or


really
 we
 got
 close
 to
 it
 in
 two
 months


where
 historically
 it's
 supposed
 to
 be


weak.
 Now,
 one
 could
 argue
 that
 because


we
 had
 that
 30%
 draw
 down
 in
 April,


that's
 why
 April
 and
 September
 were


strong.
 Maybe
 Q4
 doesn't
 have
 to
 have


the
 same
 seasonal
 return
 that
 you've
 had


uh
 in
 in
 the
 past.
 And
 really,
 it
 comes


down
 to
 earnings
 growth.
 I
 think that's


going to
 be
 the
 fundamental
 question.
 If


that
 can't
 be
 denied,
 then
 we
 probably


will
 get
 to
 those
 alltime
 highs.
 But
 I


do
 think
 the
 market's
 exhausted.
 I


really
 do.
 I
 think
 crypto's
 exhausted.


The
 market's
 exhausted.
 I
 mean,
 speaking


of
 exhausting,
 gold
 is
 freaking


exhausted.
 Take
 a
 look
 at
 gold
 today.


Lows
 of
 the
 day
 1.58%.
 It
 actually
 got


below
 4200
 at
 one
 point,
 so
 it's
 not


exactly
 at
 the
 lows
 of
 the
 day.
 Then


silver
 down
 about
 4%.
 I
 think
 Hood
 is


exhausted.
 I
 think
 Nebus
 is
 exhausted.
 I


think
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 stocks
 are


exhausted
 and
 the
 exhaustion
 potentially


is
 giving
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 a
 great
 buying


opportunity
 or
 you
 know
 there
 might
 be


some
 more
 exhaustion
 left.
 But


nonetheless,
 I
 think
 exhaustion
 is
 the


theme
 of
 the
 market
 this
 week
 just
 like


resiliency
 was
 the
 theme
 of
 the
 market


for
 the
 past
 couple
 weeks
 and
 that's


okay.
 I
 don't
 think
 that's
 the
 worst
 in


the
 world.
 Where
 is
 HIMS?
 This
 one
 had
 a


pretty
 rough
 day.
 Wow.
 15%.


I
 have
 not
 looked
 at
 him
 for
 the
 past


two
 hours.
 Last
 time
 we
 looked
 at
 it
 was


at
 54.
 Is
 this
 really
 all
 because
 of
 the


CEO
 selling
 thing
 that's
 pissing
 people


off?
 No,
 it
 has
 to
 be
 because
 of
 Trump


and
 what
 he
 said
 about
 Ozenmpic.


Is
 Lily
 in
 the
 same
 situation?
 Lily
 is


down
 2%.


Novo,
 that's
 a
 stale
 boner.
 Yeah,
 that


might
 be
 a
 st
 Novo
 right
 here
 down
 3%.
 I


mean,
 all
 the
 pharmaceuticals
 in
 that


GLP
 space
 are
 down,
 but
 Hims
 is
 just


wrecked.


Wrecked.


I
 don't
 think
 it's
 because
 of
 the
 CEO


selling
 and
 the
 whole
 Twitter


controversy
 we
 talked
 about
 in
 the


morning,
 but
 again,
 I
 don't
 think
 it's
 a


good
 look.
 And
 you
 might
 have
 some


people
 that
 are
 pissed
 off
 about
 it,
 but


I
 feel
 like
 I
 just
 don't
 know
 if
 that's


enough
 of
 a
 reason
 for
 why
 you're
 seeing


that
 sell
 off.
 Nvidia
 right
 there,
 183.


Nvidia
 actually
 being
 a
 good
 performer


today,
 up
 about
 1%,
 which
 is
 nice
 to


see.
 AMD
 right
 there,
 that's
 down
 about


half
 a
 percent.
 Broadcom,
 that
 also
 is


down
 about
 1.2,
 but
 it
 bounced
 at
 340,


which
 is
 not
 too
 bad.
 A
 couple
 quick


headlines,
 then
 we
 got
 the
 market
 close


and
 then
 we'll
 hear
 what
 we
 have
 from


Tom
 Lee.
 SoFi
 uh
 international
 money
 uh


uh
 transfers
 are
 live.
 SoFi
 members
 who


joined
 our
 wait
 list
 will
 start
 gaining


access
 to
 send
 money
 to
 Mexico
 directly


from
 their
 SoFi
 checkings
 and
 savings


account
 with
 more
 countries
 on
 the
 way.


Uh
 not
 many
 banks
 allow
 you
 to
 have
 the


ability
 to
 send
 cash
 that
 quickly
 with


worldwide
 money
 transfers.
 So
 it's
 nice


to
 see
 SoFi
 update
 a
 ton
 of
 different


press
 releases
 over
 the
 past
 couple
 of


days
 in
 anticipation
 of
 the
 earnings


that
 are
 going
 to
 be
 coming
 up
 soon.
 And


it
 looks
 like
 that's
 what
 you
 got
 from


SoFi
 as
 we
 get
 into
 their
 earnings
 that


is
 going
 to
 be
 happening
 next
 week.
 So
 I


thought
 that
 I
 thought
 that
 was
 also


nice
 to
 see.
 And
 then
 Starbucks
 is


potentially
 thinking
 of
 selling
 off


their
 China
 business.
 I
 thought
 this
 was


inevitable.
 I
 mean
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the


day,
 you
 know,
 China
 is
 a
 big
 market
 for


Starbucks,
 but
 it's
 also
 super


competitive
 in
 China.
 So
 they
 are
 taking


offers
 right
 now
 to
 the
 tune
 of
 about
 10


billion
 dollars
 potentially
 to
 sell
 off


that
 China
 business.
 Starbucks
 up
 about


1%
 on
 the
 day.
 wouldn't
 be
 the
 worst


idea,
 but
 we
 got
 to
 see
 if
 that
 is
 how


this
 ends
 up
 playing
 out.
 Yeah,
 maybe


they
 sell
 it
 to
 luck
 and
 coffee.
 Maybe


that's
 what
 they
 do.
 All
 right,
 folks.


There
 we
 go.
 It
 has
 been
 a
 wild
 week,


emotional
 week
 across
 the
 board.
 At
 the


end
 of the
 day,
 if
 you're
 an
 investor


and
 you
 have
 capital
 that
 is
 compounding


in
 the
 markets,
 that
 is
 what
 matters.


And
 most
 of
 us
 are
 still
 up
 a
 lot
 year


to
 date.
 We'll
 do
 year-to-
 date


percentages
 as
 well
 uh
 at
 the
 close.
 But


nonetheless,
 we
 survived
 another
 week.


There
 you
 go.
 Friday,
 October
 17th,
 4


p.m.
 The
 stock
 market


is
 now
 closed.


We
 are
 done.
 We
 are
 done.


Friday,
 we
 are
 done
 with
 another
 week


in
 the
 stock
 market.
 We
 have
 two
 We
 have


eight
 We
 have
 10
 weeks
 left.
 10
 weeks


left
 of
 the
 year.
 Not
 just
 10
 weeks
 left


for
 Q3
 or
 Q4.
 We
 have
 10
 weeks
 left
 of


2025,


which
 is
 freaking
 crazy,
 but
 that
 is


what
 you
 got.
 All
 right.
 S&P
 500
 5%
 on


the
 day,
 664.
 Not
 too
 bad.
 Basically
 up


half
 a
 percent
 for
 the
 week.
 Nvidia,


that's
 up
 1%.
 Tesla
 up
 2.5.
 Pounds
 here.


That's
 flat
 on
 the
 day.
 Robin
 Hood
 gets


the
 130
 close.
 SoFi
 2658.
 AMD
 232.


Google
 253.
 Grab
 gets
 a
 563
 close.


Reddit
 2%.
 Amazon
 crush
 this
 week
 213.
 I


did
 buy
 a
 lot
 more
 Amazon
 this
 week
 and


we're
 going
 to
 see
 what
 they
 deliver
 on


earnings.
 Salesforce
 down
 1%.
 Meta
 716


on
 the
 close.
 PayPal
 actually
 up
 2%
 on


the
 day.
 Not
 too
 bad
 after
 their
 $300


trillion
 mistake
 with
 their
 stable
 coin.


ELF
 that's
 up
 1%.
 Apple
 was
 actually
 up


2%
 of
 the
 day
 after
 that
 Formula
 1
 deal.


SMCI
 down
 3%.
 ETH
 3,800.
 Bitcoin
 106
 app


loven
 that
 was
 down
 about
 1%
 just
 below


600
 circle
 up
 1.4
 down
 1.4
 for
 Nphas


down
 2.3
 and
 then
 Microsoft
 flat
 on
 the


day
 actually
 up.39%
 on
 the
 day
 back
 in


that
 510
 to
 515
 range
 then
 again
 S&P
 664


Rocket
 Lab
 how
 did
 that
 get
 the
 close
 on


the
 day
 66
 okay
 slightly
 down
 as
 83
 down


from
 102
 whereas
 Lemonade
 which
 Lemonade


made
 some
 headlines
 today
 saying
 they


would
 license
 or
 they
 would
 cover
 all


the
 insurance
 for
 Tesla
 FSD


some
 people
 thought
 of
 it
 as
 a
 joke
 some


people
 thought
 of
 it
 as
 a
 Cool
 idea.


Lemonade
 is
 an
 insurance
 company
 and
 I


think
 the
 CEO
 tweeted
 that
 they're


offering
 to
 handle
 all
 the
 Tesla
 FSD


miles
 driven
 underneath
 Lemonade
 for


free.
 I
 don't
 fully
 understand
 exactly


what
 he
 was
 saying,
 but
 uh
 that
 stock


right
 here
 up
 1.3%
 on
 the
 day.
 Oscar


right
 here
 down.
 Wow.
 Oscar
 8%
 hit.


Didn't
 look
 at
 Oscar
 for
 the
 past
 couple


hours
 either.
 That
 one
 got
 kind
 of


wrecked.
 And
 then
 HIMS
 4972
 16%
 down
 on


the
 day.


16%
 down
 on
 the
 day.
 Not
 sure
 why
 Oscar


had
 that
 big
 of
 a
 drop.
 Maybe
 it
 had
 to


do
 with
 some
 of
 the
 subsidies,
 but
 HIMS


right
 there
 15.89.
 And
 then
 BMR,
 did
 we


get
 a
 $50
 close?
 We
 got
 a
 4979
 close
 on


Bitmine.


And
 that
 is
 what
 we
 got.


Uh,
 Quantum
 Names,
 QBTS
 was
 down
 8%
 when


I
 checked,
 actually
 recovered,
 now
 only


down
 3%.
 So,
 that
 one
 caught
 a
 bit
 of
 a


bid.
 Same
 thing
 probably
 with
 the
 other


ones.
 I
 regretti
 only
 down
 3.6%.
 Again,


the
 Bitcoin
 miners,
 Regetti
 was
 down


about
 three
 Bitcoin
 miners.
 Rare
 Earth


stock
 still
 down
 other
 than
 CRML.


Bitcoin
 miners,
 they
 were
 flat
 to
 red,


but
 still
 red
 mostly,
 not
 as
 red
 as
 they


were
 earlier
 in
 the
 morning,
 which
 is


good
 to
 see.
 And
 then
 the
 regionals
 were


kind
 of the
 winners
 of
 the
 day,


rebounding
 from
 what
 they
 took
 yesterday


as
 well.


All
 right,
 let's
 do
 it.
 Year
 to
 dates.


Year
 to
 dates,
 what
 do
 we
 got?
 Year
 to


dates.
 It
 has
 been
 a
 wild
 couple
 of


weeks.
 My
 year
 to
 date
 is
 now


142.79%.


142.79.


If
 you
 remember
 two
 weeks
 ago,
 it
 was
 at


208%.


So
 that
 208
 drops
 all
 the
 way
 down
 to


142.
 Obviously,
 uh,
 you
 know,
 I'm
 taking


it
 on
 the
 chin
 as
 well,
 but
 in
 the
 same


context,
 it's
 142%.
 You
 know,
 it's
 like


it's
 just
 you
 can't
 be
 that
 upset
 about


it,
 even
 if
 it's
 an
 ugly
 decline
 from


where
 it
 was
 a
 couple
 weeks
 ago.


And
 I
 think
 that's
 the
 perspective


that
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 have
 to
 have
 right


here.
 Yeah,
 I'm
 still
 seeing
 above
 40%


for
 a
 decent
 chunk
 of
 people.
 Zokold's


at
 160.
 Moon's
 at
 130.
 I
 see
 76.


Investing
 with
 Jeremy
 177.
 Cotis
 28.


Muhammad's
 at
 30.
 Shirant's
 at
 78.


Um,
 Lee
 is
 at
 50,
 Daniel's
 at
 44,
 David


111,
 Chris
 Miller
 41,
 Bobic
 107,
 Samish


160.
 I
 mean,
 dude,
 these
 are
 still


phenomenal.
 The
 S&P
 is
 at
 10.
 So,
 I
 know


it's
 not
 as
 fun
 as
 it
 was
 a
 couple
 weeks


ago,
 but
 also,
 and
 this
 I
 was
 telling
 my


cousin
 this
 in
 the
 morning.
 It's
 like
 it


was
 really
 fun,
 but
 when
 it
 gets
 that


fun,
 sometimes
 it's
 also
 not
 that
 real.


Sometimes
 that
 is
 also
 a
 bit
 euphoric.


And
 you
 know,
 I
 think
 I've
 been
 pretty


transparent
 over
 the
 past
 couple
 weeks


saying,
 "Look,
 I
 like
 Robin
 Hood
 at
 150


for
 my
 portfolio,
 but
 I
 don't
 actually


think
 they
 put
 up
 the
 earnings
 to


justify
 getting
 there
 yet.
 But
 if
 the


street
 wants
 to
 pay
 a
 multiple,
 cool,


that's
 fine.
 But
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 buy
 it


there."
 And
 so
 it
 came
 back
 down
 to


reality.
 It
 is
 what
 it
 is.
 But
 I
 don't


think
 it's
 crazy
 to
 see
 some
 of
 these


stocks
 take
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 of
 a


breather.
 S&P
 is
 10%
 year
 to
 date,
 I


think.
 So,
 let
 me
 confirm.
 S&P
 year
 to


date
 13.6.


So,
 if
 you're
 beating
 13.6,
 six


basically
 14%.


You
 are
 doing
 okay.
 George
 is
 at
 228.


Brock's
 at
 161.
 Christine
 Miller's
 at


91.
 Dman's
 at
 71.


I
 mean,
 most
 people
 are
 still
 crushing


it,
 right?
 And
 it
 puts
 it
 into


perspective.
 If
 you
 are
 not
 someone
 who


has
 compounded
 your
 assets
 above
 14%,


like
 99.9%
 of
 the
 world
 that
 doesn't


really
 invest,


it
 it's
 one
 thing
 to
 be
 up
 200%
 or
 300%


last
 week
 or
 80%
 last
 week
 and
 now


you're
 up
 65%.
 Yes,
 that
 is
 a
 meaningful


decline,
 but
 you've
 beat
 the
 S&P
 500
 by


a
 delta
 of
 a
 lot
 if
 you're
 still
 up
 uh


even
 if
 you're
 not
 as
 up
 as
 much
 as
 much


as
 you
 were
 last
 week.
 And
 I
 think
 that


is
 the
 perspective
 that's
 very
 important


to
 have
 on
 days
 like
 this.
 And
 it's
 also


healthy
 to
 eventually
 get
 back
 to
 those


all-time
 highs
 because
 if
 you
 just
 go


straight
 up
 in
 a
 in
 a
 line
 that's


vertical,
 you
 know,
 it
 tends
 to
 be
 a


much
 more
 aggressive
 fall
 at
 the
 end.


All
 right,
 that's
 what
 we
 got.
 That's


what
 we
 got
 for
 Friday.
 Let's
 listen
 to


Mr.
 Tom
 Lee
 get
 his
 thoughts.
 Steve
 will


be
 on
 in
 about
 25
 minutes
 and
 uh
 let's


see
 what
 Tom
 Lee
 has
 to
 say
 about


everything
 that
 has
 gone
 on
 over
 the


past
 week.


>> Let's
 share
 this
 right
 here.


daily.


>> Uh
 well,
 I
 I
 heard
 the
 earlier
 segment,


Scott,
 and
 I
 I
 do
 think
 I'm
 kind
 of
 more


in
 the
 Jamie
 Diamond
 camp,
 you
 know,


that
 uh
 the
 in
 Steve
 Leeman's
 point
 that


there's
 opacity
 in
 private
 credit
 and


that's
 the
 problem
 that
 investors
 are


going
 to
 grapple
 with
 for
 some
 time.
 And


I
 think
 that
 along
 with
 the
 trade


tensions
 and
 you
 know,
 the
 VIX
 spike
 is


the
 reason
 investors
 are
 a
 little


cautious.
 But
 I
 I
 don't
 think
 that's


going
 to
 change
 that
 markets
 still
 have


a
 lot
 of
 tailwinds
 into
 year
 end.
 And


part
 of
 it
 is
 AI
 is
 like
 um
 I
 I
 think


demand
 is
 accelerating
 there
 and
 we
 know


that
 investors
 are
 sitting
 on
 a
 lot
 of


cash
 and
 institutional
 investors
 are


really
 having
 a
 terrible
 year.
 Only
 22%


are
 beating
 the
 benchmark.
 So
 I
 think


there's
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 chase
 and
 then


sentiment
 has
 flipped
 negative
 which
 is


always
 a
 contrarian
 buy
 signal.
 So,
 you


know,
 I
 think
 despite
 this
 mounting
 wall


of
 worries,
 including
 the
 shutdown,
 I


think
 it
 sets
 us
 up
 for
 a
 pretty
 good


rally
 into
 the
 end
 of
 the
 year.


>> It
 sounds
 though
 like
 this
 is
 enough
 on


your
 radar
 that
 do
 you
 think
 it's
 at


least
 changed
 the
 game
 in
 the
 near
 term


for
 the
 market


>> uh
 on
 the
 private
 credit


>> just
 overall?
 I
 mean,
 if
 if
 there
 are
 if


there
 are
 continued
 issues
 in
 in
 private


credit
 and
 the
 leverage
 loan
 market,


then
 the
 the
 stock
 market
 is
 not
 going


to
 take
 that
 well.
 I
 mean,
 you
 wouldn't


think


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 Scott,
 that
 might
 the
 only


thing
 that
 I
 don't
 know
 um
 is
 how
 many


chapters
 it's
 going
 to
 take
 to
 play
 out


because,
 you
 know,
 I
 mean,
 there's
 that,


you
 know,
 there's
 opacity,
 which
 is
 what


is
 scaring
 people,
 but
 then
 there's
 real


credit
 deterioration,
 which
 I
 don't


think
 that
 that's
 what's
 happening.
 And


I
 think
 that's
 why
 uh
 Adam
 and
 all
 those


had
 called
 it
 idiosyncratic.
 I'm
 kind
 of


in
 that
 camp
 because
 high
 yield
 spreads


have
 behaved.
 So
 I
 think
 it's
 more
 of
 a


is
 the
 flow
 of
 capital
 because
 I
 think


one
 of
 the
 biggest
 sort
 of
 allocations


for
 alternatives
 has
 been
 private


credit.
 It's
 going
 to
 make
 investors


pause
 that
 you
 know
 maybe
 this
 market
 is


it's
 not
 as
 easy
 a
 return
 as
 it
 looks.


You
 told
 me,
 I
 think
 a
 couple
 of
 weeks


ago,
 that
 7,000
 on
 the
 S&P
 by
 the
 end
 of


the
 year
 was
 was
 realistic.
 You
 still


think
 that
 we
 could
 get
 another
 5%.


That's
 what
 it
 looks
 like.
 It's
 5%


between
 now
 and
 then.
 Do
 we
 have
 that
 in


us,


>> Scott?
 I
 mean,
 5%
 is
 just
 an
 average


fourth
 quarter
 from
 1950
 to
 2024.
 Um,


but
 we
 have
 the
 Fed
 easing
 after
 an


extended
 pause.
 So
 that's
 1998
 and
 2024.


So
 I
 I
 think
 that
 5%
 might
 be
 the
 base


case.
 I
 I I
 bet
 you
 it's
 going to
 end
 up


being
 more
 like
 7
 or
 8%
 or
 even
 possibly


10%.
 So
 I
 think
 7,000


>> aka


Tom
 Lee
 still
 thinks
 we're
 above
 7,000


by
 I
 mean
 meaningfully
 above
 if
 we
 get
 a


10%
 return
 from
 here
 by
 the
 end
 of
 the


year.


>> Is
 the
 low
 of
 what
 we
 can
 end
 the
 year


at.


>> Wow.
 Uh
 and
 how
 much
 do
 earnings
 have
 to


do
 with
 that?


Uh
 I
 mean
 earnings
 are
 going
 to
 matter


but
 you
 know
 this
 it's
 been
 a
 good


start.
 I
 mean
 we're
 barely
 into
 earnings


season.
 The
 banks
 have
 been
 good.
 82%
 of


companies
 are
 beating.
 There's
 a
 lot


more
 visibility
 of
 demand
 and
 then
 less


concerns
 about
 tariffs
 because
 we're


kind
 of
 working
 our
 way
 through
 it.
 So


companies
 have
 a
 better
 sort
 of


visibility
 over
 the
 next
 12
 months.
 I


think
 the
 outlooks
 are
 going
 to
 be
 good


and
 and
 I
 think
 that's
 going
 to
 help


stocks
 and
 you
 know
 I
 I
 think
 there's
 a


lot
 of
 room
 for
 multiples
 to
 still


expand.
 So,
 I
 I
 don't
 think
 this


market's
 that
 demanding.


>> I
 think
 it's
 interesting
 that
 that
 you


suggest
 that
 that
 you'd
 be
 a
 buyer
 of


regional
 banks
 and
 small
 caps.


>> Why
 are
 you
 willing
 to
 to
 to
 do
 that?


That's
 not
 putting
 your
 toe
 in
 the


water.
 That's
 like
 putting
 the
 bathing


suit
 on
 and
 jumping
 in.
 Why?


Well,
 I
 mean,
 Scott,
 you
 know,
 I
 know


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 uh
 muscle
 memory
 for


people
 from
 2023


and
 u
 and
 that
 was
 because
 of
 of
 a
 big


change
 in
 rates
 that
 really
 caught
 a
 lot


of
 banks
 offsite
 just
 in
 their
 business


model.


The
 that
 that
 doesn't
 mean
 that
 this


crisis,
 which
 is
 really
 is
 underwriting


being
 done
 properly,
 um
 should
 have
 the


same
 issue.
 So
 I
 I
 think
 that
 there
 has


been
 a
 throw
 the
 baby
 with
 the
 bathwater


out
 on
 the
 regional
 banks
 and
 the
 small


cap.
 So
 yes,
 I
 I
 think
 despite
 the
 fact


that
 the
 Russell
 had
 a
 rough
 week,
 I


think
 they're
 really
 going
 to
 be
 one
 of


the
 beneficiaries.
 I
 mean,
 even
 on


earnings
 basis,
 small
 cap
 earnings
 are


going
 to
 grow
 48%.
 In
 the
 third
 quarter,


that's
 like
 four
 times
 five
 times
 bigger


than
 the
 S&P.
 So
 I
 think
 there's
 still
 a


lot
 of
 growth
 left
 there.
 So
 Tom
 still


banging
 the
 table
 on
 IWM
 and
 KRE.
 IWM


being
 small
 caps,
 KRE
 being
 regional


banks.
 Now
 KRE
 is
 actually
 a
 big
 part
 of


IWM,
 which
 is
 why
 IWM
 has
 taken
 a
 hit


over
 the
 past
 couple
 days
 because
 KRE


got
 hit.
 But
 uh
 Tom's
 saying
 there's
 not


a
 credit
 problem
 or
 he's
 he's
 not


necessarily
 saying
 that.
 He's
 saying


there
 might
 not
 be
 as
 structural
 of
 a


credit
 problem
 as
 people
 think.
 And


based
 on
 the
 companies
 that
 reported


today
 in
 the
 regional
 banking
 sector,
 to


him
 it's
 a
 buy
 the
 dip
 and
 it
 might
 be


isolated
 to
 a
 couple
 different
 banks.


And
 if
 that
 is
 the
 case,
 then
 maybe


regionals
 do
 present
 a
 more
 asymmetric


upside
 opportunity
 along
 with
 small
 caps


given
 the
 earnings
 growth
 they
 could


deliver
 against
 the
 S&P.


>> What's
 the
 message
 in
 in
 crypto
 right


now,
 Tom?
 Bitcoin
 is
 down
 today.
 Uh
 it's


107,000


right
 now.
 What
 what's
 what's
 going
 on


there?


>> I
 I
 think
 there's
 a
 couple
 of
 things.


One
 is
 there
 was
 a
 big
 deleveraging
 last


week
 because
 that
 VIX
 spike
 and
 the


tariff
 headlines
 triggered
 the
 biggest


liquidation
 and
 deleveraging
 in
 crypto


ever
 in
 history.
 So
 I
 think
 that
 people


are
 still
 licking
 their
 wounds.
 And
 I


think
 that
 there's
 also
 a
 bit
 of
 gold


envy
 because
 as
 you
 know
 gold
 has
 been
 a


huge
 performer
 this
 year.
 Um
 in
 fact
 you


know
 there's
 people
 waiting
 in
 line
 to


buy
 gold.
 So
 I
 I
 think
 that
 there
 is
 a


bit
 of
 like
 I'd
 rather
 own
 gold
 than


crypto.
 So
 I
 I
 think
 this
 is
 not
 the
 the


top
 of
 the
 crypto
 cycle,
 but
 I
 think


leveraging
 I
 mean
 leverage
 longs
 in


crypto
 are
 near
 record
 lows.
 So
 I
 think


it's
 kind
 of
 like
 more
 the
 we're
 at
 the


basement
 and
 working
 our
 way
 back
 up.


>> Okay.
 Uh
 we'll
 see
 if
 we
 get
 there
 and


if
 we're
 walking
 or
 taking
 an
 elevator.


Tom,
 thanks.
 Enjoy
 the
 weekend,
 Tom
 Lee.


>> Thank
 you.


>> All
 right.
 So
 I
 mean
 look,
 same
 argument


that
 Tom
 has
 been
 making
 for
 the
 past


couple
 months
 now.
 Look,
 I
 I
 I
 don't


think
 he's
 saying
 anything
 egregious
 by


any
 sense
 of
 the
 imagination.
 And
 we


talked
 about
 this
 when
 he
 tweeted
 it
 in


the
 morning.
 Like,
 if
 we're
 trying
 to


think
 from
 first
 principles,
 like


realistically
 from
 first
 principles,


what
 is
 the
 major
 reason
 the
 stock


market
 took
 a
 dip
 this
 week?


Again,
 I
 I
 chalk
 it
 up
 to
 what
 Tom
 Lee


says,
 which
 is
 markets
 are
 a
 bit


exhausted
 and
 they
 wanted
 to
 take
 a


breather.
 The
 China
 stuff,
 maybe
 that's


an
 issue
 on
 a
 perception
 basis,
 not


really
 an
 issue
 because
 China
 says
 they


don't
 want
 to
 decouple
 from
 the
 US.
 US


doesn't
 want
 to
 decouple
 with
 China


deleveraging
 what
 he
 talked
 about
 last


week
 in
 crypto.
 That's
 actually
 the


reason
 why
 Bitcoin
 and
 Ethereum
 are


probably
 down.
 I
 I I
 don't
 think
 it's


people
 stopped
 believing
 in
 Bitcoin
 and


Ethereum.
 It's
 just
 that
 20
 billion


dollars
 got
 liquidated
 in
 the
 span
 of


less
 than
 24
 hours.
 And
 you
 know,
 you


probably
 got
 some
 people
 that
 are
 a


little
 bit
 scared
 to
 get
 back
 in
 it


right
 now.
 And
 that
 will
 likely
 change


over
 time,
 but
 that
 could
 be
 what's


depressing
 crypto
 markets.
 The
 cockroach


fears
 from
 private
 credit
 that
 JB


Diamond
 has
 been
 talking
 about
 might
 not


be
 as
 structur
 structural
 as
 people


think.
 And
 then
 I've
 shared
 multiple


charts
 over
 the
 past
 couple
 weeks
 around


October
 being
 one
 of
 the
 most
 volatile


months
 of
 the
 year,
 especially
 after


September
 and
 August
 have
 been
 so
 good


to
 us
 that
 you're
 going
 to
 get
 a
 bit
 of


weakness.
 And
 when
 you
 have
 an
 oak
 low


running
 up
 5%
 every
 day
 for
 no
 reason,


like
 yeah,
 probably
 is
 going
 to
 get
 a


little
 bit
 of
 a
 pullback.
 And
 I
 don't


think
 that's
 the
 worst
 thing
 in
 the


world.
 It's
 a
 volatility
 shakeout.
 A
 bit


of
 a
 volatility
 shakeout.
 These
 are
 the


updates
 for
 the
 stock
 draft.
 Matt
 money


still
 44.72%.


He
 is
 green
 whooping
 everybody's
 ass.


I'm
 at
 36%.
 Stephen
 is
 at
 6.2.
 Tanner
 is


at
 19.74
 and
 Christopher
 Patel
 is
 at


11.3.


Uh
 Matt
 right
 there
 44.2%.


We
 got
 Tanner
 in
 the
 chat.
 It
 is


Tanner's
 birthday
 today.
 We
 called
 him


on
 the
 market
 open.
 So
 everyone
 can
 wish


Tanner
 a
 very
 very
 happy
 birthday.
 He


says
 it's
 crazy
 to
 see
 see
 such
 a


community.
 It's
 hard
 to
 explain
 how


appreciative
 I
 am.
 Thanks
 for
 the
 Bday


wishes.
 Tanner
 is
 10
 days
 older
 than
 me.


So
 he
 uh
 he
 is
 officially
 28
 and
 I
 will


be
 joining
 him
 pretty
 soon.
 And
 uh
 it's


cool.
 It's
 really
 cool
 to
 be
 celebrating


not
 only
 this
 entire
 journey
 with
 him,


but
 also
 just,
 you
 know,
 it's
 fun
 to


have
 a
 friend
 in
 the
 industry
 and
 to
 to


be
 doing
 this
 thing
 together.
 Speaking


of
 friends
 in
 the
 industry
 and
 uh
 a


friend
 that
 as
 you
 guys
 can
 see
 right


there
 on
 the
 screen
 is
 objectively


kicking
 Tanner
 and
 I's
 ass
 with
 a
 44.72%


return.
 It's
 not
 his
 birthday,
 but
 he
 is


always
 making
 money.
 Ladies
 and


gentlemen,
 a
 surprise
 appearance
 on
 a


Friday
 market
 close


for
 Mr.
 Matt
 Money.
 Matt,
 what's
 up?


>> Ladies,
 gentlemen,
 Mr.
 Mitt,
 thank
 you


so
 much.
 Happy
 to
 be
 here.
 Happy


birthday,
 Tanner.
 Happy
 birthday.


>> Yeah.
 Happy
 happy
 birthday
 to
 When's


your
 birthday?


>> May
 17th.


>> I
 remember.


>> I'll
 be
 Yeah,
 I'll
 be


>> You
 were
 on
 Rocket
 Lab
 Weekly
 on
 your


birthday.


>> That's
 what
 it
 was.
 Yeah,
 they
 were


launching
 a
 rocket
 for
 my
 birthday.


That's
 right.


>> That's
 correct.
 I
 remember
 that.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah,
 that's
 fun.
 Very
 good.
 Yeah,


man.
 It's
 It's
 crazy.
 Uh
 I'm
 I'm
 kind
 of


with
 Tom,
 man.
 I
 I
 can
 kind
 of


understand
 where
 people
 are
 coming
 from.


It's
 so
 interesting
 though
 because
 you


feel
 like
 you're
 on
 the
 I
 don't know.


I've
 been
 cautious
 about
 we're
 going
 to


hit
 some
 sort
 of
 peak
 in
 crypto.
 I
 don't


think
 we're
 there.
 So,
 I'm
 with
 Tom
 in


that
 respect,
 but
 at
 the
 same
 time,


you're
 seeing
 this
 low
 sentiment
 in
 the


cryptocurrency
 market,
 but
 at
 the
 same


time,
 you're
 still
 seeing
 so
 many
 people


wanting
 to
 pile
 into
 things
 like
 BMR
 and


and
 things
 alike.
 And
 and
 I
 think
 that


those
 would
 be
 great
 opportunities
 long


term.
 I
 I
 personally
 am
 am
 staying
 out


because
 I
 do
 think
 we're
 entering
 kind


of
 the
 the
 back
 end
 of
 of
 sort
 of
 a
 a


crypto


um
 crypto
 cycle,
 bullish
 cycle,
 I
 mean.


Um
 but
 I
 don't
 know.
 I'm
 kind
 of
 curious


to
 see
 what
 what
 ends
 up
 happening
 for


for
 folks
 and
 in
 the
 cryptocurrency


market
 um
 going
 into
 the
 going
 into


2026.


>> Okay.
 So
 what
 are
 your
 overall
 thoughts


on
 the
 choppiness
 that
 we've
 seen
 over


the
 past
 week?
 So
 last
 Friday
 we
 took
 a


3%
 draw
 down.
 We
 recovered
 pretty
 much


all
 of
 it
 by
 Monday.
 I
 mean
 we're
 less


than
 0.5%
 away
 and
 now
 we
 gave
 it
 all


back.
 I
 mean
 how
 is
 the
 crypto
 markets


what
 is
 your
 rationalization
 for
 why
 we


lost
 that
 momentum
 and
 do
 you
 think
 the


loss
 of
 that
 momentum
 stops
 a
 Q4
 rally


towards?


I
 think
 that
 there's
 still
 going
 to
 be
 a


lot
 of
 momentum
 going
 into
 the
 fourth


quarter,
 but
 I
 think
 where
 the
 easy


money
 has
 been
 made
 in
 some
 of
 these


nonrevenue
 producing
 companies,
 I
 think


people
 need
 to
 be
 cautious.
 Uh,
 and
 and


that's
 been
 something
 I've
 been
 talking


about
 in
 Cash
 Flow
 Chronicles
 for
 a


couple
 weeks
 now.
 You
 know,
 I'm
 I'm
 I'm


happy
 that
 people
 making
 money
 and
 I
 I


understand
 where
 people
 are
 at.
 I
 think


we're
 in
 a
 very
 similar
 place.
 Not


exactly
 analogous
 to
 2021,
 but
 very


comparable
 in
 the
 respect
 that
 there's
 a


lot
 of
 cool
 companies
 that
 are
 coming


out,
 right?
 I
 mean,
 I
 think
 back
 in


2021,
 it
 was
 kind
 of the
 thought
 process


about
 AI
 and
 and
 what's
 going
 to
 be
 kind


of
 coming
 through.
 And
 that's
 when
 you


had
 people
 starting
 to
 think
 about,


okay,
 well,
 what's
 what's
 the
 Palunteers


of
 the
 world
 going
 to
 look
 like,
 etc.


You
 saw
 that
 large
 jump
 up
 in
 late
 21


and
 then
 throughout
 2022,
 we
 had
 this


extensive
 draw
 down
 for
 some
 of these


companies
 that
 weren't
 really
 producing


yet.
 Um,
 I
 feel
 like
 you're
 going
 to
 see


a
 lot
 of
 that
 in
 Nuclear,
 Quantum,
 and
 a


few
 others.
 It's
 not
 to
 say
 that
 they're


bad
 companies.
 Some
 of
 these
 companies


will
 eventually
 be
 like
 a
 palunteer.


They'll
 be
 a
 phoenix
 that
 rises
 through


um
 on
 the
 other
 side
 and
 and
 eventually


does
 come
 out
 with
 uh
 with
 great
 market


cap
 realization
 and
 and
 ends
 up
 growing


beyond
 what
 where
 their
 valuations
 are


even
 today.
 But
 I
 think
 that
 there's


unfortunately
 a
 lot
 of
 companies
 out


there
 that
 are
 just
 riding
 onto
 the


momentum
 that
 just
 don't
 warrant
 it.
 Um,


but
 overall
 I
 still
 think
 that
 there's
 a


lot
 of


>> Does
 that
 scare
 you?
 Does
 that
 scare
 you


at
 all
 for
 this
 market?


>> It
 scares
 me
 for
 the
 people
 that
 aren't


ready
 for
 it.
 So,
 I'm
 I'm
 okay.
 I've
 I


you
 know,
 I
 don't
 think
 that
 for
 me
 I


think
 that
 my
 portfolio
 is
 set
 up
 like


if
 a
 Rocket
 Lab
 goes
 in
 halves
 by,
 you


know,
 50%,
 it
 goes
 down
 60%,
 that's


okay.
 Um,
 because
 I
 feel
 like
 I'm
 in
 one


of
 the
 better
 names
 in
 space,
 right?
 But


if
 you're
 in
 say
 some
 sort
 of
 auxiliary


company
 that
 may
 or
 may
 not
 actually


show
 up
 and
 be
 able
 to
 deliver,
 I
 think,


you
 know,
 you
 need
 to
 kind
 of
 consider


that.
 So,
 you
 know,
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of


people
 have
 been
 able
 to
 buy
 into
 things


that
 are
 around
 Rocket
 Lab.
 Um,
 and


you
 know,
 Rocket
 Lab's
 actually
 been


able
 to
 deliver.
 They've
 delivered
 73


rockets
 to
 space
 uh
 in
 some
 way,
 shape,


or
 form.
 they're
 about
 to
 launch
 a


different
 rocket,
 you
 know,
 but
 not


specifically
 going
 into
 that
 detail,
 but


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 companies
 that
 have
 now


been
 able
 to
 ride
 on
 the
 coattails
 of


that
 and
 be
 able
 to
 get,
 you
 know,
 5,


10,
 15
 billion
 dollar
 market
 caps.
 Uh,


and
 I'm
 not
 calling
 out
 AS
 specifically.


I
 still
 think
 that
 there's
 a
 lot
 of


potential
 associated
 with
 that.
 Um
 but
 I


still
 think
 even
 still
 maybe
 that
 one's


even
 run
 um
 you
 know
 it's
 a
 even
 now
 a


larger
 market
 capitalization
 than
 Rocket


Lab
 and
 they
 have
 yet
 to
 really
 even
 get


uh
 their
 their
 latest
 satellites
 into


space.
 So
 it's
 just
 uh
 it's
 analogous
 to


2021.
 I
 think
 you're
 seeing
 a
 lot
 of


these
 companies
 run
 a
 good
 bit.
 But
 it's


not
 to
 say
 that
 you're
 not
 delivering
 in


other
 spaces.
 Nvidia
 is
 still


delivering.
 You
 still
 have
 a
 lot
 of


capital
 expenditure
 with
 all
 these
 um


big
 seven
 companies.


And
 so
 I
 don't
 think
 by
 any
 means
 we're


at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 tail
 the
 the
 the


business
 cycle
 associated
 with
 it,
 but
 I


think
 the
 easy
 money's
 been
 made
 and
 I


feel
 like
 you're
 running
 a
 little
 bit
 on


fumes


>> if
 that
 makes
 sense.
 Right.
 So,
 um,


that's
 just
 my
 thought
 process.
 And,
 you


know,
 I
 I
 think
 I'm
 okay
 because
 I'm
 not


really,
 other
 than
 Rocket
 Lab
 and
 maybe


you
 could
 consider
 potentially


Palanteer,
 I'm
 not
 really
 overexposed
 to


some
 of
 these


more
 speculative
 names.
 Um,
 so


>> I
 would
 agree.
 I
 mean,
 I
 think
 what


you're
 saying
 makes
 a
 lot
 of
 sense
 right


there.
 For
 those
 that
 don't
 know,
 first


of
 all,
 there's
 Matt's
 Twitter.
 So,


everyone,
 please
 make
 sure
 to
 give
 Matt


a
 follow
 on
 Twitter.
 For
 those
 that


don't
 know
 Matt's
 portfolio,
 he's
 been


pretty
 transparent
 about
 it.
 I
 think


your
 largest
 holding
 is
 still,
 correct


me
 if
 I'm
 wrong,
 the
 S&P
 500.


>> Um,
 no.
 Well,
 I
 mean,
 it
 was
 at
 one


point.
 Um,
 and
 I
 think
 we've
 had
 such


success
 in
 Rocket
 Lab
 and
 Palanteer
 that


>> really
 they
 they
 outgrew
 the
 Okay.
 So,


what
 S&P
 is
 top
 five
 then?
 Top.


>> Oh,
 yeah.
 Uh,
 yeah,
 probably
 for
 sure.


And
 I
 think
 it's
 definitely
 top
 three.


Yeah.


>> Wow.
 Rock
 lab
 pounder
 S&P.
 So
 the
 the


point
 I'm
 trying
 to
 make
 here
 is
 that


like
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day,
 you're
 not


in
 Oaklow
 as
 a
 top
 three
 position.


You're
 in
 the
 S&P
 500.


>> So
 the
 S&P
 500
 could
 fall
 10%
 and
 be


flat
 year
 to
 date
 and
 yeah,
 it
 would


hurt,
 but
 it
 would
 not
 be
 one
 of
 those


sizable
 draw
 downs
 that
 could
 wreck
 an


entire
 portfolio.
 And
 I
 think
 that's


also
 important
 to
 understand.
 Momentum


is
 a
 strong
 force
 and
 when
 it
 takes


these
 stocks
 up,
 it
 can
 really
 feel


like,
 you
 know,
 people
 can
 get
 rich


overnight,
 but
 a
 lot
 of
 times
 that
 stuff


fades,
 especially
 if
 there's
 nothing


fundamental.
 And
 I
 think
 your
 point


right
 here
 is
 that
 maybe
 it's
 starting


to
 fade
 and
 it
 could
 come
 back,
 but
 if


it
 fades
 away
 and
 like
 like
 Open
 Door,


right,
 if
 people
 just
 aren't
 that


excited
 about
 it
 anymore,
 then
 maybe


there's
 nothing
 there.
 And
 ultimately,


we're
 going to
 have
 to
 see
 how
 that
 ends


up
 playing
 out
 towards
 the
 end
 of
 the


year.
 Um,
 what
 do
 you
 think
 right
 now


about
 Well,
 actually,
 let
 me
 let
 me
 show


this
 headline
 right
 here.
 Uh,
 this
 came


out
 20
 minutes
 ago,
 guys.
 Nvidia
 and
 TSM


just
 unveiled
 the
 first
 US-made


Blackwell
 chip
 at
 TSMC's
 Arizona's


plant.
 That's
 actually
 very
 exciting
 to


see.
 That's
 from
 Axiovidia's
 Jensen


Huang
 called
 it
 the
 start
 of
 building


the
 world's
 AI
 factories
 right
 here
 in


America.
 That's
 an
 official
 quote
 by


Jensen.
 So
 very
 nice
 to
 see
 some


American
 manufacturing
 for
 the


semiconductor
 ecosystem
 happening
 in


America.
 Matt,
 what
 are
 your
 thoughts


about
 this
 AI
 capex
 thesis
 open
 AI
 with


AMD
 and
 Broadcom
 and
 Nvidia
 TSM


earnings?
 I
 mean
 do
 you
 think
 this
 is
 a


little
 too
 aggressive
 or
 do
 you
 think


capex
 is
 not
 slowing
 down?


>> Uh
 this
 is
 where
 it
 gets
 a
 little
 bit


boggy.
 uh
 because
 if
 you
 look
 at
 the


share
 buybacks
 and
 you
 look
 at
 the
 total


cash
 flow
 from
 operations
 from
 a
 lot
 of


these
 companies,
 they're
 starting
 to
 run


out
 of
 headroom.
 So
 if
 you
 saw
 where
 a


lot
 of these
 companies
 were
 able
 to
 add


so
 much
 cash
 to
 the
 balance
 sheet
 over


the
 past
 5
 to
 10
 years
 because
 they're


just
 such
 great
 margin
 businesses


they
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 companies
 like
 the


Googles
 of
 the
 world
 have
 been
 doing
 60


billion7
 billion
 share
 buybacks
 and


they're
 making
 a hundred
 and
 some


billion
 dollars
 a
 year
 in
 in
 cash
 flow


from
 operations.
 So
 they've
 continued
 to


be
 able
 to
 grow
 their
 capex
 capex
 capex


and
 and
 and
 potentially
 even
 start


dividends
 in
 the
 case
 of
 say
 Google.
 And


now
 they're
 starting
 to
 say,
 okay,
 well,


you're
 kind
 of
 hitting
 a
 peak
 now.
 You


can't
 expand
 your
 share
 buybacks


forever.
 You
 can't
 expand
 your
 capex


forever.
 You
 can't
 expand
 your
 dividends


forever.
 And
 now
 you
 can't
 go
 back
 on


your
 word
 either,
 right?
 I
 mean,
 imagine


Google
 coming
 out
 next
 year
 and
 being


like,
 actually,
 we're
 only
 going
 to
 do


50
 billion
 in
 buybacks
 this
 year.
 People


are
 going
 to
 be
 like,
 what
 the
 hell's


going
 on?
 Right?
 So
 there
 I
 feel
 like
 a


lot
 of
 companies
 unfortunately
 are
 are


kind
 of
 putting
 themselves
 in
 a
 corner.


Uh
 I
 don't
 like
 I
 said
 I
 don't
 think


that
 you're
 going
 to
 see
 this
 massive


capital
 expenditure
 cut
 but
 you
 might


see
 a
 slowdown
 particularly
 on
 how
 much


growth
 is
 happening
 in
 that
 area.
 So,


it's
 not
 to
 say
 that
 the
 Nvidia
 of
 the


world
 are
 going
 to
 massively
 just
 like


hit
 a
 50%
 sort
 of
 revenue
 decrease
 or


anything
 like
 that,
 but
 you're
 not
 going


to
 see
 I
 don't
 think
 just
 one
 partly


because
 of
 the
 rule
 of
 large
 numbers
 and


then
 two
 because
 I
 think
 people
 are


running
 out
 of
 the
 additional
 budget


within
 their
 cash
 flow
 from
 operations


to
 continuously
 expand
 at
 the
 growth


rates
 that
 we've
 had
 over
 the
 past
 say


two
 to
 three
 years.
 Um,
 so
 I'm
 kind
 of


curious
 to
 see
 uh
 what
 what
 ends
 up


happening.
 I
 don't
 think
 it's
 going
 to


show
 up
 in
 droves
 in
 the
 fourth
 quarter


or
 even
 the
 third
 quarter,
 but
 I
 think


that
 becoming
 into
 coming
 into
 next


year,
 I
 think
 you're
 definitely
 going
 to


start
 to
 see
 a
 slight
 pullback


potentially
 in
 some
 of
 these
 companies


and
 right
 sizing
 of
 instead
 of
 just


continuing
 to
 grow
 their
 capex,
 really


just
 level
 it
 off.


>> Yeah,
 I
 think
 that's
 fair.
 And
 look,


that
 capex
 leveling
 off
 is
 obviously


going
 to
 be
 good
 for
 shareholders
 as
 it


will
 help
 margins.
 Now,
 if
 the
 capex


doesn't
 level
 off,
 it's
 really
 good
 for


Nvidia,
 but
 it
 also
 should
 hopefully
 be


really
 good
 for
 Google
 and
 all
 these


other
 companies
 because
 they're
 actually


getting
 an
 ROI.
 Uh,
 speaking
 of
 the
 Mac


7,
 Matt,
 talk
 to
 me
 about
 this
 name


because
 I
 recently
 got
 into
 it.
 You've


been
 buying
 Amazon
 for
 god
 knows
 how


many
 years,
 and
 I'm
 pretty
 sure
 you
 have


a


>> pretty
 heavy
 position
 in
 this
 name.
 What


are
 your
 current
 thoughts
 on
 the


trajectory
 of
 Amazon,
 the
 stock?
 Yeah,
 I


mean
 Steve
 and
 I
 have
 chatted
 about
 this


on
 and
 off.
 I
 think
 we
 both
 are
 in


agreement.
 Uh
 I
 think
 you
 me
 mentioned


it
 on
 a
 previous
 market
 close
 recently.


Amazon
 will
 be
 a
 trillion
 dollar
 revenue


company
 within
 the
 next
 five
 years.
 And


so
 it's
 like
 okay,
 it's
 kind
 of
 like


just
 why
 buy
 something
 that's
 inev
 why


not
 buy
 something
 that's
 inevitable,


right?
 If
 you
 want
 to
 make
 sure
 that


you're
 going
 to
 be
 making
 money
 in
 the


market
 and
 you
 have
 a
 a
 kind
 of


opportunity
 like
 this
 and
 you
 can
 kind


of
 put
 somewhere
 money
 somewhere
 safe,


why
 not
 put
 it
 in
 something
 like
 an


Amazon
 where
 you
 know
 uh
 that
 it's
 going


to
 be
 safe.
 It's
 less
 than
 a
 $2
 half


trillion
 dollar
 market
 cap.
 It
 makes


almost
 about
 as
 much
 in
 terms
 of
 actual


cash
 flow
 as
 Google.
 And
 so
 Google's


actually
 priced
 I
 think
 20%
 higher
 in


terms
 of
 a
 market
 capitalization
 of


Amazon.
 But
 the
 reason
 why
 I
 think


Amazon
 takes
 a
 hit
 is
 because
 there's
 so


much
 infrastructure
 there's
 so
 much


warehousing
 etc
 that
 there's


unfortunately
 when
 you
 look
 at
 the
 EPS


on
 a
 gap
 basis
 you
 have
 a
 lot
 of


depreciation
 that
 gets
 fed
 into
 that
 you


have
 to
 depreciate
 your
 warehouses
 you


have
 to
 appreciate
 all
 the
 vehicles
 you


have
 to
 depreciate
 and
 so
 when
 it
 looks


when
 you
 look
 at
 it
 on
 an
 EPS
 basis


you're
 actually
 having
 a
 pretty
 big
 hit


in
 terms
 of
 the
 actual
 net
 income
 and
 so


if
 you
 look
 at
 it
 on
 a
 cash
 flow
 basis


it
 really
 should
 be
 valued
 closer
 up
 to


to
 what
 uh
 Google's
 valued
 at.
 And
 not


only
 that,
 but
 if
 you
 think
 about
 it,
 if


this
 company
 really
 is
 going
 to
 be
 a


trillion
 dollar
 revenue
 business,


there's
 really
 no
 reason
 why
 eventually


in
 the
 next
 probably
 10
 years
 or
 so,
 it


shouldn't
 be
 a
 10
 trillion
 dollar


company.
 just
 with
 respect
 to
 the


margins
 that
 they're
 getting
 in
 their


AWS
 business,
 the
 continued
 growth


they're
 getting
 in
 their
 AWS
 business,


they're
 actually
 now
 that
 they're
 really


the
 the
 main
 infrastructure
 of
 really


how
 people
 shop
 in
 the
 United
 States
 and


also
 abroad
 in
 Europe
 and
 and
 other


places.
 It's
 actually
 starting
 to


generate
 money
 if
 they're
 able
 to
 really


hone
 in
 and
 get
 those
 margins
 up.
 You


think
 about
 one
 or
 two
 percent
 um
 on
 a


trillion
 dollars
 of
 just
 margin


improvement
 is
 10
 to
 20
 billion
 dollars


in
 net
 income
 to
 the
 bottom
 line.
 You


throw
 you
 throw
 a
 multiple
 on
 that
 right


of
 you
 know
 let's
 just
 say
 10
 or
 20
 uh


times
 you're
 talking
 about
 200
 to400


billion
 and
 that's
 just
 a
 one
 or
 two


percentage
 increase
 on
 margins
 and


that's
 not
 even
 including
 potential


growth
 on
 the
 top
 line.
 So
 you
 start
 to


think
 about
 some
 of
 these
 things
 um
 and


it's
 easy
 to
 see
 for
 me
 that
 Amazon
 will


eventually
 be
 a
 $10
 trillion
 company.
 So


anybody
 that's
 sitting
 out
 here
 can
 say


okay
 if
 it's
 eventually
 going
 to
 be
 a
 10


trillion
 dollar
 or$10
 trillion
 company


it's
 at
 about
 roughly
 two
 2.2
 trillion


today.
 If
 I
 just
 bought
 a
 thousand


shares
 and
 eventually
 it's
 going
 to
 go


to
 $1,000
 a
 share,
 which
 approximately


equates
 to
 a10
 trillion
 dollar
 market


cap
 valuation,
 I'll
 be
 a
 millionaire.


So,
 if
 you
 think
 about
 it
 in
 that


respect,
 it's
 like
 if
 you're
 able
 to
 buy


a thousand
 shares
 today,
 which
 is
 200


some
 thousand
 dollars
 or
 so,
 eventually


that
 will
 be
 a
 million
 dollars.
 And


that's
 kind
 of
 my
 goal
 right
 now


specifically
 for
 Amazon.
 Uh
 I'm
 not


there
 quite
 yet
 at
 a
 thousand
 shares,


but
 I'm
 getting
 closer
 every
 day.
 But
 um


but
 yeah,
 I
 mean
 I
 I
 think
 it's
 one
 of


those
 things
 there's
 like
 why
 not
 just


buy
 something
 that's
 inevitable.
 I


understand
 where
 some
 people
 are
 at
 with


trying
 to
 find
 some
 of
 these
 things
 out


there
 like
 Oaklow
 and
 and
 some
 of
 these


other
 speculative
 bets.
 Hell,
 I
 kind
 of


took
 one
 on
 Rocket
 Lab
 myself,
 but
 um


>> Rocket
 Lab
 has
 revenue,
 which
 is
 the


only


>> true
 and
 and
 at
 the
 time
 that
 I
 at
 the


time
 it
 was
 a
 $2
 billion
 market
 cap,
 but


it
 already
 launched
 almost
 20
 20


electron
 vehicles.
 So,
 I
 mean,
 it
 was
 a


little
 bit
 less
 speculative
 than
 I
 think


some
 of these
 other
 companies,
 but
 the


the
 thing
 I'm
 trying
 to
 say
 is
 like


sometimes
 it's
 not
 bad
 to
 invest
 in


something
 that
 is
 very
 low
 risk
 and
 is


just
 executing
 like
 a
 Google
 or
 Amazon.


>> Um,
 maybe
 it's
 not
 as
 fancy,
 you
 know,


maybe
 you
 don't
 want
 to
 tell
 people


you're
 investing
 in
 Amazon.
 You'd
 rather


tell
 them
 they're
 at
 the
 water
 cooler


that
 you're
 investing
 in
 something,
 you


know,
 small
 modular
 reactors
 or


something
 like
 that
 for
 nuclear


>> quantum
 internet
 stack.


>> Quantum
 in
 some
 internet
 stacks.
 But
 at


the
 same
 time,
 it's
 like
 if
 you
 just


push
 come
 to
 shove,
 buy
 something
 on


Amazon,
 Amazon's
 inevitable
 in
 my


opinion.
 So,
 why
 not?
 Matt,
 let
 me
 show


you
 this
 before
 we
 get
 another
 guest


onto
 the
 show.
 Uh,
 this
 is
 a
 screenshot


I
 just
 got
 sent
 by
 Zubar
 on
 X
 and


everyone
 can
 see
 this
 right
 here.


If
 the
 Zoom
 would
 work,
 those
 are
 5,000


shares
 of
 Rocket
 Lab
 at
 16
 bucks


average.


>> He's
 up
 250
 grand


and
 his
 message
 is
 tell
 Matt
 this


happened
 because
 of
 him.


>> It's
 awesome.
 The
 best
 gift
 that
 that


gentleman
 can
 give
 me
 is
 if
 he's
 on
 a


beach
 somewhere,
 send
 me
 a
 picture
 of


him
 on
 the
 beach
 and
 and
 send
 it
 to
 my


DMs.
 That's
 I
 love
 it
 when
 people


message
 me
 and
 they're
 on
 vacation
 and


they're
 like,
 "Thank
 you."
 And
 I'm
 like,


"That's
 what
 it's
 all
 about,
 right?
 It's


about
 getting
 yourself
 away
 and
 and


giving
 yourself
 that
 mental
 freedom
 to
 I


don't
 want
 to
 say
 say
 f
 you
 to
 your


boss,
 but
 at
 the
 same
 time
 it's
 like,


you
 know,
 get
 yourself
 into
 a
 place


where
 you're
 meeting
 your
 objectives
 for


what
 your
 portfolio
 is
 really
 set
 up


for.
 And
 um
 luckily
 Rocket
 Lab
 has
 been


that.
 And
 don't
 thank
 me.
 Uh
 I'm
 I'm
 far


from
 the
 person
 you
 need
 to
 thank.
 I'm


just
 a
 shepherd
 uh
 and
 letting
 people


know
 about
 the
 company.
 The
 real
 people


that
 need
 to
 be
 thanked
 are
 the
 people


at
 Rocket
 Lab,
 the
 people
 that
 are


putting
 the
 rockets
 in
 the
 air.
 I'm
 just


a
 guy
 sitting
 in
 a
 an
 airond
 conditioned


room
 here
 in
 Houston,
 right?
 Those
 guys


are
 the
 ones
 that
 are
 legitimately
 doing


rocket
 science.
 So,


>> um,
 last
 quick
 question
 on
 Rocket
 Lab


and
 then
 we'll
 we'll
 keep
 going
 from


there.
 Uh,
 is
 it
 overvalued
 right
 here?


That's
 call
 it
 70
 bucks.
 Yeah,
 I
 mean
 if


you
 if
 you
 want
 to
 look
 at
 it
 on
 today's


valuation
 for
 what
 revenue
 it
 is
 today,


um
 I
 could
 say
 yeah
 for
 sure.
 But
 the


way
 I
 look
 at
 it
 is
 is
 always
 10
 years


down
 the
 road,
 right?
 And
 if
 you
 think


about
 um
 where
 we
 are
 in
 terms
 of
 the


the
 company
 and
 its
 moat,
 right?
 How


many
 people
 can
 legitimately
 say
 they've


launched
 70
 odd
 vehicles?
 How
 many


people
 are
 going
 to
 be
 able
 to
 say
 that


they
 have
 equipment
 right
 now
 on
 Mars?


How
 many
 people
 can
 really
 say
 that


their
 legacy
 companies
 that
 they
 have


and
 in
 and
 acquisition
 and
 and
 and


acquired
 rather
 have
 or
 have
 been


experience
 or
 have
 experience
 in
 putting


um
 solar
 panels
 on
 the
 James
 Webb


telescope


>> any
 right
 and
 so
 um
 maybe
 you
 could
 say


that
 there's
 other
 companies
 comparable


like
 SpaceX
 but
 I
 honestly
 believe
 that


what
 you're
 witnessing
 is
 a
 a
 true


endto-end
 space
 company.
 So
 what
 what


kind
 of
 value
 do
 you
 put
 on
 that?
 It's


kind
 of
 like
 it's
 kind
 of
 like


Palanteer,
 right?
 What
 kind
 of
 value
 do


you
 put
 on
 that
 knowing
 that
 it
 it
 helps


supply
 the
 West
 with
 the
 the
 technology


it
 needs
 to
 support
 itself
 and
 and


defend
 itself?
 It's
 like
 almost


priceless
 in
 that
 respect.
 Like
 if


anybody's
 going
 to
 be
 able
 to
 help


provide
 infrastructure
 into
 space,
 you


know,
 but
 if
 you
 look
 at
 it
 from
 a


Sorry,
 I
 didn't
 mean
 to
 cut
 you
 off.
 If


you
 look
 at
 it
 from
 like
 a
 where
 what's


the
 minimum
 of
 it,
 right?
 Say
 Neutron


doesn't
 pan
 out.
 Say
 some
 of
 these
 other


things
 don't
 pan
 out
 like
 the


constellation
 that
 they
 wanted
 to
 put


into
 space,
 right?
 You
 just
 look
 at
 it


from
 an
 Electron
 perspective.
 You
 look


at
 it
 from
 the
 space
 components
 business


perspective.
 Even
 still,
 if
 you
 think


about
 it,
 just
 to
 get
 a
 company
 like


that
 up
 and
 going,
 you're
 going
 to
 need


15
 to$20
 billion
 as
 a
 moat,
 right?
 So,


in
 my
 opinion,
 that
 that
 company
 should


only
 be
 at
 a
 minimum
 15
 to
 20
 billion.


And
 that's
 before
 you
 land
 the
 Neutron


and
 get
 the
 Neutron
 up
 and
 going.
 You


think
 about
 if
 the
 Neutron's
 up
 and


going,
 what
 kind
 of
 price
 tag
 would
 you


put
 on
 a
 company
 like
 that?
 And
 it's


probably
 north
 of
 $30
 billion.
 So
 that's


that's
 when
 you
 start
 to
 think
 like,


okay,
 the
 downside
 here.
 Okay.
 Yeah,
 15


20
 billion.
 Uh
 there's
 500
 share
 500


million
 shares
 outstanding.
 So
 just


multiply
 the
 stock
 price
 by
 double.
 It


gets
 you
 to
 about
 what
 the
 market
 cap


is,
 right?
 So
 um
 if
 you
 think
 about
 it


in
 that
 respect,
 it's
 like
 uh
 or
 divided


by
 two
 rather.
 That's
 about
 what
 the
 uh


market
 cap
 would
 be.
 So
 if
 you
 were
 to


uh
 take
 a
 $60
 share
 price,
 it's
 about
 a


$30
 billion
 market
 cap.
 So
 maybe
 it
 at
 a


minimum
 it'd
 be
 worth
 30
 to
 to
 $40


billion
 sorry$30
 to
 $40
 a
 share
 at
 even


if
 all
 the
 future
 things
 don't
 pan
 out.


So,
 to
 me,
 I'm
 I'm
 okay
 betting
 on
 a
 $60


share
 price,
 anticipating
 that
 a
 neutron


constellation,
 all
 these
 future
 things


uh
 do
 pan
 out.


>> And
 if
 it
 does
 get
 to
 30
 40
 and
 you
 have


those
 future
 catalysts
 that
 are
 yet
 to


pan
 out,
 that's
 where
 probably
 the


opportunity
 continues
 to
 exist.
 Um,
 real


quick
 guys,
 we
 do
 have
 one
 headline
 from


Robin
 Hood.
 100
 new
 prediction
 markets


have
 been
 entered
 onto
 the
 platform


powered
 by
 KHI.
 A
 lot
 of
 this
 is
 going


to
 be
 about
 politics.
 We
 do
 have
 that


New
 York
 City
 mayor
 race
 coming
 up.
 A


lot
 of
 different
 races
 in
 November.
 So,


it
 looks
 like
 they
 are
 expanding
 the


prediction
 markets,
 which
 should
 be
 good


for
 them
 because
 that
 tends
 to
 be
 a


money
 printer
 uh
 for
 that
 segment
 of
 the


business.


All
 right,
 let's
 bring
 on
 the
 uh
 newest


finit


finance
 YouTuber
 in
 the
 ecosystem
 of
 our


community,
 ladies
 and
 gentlemen,
 on
 a


Friday
 market
 close
 with
 Mr.
 Matt
 Money.


What
 more
 can
 you
 ask
 for
 in
 life?
 Matt


Money
 and
 the
 Milkman
 on
 a
 Friday.


>> I
 got
 to
 tell
 you,
 I
 was
 sitting


backstage
 and
 when
 I
 I
 obviously
 can't


see
 the
 screen
 because
 I'm
 driving.
 I


heard
 Matt's
 voice.
 I'm
 like,
 "This
 is


going
 to
 be
 a
 great
 afternoon
 after
 a


freaking
 rough
 day
 for
 me."


>> Steve,
 did
 you
 get
 a
 a
 road
 milk
 for
 the


drive
 home?


>> Got
 road
 coffee
 with
 some
 milk
 in
 it.


And
 you
 know
 what's
 funny?
 I
 went
 to


Starbucks
 and
 I
 ordered
 it
 with
 half
 and


half.
 like
 we
 don't
 have
 any
 half
 happy


and
 half
 like
 all
 right
 whole
 milk's


fine.
 I
 started
 laughing
 to
 myself


because
 a
 whole
 milk


>> you
 know
 you
 should
 be
 getting
 milk
 for


the
 road,
 dude.
 Like
 like
 that's
 that's


a
 it's
 a
 good
 idea.
 Road
 milk.
 You
 know,


people
 get
 a
 Red
 Bull,
 people
 get
 a


Monster.
 You
 need
 to
 get
 a
 a
 gallon
 of


milk
 whenever
 you
 take
 a
 long
 trip.


>> I'm
 going
 to
 have
 some
 milk
 tonight
 to


relax.
 I'm
 not
 in
 relax
 mode
 right
 now.


I'm
 still


>> You're
 not
 You're
 not
 You're
 not
 going


to
 have
 a
 bourbon.
 You're
 going to
 have


a
 freaking
 glass
 of
 milk
 on
 a
 Friday.


>> Yeah.
 No,
 milk
 is
 more
 relaxing
 than


bourbon.


>> I
 just
 I
 can't
 imagine
 putting
 my
 feet


up
 and
 be
 like,
 "Let
 me
 just
 get
 a
 nice


glass
 of
 milk."


>> I
 will
 not
 do
 that
 ever.
 Like
 I
 can


>> That
 is
 not
 just
 a
 glass
 of
 milk.
 It's


got
 to
 be
 ice
 cold.


>> Bro,
 I
 don't
 think
 for
 the
 rest
 of
 my


life
 there
 will
 be
 a
 Friday
 night
 where


I
 put
 my
 feet
 up
 on
 the
 couch
 and
 say,


"Let
 me
 get
 an
 ice
 cold
 glass
 of
 milk


and
 relax."
 Like,
 will
 will
 anyone
 ever


do
 that
 in
 the
 chat?
 Just
 please
 let
 us


would
 you
 actually
 ever
 do
 that?
 I
 think


Steve's
 one.


>> I
 I
 told
 you
 about
 my
 special
 co
 cup
 for


Coca-Cola,
 right?


>> No.


>> Oh,
 I
 gotta
 get
 this
 out
 and
 show
 you


guys.
 I
 will
 freaking
 one
 night
 live


stream
 with
 it.
 I
 have
 a
 tin
 cup
 for


Coca-Cola
 because
 it
 gets
 it
 colder
 than


a
 glass
 when
 you
 put
 ice
 in
 it
 because


it
 just
 radiates
 through
 it.
 It's


freaking
 amazing.


>> Of
 course.
 Of
 course
 you
 do.
 It's


amazing.


>> So,
 you're
 going
 to
 put
 milk
 in
 there


now,
 right?
 That's
 the
 idea.


>> I
 see.
 I
 don't
 I
 I
 there's
 something
 in


my
 mind
 that
 stopped
 me
 from
 using
 it


for
 milk.
 Just
 tin
 and
 milk
 just
 to
 me


there's
 a
 a
 block
 in
 my
 mind.
 But
 with


Coca-Cola,
 it
 is
 freaking
 amazing.


Amazing.


>> I
 just
 I
 love
 Steve's
 streams,
 man.
 Like


you
 go
 on,
 he
 talks
 about
 stocks
 for


about
 10
 to
 15%
 of
 the
 time.
 The
 rest
 is


like
 movies.
 The
 the
 rest
 is
 like
 food


and
 then
 30%
 of
 it's
 milk.
 like


hysterical.


>> No,
 when
 Steve
 starts
 a
 hedge
 fund,


it'll
 call
 it'll
 be
 called
 Milkman


Capital
 Management.
 That's
 what


>> we
 deliver
 for
 you.


>> We
 deliver
 for
 you.


>> Um,
 okay,
 Steve.
 So,
 let
 me
 get
 your


perspective
 on
 what's
 happened
 not
 only


today
 for
 the
 rest,
 but
 for
 the
 entire


week.
 S&P
 was
 down
 3%
 last
 week,


recovered
 most
 of
 it
 on
 Monday,
 lost
 all


of
 it
 by
 Wednesday.
 Now,
 we're,
 you


know,
 up
 about
 half
 a
 percent
 for
 the


week.
 Regional
 banking
 concerns


yesterday,
 China
 concerns
 this
 morning,


2
 am.
 I
 don't know
 if
 you
 were
 sleeping,


but
 it
 was
 pretty
 ugly.
 If
 you
 took
 took


a
 look
 at
 your
 portfolio
 in
 the
 middle


of the
 night,
 what
 are
 your
 thoughts
 on


what
 has
 happened
 in
 the
 markets


throughout
 the
 entire
 week?


>> I
 don't
 care.


>> Okay.
 Outside
 of
 the
 part
 of
 you
 not


caring.
 Um


>> that's
 the
 same
 reaction
 I
 had
 when
 when


every
 time
 he
 says
 it
 when
 I'm
 just


watching
 your
 stream
 is
 like,
 I
 don't


care.
 I
 was
 like,


>> yeah,
 I
 mean,
 do
 are
 we
 freaking
 worried


about
 a
 2%
 correction
 or
 a
 5%


correction?
 Because
 if
 we
 are,
 then
 we


shouldn't
 be
 investing
 in
 freaking


equities.


>> No,
 I
 I
 get
 it.
 I
 No,
 no,
 I
 don't
 think


anyone's
 freaking
 out.
 I'm
 just
 in


general,
 the
 sort
 of
 like
 wherever
 you


want
 to
 take
 it,
 regional
 banks,
 China,


like
 did
 any
 of
 that
 stuff,
 did
 you


think
 about
 it?
 Did
 you
 analyze
 it?
 Or


is
 it
 kind
 of
 just
 ultimately
 not


anything
 that
 should
 be?


>> It's
 not
 impacting
 anything
 I'm
 invested


in.


>> That's
 fair.


>> I
 mean,
 how
 is
 it
 going
 to
 impact
 Meta


or
 Amazon?


How
 is
 it
 going
 to
 impact
 Nvidia?
 Nvidia


is
 still
 over
 180.
 So
 if
 we're
 saying


that,
 oh
 my
 god,
 we're
 worried
 about


Nvidia
 go
 oh.
 So
 what
 do
 we
 worry
 about


Nvidia
 going
 to
 165
 or
 170?
 Most
 of
 us


have
 cost
 basises
 of
 1151
 120.


It's
 true.
 So
 yeah,
 look,
 I'm
 looking
 at


this
 as
 opportunities
 to
 buy
 more.
 I'm


looking
 at
 this
 as
 you
 know what,
 we're


going
 to
 go
 into
 potentially
 the
 biggest


earning
 season
 we've
 ever
 had.
 So,
 if
 we


get
 a
 5%
 retracement
 beforehand,
 if
 I


can
 get
 some
 more
 capital
 into
 the


market,
 I'm
 happy
 to
 do
 so.
 And
 these


are
 things
 that
 are
 short-term


concerns
 and
 I
 don't
 have
 a
 short-term


mindset.
 So,
 it
 is
 what
 it
 is.
 I
 don't


have
 the
 time
 to
 worry
 about
 what
 one


thing
 is
 going
 to
 do
 to
 the
 other
 over
 a


week.
 you
 know
 ultimately
 the
 stuff
 that


I
 am
 in
 I
 am
 very
 confident
 in
 and
 it


just
 creates
 an
 opportunity
 to
 buy
 more.


>> Yeah.
 Look
 no
 I
 agree
 and
 I
 I
 think
 the


theme
 of
 today
 from
 my
 perspective
 is


the
 market
 is
 exhausted.
 You
 had
 a
 lot


of
 nonsense
 run
 up
 10
 20%
 almost
 every


week
 for
 the
 past
 10
 weeks
 in
 a
 row


literally.
 That's
 why
 these
 stocks
 are


up
 three
 400%
 even
 if
 they
 were
 to
 take


a
 20%
 haircut.
 And
 so,
 yeah,
 there's


going
 to
 be
 names
 that
 that
 are
 that


>> stocks
 that
 shouldn't
 have
 been
 up
 that


much.


>> Like,
 let's
 call
 Spain
 Spade.


>> Can
 any


justify
 Ollo's
 freaking
 price?
 Like,


stop.
 It's
 not
 justifiable.
 It's
 a


greater
 fool
 theory
 at
 this
 point


because
 nobody
 can
 prove.
 The
 only


reason
 Olo
 continues
 to
 go
 up
 is
 because


the
 Department
 of
 Energy
 tapped
 them
 and


two
 or
 three
 other
 companies
 for
 a


potential
 a
 project
 that
 may
 potentially


work.
 Nobody's
 saying
 that
 these
 things


are
 actually
 going
 to
 work
 or
 that


they're
 going
 to
 have
 the
 SMRs
 ready
 in


a
 timely
 fashion.
 I
 mean,
 it
 really


could
 be
 five
 years
 or
 at
 this
 point


four
 and
 a
 half
 years
 because
 they're


not
 expecting
 to
 drive
 any
 EPS
 until


2030.


like
 they're
 pulling
 so
 much
 forward


that
 if
 they
 go
 down
 50%
 it
 wouldn't


shock
 them.


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 and
 that's
 the
 that's
 the


punch
 line.
 Like
 if
 these
 names
 take


that
 big
 of
 a
 hit,
 will
 it
 take
 the


Amazons
 and
 Google's
 down
 a
 little
 bit?


Yes.
 Because
 everything
 will
 go
 down,


but
 you
 know,
 50%
 on
 a
 name
 that
 never


probably
 deserved
 to
 be
 here.
 And
 not


saying
 it's
 a
 bad
 company,
 but
 as
 you


said,
 call
 spade
 a
 spade.
 Maybe
 it


didn't
 deserve
 this
 rich
 of
 a
 premium.


That's
 healthy.
 That's
 like
 that
 that's


not
 that's
 not
 like
 a
 the
 top
 is
 in


that's
 not
 you
 know
 people
 don't
 care


about
 stocks
 anymore.
 That's
 just
 hey


there's
 some
 bag
 holders
 now
 and
 every


market
 cycle
 creates
 bag
 holders
 out
 of


a
 bunch
 of
 these
 names
 that
 go


>> Yeah.
 But
 hold
 on.
 Did
 did
 open
 door


take
 Amazon
 down
 when
 it
 crashed?
 I
 mean


I
 don't
 know
 that
 Oak
 going
 down
 matters


for
 any
 of
 those
 companies.
 It's
 not


part
 of
 the
 S&P
 and


people
 aren't
 freaking
 selling
 off


Amazon
 and
 selling
 off
 Aqua
 at
 the
 same


time.
 I
 think
 it's
 apples
 and
 oranges
 at


that
 point.
 If
 something
 happens
 with


the
 capex
 buildout,
 that's
 a
 much


different
 story.
 But
 right
 now,
 Aqua


going
 down
 or
 stuff
 like
 that,
 it
 just


does.
 I
 don't
 think
 it
 matters.


>> I
 would
 agree.
 I
 would
 agree.
 Um
 Matt,


any
 thoughts
 on
 this
 regional
 banking


issue?
 I
 don't
 know
 how
 much
 you've
 had


a
 time
 to
 look
 into
 it,
 but
 do
 you
 think


private
 credit
 should
 be
 any
 concern
 for


us
 to
 to
 keep
 an
 eye
 out
 on?


I
 haven't
 done
 as
 much
 due
 diligence
 as


I
 want
 to.
 Um,
 to
 be
 very
 honest,


um,


so
 I'm
 kind
 of
 curious
 to
 hear
 what
 what


Steve
 thinks.
 I
 mean,
 I
 was
 looking
 at


some
 regional
 banks,
 uh,
 very
 small,


right?
 uh
 less
 than
 a
 billion
 dollar


regional
 banks
 in
 in
 Pennsylvania
 around


where
 my
 mom
 lives
 and
 they
 looked


pretty
 healthy.
 But
 at
 the
 same
 time,
 I


don't
 think
 it
 would
 take
 very
 much
 if


unfortunately,
 you
 know,
 several
 of


these
 people
 were
 to
 unfortunately
 lose


their
 jobs
 for
 uh
 the
 banks
 and
 and
 the


loans
 that
 which
 those
 banks
 really
 hold


on
 their
 books
 to
 to
 start
 really


hitting
 some
 issues.
 So,
 um,
 Steve's


probably
 much
 more
 well
 read
 on
 it
 than


I
 am.
 So,
 I'm
 kind
 of
 curious
 to
 hear


the
 milkman's
 thoughts.


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 well,
 the
 question
 is,


well,
 you
 you've
 analyzed
 banks
 for
 a


very
 long
 time.
 Yesterday,
 two
 banks,


regionals,
 said
 they
 had


>> I
 don't
 even
 want
 to
 say
 credit
 issues,


but
 they
 said
 they
 had
 some
 crappy


loans.
 Then
 we
 had
 three
 banks
 this


morning
 say
 their
 provision
 for
 credit


losses
 were
 way
 better
 than
 expected,


which
 is
 why
 regionals
 rebounded.
 But
 it


gave
 the
 market
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 March


2023
 moment
 to
 an
 extent.
 Do
 you
 think


we
 should
 be
 concerned
 about
 a
 credit


crisis
 based
 on
 some
 regionals
 showing


some
 bad
 results?


>> Some
 regionals
 showing
 bad
 results
 is


not
 reason
 to
 think
 that
 this
 is
 2022


all
 over
 again
 where
 you
 had
 the


regional
 banking
 crisis.
 I
 mean,


there's
 going
 to
 be
 even
 more
 reason
 for


the
 Fed
 to
 cut
 now.
 They
 may
 even
 get


more
 aggressive
 early
 next
 year.
 And
 I


need
 to
 look
 which
 regionals
 was
 it?
 Do


you
 know
 off
 the
 top
 of your
 head?
 Was


it
 truest?


>> No.
 No.
 No.
 Those
 were
 great.
 It
 was


Zions
 and
 Western
 Alliance.


>> Doesn't
 matter
 one
 bit.


>> Yeah.


>> I
 mean,


>> you
 know,
 Truis
 Truist
 had
 a
 phenomenal


earnings
 today
 and
 that's
 the
 seventh


largest
 bank
 in
 the
 country,
 right?


You
 know,
 the
 the
 the
 big
 thing
 to
 worry


about
 is
 is
 this
 the
 stepping
 stone
 of


what's
 to
 come
 over
 the
 next
 several


years
 if
 we
 have
 employment
 through


expansion
 and
 efficiency
 with
 robotics


and
 AI
 and
 our
 smaller
 companies
 going


to
 be
 able
 to
 compete
 and


that's
 a
 whole
 different
 side
 of
 it.


Right
 now,
 two
 regional
 banks
 showing
 a


little
 bit
 of
 concern
 is
 not
 something


where
 I'm
 too
 worried,
 especially
 since


the
 majority
 of
 banking
 is
 done
 with
 the


big
 money
 centers
 and
 the
 big
 regionals


and
 the
 big
 banks
 were
 not
 showing
 any


signs
 of
 concern
 at
 all
 during
 earning


seasons.
 So,
 right
 now,
 it's
 not


something
 I'm
 worried
 about.


>> Yeah,
 I
 I
 did
 have
 the
 chance
 to
 look
 at


the
 large
 banks
 and
 I
 don't
 think
 I've


seen
 a
 stronger
 quarter
 from
 a
 lot
 of


them.
 um
 they're
 well
 capitalized.
 So
 I


mean
 if
 you
 think
 about
 it
 kind
 of
 going


back
 to
 what
 you
 said
 about
 2023
 AIT


does
 this
 feel
 like
 analogous
 and
 does


this
 feel
 like
 it's
 kind
 of
 a
 a
 start
 of


this
 again?
 I
 guess
 the
 big
 concern


would
 be
 is
 if
 the
 big
 banks
 weren't
 in


a
 position
 to
 be
 able
 to
 absorb
 some
 of


this
 because
 if
 you
 think
 about
 what


happened
 after
 first
 republic
 and
 SVB


had
 their
 issues
 their
 their
 credit


basically
 had
 to
 be
 bought
 up
 by
 the
 JP


Morgans
 of
 the
 world.
 So
 if
 if
 everybody


else
 is
 on
 bad
 footing,
 then
 I'm
 kind
 of


where
 Steve
 is
 at.
 I
 don't
 think
 it


really
 matters
 unless
 you
 were
 to
 say


have
 poorly
 capitalized
 Wells
 Fargo,
 uh,


poorly
 capitalized
 cities,
 poorly


capitalized
 JP
 Morgans,
 poor
 poorly


capitalized
 Bank
 of
 Americas,
 but
 you're


not
 in
 that
 situation.
 And
 so
 even
 if


there
 is
 a
 point
 where
 some
 of
 these


poor
 loans
 or
 or
 um
 bad
 assets
 have
 to


be
 absorbed,
 they're
 going
 to
 be


absorbed
 and
 and
 well
 absorbed
 by
 these


larger
 institutions.
 So
 I
 don't
 think


that
 we're
 in
 such
 a
 bad
 spot.
 Um
 and
 to


be
 very
 frank,
 I
 think
 any
 of
 these


companies
 that
 are
 struggling
 right
 now,


hopefully
 they'll
 get
 some
 relief.
 Um


some
 of
 these
 regional
 banks
 will
 get


relief
 as
 we
 start
 to
 cut
 interest


rates.
 And
 you
 know,
 we
 already
 did
 cut


once
 um
 you
 know,
 just
 last
 month
 and


hopefully
 two
 more
 times
 before
 the
 end


of
 the
 year
 and
 then
 hopefully
 a
 couple


more
 times
 throughout
 next
 year.


Hopefully
 that
 gives
 them
 a
 little
 bit


more
 headroom
 on
 on
 some
 of
 these
 assets


that
 they're
 holding
 on
 their
 books
 that


were
 kind
 of
 tarnished.
 So,
 um
 I
 don't


know,
 may
 maybe
 it's
 a
 it's
 a
 wait
 and


see
 kind
 of
 game.
 Um
 maybe
 if
 it
 dips


into
 the
 beginning
 of
 2026,
 that's
 a


different
 story.
 But
 even
 still,
 it


seems
 like
 that
 the
 the
 large


institutions
 are
 are
 fine
 enough
 to


absorb
 anything
 that
 I've
 kind
 of
 uh


seen
 so
 far.


>> Yeah.
 And
 I
 think
 we
 would
 have
 to
 see


continued
 weakening
 in
 the
 regional


banks
 to
 to to
 think
 this
 is
 like
 a


structural
 problem.
 And
 today
 just


denied
 that.
 So
 again,
 it's
 not
 like


this
 market
 doesn't
 have
 its
 own


different
 things
 that
 pop
 up
 that
 could


make
 people
 worried,
 but
 until
 the
 data


shows
 a
 trend
 that
 that
 justifies
 a
 lot


of
 that
 worrying.
 It's
 just
 hard
 for


money
 to
 stay
 on
 the
 sidelines
 if
 they


know
 that
 the
 Fed
 is
 ultimately
 going to


be
 cutting
 rates.
 Um
 there's
 Steve's


YouTube
 right
 there
 in
 the
 chat,
 folks.


You
 can
 subscribe
 to
 that
 and
 Matt's


YouTube
 as
 well.
 You
 can
 give
 him
 a


subscribe.
 Steve,
 I'll
 I'll
 ask
 you
 I'll


give
 you
 the
 first
 word
 on
 this


question.
 Speaking
 of
 banks,
 is
 SoFi
 a


buy
 here
 before
 earnings?


>> I
 mean,


I'm
 not
 buying.
 So,
 it's
 hard
 for
 me
 to


say
 that,
 you
 know,


super
 bullish.
 I
 think
 earnings
 are


going
 to
 be
 great.
 I
 look,
 we
 all
 know


the
 story.
 It's
 more
 frequent
 than
 not


that
 SoFi
 does
 a
 triple
 beat,
 right?
 We


say
 triple
 beat.
 They
 beat
 on
 the
 top,


they
 beat
 on
 the
 bottom,
 and
 they
 raise


guidance
 and
 the
 stock
 pops
 in
 the


morning,
 and
 then
 it
 sells
 off
 five
 to


10
 percent.
 By
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day
 or
 the


next
 day,
 is
 that
 going
 to
 happen
 again?


I
 have
 no
 idea.
 I
 think
 it's
 something


that's
 interesting
 if
 you
 want
 to
 try
 to


play
 something
 that
 normally
 has
 a
 pop


in
 the
 morning,
 but
 I
 mean,
 long
 term,
 I


think
 it'll
 do
 well.
 It's
 something


where
 you
 have
 the
 PSUs


So
 they
 need
 it
 to
 be
 35
 or
 45
 depending


on
 what
 trunch
 you
 think
 it's
 going
 to


get
 to.
 So
 depends
 time
 frame
 and


whatnot.
 I
 mean
 I'm
 not
 personally


buying
 more
 here
 but
 I
 think
 it's
 going


to
 have
 a
 very
 good
 quarter
 and
 rate


cuts
 are
 super
 bullish
 because
 you're


going
 to
 have
 people
 refinancing
 on


student
 loans.
 You're
 going
 to
 have


housing
 market
 come
 back.
 So
 there's
 a


lot
 of
 catalyst
 for
 them.


>> Matt,
 you
 buying
 here
 for
 earnings?
 Uh,


I
 did
 pause.
 I
 was
 doing
 um
 by
 monthly


buy.
 So,
 I
 get
 paid
 the
 15th,
 the
 last


day
 of
 every
 month.
 And
 with
 that,
 I
 was


I
 was
 siphoning
 off
 a
 portion
 of
 my


income
 to
 always
 buy
 more.
 I
 paused
 that


about
 two
 or
 three
 weeks
 ago
 uh
 to
 put


it
 elsewhere.
 I
 just
 think
 that
 I
 don't


I'm
 not
 bearish
 on
 the
 stock.
 I
 don't


think
 it's
 going
 to
 go
 back
 to
 six
 bucks


or
 anything
 of
 the
 like,
 but
 I
 just


think
 that
 it's
 it's
 run
 a
 little
 bit


too
 far.
 And
 um
 there's
 just
 other


places
 I
 want
 to
 put
 my
 money
 right
 now.


Now
 if
 you
 were
 to
 ask
 me
 do
 I
 think


it's
 going
 to
 be
 higher
 in
 two
 to
 three


years
 I
 would
 say
 in
 bear
 if
 there's
 not


sort
 of
 sort
 of
 large
 macroeconomic


recession
 or
 anything
 like
 that
 I
 think


that
 SoFi
 will
 continue
 to
 do
 well
 and
 I


think
 it'll
 continue
 to
 climb
 in
 terms


of
 uh
 the
 top
 banking
 institutions
 in


the
 United
 States.
 So
 I
 guess
 it
 really


just
 depends
 on
 somebody's
 time
 horizon


right
 if
 you're
 looking
 specifically
 at


this
 quarter


it's
 kind
 of
 a
 gamble.
 you've
 already


run
 so
 much
 uh
 this
 year.
 It's
 it's
 been


a
 great
 performer.
 I
 mean,
 it
 feels
 like


just
 uh
 uh
 believe
 it
 or
 not,
 just
 a


couple
 quarters
 ago,
 we
 were
 talking


about
 it
 below
 $10
 uh
 and
 and
 being


excited
 that
 it
 hit
 15
 and
 now
 people


are
 not
 happy
 that
 it's
 not
 30
 bucks.


It's
 it's
 kind
 of
 astonishing
 um
 how


much
 it's
 uh
 it's
 it's
 kind
 of
 grown.


So,
 um
 but
 yeah,
 people
 think
 I'm
 biased


because
 of
 a
 $500
 bet.
 Um,
 it's
 not
 it's


not
 that
 big
 of
 a
 deal.
 Uh,
 I
 have


enough
 SoFi
 that
 I've
 already
 gained


that
 in
 some,
 so
 it's
 not
 too
 much
 of
 a


deal.
 And
 and
 and
 I
 think
 Tevvis
 and
 I


both
 agreed
 that
 whoever
 wins,
 we
 would


spend
 it
 uh
 wherever
 whatever
 trip
 we


were
 on.
 So,


>> it's
 about
 the
 bragging
 rights,
 bro.


That's
 what
 it's


>> about
 the
 bragging
 rights.
 Yeah,
 it's


it'll
 hold
 an
 eternity.


>> And
 I
 think
 I
 have
 it
 in
 my
 public


portfolio.
 I
 think


>> Yeah,
 I
 think
 you
 and
 Chris
 might
 have


it.
 Oh,
 no.
 You
 have
 it
 in
 the
 stock


draft.
 Oh,
 can
 we
 can
 we
 talk
 about


that?
 Steve,
 why
 why
 are
 you
 why
 is
 your


performance
 so
 bad
 in
 the
 stock
 draft?


>> I
 actually
 haven't
 looked
 at
 in
 a
 while.


>> I'm
 just
 calling
 him
 out.
 Like,
 what?


>> Dude,
 Steve,
 you
 suck,
 bro.
 Like,
 let's


just
 let's
 call
 it,


>> bro.
 You're
 up
 6%.


>> Dude,
 check
 out
 Broadcom,
 though.
 Geez.


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 Steve's
 up
 40%,
 but
 he's


down
 60%.


>> But
 in
 all
 seriousness,
 when
 is
 the


stock
 draft
 over?


>> June.


>> We
 got
 a
 lot
 of
 time.
 Okay,
 so
 I
 got
 Q3,


Q4,
 and
 Q1
 to
 make
 a
 comeback.
 I
 got


three
 more
 earnings
 reports.
 Keep
 that


in
 mind.


>> Yeah,
 but
 a
 lot
 of
 your
 stocks
 suck.


>> I
 wouldn't
 have
 chose
 Micro
 Strategy,


bro.


>> I
 look,
 I
 took
 that
 on
 a
 flyer.
 That


could
 Yeah,
 but
 there's
 so
 much
 time.
 I


just
 need
 a
 couple
 of
 weeks.
 Like,
 in


all
 seriousness,
 that
 could
 come
 back
 in


a
 matter
 of
 three
 weeks.


>> I
 I
 I
 think
 you
 picked
 a
 portfolio
 that


will
 make
 sure
 you're
 definitely
 you're


definitely
 not
 negative
 by
 the
 time
 this


is
 over.
 I
 just
 don't
 know
 if
 it's
 if


it's
 a
 bull
 market
 again.
 I
 don't
 know


if
 it
 beats
 Matt
 or
 me
 or
 Tanner
 because


we
 just
 have
 too
 many
 other
 high
 beta


names
 that'll
 propel
 it
 forward,
 you


know.


>> Yeah.
 Look,
 I
 took
 him
 because
 I
 wanted


to
 deal
 it
 because
 I
 thought
 other


people
 wanted
 and
 I
 should
 have
 dealt
 it


to
 you
 for
 Apple,
 but
 I
 was
 holding
 out


for
 something
 else
 that
 backfired.
 And


Micro
 Strategy
 was
 something
 that
 I


thought
 if
 Bitcoin
 really
 did
 well,
 this


could
 really
 fly.
 And
 look,
 if
 Bitcoin


goes
 to
 150
 or
 175
 by
 June,


Micro
 Strategy
 could
 end
 up
 being
 a
 40


50%
 winner
 for
 it.


>> 100%.
 That's
 true.
 That
 is
 correct.


>> So
 there's
 still
 We
 shouldn't
 be


counting
 that
 out.
 And
 the
 other
 ones


that
 are
 down,
 I'm
 not
 sure.
 I'm
 not


looking
 at


>> Salesforce
 and
 Salesforce
 and
 PayPal.


>> Sales
 Force,
 I'm
 not
 worried
 about.
 I'm


very
 worried
 about
 PayPal.
 Salesforce


can
 make
 a
 run
 to
 300.


>> You
 know,
 PayPal
 made
 a
 $300
 trillion


mistake
 yesterday.
 No,
 but
 I
 mean
 I'm


not
 surprised.


>> They
 printed
 300
 trillion
 of
 their


stable
 coin
 and
 they
 quickly
 erased
 the


mistake.
 I
 mean
 it
 wasn't
 really
 their


fault.
 It
 was
 their
 issuer
 practice
 that


had
 it.
 But
 like
 still
 it,
 you
 know,


it's
 kind
 of
 wild
 to
 print
 300


>> wrong
 with
 these
 people.


What
 is
 wrong
 with
 them?
 Like
 can
 they


do
 anything
 right?
 Like


>> dude,
 300
 trillion
 is
 a hundred
 times
 or


three
 times
 more
 than
 the
 amount
 of


dollars
 in
 circulation.


>> Yeah,
 we'll
 just
 add
 a
 couple
 of
 zeros


for
 pen.
 See
 if
 anybody
 notices.


Just
 banging
 the
 keyboard
 a
 bit.


>> Just
 banging
 the
 keyboard.
 Um,
 so
 the


chat,
 76%
 of
 you
 are
 saying
 S&P
 7000
 by


end
 of
 year.
 I
 know
 Steve's
 answer.
 So


Matt,


yes
 or
 no?
 S&P
 7K
 by
 end
 of
 year.


>> If
 you
 asked
 me
 this
 two
 weeks
 ago,
 I


would
 have
 felt
 a
 lot
 more
 confident.


>> So
 would
 I.


>> Yeah.
 Uh


but
 I
 think
 that
 I
 still
 say
 yes
 because


the
 companies
 in
 which
 that
 are


propelling
 the
 S&P
 500
 forward
 are
 still


on
 great
 financial
 footing.
 You
 don't


need
 the
 speculative
 companies
 of
 the


world
 like
 the
 Olos
 and
 many
 of
 these


other
 quantum
 companies
 that
 I
 think


might
 might
 unfortunately
 hit
 some


headwinds.
 Uh
 I
 don't
 think
 that
 those


are
 going
 to
 be
 the
 ones
 that
 are
 going


to
 be
 involved
 at
 all.
 Right?
 They're


none
 of
 them
 are
 in
 the
 S&P
 500.
 none
 of


them
 have
 revenue
 or
 income
 enough
 to
 be


entered
 into
 the
 S&P
 500.
 That's
 not
 a


hit
 on
 them.
 That's
 just
 the
 this
 is
 the


fact
 of
 the
 situation.
 So
 I
 I
 think
 I


still
 think
 that
 there's
 a
 lot
 of


revenue
 to
 be
 realized
 from
 Nvidia
 of


the
 world.
 There's
 a
 lot
 of
 revenues
 to


be
 realized
 from
 all
 this
 capital


expenditure
 that's
 been
 going
 on
 in
 the


mag
 7.
 So
 I
 still
 think
 that
 there,
 you


know,
 you
 get
 a
 nice
 warm
 gust
 uh
 of


Santa
 rally
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 year
 like


we
 generally
 always
 do.
 And
 I
 could
 see


us
 touching
 7K.
 Do
 we
 have
 to
 end
 above


seven
 or
 just
 touch
 it?


>> Yeah,
 I
 know.
 We
 got
 to
 get
 We
 got
 to


end
 December
 31st.


>> That's
 a
 little
 tougher,


>> Steve.


>> I
 think
 there's
 a
 chance.


>> I
 mean,
 what
 am
 I
 supposed
 to
 do?
 Say


we're
 not.


>> It's
 up
 to
 you.
 You're
 you're
 you're


you're
 the
 one
 making
 a
 call
 here.


>> And
 I
 made
 I
 made
 the
 call
 before


anybody
 else.


>> Oh,
 no.
 We
 got
 it.
 You
 remind
 us
 that


every
 time,
 but
 I'm
 asking.


>> So,
 it's
 not
 like
 I
 can
 go
 back
 on
 this.


You
 know what
 I
 mean?


>> No.
 No,
 of
 course
 you.
 Dude,
 these


analysts
 do
 it
 every
 single
 day.
 They


switch.


>> That's
 not
 right.
 I'm
 not
 going
 back.
 I


made
 a
 prediction
 and
 I
 stuck
 with
 the


prediction
 through
 the
 freaking
 thick
 of


it.


>> We
 lost
 them.


>> I'm
 also
 not
 saying
 that
 it's
 going
 to


be
 higher
 than
 7,000.
 So,


>> no,
 but
 but
 but
 look,
 making
 a


prediction
 and
 then
 getting
 you
 data
 to


change
 your
 prediction
 is
 it's
 not


inconsistent.
 So,
 is
 there
 any
 data
 that


makes
 you
 feel
 7,000
 harder?
 And
 there's


no
 data
 that
 makes
 me
 want
 to
 change
 my


mind
 at
 the
 moment.
 Now,
 if
 we
 get
 in


Q3,
 Microsoft,
 Amazon,
 Alphabet,
 and


Zuck
 will
 say
 that,
 you
 know what,
 we


think
 Open
 AI
 is
 wrong.
 Haha,
 we're


already
 built
 out
 to
 capacity
 and


they're
 going
 to
 waste
 all
 this
 money.


Then
 I'll
 really
 get
 worried.
 I'll
 say


that
 we're
 going
 to
 5,500
 pretty
 damn


quick
 or
 maybe
 lower.
 But
 I
 don't
 think


that
 that's
 the
 case.
 I
 think
 they're


all
 going
 to
 come
 over
 the
 top.


Yeah,
 I
 would
 agree.
 Look,
 I
 I
 I'll
 get


on
 the
 7,000
 B
 bandwagon
 as
 well.
 I


mean,
 I've
 never
 I
 don't
 think
 I've
 ever


put
 out
 a
 real
 I
 mean,
 I
 think
 my


target's
 been
 68
 to
 69
 for
 a
 while.
 If


we
 get
 that
 close,
 we
 probably
 end
 up


topping
 7,000
 by
 the
 end
 of
 the
 year.
 If


the
 momentum
 is
 there
 and
 the
 earnings


are
 there,


>> I
 have
 a
 question
 for
 you
 because
 I
 was


in
 meetings
 legitimately
 pretty
 much
 all


day.
 I
 didn't
 even
 get
 to
 see
 what
 you


put
 on
 Substack.
 Where'd
 you
 write
 about


it?


I
 did
 not
 officially
 publish
 I
 was


actually
 going
 to
 do
 this
 at
 the
 end.
 We


might
 as
 well
 do
 it
 right
 now.
 So,
 I'm


publishing
 two
 deep
 dive
 deep
 dives


today.
 I
 wanted
 to
 start
 off
 with
 two


companies.
 Usually,
 it'll
 be
 two
 a


month,
 but
 we're
 starting
 off
 with
 two


companies.


>> All right.


>> I
 I
 have
 not
 announced
 the
 names
 of
 it.


I'll
 put
 the
 link
 in
 the
 chat
 for
 those


that
 want
 to
 get
 subscribed
 before
 it


comes
 out.
 It'll
 be
 out
 around
 7:30,
 800


PM
 Eastern.


>> Everybody
 should
 subscribe
 immediately.


>> I
 want
 you
 both
 to
 guess.
 I'm
 not
 gonna


reveal
 it,
 but
 what
 are
 the
 two
 names


you
 think
 I'm
 putting
 out
 my
 deep
 dive


on
 today?


>> I
 mean,
 I
 feel
 like
 you're
 gonna
 do


Palanteer
 as
 one
 of
 them.


>> No,
 hold
 on,
 hold
 on.
 Let
 me
 let
 me
 give


you
 some
 context.
 I
 worked
 really
 hard


on
 this
 [ __ ]
 I
 don't
 like
 writing.


Like,
 I
 really
 hate
 writing,
 so
 it
 it


really
 took
 a
 toll
 out
 of
 me
 for
 the


past
 month
 to
 sit
 down
 there
 and


freaking
 write
 this
 [ __ ]
 Um,


>> these
 are
 two
 companies
 that
 are,
 I


think,
 very


relevant
 in
 the
 broader
 ecosystem.
 They


are
 definitely
 two
 companies
 that
 were


heavily
 requested.
 Not
 everyone's
 going


to
 like
 these
 two
 companies
 and
 they're


going
 to
 be
 annoyed
 I
 didn't
 do
 it
 on


the
 other
 two,
 but
 hopefully
 over
 time


uh
 you
 know
 we'll
 get
 to
 do
 everything


and
 people
 will
 still
 value
 the
 the
 the


the
 the
 research
 itself.
 And
 the
 last


hint
 I'll
 give
 is
 that


is
 that


one
 is
 a
 tech
 company
 and
 the
 other
 one


utilizes
 technology.


>> I
 mean
 every
 company
 utilizes


technology.
 That's
 not
 the
 greatest


hint.


>> Yeah,
 that's
 that's
 a
 bad
 hint,
 but
 all


right,
 you
 guys
 get
 you
 both
 get
 two


guesses.
 What
 do
 you
 think,
 Steve?
 What


are
 you


>> I'm
 going
 to
 say
 Core
 Wee
 because
 that's


one
 of
 the
 most
 requested
 things
 by


everybody
 these
 days.


>> Okay.
 And
 then
 what's
 the
 other
 one?


>> Another
 company
 that
 uses
 tech.
 I
 mean,


you
 can
 make
 an
 argument
 that
 every


company
 uses
 tech
 from
 an
 email
 platform


to
 servers
 to
 application
 software.
 So,


I
 mean,
 I
 don't
 know.


Take
 a
 guess.
 You
 got
 to
 lock
 it
 in.


Lock
 it
 in.


>> And
 for
 you
 to
 say
 it
 was
 hard
 for
 you


to
 do
 it
 makes
 me
 think
 it
 was
 something


that
 really
 wasn't
 that
 interesting
 to


you.
 So,
 it
 would
 have
 been


>> No,
 I
 I
 will
 say,
 look,
 these
 are
 the


first
 two
 deep
 dives.
 I
 want
 them
 to
 be


good.
 I
 I
 picked
 two
 companies
 I
 care


about.
 Like,
 there's
 plenty
 of
 companies


I
 write
 about
 that
 I
 don't
 care
 about


too
 much,
 but
 these
 two


>> I
 do
 care.


>> I
 feel
 like
 Grab
 is
 the
 other
 one.


>> Grab
 and
 Cororeweave.
 Okay.
 Matt,
 what


do
 you
 think
 it?
 I
 just
 I
 don't
 Damn.
 Do


you
 really
 think
 it's
 grabb?
 I
 was


originally
 gonna
 say
 grab
 because


originally


>> he
 didn't
 give
 us
 the
 best
 freaking


hints
 to
 go
 off.


>> I
 gave
 you
 good
 hints,


>> but
 but
 the
 hints
 that
 he
 gave
 it
 seem


like
 it's
 not
 going
 to
 be
 ones
 that
 are


obvious
 choices,
 but
 but
 the
 community


wants
 it,
 right?
 So
 if
 and
 maybe
 he's


using
 very
 collective
 or
 selective


language
 to
 throw
 me
 off,
 but
 my
 thought


process
 would
 have
 been
 like
 it's


companies
 that
 I
 really,
 you
 know,


thought
 like,
 you
 know,
 admire
 and
 want


to
 be.
 So
 that's
 why
 he
 said
 it's
 what


the
 community
 is
 more
 so.
 So
 that's


what's
 making
 me
 think
 it's
 not


>> I'll
 just
 say
 I'll
 just
 say
 one
 of
 them


is
 not
 Grab.
 I'll
 just
 put
 that
 out


there.
 So


>> yeah,
 I
 didn't
 think


>> I
 also
 already
 put
 out
 a
 15-page


document
 on
 Grab.
 So
 it's
 not
 Grab.


>> Yeah.
 So,
 I
 didn't
 think
 it
 was
 going
 to


be
 grabbed
 after
 you
 kind
 of
 described


it
 initially
 before
 you
 gave
 us
 your


kind
 of
 thought.
 Um,


utilizes
 technology.
 That's
 just


I
 because
 any
 other
 hint,
 bro,
 it's


going
 to
 give
 it
 away.
 So,
 I
 I
 like


>> I
 can't
 wait
 for
 him
 to
 actually
 tell
 us


what
 it
 is
 so
 we
 can
 say
 what
 his
 see


what
 his
 definition
 of
 utilizing


technology
 is.


>> One
 of
 them
 legit
 utilizes
 tech.
 like


they're
 intertwined
 with
 it.
 It's
 not


Amazon
 either,
 guys.
 It
 is
 not
 Amazon.


Amazon's
 a
 little
 too
 easy
 to
 do
 a
 deep.


It's
 freaking
 Amazon,
 bro.
 Like


eventually
 I'll
 do
 a
 deep
 dive,
 but
 it's


like,
 you
 know,
 it's
 Amazon.
 People
 know


what
 Amazon
 is.


>> Yeah,
 it's
 definitely
 not
 Palier
 either.


You
 talk
 about
 pounder.


>> I
 will.
 It's
 not
 pounder
 hood.
 I'll
 say


it's


>> [ __ ]
 What
 would
 the
 I
 mean
 I
 feel
 like


I
 would
 want
 to
 say
 BMR
 but
 I
 feel
 like


that's
 too
 obvious
 and
 I
 don't
 think
 you


would
 want
 to
 do
 it.
 I
 do
 like
 what


somebody
 said
 Nebius
 and
 I
 think
 that


you
 would
 potentially
 write
 on
 Nebus


uh
 because
 I
 know
 that
 the
 companies


that
 you
 are
 in
 your
 periphery


uh
 are
 are
 definitely
 Nebius
 and
 you've


been
 intrigued
 by
 it
 and
 the
 I
 know
 it's


not
 something
 you
 cover
 too
 extensively.


Um
 so
 I'm
 gonna
 go
 with
 Nebius.


Okay,
 one
 more.


It's
 not
 SoFi,
 guys.
 It's
 not
 It's
 not


so


>> I'm
 using
 the
 chat.
 The
 chat
 The
 chat's


going
 to
 lead
 me
 to
 greatness.


>> I
 will
 say
 a
 couple
 people
 have


mentioned
 it,
 but
 just
 a
 couple
 people


have
 guessed
 it.
 Both
 of
 them.
 Not
 I


mean
 the
 majority
 of
 people
 have
 are


picking
 names
 that
 are
 not
 it
 not
 for


this
 time.


>> I'll
 just
 go
 Duolingo.
 Screw
 it.


>> Oh,
 Nebius
 and
 Dolingo.
 Okay.


>> Yeah.


>> All
 right.
 Well,
 it'll
 be
 out
 at
 7:30,
 8


p.m.
 And
 hopefully
 people
 enjoy
 and
 I'll


>> Oh,
 you're
 not
 even
 going
 to
 tell
 us?


>> No,
 it's
 got
 to
 be
 a
 surprise.
 You'll


>> you
 got
 to
 subscribe.
 Why
 Why
 would
 you


tell
 us?
 It
 ruins
 the
 subscription.
 Then


people
 like,
 "Oh,
 I
 don't
 care
 about


that
 company.
 Why
 would
 I
 subscribe?"


>> Look,
 there's
 No,
 there's
 going to
 be
 a


bunch
 of
 people
 that
 don't
 care.
 But
 I


want
 to
 build
 a
 Substack
 where
 people


are
 willing
 to
 read
 anything
 because


they're
 intellectually
 curious.
 And
 I


think
 that's
 also
 the
 culture
 of


Substack.
 Like
 the
 culture
 is
 people
 are


willing
 to
 take
 a
 chance
 on
 an


intellectual
 journey
 and
 read
 something


new
 for
 the
 sake
 of
 the
 research
 that
 it


provides,
 not
 because
 they're
 just


curious
 about
 the
 ticker,
 right?
 So
 I


hope
 that's
 the
 community
 we
 can
 create.


But
 you
 know,
 you
 got
 to
 put
 out
 good


content
 for
 that
 to
 happen
 long
 term.


So,
 all
 right.
 It'll
 be
 out
 in
 a
 couple


of
 hours
 and
 we'll
 go
 from
 there.


Um,


you
 know,
 there's
 no
 paywell
 for
 those


saying,
 "No,
 there's
 no
 paywall.
 It'll


be
 free.
 Everything
 will
 be
 out
 for


everyone
 for
 free
 forever."
 What
 else?


What
 happened?
 What
 else
 happened
 this


week?
 I
 mean,
 I
 think
 it
 was
 a


relatively
 outside
 of
 the
 market
 going


up
 and
 down.


>> Uh,
 you
 had
 some
 pretty
 big
 news
 this


week.


I
 mean,
 what
 the
 OpenAI
 stuff
 with


Broadcom
 that
 like


>> that
 and
 TSM
 murdering
 earnings.


>> Well,
 yeah,
 that's
 true.


>> And
 because
 that
 sets
 the
 stage
 for
 the


next
 two
 weeks


>> or
 at
 least
 not
 this


>> Oh,
 that's
 what
 we
 Yes,
 we
 should
 end


off
 on
 this.
 Okay.
 So,
 next
 week,
 let's


do
 next
 two
 weeks.
 A
 little
 bit
 of a


preview.
 We're
 not
 going
 to
 touch
 on


every
 company,
 but
 Steve,
 what
 what
 do


you
 think
 big
 tech
 is
 setting
 up
 for


going
 into
 next
 week?
 I
 think
 murderers


be
 uh
 beat
 on
 top
 and
 bottom
 line.


Like
 not
 even
 small.
 I
 think
 murderers


like
 I
 think
 they're
 going
 to
 absolutely


destroy


>> all
 of
 them.


>> I
 I
 think
 that
 you're
 going
 to
 see
 Azure


AWS
 and
 Google
 Cloud
 not
 be
 able
 to
 keep


up
 with
 demands.
 I
 think
 you're
 going
 to


see
 big
 capex
 spending.
 I
 think
 you're


going
 to
 see
 a
 lot
 of
 cash
 from


operations.


I
 think
 you're
 going
 to
 see
 Apple
 have
 a


very
 strong
 Q1.
 I
 think
 people
 are


underestimating


the
 iPhone
 cycle.


I
 think
 big
 tech
 setting
 up
 for
 good


things.
 I
 really
 do.
 And
 I
 think
 Nvidia


is
 going
 to
 come
 out
 saying
 that
 they


hit
 30
 billion
 in
 net
 income.
 You
 can't


keep
 up.
 Not
 that
 they
 can't
 keep
 up


with
 demand,
 but
 every
 chip
 is
 basically


accounted
 for.
 I
 just
 I'm
 not
 seeing
 any


after
 the
 I
 after
 going
 through
 TSM


report.
 if
 there's
 no
 reason
 not
 to
 be


super
 bullish
 on
 those
 companies.


>> Okay,
 I'm
 going
 to
 put
 a
 poll
 right
 here


in
 the
 chat.
 And
 uh
 dude,
 YouTube
 needs


to
 give
 us
 more
 than
 four
 options


because
 it
 always
 makes
 these
 polls
 so


hard.
 But
 the
 question
 is,
 which
 out
 of


these
 four


have
 the
 best
 earnings
 objectively?
 Not


just
 stock
 price
 reaction,
 but
 which
 one


do
 you
 think
 crushes
 it
 out
 of
 the
 park?


We're
 going
 to
 go
 Meta,
 Google,
 Amazon,


and
 Nvidia.
 I
 I
 I
 just
 can't
 put
 the


other
 three
 because
 I
 don't
 have
 the


poll.
 But


>> when
 you
 do
 that,
 are
 you
 doing
 it
 on


YouTube
 or
 stream
 streaming?


>> YouTube.
 YouTube.


>> Okay.


>> YouTube
 has
 to
 optimize
 more
 for


streamers
 because
 we
 need
 these
 results.


But
 oh,
 let's
 give
 to
 you
 Matt.
 What


which
 one
 out
 of
 those
 four
 do
 you
 think


will
 objectively
 have
 the
 best
 earnings


this?


>> So,
 I
 think
 Google
 and
 Amazon
 report
 at


the
 end
 of
 the
 month,
 right?
 So,
 they


report
 on
 the
 29th
 and
 30th,
 I
 believe.


Um,


I'm


>> Isn't
 it
 Apple
 Amazon
 at
 the
 end?
 you


you
 might
 be
 right.
 Um


>> yeah,
 it's
 usually
 Google,
 Meta,


>> Meta,
 and
 Microsoft.


>> Yeah.


>> But
 regardless,
 um
 I
 guess
 dates
 not


important.
 If
 we're
 talking
 about
 the


rest
 of
 the
 month
 and
 and
 just
 earnings


in
 general,
 I
 think
 I
 think
 Google
 uh


will
 probably
 have
 the
 most
 uh
 I
 don't


know,
 Nvidia
 might
 come
 up
 with
 a


surprise,
 but
 I
 feel
 like
 Nvidia
 with


where
 they're
 at
 now,
 I
 think
 they're


unfortunately
 their
 margins
 are
 going
 to


get
 hit
 a
 little
 bit
 because
 um
 they


need
 to
 entice
 people
 to
 spend
 more.
 So,


I
 feel
 like
 they're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 uh


to
 cut
 margins
 a
 little
 bit
 to
 to
 be


able
 to
 make
 it
 a
 little
 bit
 more


affordable.
 So
 I
 think
 Google
 because
 of


their
 operating
 margin
 expansion


associated
 with
 the
 cloud
 business
 and


it's
 growing
 at
 such
 an
 alarming
 rate


comparatively
 to
 the
 rest
 of
 their
 you


know
 their
 search
 business
 and
 and


YouTube
 business
 etc.
 I
 think
 that


that's
 really
 going
 to
 help
 play
 a
 huge


impact
 to
 their
 bottom
 line
 and
 so
 um


you
 might
 not
 see
 a
 large
 topline
 growth


number
 associated
 with
 it.
 I
 still
 think


you'll
 see
 north
 of
 20%
 growth
 from


cloud.
 Um,
 but
 as
 a
 group,
 I
 don't
 think


you'll
 see,
 you
 know,
 in
 the
 20%
 range,


but
 I
 believe
 because
 of
 the
 the
 uh
 the


large
 expansive
 uh
 margins
 that
 you
 have


in
 the
 cloud
 business,
 it'll
 drag
 the


net
 income
 margin
 up
 substantially
 for


the
 entirety
 of
 the
 group.
 So,
 uh,
 now


that
 you've
 over
 the
 past
 18,
 24
 months


really
 hit
 ops
 cashache
 positive
 on
 the


cloud
 business,
 it's
 really
 just,
 um,


you
 know,
 getting
 as
 much
 in,
 uh,


revenue
 as
 you
 can
 versus
 Amazon
 and


Microsoft,
 not
 that
 they're
 in
 bad,
 uh,


you
 know,
 bad
 shape
 or
 anything
 of
 the


like,
 I
 just
 feel
 like
 they're
 they're


more
 mature
 on
 the
 cloud
 space
 and
 their


businesses
 have
 already
 kind
 of
 been
 on


that
 cycle.
 So,
 uh,
 I
 don't
 know,
 just


cautiously
 optimistic
 that
 in
 terms
 of


bottom
 line
 growth,
 not
 necessarily


stock
 performance,
 but
 actually
 company


performance,
 I
 think
 Google's
 net
 income


will
 will
 probably
 show
 up
 better
 than


than
 everybody
 else's.
 But
 I
 could
 be


humbled
 by
 um,
 Nvidia


um,
 just
 with
 how
 much
 capital


expenditure
 year-over-year
 has
 has
 been


implemented.


Steve,
 are
 you
 going
 Nvidia?


>> I
 don't
 know.
 I
 mean,
 I
 think
 Nvidia
 is


going
 to
 crush,
 but
 I
 I
 got
 something


that
 you're
 not
 going
 to
 like.
 I
 think


Microsoft's
 going
 to
 have
 a
 great


freaking
 quarter.
 I
 really
 do.


>> Okay,
 so
 let
 me
 do
 a
 poll
 for
 the
 last


three.
 So,
 the
 last
 three
 are
 Microsoft,


Apple,
 and
 Tesla.
 Still
 good
 to
 put


those
 three
 together.
 I
 mean,
 you
 So,


would
 you
 say
 Microsoft
 is
 potentially


the
 best
 one


>> out
 of
 those
 three?
 I
 think
 so.


Actually,


we'll
 do
 we'll
 do
 just
 do
 another
 four.


So,
 we'll
 do
 Microsoft,


Apple,
 Tesla,
 and
 then
 we'll
 put
 I
 don't


know,
 we'll
 put
 Google
 in
 there.


I
 mean,
 look,
 I
 think
 Microsoft
 because


they
 freaking
 uh
 started
 disclosing
 AWS


run
 rates.


That's
 not
 easy
 to
 do,
 especially
 for
 a


company
 that
 never
 did.
 I
 mean,
 the
 fact


that
 they
 were
 so
 comfortable
 doing
 that


and
 all
 these
 dude,
 some
 of
 these


startups,
 I
 I
 don't
 know
 how
 much
 you


guys
 keep
 up
 with
 the
 startup
 news,
 but


there
 was
 a
 company
 today
 that
 raised
 a


$135
 million
 seed
 round.
 Not
 series
 A,


not
 series
 B,
 seed
 round,
 and
 they're
 a


foundation
 model
 company.
 They're
 not


competing
 with
 like
 anthropic,
 but


they're
 one
 of
 these
 foundation
 model


companies
 that's
 out
 there.
 Um,
 I
 mean


the
 amount


>> speaking
 speaking
 of
 private
 companies,


did
 you
 see
 the
 headset
 or
 the
 uh
 helmet


and
 glasses
 that
 Lucker
 Pal
 uh
 polymer


lucky
 showed?


>> Did
 you
 say
 Ler?
 You
 just
 had
 an
 emit


moment.
 No,
 he
 just
 had
 a
 fullon
 emit


moment.
 You
 just
 you
 just
 committed
 an


>> Did
 you
 see
 the
 clip?


>> I
 didn't
 I
 I
 didn't
 see
 the
 clip.
 We


could
 We
 could


>> I'll
 send
 it
 to
 you.
 It
 is
 incredible


what
 they're
 building
 at
 Andre.


Incredible.


>> Lucker
 Paul
 me.
 I
 love
 it.
 Um,
 no,
 but


going
 back
 to
 your
 point,
 Steve,
 on
 this


private
 stuff,
 like
 all
 these
 private


companies,
 when
 they
 raise
 hundreds
 of


millions
 of
 dollars
 from
 VCs,
 guess


where
 they're
 going
 to?
 Amazon,
 Google,


and
 Microsoft
 to
 run
 their
 AI
 workloads.


>> Yeah.
 And
 that
 money
 is
 get
 actually


getting
 spent
 because
 it's
 freaking


capital
 they're
 raising.
 So,
 it's
 not


like
 it's
 phantom
 capital.
 Now,
 if
 those


companies
 actually
 survive
 is
 a


different
 story,
 but
 that
 doesn't
 matter


for
 freaking
 Microsoft.
 They're
 still


paying.


>> Correct.
 They
 are
 they
 they
 are
 still


paying.
 And
 so
 that
 that
 is
 something


that
 could
 be
 a
 tailwind
 as
 well
 for
 the


the
 hyperscalers.
 Here's
 the
 clip
 Steve


was
 talking
 about
 for
 Palmer
 Lucky.


>> It's
 wild.


>> This
 is
 a
 new
 product
 that
 we
 just


announced
 at
 the
 Army's
 conference


yesterday.
 We've
 been
 working
 on
 it
 for


years
 using
 our
 own
 money.
 no
 taxpayer


dollars
 were
 used
 to
 create
 it.
 Um,
 it's


called
 Eagle-Eye
 and
 it
 is
 an
 integrated


ballistic
 shell.
 So,
 you've
 got
 a


helmet.
 Um,
 you've
 got
 hearing


protection,
 you've
 got
 thermal
 sensors,


night
 sensors,
 uh,
 uh,
 signals,


intelligence
 sensors
 that
 allow
 you
 to


detect
 where
 cell
 phones
 are,
 where


radios
 are,
 see
 that
 in
 your
 view.
 It


even
 detects
 where
 gunshots
 are,
 shows


them
 exactly
 where
 they're
 placed
 and


how
 far
 they
 are.


>> So,
 this
 is
 the
 this
 is
 a
 recreation
 of


it.
 So
 this
 is


>> yeah
 this
 is
 a
 so
 this
 is
 a
 video
 feed


of
 what
 it
 is
 like
 to
 use
 the
 system.
 So


I've
 got
 the
 helmet
 on
 here
 and
 then


what
 I
 have
 is
 this
 pair
 of
 augmented


reality
 glasses.
 Um
 so
 basically
 I
 can


take
 these
 glasses


and
 I
 put
 them
 on.
 These
 sync
 with
 the


helmet
 and
 with
 these
 sensors
 so
 I
 can


for
 example
 see
 where
 my
 gun
 is


pointing.
 I
 can
 see
 where
 every
 enemy


is.
 I
 can
 see
 where
 all
 of
 my
 buddies


are.
 I
 can
 see.
 So,
 like
 there's
 a


there's
 a
 view
 that's
 coming
 up
 here


where
 you're
 gonna
 notice
 a
 drone
 picks


up
 a
 guy
 behind
 that
 container
 over


there.
 And
 what's
 gonna
 happen
 is
 when


he
 walks
 behind
 that
 container,
 I'm
 able


to
 continue
 to
 see
 where
 he
 is
 and
 what


he's
 doing.
 So,
 here's
 Ghost
 X
 is
 the


drone
 that's
 watching.
 So,
 just
 watch


for
 a
 moment.
 So,
 the
 blue
 force
 is
 my


friendlies.
 So,
 see
 that
 little
 right


hand
 corner
 where
 it
 sees
 behind
 the


containers?


>> Uhhuh.


>> They're
 tracking
 where
 the
 bad
 guy
 is.


They're
 tracking
 where
 my
 guys
 are.
 And


then
 watch
 when
 they
 go
 behind
 the


container.


>> So
 I
 can
 actually
 see
 through
 it
 and


watch.
 Now
 they're
 engaging
 the
 guy
 over


there
 and
 he's
 down.


>> Wow.


>> Imagine
 a
 guy's
 coming
 over
 a
 hill
 and
 I


want
 to
 engage
 him.
 So
 actually
 I'm


going
 to
 put
 on
 the
 mission
 shield.


There
 we
 go.


>> What?


>> So
 um
 this
 is
 a
 system
 that
 allows


everybody
 to
 basically
 be
 operating
 as


one
 one
 combined
 hive
 mind
 where
 you
 can


all
 share
 a
 view
 of
 the
 world.
 And
 by


the
 way,
 this
 view
 that
 I
 have,
 it's


shared
 now
 with
 all
 of
 the
 robots
 as


well.
 So
 all
 the
 anything
 I
 see,
 like


let's
 say
 I
 see
 someone
 inside
 of
 a


building.
 Every
 drone
 and
 every
 person


now
 sees
 that
 person
 where
 he
 is.


>> All right.
 So
 what
 is
 it
 going
 to
 500


billion?
 Where's
 where's
 Andrew
 going?


>> I
 gotta
 tell
 you
 what
 they're
 building


is
 incredible.
 And
 if
 this
 company
 goes


public
 anytime
 soon,
 I
 got
 it's
 gonna
 be


bigger
 than
 LED.


>> Did
 you
 just
 say
 Led?


>> Did
 you
 just
 say
 Led?
 No.
 No.
 No.
 All


right,
 everybody.
 Have
 a
 good
 day.


>> Everyone
 heard
 that,
 right?


>> He
 just
 said
 Led.
 It
 is
 Led
 Martin.
 Yes,


>> Mr.
 Milkman.


>> Been
 a
 long
 day.
 Um,
 it'll
 be
 bigger


than
 them.
 It
 would
 be
 bigger
 than


Boeing.
 I
 mean,
 this
 will
 probably
 be


half
 a
 trillion
 dollar
 company.


I
 I
 don't
 even
 know
 what
 to
 say.
 That


shit's
 wild.
 It's
 some
 Call
 of
 Duty


[ __ ]


>> Yeah,
 they're
 going
 to
 get
 like
 they're


going
 to
 be
 the
 sole
 supplier
 for
 the


military
 with
 all
 this
 new
 tech.
 And


then
 when
 you
 add,
 you
 know,
 they're


working
 with
 Palunteer.
 I
 mean,
 this
 is


going
 to
 have
 huge
 implications
 for


Palanteer
 eventually.


>> So,


uh,
 I
 want
 to
 talk
 about
 Andre
 every


day.
 If
 Steve's
 gonna
 mess
 up
 this
 much


on
 words,
 I
 mean,
 let's
 do
 this
 every


freaking
 day.
 That
 would
 be


>> I
 freaking
 I
 love
 Androl.


>> Look,
 here's
 the
 thing.
 So,
 uh,
 so
 I
 I


know
 I
 know
 one
 person
 in
 the
 chat,
 our


boy
 Douggee,
 he
 he
 has
 a
 $50,000


investment.
 I
 think
 he
 got
 in
 at
 20


billion.
 Doug,
 correct
 me
 if
 I'm
 wrong.


>> Is
 Douggee
 in
 the
 chat?


>> Douggee
 is
 in
 the
 chat
 and
 he


>> ask
 him
 how
 confidence
 was
 because
 he


said
 he
 started
 watching
 it
 last
 night.


>> Doug,
 let
 us
 know
 how
 confidence
 was,


but
 uh
 I
 mean,
 put
 in
 the
 chat
 if
 you


have
 any
 exposure
 it
 like
 directly
 or


through
 an
 SPV.
 Don't
 tell
 me
 Kraken


Robotics.
 I
 know
 that's
 like
 the
 only


OTC
 way,
 but
 outside
 of
 that,
 like
 is


anyone
 else
 having
 exposure
 to
 it?
 And
 I


mean,
 Steve
 says
 half
 a
 trillion.
 Matt,


are
 you
 buying
 day
 one
 when
 they
 go


public
 regardless
 of
 valuation?


>> I
 don't
 know
 about
 regardless
 of


valuation.
 That
 might
 be
 tough.
 Um


maybe
 a
 little
 just
 just
 because
 of
 what


they're
 doing
 and
 I
 support
 it.
 Um
 you


know,
 kind
 of
 like
 with
 Palunteer,


right?
 I
 support
 the
 mission.
 I
 support


the
 vision.
 So,
 I
 mean,
 I
 feel
 like
 in


that
 respect,
 I
 feel
 like
 even
 if
 it


loses
 money,
 quote
 unquote,
 you
 know,
 if


you're
 thinking
 about
 market
 cap


irrelevancy,


then
 I
 feel
 like
 I
 have
 to
 at least
 get


involved
 somehow.
 Uh,
 but
 even
 still,
 it


it
 might
 be
 just
 one
 of
 those
 things


that
 trades
 at
 a
 such
 a
 premium


valuation
 regardless
 of
 whatever
 it
 is,


just
 based
 off
 the
 fact
 that
 it
 at
 the


moment
 looks
 like
 it's
 going
 to
 be


bigger
 than
 the
 key.


I
 think
 that
 Andrew
 could
 pull
 a


snowflake
 and
 have
 a
 ridiculous
 pop


right
 out
 of
 the
 gate
 and
 start
 to


teeter
 off
 maybe.


>> But
 this
 is
 something
 I
 want
 to
 own


regardless
 of
 valuation
 if
 it's
 a
 crazy


valuation
 that
 doesn't
 make
 sense.


>> So
 they
 just
 raised
 that
 like
 40


billion.
 What's
 crazy
 for
 them
 going


public?
 I
 mean
 without
 knowing
 the


numbers,
 what
 do
 you
 think
 could
 be


crazy?


>> I
 mean
 if
 they
 just
 raised
 at
 40,
 if


they
 go
 public
 at
 100,
 that
 would


probably
 be
 a
 little
 crazy.
 No,
 but
 that


would
 be
 do
 the
 investor
 the
 VCs
 would


expect
 them
 to
 go
 100.
 So
 that
 I
 don't


think
 I
 think
 15
 to
 200
 crazy.


>> I
 don't
 know.


>> At
 100
 I'd
 be
 buying
 in


>> at
 100.
 I
 think
 everyone
 wants
 in
 to
 be


honest.


>> My
 fear
 is
 that
 it's
 going to
 be
 north


of
 100.
 My
 fear
 is
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 like


300
 400.


>> Okay.
 Well,
 here's
 the
 other
 concern


about
 uh
 I
 was
 about
 to
 say
 Lita
 about


um
 Andre.
 What
 if
 their
 margins
 suck?
 At


the
 end
 of
 the
 day,
 they
 sell
 hardware,


right?
 So,
 if
 we're
 talking
 about


business,
 like
 what
 if
 they're
 just
 not


pro
 or
 they
 go
 public
 and
 it's,
 you


know,
 they
 say
 we're
 going
 to
 be


profitable
 in
 a
 few
 years,
 but
 then
 they


turn
 a
 profit
 and
 it's
 not
 like
 a


pounder
 type
 of
 profit
 with
 60%
 free


cash
 flow
 margins.
 It's
 it's
 a
 profit,


but
 like
 are
 is
 that
 a
 concern
 at
 all?


>> You
 know
 what
 the
 you
 know
 what
 the
 good


part
 about
 them
 selling
 hardware
 is?
 You


sell
 hardware
 to
 the
 military
 that's


beating
 up
 the
 hardware
 has
 to


continuously
 spend
 more
 and
 buy
 more.
 So


all
 the
 drones
 that
 they're
 going
 to
 be


selling
 eventually
 they're
 gonna
 have
 to


be
 keep
 selling
 more.
 How
 much
 get


banged
 up.
 So


>> the
 defense
 budget
 continues
 to
 grow.


What's
 the
 defense
 budget
 at
 now?
 900


billion,


>> I
 believe.
 So


>> and
 then
 they're
 going
 to
 keep
 coming
 up


with
 new
 stuff.
 They're
 going
 to
 keep


innovating
 and
 the
 US
 government
 is


going
 to
 keep
 spending
 more.
 The
 allies


are
 going
 to
 spend
 more.
 So
 they
 already


have
 a
 built-in
 audience
 where


one
 way
 to
 grow.


>> My
 question
 is
 who
 the
 hell
 do
 you
 need


to
 short?
 I
 mean,
 I
 just
 don't


understand
 like
 if
 these
 guys
 enter
 the


chat,
 like
 why
 would
 you
 ever
 I
 mean,
 I


know
 you
 need
 to
 have
 separate
 contracts


for,
 you
 know,
 the
 fact
 that
 you
 you


need
 multiple
 contractors,
 etc.,
 because


you
 can't
 be
 reliant
 upon
 one,
 you
 know,


like
 I
 get
 that.
 That's
 just
 like
 a


security
 thing.
 But
 you
 I
 feel
 like


these
 guys
 are
 going
 to
 have
 to
 steal
 so


much
 market
 share
 from
 everybody
 else.


>> They'll
 steal
 market
 share
 from
 who?


Raia,
 Northward,
 Grumman,
 Lheed,


there'll
 probably
 be
 a
 little
 bit
 from


everybody
 they're
 going
 to
 steal.


>> Yeah.


>> Yeah.
 No,
 I
 think
 that's
 fair.
 I
 think


this
 will
 be
 the
 most
 anticipated
 IPO
 in


uh
 in
 history.
 Well,
 let's
 transition
 to


this
 topic
 real
 quick.
 Um
 you
 I
 know


Steve
 loves
 Salesforce.
 I
 don't
 know if


Matt,
 you're
 a
 big
 fan
 of
 Salesforce,


and
 we
 already
 talked
 about
 the
 new


numbers
 and
 the
 60
 billion
 guidance,
 but


Steve,
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 you
 saw
 this


headline,
 Matt,
 I
 don't know
 if
 you
 saw


it
 either.
 Uh
 Mark
 Benov
 sword
 he's


getting
 sued.


>> No,
 that
 that
 that's
 not
 even
 the
 juicy


headline.
 Mark
 Ben
 off
 two
 days
 ago
 said


the
 National
 Guard
 Trump
 should
 send
 him


to
 San
 Francisco.


>> Yeah,
 I
 saw
 it.


>> 45
 minutes
 ago,
 he
 apologized
 for
 saying


Trump
 should
 send
 the
 National
 Guard
 to


San
 Francisco.


>> Oh
 god.


>> I
 mean,
 what's
 he
 gonna
 say?
 He
 was
 What


did
 he
 say?
 He
 was
 under
 duress.
 Like,


come
 on.
 I
 don't
 have
 the
 exact
 quote,


but
 we
 do
 have
 the
 headline.
 I
 don't


think
 this
 guy
 really
 has
 a
 backbone.


>> I
 You
 said
 it.
 You
 You
 literally
 took


the
 words
 right
 out
 of
 my
 mouth.


>> You
 did.


>> I
 I
 I
 have
 respect
 for
 the
 company
 he's


built.
 He's
 much
 more
 successful
 than


me,
 but
 one
 of the
 reasons
 people
 love


Alex
 Karp
 is
 because
 when
 he
 says


something,
 he
 really
 means
 what
 he
 says.


I
 mean,
 Steve,
 does
 I
 know
 you
 love
 the


numbers
 on
 Salesforce,
 but
 does
 this


give
 you
 any
 pause
 of
 just
 like,
 do
 I


really
 want
 to
 trust
 this
 guy
 over
 the


next
 five
 years
 or


>> It
 just
 makes
 me
 more
 mad
 at
 Benny
 off


just
 as
 what
 he
 says
 in
 public,
 but
 you


know,
 first
 taking
 shots
 of
 Palunteer.
 I


mean,
 I
 didn't
 like
 that.
 Now
 saying


this,
 then
 backtracking
 on
 I
 don't
 like


that.
 I
 mean,
 do
 my
 philosophy
 on


Salesforce
 has
 always
 been
 I
 don't
 care


what
 everybody's
 opinion
 about
 the


software
 is
 because
 everybody
 can
 think


that
 the
 software
 sucks.
 The
 bottom
 line


is
 the
 company
 still
 freaking
 grows
 and


everybody
 still
 using
 it.
 So,
 it
 can't


suck
 that
 bad
 if
 everybody
 keeps
 using


it
 and
 they
 keep
 growing.
 So,
 the


numbers
 make
 a
 really
 compelling


argument
 that
 it's
 undervalued.
 I'm
 just


annoyed
 with
 how
 he
 is
 handling
 himself


in
 public.


I
 I
 you
 know
 I
 I
 want
 to
 take
 a
 I
 don't


want
 to
 say
 contraria
 opinion.
 I
 think


people
 know
 if
 they
 watch
 my
 Twitter


feed
 um
 you
 know
 who
 I'm
 supporting
 when


it
 comes
 to
 the
 AI
 race
 and
 I
 think
 that


Salesforce
 is
 floundering
 here.
 But
 like


I
 was
 initially
 thinking
 I
 was
 like
 well


I
 mean
 why
 does
 Mark
 feel
 like
 he


doesn't
 have
 the
 ability
 to
 to
 stand
 on


his
 ground,
 right?
 Like
 I
 think
 you
 said


the
 word
 limit
 like
 he
 doesn't
 have
 a


backbone.
 Like
 I
 was
 like
 surely
 he
 has


enough
 of
 Salesforce
 where
 you
 know
 he


can
 do
 exactly
 how
 Karp
 and
 and


everybody
 else
 it
 seems
 like
 a
 Palanteer


operates
 but
 I
 just
 looked
 he
 only
 owns


like
 two
 and
 a
 half%
 of
 Salesforce


>> really.
 Yeah.
 Like
 I
 assumed
 he
 owned


way
 more.
 So
 like
 when
 when
 I
 feel
 like


the
 reason
 why
 I
 feel
 like
 Carb
 can
 say


whatever
 the
 hell
 he
 wants
 is
 because
 he


literally
 is
 Palanteer
 and
 he
 has
 those


class
 F
 shares.
 Yeah.
 But
 now
 that
 I'm


thinking
 about
 it,
 I'm
 like
 because
 I


was
 like,
 why
 does
 Mark
 feel
 like
 he


needs
 to
 appeal
 to
 the
 masses
 and
 be
 on


boggy
 water,
 you
 know,
 or
 boggy
 like


land
 and
 and
 you
 know,
 but
 I
 guess
 if


you
 only
 own
 two
 and
 a
 half%,
 you're


your
 head
 can
 kind
 of
 be
 on
 the
 chopping


block
 whenever
 the
 hell
 you
 want,
 even


though
 you're
 the
 co-founder,
 like
 you


really
 don't
 have
 as
 much
 control
 maybe.


So
 I
 I
 I
 it
 gives
 me
 a
 whole
 another


perspective.
 Like
 I
 feel
 like
 he's


scared
 for
 his
 company.
 like
 I
 feel
 like


he's
 g
 he
 feels
 like
 he's
 going
 to
 lose


it
 because
 of
 what's
 going
 on
 with


Palunteer
 and
 and
 and
 how
 he's
 behind


and
 um
 so
 I
 don't
 know
 it
 just
 seems


like
 he's
 just
 every
 time
 he
 goes
 on
 the


news
 he
 just
 seems
 so
 frantic
 and
 like


you
 said
 he's
 built
 a
 phenomenal
 company


you
 know
 co-founder
 and
 he's
 done
 a


great
 job
 but
 it
 just
 seems
 like
 he


well
 another
 another
 headline
 another


headline
 today
 was
 Salesforce
 says
 they


are
 ready
 to
 work
 with
 the
 US
 government


on
 immigration
 services.
 So,
 I
 thought


these
 headlines
 were
 insane
 because
 Ben


off,
 you
 know,
 historically
 has
 been


super
 super
 to
 the
 left.
 One
 could
 argue


that
 the
 Trump
 administration
 policies


on
 immigration
 are
 much
 more


right-leaning.
 Uh,
 and
 so
 Salesforce
 is


saying,
 hey,
 with
 Mission
 Force,
 which


is
 their
 new
 kind
 of
 government
 suite
 of


products,
 we
 are
 ready
 to
 help
 ICE.


Pounder
 gets
 a
 lot
 of
 [ __ ]
 for
 working


with
 ICE.
 And
 then
 now
 he
 says
 he


apologizes
 for
 saying
 Trump
 should
 send


the
 National
 Guard.
 So,
 I
 think
 you're


just
 getting
 wishy-washy
 everywhere.
 And


it's
 tough
 sometimes
 as
 a
 shareholder
 to


want
 to
 be
 part
 of
 that
 type
 of
 story.


Um,
 this
 is
 a
 quick
 clip
 right
 here
 of


Karp
 actually
 being
 asked
 about
 if
 he


believes
 what
 he
 says
 and
 this
 was
 his


response.


>> A
 personal
 question
 actually
 as
 I
 was


was
 as
 I
 was
 watching
 you


u
 give
 this
 amazing
 amazing
 answer.
 I


thought
 to
 myself,
 do
 you
 ever
 worry


about
 what
 you're
 saying?


No,
 I
 mean
 I
 mean
 this
 genuinely.
 I


mean,
 have
 you
 ever
 walked
 off
 a
 stage


and
 say,
 "I
 shouldn't
 have
 said
 that."


>> Because
 you
 have
 a
 remarkable
 confidence


and
 I
 I
 was
 actually
 thinking
 even
 when


we
 first
 started
 doing,
 you
 know,
 doing


interviews
 probably
 back
 in
 2010,


you
 would
 say


pretty
 provocative
 stuff.


>> I
 mean,
 where's
 that
 come
 from?


>> I
 don't
 uh
 I
 don't
 know
 once
 I
 get
 going


exactly
 where
 it's
 going
 to
 go.
 Um,
 I


I'll
 tell
 you
 what's
 really
 funny


because
 I
 I
 I
 barely
 go
 out,
 especially


now.
 It's
 actually
 great
 as
 an
 introvert


once
 you're
 famous
 because
 you're
 like,


I
 just
 can't
 go
 out.
 Too
 many
 people


know
 me.
 I
 got
 to
 stay
 home.
 Can't
 go


out.
 Security
 reasons.
 I
 can't
 do


anything.
 Uh,
 but
 whenever
 I
 on
 occasion


go
 out
 and
 I
 meet
 people,
 they're
 like,


wait
 a
 minute,
 that's
 not
 an
 act.
 Like


people
 are
 like
 they,
 you
 know,
 people


who
 work
 with
 me
 closely
 are
 like,
 "No,


no,
 no.
 It's
 full-time.


We're
 we're
 taking
 days
 off."
 Um,
 and


uh,
 but
 um,
 I
 don't
 like
 like
 honestly
 I


really
 don't
 like
 offending
 people,
 but


sometimes
 it's
 necessary.
 And
 uh,
 I


don't
 really
 I
 really
 don't
 I
 feel
 like


I
 feel
 I
 do
 I
 do
 like
 legitimately
 kind


of
 afterwards
 I'm
 like,
 well
 god
 I
 you


know
 like
 um,
 somebody
 was
 visiting
 the


office
 and
 they
 were
 kind
 of
 at
 you
 know


I
 was
 making
 fun
 of
 a
 lame
 company
 they


happened
 to
 work
 at
 and
 I
 didn't
 know


they
 were
 external.
 I
 felt
 a
 little
 bad


about
 that
 honestly.
 But
 then
 I
 thought,


well,
 God,
 someone's
 got
 to
 tell
 this


person
 got
 to
 get
 out,
 you
 know?
 It's


like
 this
 is
 like
 easier
 life,
 you
 know?


They're
 like
 monetizing.
 It's
 like
 the


Matrix,
 you
 know.
 And
 uh
 um


uh
 uh
 I
 believe
 what
 I'm
 saying.
 And
 I


And
 you


>> always
 like
 this
 though.
 Um,


I
 I'm
 actually
 very
 introverted
 and
 I


was
 I
 I
 am
 kind
 of
 shy,
 but
 if
 you
 put


me
 if
 you
 like
 put
 me
 on
 stage
 and
 ask


me
 a
 question,


>> then
 uh


>> Okay.


>> But
 I
 I
 don't
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 I
 don't


want
 to
 intentionally
 make
 people
 like
 I


I
 felt
 bad
 that
 I
 like
 but
 I
 would
 felt


much
 worse
 if
 it
 wasn't
 true.


Um,


and
 uh,
 I
 genuinely
 believe
 what
 I'm


saying
 and
 I
 would,
 you
 know,
 of
 course,


if
 you're
 talking
 saying
 a
 lot
 of


things,
 you're
 not
 you're
 going to
 mess


up,
 but
 I
 think
 people
 understand
 the


intent
 of
 what
 I'm
 saying.
 And
 uh,
 and
 I


would
 say
 I'll
 tell
 you
 one
 of the
 great


things
 about
 this
 country.
 people


especially
 who've
 joined
 Palunteer
 or


were
 at
 Palanteer
 or
 invested
 in


Palanteer,
 they
 know
 I'm
 fighting
 for


them
 and
 our
 country
 and
 they're
 willing


to
 see
 the
 better
 side
 of
 what
 I'm


saying
 because
 they
 that
 that
 part
 is


true.
 And
 if
 people
 know
 that,
 they're


willing
 to.
 It's
 like
 in
 any


relationship,
 if
 like
 somebody
 knows
 you


actually
 care,
 maybe
 they
 forgive


certain
 foibless,


>> just
 a
 different
 person
 that's
 running


Palanteer
 versus
 some
 of
 the
 other


assassin.


>> But
 I
 think
 he
 said
 it
 perfectly
 well
 at


the
 right
 end,
 right?
 Like
 as
 long
 as


people
 know
 where
 you're
 going
 and
 you


have
 like
 your
 true
 blue
 to
 your
 mission


and
 and
 you
 are
 very
 one
 directional
 in


that
 and
 you
 don't
 waver
 then
 yeah
 you


can
 steer
 off
 like
 from
 time
 to
 time
 but


people
 know
 where
 you're
 headed
 right
 so


like
 yeah
 you
 might
 say
 something
 here


it's
 like
 but
 I
 still
 got
 to
 follow
 the


guy
 like
 I
 don't
 agree
 with
 him
 on
 that


but
 I
 agree
 with
 where
 we're
 going
 so


put
 that
 aside
 we're
 still
 headed
 to
 the


start
 but
 uh
 we
 lost
 hot
 Steve
 but
 I
 if


uh


If
 you're
 like
 Beni
 off,
 like
 you
 said,


like
 if
 you're
 not
 supporting
 this
 week,


you're
 supporting
 this
 week,
 and
 you're


going
 back
 and
 forth,
 it's
 it's
 it's


tough
 to
 get
 behind
 somebody
 like
 that


and
 truly
 build
 momentum.
 Um,


>> yeah,
 I
 agree.


I
 would
 agree.


Um,


all
 right.
 So,
 uh,
 well,
 I'll
 get
 a
 text


from
 Steve
 and
 we'll
 see
 if
 he's
 done


for
 the
 day.
 He
 might
 be
 probably
 just


pulled
 into
 his
 his
 driveway.
 Um,


I
 think
 that's
 pretty
 much
 it
 for
 us,


guys.
 I
 want
 to
 play
 one
 more
 clip
 that


I
 just
 found.
 Uh,
 Andre
 Karpathy
 just


did
 a
 interview.
 Uh,
 he's
 one
 of the


biggest
 guys
 in
 AI.
 Here's
 a
 45se


secondond
 clip
 about
 what
 he
 said
 about


Sam
 Alman.
 We'll
 analyze
 this
 more
 on


Monday,
 but
 this
 clip
 just
 popped
 up
 and


thought
 this
 would
 be
 quite
 interesting


>> that
 you've
 just
 mentioned.
 It's
 the


decade
 of
 agents.
 That's
 actually
 a


reaction
 to
 an
 existing
 pre-existing


quote
 I
 should
 say
 where
 I
 think
 a
 lot


of
 some
 of
 the
 labs
 I'm
 not
 actually


sure
 who
 said
 this
 but
 they
 were


alluding
 to
 this
 being
 the
 year
 of


agents


>> uh
 with
 respect
 to
 LLMs
 and
 uh
 how
 they


were
 going
 to
 evolve
 and
 I
 think
 um


>> I
 was
 triggered
 by
 that
 because
 I
 feel


like
 there's
 some
 overpredictions
 going


on
 in
 the
 industry
 and
 uh
 in
 my
 mind


this
 is
 really
 a
 lot
 more
 accurately


described
 as
 the
 decade
 of
 agents
 and
 we


have
 some
 very
 early
 agents
 that
 are


actually
 like
 extremely
 impressive
 and


that
 I
 use
 daily
 uh
 you
 know
 claude
 and


codeex
 and
 so
 on
 but
 I
 still
 feel
 like


there's
 uh
 so
 much
 work
 to
 be
 done
 and


so
 I
 think
 my
 like
 my
 reaction
 is
 like


we'll
 be
 working
 with
 these
 things
 for
 a


decade
 they're
 going
 to
 get
 better
 uh


and
 uh
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 wonderful
 but
 I


think
 I
 was
 just
 reacting
 to
 the


timelines
 I
 suppose
 of
 the
 of
 the
 uh


implication
 at
 you
 so
 he's
 basically


calling
 out
 Sam
 Alman
 right
 there
 saying


that
 this
 is
 going
 to
 happen
 sooner
 than


expected
 and
 and
 by
 the
 way
 the
 other


piece
 of
 news
 right
 here
 on
 OpenAI
 just


a
 quick
 headline
 from
 Deutsche
 Bank
 uh


Europeans
 aren't
 paying
 for
 Chachi
 BT
 so


flagship
 ship
 product
 of
 the
 AI


industry.
 Chat
 GBT
 is
 facing
 a
 major


challenge
 in
 growth
 in
 paying
 users


across
 Europe.
 OpenAI's
 corporate


valuation
 has
 reached
 500
 billion


approaching
 Netflix's
 market
 cap.
 Yet,


its
 revenue
 scale
 and
 paid
 subscriber


base
 are
 far
 behind.
 Uh
 Deutsche
 Bank


also
 said
 there's
 no
 doubt
 AI
 will


change
 the
 world
 and
 boost
 productivity,


but
 the
 path
 to
 profitability
 remains


unclear.
 The
 real
 challenge
 isn't
 the


algorithm,
 it's
 the
 business
 model.


Essentially,
 as
 you
 can
 see
 right
 here


on
 the
 chart,
 uh
 this
 is
 only
 Europe.


This
 is
 not
 North
 America,
 but
 compared


to
 Netflix
 and
 Spotify,
 which
 are
 other


massive
 consumer
 products,
 Europeans
 are


not
 paying
 as
 much
 for
 chat.
 So,
 I
 think


in
 general,
 you
 know,
 that's
 something


that
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 see
 over


this
 whole
 AI
 capex
 life
 cycle
 of
 is


there
 an
 ROI,
 which
 I
 don't
 think
 any
 of


us
 fully
 can
 say
 there
 will
 be
 yet,
 but


if
 it's
 not,
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 issues.


Hopefully,
 it
 does
 happen
 and
 as
 a


result,
 these
 companies
 can
 continue
 to


expand.


All
 right,
 that
 is
 what
 we
 got
 today,


folks.
 Uh
 I
 don't
 think
 Steve's
 probably


coming
 back.
 He's
 Yeah,
 he
 just
 pulled


into
 the
 garage.
 So,
 uh
 he'll
 be


streaming
 on
 Saturday,
 tomorrow.
 So,
 for


those
 that
 want
 to
 get
 some
 more
 of
 the


Milkman,
 he'll
 be
 live
 tomorrow.
 Matt


Money,
 I'm
 putting
 his
 YouTube


description


or
 YouTube
 link
 in
 the
 channel.
 Matt,


thanks
 for
 coming
 on,
 man.
 We
 appreciate


it.


>> Thank
 you.
 No.
 Yeah,
 it
 was
 always
 good


to
 to
 hang
 out
 and
 uh
 I
 wasn't
 bogged


down
 on
 on
 uh
 office
 work.
 So,
 uh
 just


happened
 to
 uh
 have
 the
 opportunity.
 So,


appreciate
 you
 having
 me
 on.


>> Have
 you
 have
 you
 uh
 I
 mean
 I
 didn't
 ask


you
 this,
 but
 when
 Rocket
 Lab
 hit
 73,


like
 did
 you
 just
 take
 a
 moment
 to


yourself
 and
 look
 back
 and
 be
 like,


damn,
 like
 you
 know,
 it's
 it
 it
 really


did
 happen.
 You
 called
 this
 thing
 at
 $4


and
 almost
 at
 100


or
 is
 it
 kind
 of


>> It's
 I
 was
 actually
 thinking
 about
 that,


dude.
 Like
 how
 wild
 has
 this
 has
 this


been,
 dude?
 Like
 I
 I
 literally
 was


thinking
 about
 I
 was
 just
 like,
 dude,


even


it
 was
 a
 very
 humbling
 moment.
 I
 was


sitting
 I
 don't
 know
 where
 it
 was.
 was
 I


don't
 know if
 it
 was
 on
 the
 couch
 or
 if


I
 was
 laying
 in
 bed
 or
 whatever,
 but
 of


course
 I
 was
 thinking
 about
 you
 and
 uh


no
 the
 the
 and
 just
 like
 I
 was
 like
 how


wild
 has
 this
 been
 like
 how
 well
 we've


been
 able
 to
 choose
 these
 f


foundationally
 phenomenal
 companies
 that


have
 been
 like
 you
 know
 what
 this
 is


going
 to
 be
 a
 great
 organization
 and
 we


can
 see
 the
 future
 potential
 in
 this
 and


we
 have
 the
 conviction
 we
 need
 to
 get


behind
 it
 and
 I
 was
 like
 how
 awesome
 has


it
 been
 that
 you've
 been
 able
 to
 do
 so


and
 we
 were
 able
 to
 find
 each
 other


through
 PAL
 volunteer
 because
 of
 our


conviction
 in
 that.
 And
 then
 you
 were


able
 to
 find
 something
 like
 Robin
 Hood.


Uh
 I
 was
 able
 to
 find
 something
 like


Rocket
 Lab.
 Like
 it
 just
 goes
 to
 show


that
 if
 you
 truly
 put
 in
 the
 due


diligence
 and
 think
 about
 it
 like
 how


awesome
 it
 is.
 Um
 but
 yeah,
 like
 it
 was


a
 very
 interesting


>> that's
 a
 that's
 an
 important
 point


because
 we
 both
 found
 Pounder,
 but
 then


we
 went
 in
 different
 directions
 to
 find


our
 next
 stock.
 And
 just
 I
 think
 for
 us


as
 creators,
 it's
 really
 important
 to


kind
 of
 say,
 hey,
 it's
 not
 just
 a
 one


and
 done.
 like
 there's
 an
 ability
 to


kind
 of
 analyze
 companies
 and
 hopefully


find
 some
 diamonds
 in
 the
 rough
 and
 with


Rocket
 Lab
 and
 Hood
 it
 is
 a
 pretty


incredible
 journey
 to
 like
 be
 able
 to


get
 that
 second
 one.


>> Yeah.
 And
 and
 I
 think
 both
 of
 them
 have


great
 stories,
 right?
 Like
 Robin
 Hood,


who
 who
 would
 have
 thought
 that
 wasn't


going
 to
 be
 successful?
 Like
 in


retrospect,
 it's
 like
 dude,
 it
 was


inevitable,
 right?
 And
 I've
 been
 using


Robin
 Hood
 since
 like
 2014.


>> Yeah.


>> Like
 if
 you
 think
 about
 it,
 I
 had
 the


I've
 had
 the
 app
 on
 my
 phone
 forever.


Um,
 so
 it's
 it's
 insane
 to
 to
 think
 like


what
 what
 would
 have
 gave
 me
 pause
 and
 I


think
 it
 really
 was
 the
 narrative
 around


what
 happened
 during
 COVID
 and
 uh
 and
 in


with
 GameStop
 and
 everything
 like
 that.


But
 I
 think
 that
 that
 painted
 such
 a


narrative
 negative
 a
 negative
 narrative


for
 quite
 some
 time
 that
 um
 but
 anyway


it's
 just
 so
 I
 was
 I
 did
 have
 that


reflection
 a
 couple
 days
 ago
 like
 holy


crap
 like
 it's
 obviously
 grown
 to
 way


bigger
 than
 I
 was
 expecting
 way
 faster


than
 I
 was
 expecting
 but
 just
 like


Palunteer
 like
 you
 get
 involved
 and
 you


see
 a
 vision
 but
 then
 you
 find
 out
 more


as
 the
 as
 the
 founders
 kind
 of
 come
 up


to
 okay
 well
 we
 delivered
 on
 that
 this


is
 where
 we're
 going
 next
 and
 So,
 you


wait
 for
 the
 second
 the
 second
 act
 or


the
 third
 act
 or
 the
 fourth
 act
 of
 what


whatever
 they're
 working
 on.
 And
 so,
 it


it
 gives
 you
 thought
 um


and
 uh
 but
 yeah,
 it's
 it's
 definitely


been
 interesting.
 It's
 definitely
 made


me
 think
 about


um
 my
 my
 future
 goals
 and
 um
 it's


definitely
 given
 me
 a
 different


perspective
 on
 it's
 honestly
 it's
 given


me
 an
 I
 don't know
 if
 I
 told
 you
 this,


maybe
 I
 shouldn't
 say
 this
 in
 four
 to


four
 or
 5,000
 people.
 It's
 giving
 me
 an


existential
 crisis
 about
 like
 what
 the


hell
 am
 I
 doing
 with
 the
 rest
 of
 my
 life


and
 figuring
 out
 like
 am
 I
 focusing
 on


should
 I
 continue
 to
 focus
 on
 the


market?
 Should
 I
 just
 like
 go
 lay
 on
 a


beach
 for
 a
 couple
 years?
 Like
 what


should
 I
 do?
 Um
 but
 in
 the
 meantime
 I'm


still
 clocking
 in
 9
 to5
 Monday
 through


Friday.


>> Are
 you
 are
 you
 getting
 the
 the
 the


drive
 to
 find
 the
 next
 Rocket
 Lab
 and


you
 think
 the
 the
 the
 nineto-5
 is
 taking


away
 the
 opportunity
 to
 focus
 on
 that?


>> No,
 the
 nineto-ive
 isn't
 taking
 away.
 I


mean,
 I
 still
 get
 the
 time
 to
 to
 kind
 of


do
 the
 research,
 chat
 with
 you
 guys.
 I


able
 to
 chat
 with
 Chris
 and
 come
 up
 with


ideas
 back
 and
 forth.
 Uh,
 so
 I
 feel
 like


it's
 not
 taking
 away
 too
 much
 as
 of
 yet,


and
 I
 still
 really
 enjoy
 what
 I
 do
 9


to5.
 Uh,
 for
 people
 that
 don't
 know,
 I
 I


work
 at
 an
 oil
 and
 gas
 company
 and
 um
 do


some
 management
 of
 of
 some
 of
 our


assets.
 So,
 um,
 so
 yeah,
 it's
 it's
 it's


a
 really
 fun
 job
 to
 kind
 of
 know
 where


all
 the
 barrels
 are
 and
 everything
 like


that.
 But,
 um,


but
 yeah,
 it
 kind
 of
 is
 just


interesting.
 It's
 like,
 could
 I
 maybe


live
 a
 different
 lifestyle?
 And
 that's


where
 I'm
 kind
 of
 like,
 you
 know,
 I
 I
 I


don't
 mind
 working
 and
 doing
 what
 I'm


doing,
 but
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 being
 your


own
 boss
 and
 figuring
 out,
 am
 I
 holding


myself
 back
 by
 working
 for
 this
 company


instead
 of
 potentially
 doing
 other


things?
 Could
 I
 be
 helping
 more
 people?


I
 think
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day,
 like


could
 I
 like
 how
 many
 people
 have
 you


met
 that
 have
 been
 their
 lives
 changed


by
 Hood
 or
 Rocket
 Lab
 or
 whatever
 that


you
 met
 in
 Miami
 or
 just
 on
 your
 YouTube


channel
 or
 whatever?
 And
 it's
 just
 like


could
 I
 be
 doing
 more
 of
 that?
 And


>> that's
 what
 I'm
 kind
 of
 like
 in
 terms
 of


like
 I've
 done
 well
 enough
 for
 myself


now
 I'm
 starting
 to
 think
 about
 the


others
 in
 which
 I
 impact
 with.
 Um
 and


it's
 just
 like
 could
 I
 potentially
 be


really
 being
 selfish
 by
 not
 helping


others.
 Um
 and
 it's
 because
 of
 my


insecurity
 about
 say
 money
 running
 out


or
 something
 like
 that.
 um
 a
 million


different
 things,
 right?


>> Yeah.
 Um
 so
 that's
 a
 kind
 of
 like
 an


existential
 crisis
 that
 I'm
 uh
 dealing


with
 right
 now.
 But
 it's
 a
 bad
 thing.


It's
 a
 situation
 of
 of
 of
 good,
 not
 a


situation
 of
 bad.
 So
 it's
 not
 like
 I'm


sitting
 here.
 Um
 uh


Steve,
 we're
 about
 to
 end
 it
 out.
 We


were
 having
 a
 deep
 conversation.
 You're


going
 to
 come
 talk
 to
 us
 about
 milk,


bro.
 You're
 ruining
 it.


>> I
 got
 my
 special
 Coca-Cola
 cup.


>> I'm
 not
 even
 kidding.
 Look
 at
 this


thing,


>> dude.
 That
 thing's


>> It's
 so
 dope.


>> Sick,


>> bro.
 Do
 you
 have
 a
 crushed
 ice?
 Do
 you


have
 crushed
 ice?
 What
 do
 we
 do?


>> You
 want
 me
 to
 go
 get
 some
 ice
 and
 drop


it
 in
 so
 you
 can
 hear
 what
 it
 sounds


like?


>> Yeah.
 I
 want
 to
 see
 that.


>> We're
 having
 an
 existential
 conversation


now.
 I'm
 talking
 about
 stupid
 ice.


>> Right
 back.
 It
 sounds
 so
 crazy.
 Hold
 on.


>> He's
 not
 wearing
 pants.
 It's
 going
 to


show
 off
 his
 camera.


He's
 probably
 gonna
 come
 back
 with
 a


drinkable
 yogurt,
 too.
 Guy's
 an
 animal.


I
 love
 it.


>> No,
 but
 but but
 it
 is
 a
 good
 point
 and


like
 Yeah,
 I
 think
 you
 know,
 calling
 a


name
 like
 that
 can
 really
 change
 your


life.
 I
 mean,
 all
 of
 us
 in
 the
 chat
 have


experienced
 if
 you
 if
 you
 really
 were


there
 from
 the
 early
 days
 and
 then
 you


experience
 a
 10
 or
 20.
 Rock
 Labs
 what


four
 to
 60
 is
 12x
 or
 something
 like


that,
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 than
 that.
 Like


when
 you
 experience
 that,
 it
 changes


your
 life
 financially,
 but
 also
 it,
 you


know,
 opens
 up
 opportunities
 and
 stuff.


And
 so
 it
 makes
 sense
 to
 kind
 of


>> covered
 and
 the
 covered
 calls
 like
 the


covered
 calls
 on
 it
 like


>> are
 wild.


>> Yeah.
 Because
 once
 you
 have
 such
 a
 big


position
 even
 if
 some
 of
 it
 gets
 sold


off
 it's
 like
 okay
 who
 cares,
 right?


Like
 so.


>> All
 right.


It's
 a
 showand
 tell
 talent
 show.
 Steve


show
 us


>> I'm
 ready
 my
 guy.
 I
 first
 and
 foremost


I'm
 I'm
 want
 to
 know
 what
 kind
 of
 ice
 is


it
 first
 before
 you
 put
 it
 in.
 cubes.


>> You
 don't
 do
 the
 crushed
 ice.


>> No,
 it
 freaking
 melts.


>> I'm
 a
 cube
 guy.
 I'm
 a
 cube
 guy.


>> No,
 it
 melts
 too
 quick.
 You
 can't
 do


crushed
 ice.
 And


>> 100%
 agreed.
 100%.


>> Hold
 on.


>> Okay.
 Okay.
 Maybe
 it's


>> dude.
 My
 My
 sister
 likes
 to
 like
 chew
 on


the
 crushed
 ice.
 I
 never
 understood
 why.


Like
 it's


>> Oh,


>> that
 does
 sound
 good.
 That
 is
 That's


some
 ASMR
 right
 there.
 Maybe
 Steve's
 got


another


>> Steve's
 Steve's
 channel
 is
 gonna
 be


crazy.
 He's
 gonna
 be
 bigger
 than


everybody's.
 He's
 coming
 for
 you,
 dude.


>> He's
 going
 to
 talk
 about
 sports.
 Like,
 I


was
 listening
 last
 night
 sports.
 He's


talking
 about
 food.
 Like,
 what
 doesn't


this
 guy
 do,


>> dude?
 We're
 going
 to
 be
 talk
 We're
 going


to
 be
 streaming
 the
 Masters
 in
 April.


We're
 going
 to
 be
 streaming
 every
 golf


major.
 We're
 probably
 going
 to
 do
 one


Yankee
 game
 a
 week.
 We're
 going
 to
 do


Fight
 Companions.
 Like,
 we're
 going
 to


do
 everything.


>> AK
 Media
 is
 going
 to
 zero,
 dude.
 We're


gonna
 be
 working
 for


>> Dude,
 I'm
 trying
 to
 get
 a
 buyout
 from
 AK


Media.
 How
 did
 you
 freaking
 acquire
 this


guy
 just
 to
 stay
 in
 business,
 bro?


>> I
 know.
 You're
 like,
 he's
 growing
 too


fast.
 He's
 growing
 too
 much
 power.


>> I'm
 trying
 to
 get
 a
 hand.


>> I'm
 trying
 to
 do
 like
 a
 myth.


>> If
 I
 don't
 acquire
 this
 entity
 while


they're
 young
 and
 up
 and
 coming,
 I'm


done.


>> You're
 done.


>> You're
 done,
 dude.


>> Matt,
 you
 got
 to
 love
 the
 freaking


>> I
 love
 that
 ASMR
 on


>> Tink
 from
 the
 Oyster
 Festival.
 You
 know


what
 I
 mean?


>> There's
 an
 oyster
 festival.
 There
 is
 an


oyster
 festival
 on
 Long
 Island
 every


year.
 Yes.


>> Now
 you
 know.


>> I
 did
 not
 know
 that.


>> Yeah.


>> He's
 bigger
 than
 Netflix.


>> No,
 he
 bro
 for
 for
 a
 certain
 subgroup
 of


people
 like
 dude
 there
 was
 like
 a


thousand
 people
 last
 night
 just


listening
 to
 him
 even
 after
 I
 left
 just


like
 people
 just
 like
 listening
 to
 him


talk
 about
 anything,
 you
 know?


>> You
 know,
 I
 like
 listening
 to
 him
 talk


about
 everything.
 Steve
 is
 the
 man.


somebody
 that
 I
 you
 that
 used
 to
 work


with
 me,
 they
 no
 longer
 work
 at
 the


company.
 We
 were
 at
 our
 golf
 outing
 one


year
 having
 breakfast
 and
 they
 were
 into


completely
 different
 things
 and
 we
 got


on
 a
 different
 subject
 and
 they
 look
 at


me
 and
 they're
 like,
 "How
 is
 it
 that
 you


can
 talk
 about
 almost
 anything
 and
 I'm


like,
 I
 don't
 know.
 I
 have
 a
 wide


variety
 of
 interests
 and
 I
 like
 a
 lot."


It's


>> It's
 because
 you've
 watched
 It's
 because


you've
 watched
 every
 movie
 out
 there


that
 that
 expand.
 Well,


>> you
 know,
 that
 could
 be
 part
 of
 it.


Because
 you
 can
 always
 reference


something
 that
 has
 happened
 and
 related


to
 a
 topic,
 right?
 It
 actually
 really


does
 help
 the
 knowledge
 base.
 I
 think


when
 you've
 listened
 and
 watched


everything.


>> Did
 Douggee
 watch
 Confidence?
 Do
 we


know?
 Did
 he
 ever
 go
 back
 to


>> tonight?
 What
 is
 it
 on
 Netflix
 or
 what


what
 is
 it?


>> I
 don't
 know
 what
 it's
 on,
 but
 I
 told


everybody
 that
 hung
 out
 last
 night.
 We


got
 we
 started
 going
 down
 the
 movie


rabbit
 hole
 and


the
 Usual
 Suspects
 came
 up.
 I'm
 like,
 I


know
 The
 Usual
 Suspects
 is
 freaking


great.
 I
 know
 that
 it's
 amazing
 that
 the


person
 who
 you
 didn't
 think
 was
 going
 to


turn
 out
 to
 be
 Kaiser
 So
 turned
 out
 to


be
 Kaiser
 So,
 but
 trust
 me,
 if
 you
 like


usual
 suspects,
 there's
 a
 chance
 you're


going
 to
 think
 Confidence
 is
 a
 better


movie.


>> Hot
 Steve.


>> And
 then
 I
 got
 Oh,
 Matt,
 you'll


appreciate
 this.
 All
 right,
 Amit,
 I


don't
 know
 if
 he's
 going
 to


appreciate
 this
 or
 not,
 but
 I
 think
 you


will
 because
 you
 like
 gangster
 movies,


right?


>> Yeah.


>> All
 right,
 so


>> I
 agree
 with
 you.
 American
 Gangster
 does


not
 get
 enough
 credit.


>> Doesn't
 get
 enough
 credit.
 Uh
 oh,
 it's


on
 HBO
 Max.
 That's
 freaking
 awesome.
 I'm


going
 to
 watch.


>> That
 is
 good.
 I
 have
 I
 have
 it.
 So,
 it's


good.
 So,
 I
 made
 a
 hot
 take
 last
 night


that
 mob
 movies
 can
 be
 gangster
 movies,


but
 gangster
 movies
 are
 not
 necessarily


mob
 movies.


>> Truth.


>> See,
 this
 is
 another
 reason
 it's
 good


for
 you
 to
 stream
 and
 talk
 about
 movies


because
 you're
 going
 to
 come
 up
 with
 hot


takes.


>> So
 many
 hot
 t
 I
 had
 so
 many
 hot
 takes


last
 night.


Tomorrow's
 going
 to
 be
 even
 weird.
 Like,


tomorrow's
 gonna
 be
 good
 because
 I
 may


actually
 have
 a
 drink
 tomorrow
 night
 and


get
 a
 little
 loose.


Oh,
 I
 want
 to
 see.
 I
 will
 be
 tuning
 into


that.


>> I
 may
 have
 a
 drink
 tomorrow
 night
 and


get
 a
 little
 loose.
 I
 mean,


>> you
 might
 whip
 out
 one
 of
 those
 cigars.


>> Matt's
 boycotting
 the
 freaking
 Saturday


night
 stream
 for
 something.


>> I'm
 not
 boycotting.
 May
 maybe
 I
 show
 up.


I
 You
 know what
 I've
 been
 thinking


about?
 Actually,
 I've
 been
 thinking


about
 how
 do
 I
 get
 this
 room
 set
 up
 so
 I


could
 smoke
 cigars
 on
 stream.


>> No,
 don't
 do
 it.
 You're
 going
 to
 need
 to


put
 I
 already
 looked
 into
 it.
 It's
 not


worth
 it.
 You're
 going to
 need
 a
 Rapid


Oasis
 system
 in.
 It's
 hectic.
 What
 you


got
 to
 do?
 Don't
 do
 it.


>> Don't
 do
 it.


>> Don't
 do
 it.


>> Steve,
 you
 got
 You
 got
 to
 pour
 the
 milk


in
 the
 uh
 in
 the
 tin.


>> No,
 I
 just
 did
 that
 for
 a
 fact.
 It's
 not


milk
 time
 yet.
 I
 still
 got
 to
 work.


>> Not
 milk
 time.


>> You
 can't
 make
 this
 [ __ ]
 up,
 dude.


of
 the
 chair.


>> AK
 Media
 is
 cooked,
 bro.


>> What
 is
 going
 on?
 What
 is
 going
 on,
 bro?


What
 is
 What
 is


>> Oh,
 God.


>> That
 just
 reminded
 me
 to
 freak.
 You
 know


what?
 I
 just
 got
 a
 flashback
 of


kindergarten.
 It's
 not
 milk
 time
 yet,


guys.
 Like,
 that
 really
 just
 reminded
 me


of
 freaking
 kindergarten.


>> And
 if
 you
 want
 more
 of
 that,
 there
 is


Steve's
 channel.
 Please
 make
 sure
 to


subscribe.


Yeah.
 What
 is
 this?
 Is
 this


>> I
 feel
 like
 we
 got
 to
 end
 there.
 How


else
 do
 we
 have
 a
 better
 ending?
 There's


no
 way
 we
 can
 top
 that
 ending
 for


tonight.
 There's
 no
 way


>> we
 can
 top
 that
 ending
 tonight.


>> Milk
 time
 definitely
 needs
 to
 be
 a


segment.


>> I
 love
 it.
 I
 love
 it.


>> It
 needs
 to
 be
 an
 intro
 music.
 Milk
 time


with
 Steve.
 Just


>> Yes.


>> Yes.


>> All
 right.


>> That
 is
 it.
 That
 is
 it
 for
 today.
 Are


you
 guys
 doing
 anything
 tonight
 or
 just


chilling
 at
 home?
 Fintech
 Frenzy.


>> Oh
 yeah,
 you
 do.
 So
 it's
 Tanner's


birthday.


>> I
 know.
 I
 already
 called
 him.


>> Yeah,
 I
 I
 I
 found
 out
 in
 the
 morning
 and


we
 wished
 him
 live.
 So
 it'll
 be
 tuning


in.
 That'll
 be
 fun.


>> So
 Fintech
 Frenzy
 and
 then
 Saturday


night
 stream
 with
 the
 boys
 tomorrow
 and


then
 alternative
 asset
 weekly
 on
 Sunday.


>> Oh,
 you're
 doing
 it
 every
 Sunday.


>> Got
 it
 to
 stop
 grinding.


>> Okay,
 there
 we
 go.
 So
 that
 your
 weekend


then
 Friday,
 Saturday,
 Sunday.
 I
 think


Alex
 is
 going
 to
 come
 on
 and
 I
 got


somebody
 else
 that's
 going
 to
 come
 on,
 I


think.


>> I
 love
 it.
 Uh,
 let
 me
 know
 in
 the
 chat


what
 are
 people
 doing
 over
 the
 weekend.


It's
 been
 a
 hectic
 week,
 but
 overall


stocks
 ended
 relatively
 green,
 so
 not


too
 bad
 for
 all
 the
 stuff
 everyone
 had


to
 deal
 with.


>> Confidential
 right
 now.


>> So,


>> what
 did
 he
 say?


>> No,
 somebody
 asked
 what
 time
 tonight.
 10


p.m.
 tonight.
 I'll
 put
 a
 link
 out.


>> Oh,
 for
 the
 fintech
 friend.
 Oh,
 yeah.


Yeah.
 Your
 Saturday
 stream
 is


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.


>> Yeah.
 Tomorrow's
 gonna
 be
 9:30.


>> It's
 always
 nice
 to
 end
 out
 a
 Friday


with
 a
 Matt
 and
 Steve
 stream.
 It
 doesn't


happen
 every
 Friday,
 so
 I
 cherish
 them,


but
 it's
 always
 nice
 for
 a
 Friday,
 end


of
 week
 close
 with
 Mr.
 Matt,
 Money,
 and


Steve.


>> We
 got
 to
 get
 Matt
 out
 more.
 You
 know,


>> Steve's
 the
 man.
 No,
 Matt,
 I
 heard
 you


on
 Steve's
 stream,
 I
 think
 like
 a
 couple


days
 ago,
 saying
 you're
 gonna
 come
 to


New
 York.
 So,
 if
 you
 come
 through,
 dude,


you
 got
 a
 place
 to
 stay.


>> Seriously,
 when
 you
 come,
 I'm
 taking
 the


two
 of
 you
 out.
 So,


>> yeah,
 that's
 the
 hope.
 Um,


at
 some
 point,


>> you've
 never
 seen
 If
 you've
 never
 seen


Christmas
 in
 New
 York,
 I
 feel
 like
 you


should
 come
 during
 uh
 December.
 It'll
 be


fun.


>> Yeah,
 I
 definitely
 have
 some
 time
 over


Thanksgiving
 and
 definitely
 Christmas


time.
 So,
 um,
 and
 especially
 if
 I
 rent
 a


car
 from
 my
 mom's
 place,
 New
 York's
 not


too
 far.
 So,


>> yeah,
 that's
 perfect.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 bro,
 you
 don't
 have
 to
 pay
 for
 a


hotel.
 I
 got
 you
 here.
 If
 you
 need
 a


weekend,


>> four
 or
 five
 days,
 whatever
 you
 need,


I'll


>> live
 in
 the
 the
 skybox.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 then,


let
 me
 know
 what
 day
 you
 want
 to
 come


in.
 And,
 you
 know,
 Aid
 and
 I
 will
 scout


out
 some
 places.
 I
 got
 a
 good
 idea
 for


where
 we're
 going
 to
 go.
 I
 got
 a
 good


idea
 of
 where
 I'm
 going
 to
 take
 the
 two


of
 you.
 So,
 good
 stuff.


>> All
 right,
 folks.
 That
 is
 it
 for
 us.


Matt's
 YouTube
 in
 the
 chat.
 Please
 make


sure
 to
 subscribe.
 Steve's
 YouTube
 in


the
 chat.


>> Uh
 he
 will
 be
 live
 on
 Saturday.
 You
 can


subscribe
 to
 that.
 And
 then
 at
 7:30
 to


8:00
 p.m.
 tonight,
 my
 first
 two
 deep


dives,
 I'll
 have
 a
 tweet
 on
 it
 as
 well,


will
 be
 out
 tonight.
 And


>> I
 think
 that
 you
 should
 do
 a
 live
 stream


and
 actually
 read
 the
 article
 out
 loud.


>> Okay.
 No,
 we're
 I'm
 not
 I'm
 not
 doing


all
 that.
 That's
 But
 the
 point
 of
 this


is
 not
 for
 it
 to
 be
 audio.
 The
 point
 of


it
 is
 for
 people
 to
 actually
 read
 it
 and


and
 you
 know
 there
 there
 is
 you
 know


dude
 I
 didn't
 realize
 how
 big
 substance


>> dude
 you
 could
 name
 it
 story
 time
 with
 a


meth.


>> No,
 we're
 not
 doing
 story
 time
 with
 some


milk
 and
 cookies
 that
 like


>> I
 mean
 he
 has
 a
 point
 though.
 Some


people
 like
 listening
 to
 your
 your


beautiful
 voice.
 It
 could
 become
 an
 ASMR


thing
 wouldn't.


>> No,
 but
 dude,
 Substack
 gets
 125
 million


visits
 a
 month.
 Like,
 I
 didn't
 know
 it


was
 that
 big.
 And
 then
 I
 looked
 at
 the


leaderboards
 and
 stuff.
 There's
 like


there's
 people
 that
 have
 hundreds
 of


thousands
 of
 subscribers
 that
 read
 their


like
 I
 didn't
 again
 I'm
 not
 that
 big
 of


a
 writer
 reader.
 This
 my
 first
 foray


into
 it
 professionally
 and
 I'm
 like
 this


is
 a
 massive
 ecosystem
 for
 people.
 So,


>> is
 Patty
 McCormack
 still
 big
 on
 it?


I
 didn't
 see
 him
 in
 the
 leaderboards,


but
 I
 I
 do
 know
 that
 he's
 had
 a
 big


substack
 for
 a
 while.


>> He
 had
 a
 big
 run
 before.


>> I
 don't
 know if
 he's
 still
 big
 or
 not.


>> All
 right,
 that's
 what
 we
 got.
 Thank
 you


everybody.
 Deeply
 appreciate
 it.
 Um


I'll
 be
 back
 Sunday
 for
 the
 futures.


Steve
 will
 be
 back
 tonight
 for
 Fintech


Frenzy
 and
 then
 Saturday
 and
 then
 Matt


will
 probably
 hear
 from
 him
 next
 week
 on


Cash
 Flow
 Chronicles
 as
 well
 and
 we'll


keep
 going
 from
 there.


Why
 are
 you
 letting
 go?
 All right,


that's
 it.
 Fourth
 time,


>> dude.
 I
 I'm
 like
 Steve.
 It's
 hard
 for
 me


to
 end
 the
 stream,
 but
 Steve
 is
 a


different
 level.
 He
 will
 end
 it
 like
 I


will
 end
 it
 maybe
 35.
 Steve
 will
 go
 two


hours
 after
 he
 said
 he
 was
 going
 to
 end


it.


>> So,


sometimes
 I
 think
 people
 just
 say
 stuff


to
 get
 you
 to
 stay.
 Like,
 it's
 just


>> tomorrow.
 Tomorrow,


>> they
 just
 throw
 a
 grenade.
 They're
 like,


"Low
 risk,
 high
 reward.
 If
 we
 say


something,
 he'll
 stay."


Tomorrow
 I
 plan
 on
 going
 to
 like
 2
 am.


>> Of
 course
 you
 do.
 Of
 course
 you
 like
 it.


No,
 it's
 cool,
 dude.
 It's
 cool.
 You're


building
 a
 You're
 building
 the
 initial


early
 phases
 of
 it.
 So,
 it
 makes
 sense.


>> You
 know
 what?
 I'm
 going
 to
 go
 to
 the


bakery
 tomorrow.
 I'm
 going
 to
 take
 a


walk
 to
 the
 bakery


and
 I'm
 not
 getting
 a
 chocolate
 chip


cookie.
 I'm
 going
 to
 get
 a
 black
 and


white
 cookie
 and
 we're
 going
 to
 test
 my


hypothesis.


>> You
 might
 as
 well
 get
 like
 four
 or
 five


cookies
 and
 just
 review
 it.
 If
 you're


going
 to
 go
 that
 long,
 you
 might
 as
 well


just
 do


>> No,
 we're
 we're
 actually
 going
 to
 do
 a


full
 supermarket
 review
 of
 cookies
 where


I
 get
 every
 package
 cookie
 for
 chocolate


chip
 cookies
 and
 get
 her
 done.
 But,
 um,


you
 know,


>> I
 don't
 know
 if
 my
 heart
 can
 handle


that.


>> The
 first
 and
 last
 bite
 from
 a
 chocolate


chip
 from
 a
 black
 and
 white
 cookie
 are


the
 best
 if
 you
 do
 it
 in
 a
 certain


sequence
 is
 there's
 only
 two
 times
 you


can
 actually
 get
 the
 chocolate
 and
 the


vanilla
 in
 the
 same
 bite.


>> Only
 an
 expert
 would
 be
 able
 to
 do
 this.


So,
 There
 you
 go.


>> All right.
 Thank
 you
 everybody.
 Deeply


deeply
 appreciate
 everyone
 who
 has


joined
 market
 open
 market
 close
 for
 the


past
 week.
 Deeply
 appreciate
 everyone


who
 has
 either
 subscribed
 to
 the


Substack,
 Matt's
 channel,
 Steve's


channel.
 We
 all
 do
 this,
 you
 know,
 for


the
 love
 of
 the
 game.
 And
 uh
 it
 is
 it
 is


really
 cool
 to
 build
 a
 community
 online


with
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 and
 to
 have
 genuine


friends
 build
 it
 together.
 I
 mean,
 it's


not
 fun
 doing
 this
 by
 yourself.
 So,


being
 able
 to
 do
 it
 with
 friends
 really


really
 means
 the
 world.


>> Yo,
 your
 chat
 is
 freaking
 amazing.


It's
 basically
 your
 chat,
 too.
 So,


>> your
 chat
 is
 amazing.
 Oh
 my
 god.


>> Yeah,
 there's
 like
 17
 comments
 trying
 to


save.


>> Wait,
 what
 what
 comment
 got
 you?
 What


comment
 got
 you?


>> Drake
 is
 live.


[Music]


>> All
 right,
 that's
 it.
 Thank
 everybody.


Appreciate
 it.


>> Call
 Steve.
 Dude,
 that's
 the
 number
 one


thing
 they
 say
 before
 I'm
 about
 to
 leave


until
 Trump
 is
 live
 or
 call
 Steve.


>> But
 like
 Steve's
 right
 there.
 So,
 all


right.
 Thank
 everybody.
 We'll
 see
 you


guys
 later
 in
 the
 weekend.


>> Bye
 everyone.
 Have
 a
 good
 one.
