Hello
 everyone.
 Glad
 to
 be
 here
 this


year.
 Oh,
 okay.
 Okay.
 Wanted
 to
 talk


about
 not
 about
 autonomous
 driving


today.
 I
 wanted
 to
 talk
 about


entrepreneurship
 in
 general.
 You
 know,


every
 time
 when
 I
 visit
 the
 Bay
 Area,
 I


feel
 this
 is
 a
 promised
 land.
 A
 lot
 of


miracles
 happening
 here
 and
 more
 drama


of
 course.


So
 there
 will
 be
 two
 types
 of
 uh


capitals.
 In
 fact
 after
 10
 years
 in
 a
 in


doing
 all
 kinds
 of
 uh
 startups
 I
 found


that
 it's
 actually
 not
 only
 about
 VC


there
 are
 two
 types
 of
 capitals.
 One
 is


called
 venture
 capital
 and
 the
 other
 one


is
 called
 consensus
 capital
 and
 venture


capital
 bet
 on
 ideas.
 Ideas
 where
 it's


big
 enough
 to
 change
 the
 world.
 ideas


where
 pe
 other
 people
 don't
 believe
 in.


So
 that's
 why
 you
 call
 them
 venture


capital.
 But
 many
 other
 capitals
 are


here
 to
 bet
 for
 consensus.
 So
 consensus


capital
 is
 the
 type
 of
 capital
 where


okay
 two
 years
 ago
 everyone
 thinking


about
 large
 language
 model
 that's
 the


thing
 to
 bet.
 So
 you
 bet
 on
 it.
 Uh
 even


if
 you
 bet
 your
 bet
 is
 wrong
 there's
 no


problem
 because
 everyone
 is
 feeling
 the


same.
 And
 more
 often
 you
 can
 get
 in
 in
 a


round
 and
 get
 out
 in
 C
 round.
 and
 you


can
 make
 money,
 right?
 So
 that's
 a


consensus
 capital
 and
 people
 may
 feel


that
 well
 everyone
 is
 talking
 about
 VC


and
 VC
 and
 VC.
 So
 VC
 might
 be
 the


majority
 of
 this
 capitalism.
 But
 in
 fact


what
 I
 feel
 is
 that
 the
 consensus


capital
 is
 actually
 more
 typical.


That's
 a
 matter
 of
 fact.
 I'm
 not
 really


trying
 to
 say
 consensus
 capital
 is
 evil


or
 anything.
 It's
 actually
 they
 have


their
 reasons
 because
 every
 fund
 they


have
 a
 certain
 limit
 of
 years
 to
 return


to
 the
 in
 to
 their
 investors
 so
 that


they
 have
 to
 bet
 on
 something
 that
 has


certain
 amount
 of
 certainty
 and
 also
 the


biggest
 fund
 like
 Andrea
 Horowway
 is


actually
 is
 is
 making
 great
 money
 for


their
 investors
 but
 after
 all
 they
 are


betting
 money
 on
 the
 consensus
 and
 look


at
 the
 consensus
 today
 we
 have
 a


robotics
 and
 we
 have
 a
 BCI
 right
 and
 we


we
 used
 to
 have
 autonomous
 driving
 but


not
 any
 not
 anymore
 but
 those
 are
 the


consensus
 we
 talk
 about.
 So
 every
 now


and
 then
 in
 the
 Silicon
 Valley
 I
 hear


people
 even
 in
 the
 restaurant
 I
 hear


people
 talking
 about
 some
 buzzwords
 and


those
 are
 the
 consensus
 and
 those
 what


attracts
 people
 getting
 in
 attracts


investment
 getting
 in
 and
 making


miracles
 happen


but
 the
 choice
 is
 for
 the
 founders


it's
 not
 always
 true
 that
 we
 get
 into


something
 that
 is
 a
 consensus
 because


hey
 if
 I'm
 getting
 into
 that
 consensus


and
 my
 peers
 are
 also
 getting
 into
 the


same
 consensus
 everyone
 is
 competing
 on


the
 same
 topic
 that
 happens
 too
 often
 in


this
 promised
 land
 in
 here
 in
 the


Silicon
 Valley
 and
 I
 would
 say
 there
 are


two
 types
 of
 founders.
 One
 we
 call
 them


the
 founders
 who
 does
 startups.
 The


founder
 do
 who
 does
 startup
 is
 a
 founder


that
 has
 a
 certain
 time
 before
 the


consensus
 is
 running
 out.
 They
 got
 to


make
 their
 way
 out.
 That
 is
 a
 typical


startup.
 So
 I
 I
 have
 several
 friends
 who


just
 repeatedly
 starting
 small


businesses
 getting
 acquired
 by
 big


companies
 and
 restart
 again.
 So
 that's
 a


lifestyle.
 So
 I
 call
 them
 startups.
 The


other
 one
 is
 enterprise
 because
 if
 you


really
 sell
 your
 company
 to
 a
 big


company,
 uh
 you
 you
 sell
 your
 startup
 to


a
 big
 company,
 there's
 no
 way
 for
 you
 to


continue
 the
 journey.
 Someone
 else
 is


taking
 over
 and
 you
 you
 have
 a
 board


that
 managing
 you
 and
 they
 are
 not


driven
 by
 the
 vision.
 They're
 driven
 by


the
 next
 year,
 next
 uh
 quarterly
 report


or
 annual
 report
 of
 the
 financials.
 So


uh
 the
 other
 one
 if
 you're
 trying
 to
 do


something
 you
 wanted
 to
 go
 to
 the
 very


end
 of
 it
 I
 call
 them
 enterprises.
 So


that's
 results
 driven.
 So
 there's
 a
 very


different
 mentality
 between
 the
 timed


driven
 and
 results
 driven
 play.
 And
 of


course
 all
 of
 that
 has
 been
 influenced


by
 the
 consensus


and
 we
 all
 know
 this.
 This
 is
 a
 very


typical
 Gartner
 Gartner
 cycle
 of
 hype.


Every
 year
 uh
 there's
 a
 new
 thing
 and
 I


try
 to
 uh
 for
 specifically
 choose
 for


this
 meeting
 this
 is
 a
 AI
 related


gardener
 cycle
 not
 my
 opinion
 but


Gartner
 Institute's
 opinion
 about
 it


people
 talk
 about
 this
 I
 think
 this
 is


definitely
 not
 the
 first
 time
 you
 saw
 it


but
 what
 I
 see
 from
 this
 cycle
 is
 that


there
 are
 two
 things
 one
 in
 the
 general


trend
 things
 take
 a
 lot
 of
 years
 to


mature
 to
 the
 right
 end
 to
 finally


plateau
 of
 productivity
 on
 the
 right


bottom


But
 there
 is
 a
 hype
 cycle
 and
 in
 fact


hype
 cycle
 in
 other
 words
 is
 actually


the
 attention
 span
 of
 the
 consensus.
 A


lot
 of
 people
 focusing
 in
 one
 thing.
 Of


course
 this
 is
 a
 phenomena
 but
 this


phenomena
 this
 party
 only
 lasts
 for


certain
 amount
 of
 time
 normally
 not
 more


than
 five
 years
 sometimes
 even
 one
 year.


Like
 how
 many
 of
 you
 started
 thinking


about
 starting
 building
 a
 large
 language


model
 company
 as
 of
 today?
 Not
 a
 good


business
 right?
 Maybe
 tomorrow
 OpenAI


would
 have
 another
 feature
 that
 kills


you.
 I
 talk
 about
 this
 to
 investors
 back


in
 2023,
 but
 people
 don't
 listen.
 But


you
 know,
 this
 year
 maybe
 we
 can
 talk


about
 robotics,
 but
 you
 know,
 two
 years


in
 the
 future,
 some
 some
 people
 would


tell
 you,
 oh,
 of
 course,
 that's
 that's
 a


very
 natural
 uh
 issue
 for
 robotics
 to
 to


robotics
 is
 not
 a
 good
 business
 in
 2025.


And
 the
 reason
 is
 A,
 B,
 and
 C.
 Two
 years


later,
 people
 will
 tell
 you
 that
 that


becomes
 a
 new
 consensus
 of
 course.
 So


consensus
 has
 a
 very
 relatively
 short


time
 span
 but
 in
 order
 to
 achieve


something
 achieving
 an
 enterprise
 takes


much
 longer
 time.
 So
 this
 this
 is
 what
 I


call
 a
 mismatch
 especially
 if
 we're


thinking
 about
 building
 hard
 texts.
 A


lot
 of
 people
 are
 like
 me
 who
 are
 coming


from
 the
 academia
 and
 we
 get
 into
 the


startup
 world
 or
 enterprise
 world


whatever
 we
 build
 things.
 Building
 hard


tech
 itself
 is
 already
 very
 very


torturing
 and
 it
 takes
 a
 long
 time.
 But


even
 worse,
 we
 also
 have
 to
 build
 the


product
 around
 it.
 Because
 building


technology,
 you
 know,
 you
 have
 great


technology,
 but
 it
 doesn't
 really
 make


money
 out
 of
 it.
 You
 need
 to
 find
 the


customer,
 you
 need
 to
 polish
 your


product
 instead
 of
 uh
 instead
 just
 the


core
 technology.
 Those
 algorithms
 are


relatively
 cheap.
 The
 product
 is
 what


makes
 money.
 But
 building
 product
 plus


building
 tech,
 how
 can
 we
 squeeze
 all
 of


that
 within
 one
 consensus
 cycle?
 And


very
 often
 the
 consensus
 cycle
 is
 gone


before
 we
 even
 finish
 building
 the
 hard


tech.
 That's
 a
 sad
 reality
 and
 that's


why
 many
 of
 the
 company
 are
 suffering.


Thinking
 about
 this
 great
 technologies


my
 opinion
 most
 of
 the
 grid
 technology


they
 must
 go
 through
 the
 cycles.
 They


can't
 really
 just
 stay
 in
 one
 cycle
 and


build
 everything.
 If
 you're
 building


that
 in
 within
 one
 cycle
 I'm
 telling
 you


you're
 building
 a
 small
 business.
 You're


not
 building
 an
 enterprise.
 All
 of
 the


things
 virtual
 reality.
 How
 many
 of
 you


are
 talking
 about
 virtual
 reality
 today?


Back
 in
 2016,
 I
 have
 one
 of
 my
 best


friends
 in
 the
 Silicon
 Valley
 decided
 to


go
 home,
 go
 back
 to
 China
 and
 build
 his


own
 VR
 company.
 He's
 still
 fighting,
 but


his
 life
 is
 not
 as
 great
 as
 some
 of
 the


other
 companies
 because
 it's
 very
 hard


to
 raise
 money
 for
 the
 sake
 of
 virtual


reality.
 Similar
 things
 with
 autonomous


driving.
 I'm
 still
 working
 on
 autonomous


driving.
 I'm
 so
 jealous
 of
 myself,
 you


know,
 uh
 seven
 years
 ago,
 it
 very
 easily


become
 an
 unicorn
 and
 easily
 go
 to


public.
 But
 uh
 you
 know
 the
 the
 chance


is
 no
 longer
 there
 today.
 Genomics,


robotics,
 quantum
 computing,
 even
 if
 we


take
 a
 general
 a
 very
 generic
 sense


artificial
 intelligence.
 Artificial


intelligence
 has
 been
 through
 multiple


hypes.
 Back
 in
 1960s,
 Dartmouth,
 right?


People
 are
 talking
 about
 computer
 vision


to
 be
 solved
 in
 one
 summer
 camp.
 That's


not
 happening.
 and
 decades
 of
 up
 and


downs
 and
 hint
 Jeff
 Hinton
 used
 to
 be


the
 celebrity
 and
 used
 to
 be
 the


hetradox
 research
 scientist
 and
 then


becomes
 a
 celebrity
 again
 and
 this
 is


the
 third
 time
 he
 becomes
 a
 celebrity


but
 he
 has
 this
 insistence
 only
 with


those
 type
 of
 insistence
 great


technology
 will
 be
 born
 and
 what


happened
 after
 the
 hype
 I
 call
 them


after
 hype
 so
 I've
 been
 living
 in
 the


after
 hype
 world
 for
 about
 two
 years


even
 though
 I'm
 still
 fighting
 I
 still


feel
 the
 pain.
 First
 of
 all,
 in
 the


afterhive
 world,
 no
 one
 takes
 a
 pain.


You
 can
 make
 a
 promise
 saying
 that
 you


know
 the
 robotics
 can
 do
 everything.


Their
 generalization
 power
 is
 great


enough
 or
 you
 can
 say
 agentic
 AI
 can


actually
 solve
 all
 of
 the
 problem
 for


you.
 All
 of
 these
 things
 are
 promised


because
 you
 have
 not
 yet
 provide
 hard


evidence
 in
 doing
 that.
 By
 the
 way,
 I


just
 learned
 that
 for
 agentic
 AI
 uh
 one


of
 the
 metric
 interestingly
 is
 how
 many


hours
 can
 you
 run
 the
 agent
 without


falling
 without
 failing
 and
 in
 fact
 the


the
 metric
 has
 a
 caveat.
 If
 you
 have
 50%


of
 the
 success
 success
 rate
 I
 we
 count


it
 in
 as
 a
 as
 a
 counting
 in
 as
 a


duration
 of
 of
 the
 running
 like
 50%
 come


on
 that's
 not
 a
 product
 at
 all
 but


people
 are
 willing
 to
 bet
 in
 because


people
 can
 always
 messize
 themselves
 and


saying
 yeah
 today
 the
 technology
 is
 not


perfect
 but
 it's
 50%.
 Maybe
 next
 year
 it


gets
 to
 70%
 and
 two
 years
 later
 90%.
 Who


knows,
 right?
 People
 have
 this
 kind
 of


optimism
 about
 technology,
 but
 that


thing
 never
 happened
 in
 the
 after
 world.


After
 world
 is
 like
 I've
 been
 talking
 to


people,
 hey,
 we
 be
 building
 the


autonomous
 driving
 trucks
 driving


without
 a
 driver.
 I've
 done
 it
 before,


so
 trust
 me,
 we
 can
 do
 it.
 Nah,
 we


wanted
 to
 talk
 to
 you
 after
 you
 finish


it.
 Of
 course,
 we'll
 finish
 it
 and
 there


will
 be
 more
 challenges
 and
 questions.


That's
 one.
 The
 second
 is
 that
 in


afterhive
 world,
 no
 one
 cares
 about
 the


relative
 progress.
 I'm
 always
 joking


that
 I've
 been
 presenting
 to
 other


people
 that
 we
 have
 delivered
 the
 the


driver
 out
 level
 four
 driver
 out
 truck


without
 a
 human
 uh
 with
 only
 41
 millions


of
 spending.
 That's
 a
 a
 wild
 number
 even


to
 myself.
 I
 feel
 very
 proud
 of
 the


team.
 But
 investors
 like
 well
 you
 know


the
 I've
 seen
 more
 capital
 efficient


companies
 out
 there.
 This
 is
 like
 a
 very


I
 would
 say
 humiliating
 to
 me
 as
 if
 I


were
 telling
 people
 I've
 run
 a
 100
 meter


sprint
 with
 nine
 second
 and
 eight
 9.80


seconds
 and
 some
 people
 say
 oh
 reminds


me
 about
 the
 world
 record.
 So
 this
 is


where
 I
 felt
 that
 no
 one
 really
 cares


about
 the
 relative
 progress


and
 uh
 the
 worst
 is
 that
 for
 us
 the


founders
 we're
 not
 prepared
 for
 all
 of


it.
 I
 wanted
 to
 do
 a
 tally
 here.
 How


many
 of
 you
 been
 working
 in
 uh
 startup


world
 for
 more
 than
 five
 years?
 Raise


your
 hand
 please.


I
 don't
 see
 many.
 And
 uh
 you
 know
 to
 me


I've
 been
 working
 in
 this
 world
 for


about
 10
 years
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 than
 10


years
 but
 uh
 I
 have
 uh
 did
 my
 account
 my


first
 startup
 was
 the
 at
 the
 born
 of


deep
 learning
 where
 I
 certainly
 I'm
 the


beneficiary
 of
 the
 hype
 and
 my
 second


startup
 was
 in
 autonomous
 driving.
 I


lived
 uh
 probably
 six
 years
 in
 the
 hype


which
 I
 enjoyed
 the
 hype
 and
 uh
 then
 the


third
 startup
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 than
 two


years
 I
 live
 in
 the
 after
 hype
 world.
 So


I
 have
 either
 lived
 in
 the
 hype
 world
 or


the
 hopter
 hype
 world.
 And
 I
 think
 this


is
 also
 a
 very
 common
 symptom
 for


everyone
 here
 in
 the
 in
 the
 promised


land
 of
 the
 Silicon
 Valley
 where
 we


always
 live
 in
 this
 hype
 or
 after
 hype


world
 and
 we
 including
 myself
 has


ignored
 a
 bigger
 world
 normal
 business


world
 and
 in
 fact
 the
 answer
 is
 in
 this


traditional
 investment
 activity
 the


normal
 business
 world
 is
 the
 answer
 to


go
 through
 the
 hype
 cycles.
 This
 is
 what


I
 believe.
 I'm
 talking
 to
 my
 team.
 What


if
 people
 don't
 believe
 in
 autonomic


driving
 anymore?
 What
 pe
 what
 if
 people


feel
 that
 there's
 after
 hype


repercussion?
 We
 can
 still
 make
 money.


We
 can
 still
 find
 investment
 if
 we


thinking
 about
 ourselves
 in
 a
 very


humble
 way
 thinking
 that
 we're
 running
 a


chain
 restaurant
 business.
 Of
 course,


90%
 of
 the
 uh
 all
 the
 economics
 are


happening
 in
 just
 like
 a
 normal
 world,


not
 hype,
 not
 after
 hype.
 Okay?
 No


secret
 recipe.
 We
 were
 not
 KFC.
 We're


just
 like
 a
 typical
 typical
 restaurant


and
 no
 one
 need
 to
 need
 to
 take
 a
 leap


of
 faith
 with
 us.
 Like
 our
 food
 is
 not


superior
 and
 there's
 no
 valuation


inflation
 and
 of
 course
 limited
 social


media
 attention.
 But
 even
 with
 all
 of


that,
 can
 we
 make
 money
 here?
 This
 is
 a


formula.
 If
 you
 want
 to
 take
 photos,


please
 take
 this
 one.
 This
 is
 probably


the
 most
 important
 thing.
 Your
 your


survival
 formula
 for
 the
 after
 hyper


world.
 Restaurant
 value
 equals
 food


value
 minus
 operating
 cost.
 and
 minus


advertising
 cost.
 If
 you
 can
 solve
 that


value,
 you
 can
 say,
 "Okay,
 my
 restaurant


makes
 money.
 Now
 I
 need
 more
 money
 to


build
 more
 restaurants
 to
 make
 a
 chain."


That
 is
 very
 convincing
 to
 normal


investors.
 We
 don't
 need
 to
 find
 those


consensus
 investors.
 We
 don't
 need


consensus
 or
 or
 uh
 venture
 cons
 venture


capital.
 But
 let's
 transform
 that


restaurant
 formula
 for
 autonomy


product
 value.
 People
 are
 talking
 about


autonomous
 driving.
 Oh,
 beautiful.


Remove
 the
 driver,
 right?
 But
 people
 are


forgot
 about
 operating
 cost
 and
 customer


acquisition
 cost.


Especially
 especially
 if
 you
 are
 selling


the
 technology.
 A
 lot
 of
 us
 today
 we're


simplifying
 our
 uh
 road
 map
 of
 of


technology
 growth
 or
 company
 growth
 or


enterprise
 growth
 by
 thinking
 about
 okay


let's
 about
 thinking
 about
 selling


technology
 to
 millions
 of
 the
 customers


assuming
 that
 we
 have
 the
 customer
 is


tomorrow
 and
 they
 don't
 really
 think


about
 getting
 into
 there
 but
 I
 feel
 more


and
 more
 true
 that
 many
 of
 these
 hard


technologies
 requires
 the
 founder
 of


enterprise
 not
 a
 startup
 they're


planning
 to
 sell
 to
 big
 companies
 next


year
 a
 founder
 of
 a
 enterprise
 price
 to


really
 focusing
 on
 making
 money
 as
 if


we're
 building
 the
 chain
 restaurant,


especially
 on
 the
 operating
 cost
 for


autonomous
 driving.
 Even
 cleaning
 the


sensors
 is
 not
 is
 not
 a
 trivial
 job.
 But


many
 people
 have
 overlooked
 that.
 Give


you
 one
 data
 point.
 Uh
 in
 my
 last


company,
 we
 spend
 $20
 per
 mile
 in


operating
 our
 fleet
 and
 we're
 making
 $2


per
 mile.
 Yes,
 the
 technology
 is
 cool,


but
 people
 will
 only
 pay
 for
 coolness
 in


the
 hype.
 we
 got
 to
 go
 back
 to
 the


normal
 business.
 And
 I'm
 not
 sure
 if


today
 I
 I
 don't
 I
 don't
 wanted
 to


speculate
 about
 Whimo's
 cost,
 but
 my


understanding
 is
 is
 that
 the
 total
 cost


combined
 of
 the
 operation
 is
 still
 not


making
 money.
 And
 I'm
 I'm
 glad
 my
 new


company
 bought
 auto,
 we
 are
 already


making
 a
 tiny
 bit
 of
 money
 by
 removing


the
 driver
 here
 in
 the
 operating
 cost.


And
 the
 last
 thing
 is
 customer


acquisition
 cost.
 This
 is
 especially


true
 for
 robotics.
 Like
 I
 don't
 really


feel
 that
 my
 parents
 would
 allow
 a


robots
 to
 be
 invited
 to
 be
 introduced
 to


to
 their
 home
 and
 they're
 living
 with
 a


robot.
 No
 way.
 They're
 not
 prepared.
 So


how
 can
 we
 get
 customers
 if
 we're


selling
 a
 robots
 to
 others?
 Similarly,


how
 can
 we
 sell
 the
 autonomous
 driving


technology
 to
 a
 car
 manu
 truck


manufacturer,
 car
 manufacturer
 or
 a


fleet
 of
 trucks?
 We
 have
 to
 be
 the
 owner


who
 operate
 the
 trucks.
 Just
 again
 this


is
 like
 a
 chain
 restaurant.
 We
 are
 here


providing
 the
 food.
 We're
 not
 here


providing
 the
 recipe.
 We're
 not
 here


providing
 the
 the
 the
 the
 halfy
 baked


food,
 right?
 That's
 a
 like
 a
 halfy


processed
 food.
 That's
 a
 that's
 an
 issue


in
 China
 right
 now,
 right?
 But
 thinking


about
 this,
 if
 you
 are
 if
 you
 are
 a


restaurant,
 you
 truly
 believe
 you're
 a


chain
 restaurant,
 you
 got
 to
 provide
 the


food
 for
 the
 customer
 because
 that's
 the


easiest
 way
 for
 you
 to
 make
 money.
 You


can
 solve
 the
 customer
 acquisition
 cost


and
 solving
 operation
 cost.
 Okay,
 I'll


leave
 several
 minutes
 for
 the
 quick
 Q&A.


And
 for
 those
 who
 want
 to
 build
 hard


techch,
 live
 long
 and
 prosper.
