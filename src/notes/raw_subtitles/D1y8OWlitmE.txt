MAN:
Do Ontario's
former premiers
still stand by the policies
they became known for?
The Premier Files
 explores all
of that and much more.
I, Dalton McGuinty,
swear that I will
duly and faithfully
and to the best of my
skill and knowledge
execute the powers and
trust reposed in me
as premier and president of
the executive council
and minister of
intergovernmental relations
of the province
of Ontario.
So help me God.
Dalton McGuinty brought the
Liberals back to power in 2003,
becoming Ontario's
24th premier.
He won three
straight elections,
making him the most
successful Liberal premier
in more than
a century.
His approach-- never
too high,
never too low,
just relentless.
We spoke here
at Queen's Park.
Premier McGuinty, I'm curious
as to what it was like
walking back into this building
today after so many years.
(Laughing)
Well, I was met
by capable,
friendly,
accommodating
security personnel
who wouldn't know me
from any other passerby.
You really think
they didn't you know you?
They did not
know me. No. No.
But time marches
on, right?
It's been 12 years
since you were premier.
It's been
12 years, and--
But I have all kinds
of warm memories
from this building.
Well, let's go back,
because we're going to go--
We'll eventually get
to this building,
but I do want to start
at the beginning.
And I want to start with the
home you grew up in--
Yeah.
--with two parents and 10 kids.
Was that the mayhem
it sounds like?
I think it was kind of
organized mayhem.
My parents, I think,
allowed for a
comfortable accommodation
so that we could
be kids and crazy,
but there were also
some rules
that we had to
stick by.
You know, one of
my dad's routines,
if you want to--
He was a university
professor.
It's hard to feed 10 kids on
an academic's salary,
so he was very
entrepreneurial, and he did
all kinds of things. But one
of the things he did was,
he taught summer courses and
he taught evening school.
So, he'd come home to be
with us during dinner,
and then he'd stretch
out immediately after dinner
on a La-Z-Boy chair
and just cover himself
with the newspaper.
We would run around
like idiots,
high on ice cream
we bought by the
two-gallon barrels,
and if we got
too loud,
he'd let out a
howl or a shriek.
That would scare the
you-know-what out of us,
and we knew we had to
kind of temper our fun.
So, we had
a lot of fun,
but there was also a
lot of discipline
and a lot
of expectation.
Were you
expected, though,
as one of the
older kids,
to be a kind of a co-parent
to the younger ones?
Yeah. There was
a heavy expectation.
It's not something that
I felt at the time,
though, Steve, that
was heavy.
It was just how
I was growing up.
It was what I knew.
I was the oldest
of six boys,
and so my job was,
my mother and father expected
me to set a good example.
STEVE:
A lot of
multitasking here.
DALTON:
A lot of multitasking,
yeah, and the other
thing, of course,
you learn in this large,
big family environment
is how to manage
different personalities.
Does that come in helpful
when you've got a caucus of--
Absolutely.
--70-plus people?
Absolutely.
It does?
Absolutely. I like to say
a caucus is a football team
consisting entirely
of quarterbacks.
They all want to
call the play,
and they are all leaders
in their own right.
They are leaders and
have been seen as such
in their
communities.
So, you know, I'm sure we
might find some time
to come back to these
kinds of things,
but one of the things
I've learned about leadership--
there's kind of
a simple formula.
Get the best people.
Get the best out
of them.
Not much more
complicated than that.
Provincial politics is so much
about health care and education,
and your mom was
a nurse.
Your dad was in
the postsecondary world.
I mean, there it is right there.
Mm-hmm.
Do I assume that
a large part
of the reason why
you went into public life
is because of
the example they set?
You know, I've never really
thought of it that way,
in fact, ever,
but I think there
was just an expectation,
mostly unwritten.
It's never going to
be good enough to grow up,
get a job,
and pay taxes.
Everybody does that.
That's kind of the
minimum expectation.
They also would
have conveyed
that the quality
of life that we enjoyed
is nothing short of
extraordinary
and it didn't just
happen,
but previous generations
did something.
And I'm going to use a
word we rarely use today.
They sacrificed, right,
for the younger
generations
and handed down to us
on a silver platter
wonderful things like great
schools and great health care
and safe and
strong communities
and a safe and
clean environment.
All those kinds of things
didn't just happen.
So there was an expectation
we would find a way,
each in our own way,
to make a
contribution.
When did you first
get the notion
that maybe going into politics
at some point in your life
was a consideration?
Well, I kind
of approached it,
then pulled
away from it,
and then came
back to it.
So, I approached it at the
outset when we were younger.
You know, my
dad was
John Turner's riding
association president,
and we worked on campaigns
even before then.
We'd show up with a modest crew
of five or six kids.
We would stuff
envelopes,
make some calls when
we got a little bit older,
knock on doors,
and came to see campaigning
as a lot of fun.
And then later on,
my dad got
into politics.
I could see that he
found it very challenging.
He wanted to
be in cabinet.
He never
got into cabinet.
I could see
the long hours,
the time
away from family.
You're called upon to
reconcile the irreconcilable.
It's so difficult at
time to make progress.
There are
frustrations,
and there's
cynicism.
It can be a toxic
environment at time,
so that kind of
repelled me from it,
and then
he passed away.
And I thought,
you know,
"Hey, time
to step up."
I want to go back to one of
the worst nights of your life,
the 16th
of March, 1990,
and your father is shoveling
the snow on the driveway.
What do you remember about
that evening?
I got a call
from my mother.
And my mom's a very calm
and collected--
was a calm and
collected person.
So, she said,
"Mick, you better
get over here."
So, I thought,
"Okay. Alright.
I'll take some time
and, you know, pull
some things together,
make sure the kids are
good and all that."
And then a
few minutes later,
my brother
Michael phones,
and he says, "Jamie,
get the hell over here."
So I knew
something was up,
so I get in the car.
My mom and dad's place
was only, like, five or
six minutes away.
Drove as quickly as I
could. I get there
and found my mom
giving my dad
mouth-to-mouth
resuscitation. So--
Outdoors?
Outdoors, yeah.
On the ground in the winter.
On the ground.
Yeah. Yeah.
So, I took over.
She proceeded--
she was a nurse--
to give him chest
compressions,
but it was too late.
It was too late, so we waited
for the ambulance to come.
They took him to
the hospital.
We followed immediately behind,
but it was too
late. Yeah.
Sixty-three.
Sixty-three
years of age.
Let me circle back to something
you said a moment ago,
which is, your mother
called you Mac.
Mick.
Mick?
Yeah.
And you had a brother
call you Jamie?
Yeah.
Your name's Dalton James
Patrick McGuinty Jr.
Yeah.
You have the same name
as your dad.
Yeah.
What's with all the different
names that everybody calls you?
(Laughing) So, well,
it's a little
bit complicated.
First of all, yeah.
So, I was known
as Jamie growing up,
and my family still
calls me Jamie.
Dalton was
my father, right?
And then later on, my
parents christened me Mick.
It became
my nickname.
Got you. His death,
besides being a personal tragedy
for your family--
I mean, I guess the
reality is,
he's an elected
member at the time,
and his death means there's
going to be a byelection
to replace him
in the legislature.
Right.
How long did it take
before your family kind of
sat down and started to think
about whether one of the
kids would run in his stead?
So, David Peterson delivered
the eulogy at my dad's funeral,
and then we hosted
a gathering
at my mom's
house afterwards.
And I remember David saying
to me and my brothers,
"Which one of you is
gonna run?"
He put it like that?
Yeah.
So the
expectation was,
it was going to be
somebody from the family.
Yeah. There was kind of
an expectation there,
and I think even had
he not said that,
I think we'd all
seriously considered it.
And I felt a
yearning,
something to get
at this now,
and the joke I used
to make was, "Well, look.
My name's already
on the signs,
so we've got a
financial argument
in favour of
my candidacy."
Anyway, two weeks after
the funeral,
I said to Terri,
"I think I...
I think I
got to run."
She says, "We have
four kids under eight.
You're not running."
Yes.
I said, "That is
so sensible."
But for me,
as for everything
that I've ever
pursued in politics,
it was always
much more, Steve,
an affair of the
heart than the head.
It's been said that the
heart has its reasons
reason alone
will never know,
and I felt a
calling.
I felt a responsibility to pick
up where my dad had left off,
and that's the long and
the short of it,
how I got in.
The 1990
election comes,
and you are
the one Liberal
who's new
at Queen's Park.
I am the class
of 1990.
You are the Liberal
class of 1990.
Fifty-nine
Liberal MPPs
lost their seats in
that election.
This was the election
Bob Rae won--
Right.
--in a shocking upset.
How do you think you managed
to withstand the tide
that was slaying Liberals
all over the province?
The sheer quality of my
candidacy. (Laughing)
But seriously, folks...
I think that my dad had an
excellent reputation.
I think there's
no doubt about that.
I think that
there was some...
"Let's give this kid
a shot," right?
"His dad was
in office.
He was an upstanding
contributor
to our
community life.
Let's give the kid a shot."
So, I think there was
undoubtedly some sympathy
there associated with that,
and the other thing I
like to think was,
we ran a good campaign and we
ran an honest campaign.
I mean, you know, one of
the things I did--
I think I even put
this in my book.
You know, like, three
days after I'd been
knocking on doors,
I discovered the bloom
had really come off
the Liberal rose.
Mm.
So I came back to campaign
headquarters. I said,
"We have to remove
all posters of my leader.
I have to take them
out of my pamphlets."
You know, some people might
consider this heretical,
but I figured the single most
important obligation
I owed to my leader
was, win my seat.
Win my seat.
So that's what I did and
worked very hard
and was able to win,
and I know that our
party took a kicking.
And I recall our first meeting
in this building, Steve.
I was the only
newly elected MPP,
and at the time,
it was a gathering
of all the MPPs
who had run
in that election.
And lost.
And lost,
so I felt like I
was sitting in on a wake.
I thought, "What the hell?
I just won this thing.
This is-- I'm riding
the wave here."
I was excited
to be here
and grateful
for the opportunity,
but of course,
I had to, you know,
bite my tongue
and feel the reality,
what was being experienced
by my colleagues.
There's no way
you will remember this,
but I have never
forgotten it.
You and I
had a lunch
not too long after you
won your seat,
because I thought,
"I got to meet
this one new Liberal MPP and
find out what he's all about."
So we had lunch in the
basement of this building,
and somehow, during the
course of that lunch,
you mentioned to me, when
I asked you, you know,
"What are your plans
for around here?",
you said, "Well, I
think I'd like
to lead this
party someday."
You said that having
probably no idea
where the bathrooms in this
building even were yet.
Did you really...
What gave
you the chutzpah
to start thinking you could be
the leader of this party,
given the bloodbath
your party had just been through
and you're a
brand-new person here?
Yeah. I was probably just
full of blarney
at the time, Steve.
I love that you're
not denying the story.
Yeah. (Laughing)
Probably just
full of blarney,
but I think that I
didn't give it
really
serious consideration
until much later when I
thought, you know,
"Maybe I can bring
something to the table here
that'll be different from what
others might be offering."
The crazy thing about
the conversation
you and I had
over lunch
is that six years later you ran
for the leadership and won.
Yeah.
What made you think at the age
of 41 years old in 1996
that you were
ready, actually,
to be the leader
of the party?
Right. Well, I felt we needed to
kickstart our party, right?
It was languishing,
and we had won
one in 50 years,
I guess it was.
And I thought I
could bring forward
some new ways,
some new ideas,
some new methods,
and I thought, "What
the heck?
Give it a shot."
And you know--
(Laughing)
--there was no province-wide
"Draft Dalton" movement,
I can assure
you, and again,
there was a struggle
on the home front.
When you told your
wife you wanted to run
for the leadership.
Yeah.
How'd that go?
Well, about as well as it did
when I told her I wanted
to get into politics
in the first instance.
But she didn't veto.
She did not veto,
but she raised all the
usual legitimate concerns.
What did you consider
your chances for victory to be
during the course of the
campaign, running for leader?
I felt the longer I
was out there,
the more
optimistic I was,
the more I
was growing,
the more I was
connecting,
the more I
was learning.
So I felt
optimistic.
We are almost
30 years
since you ran in
that leadership convention
as we sit here today
in June of 2025,
and you gathered
at Maple Leaf Gardens,
all the troops.
The results of the
first ballot come in,
and you are in fourth place.
Yeah.
What'd you think of your
chances at that point?
(Laughing) I thought--
I thought--
You know what?
I wasn't put out
by that, because...
my ambition
was to be everybody's
favourite second choice.
I knew that in
this-- I think--
Were was six of us or seven
of us? I can't recall.
A fair number of
leadership candidates.
Seven, I think.
Seven all told, yeah?
So I had made an
effort to--
It was an old-fashioned
delegated convention.
The best kind. Yes, sir.
The best kind.
You got that right,
and so, you get to know who
the delegates are.
So, I made a point of
phoning every single one
before that
convention personally.
Five thousand delegates?
Phoned them all,
and the purpose of the call
was simply to say,
"I see you're supporting
so-and-so. Fabulous.
So-and-so's an
excellent candidate.
However, should he or
she drop off the ballot,
I'd be honoured
to have your support."
Just a soft sell like
that, right?
So, that was my
objective,
to be everybody's
favourite second choice.
Except when the results
of the second ballot came in,
you were still in fourth
and a worse fourth.
Yeah.
So, what did you think
at that point?
Yeah.
The conventional
wisdom says,
when you come a worse
fourth on the second ballot,
you drop out.
Yeah.
You go endorse
another candidate.
Right. Right.
Did you consider that?
No. No. I think there were still
people behind me at that time.
There were, yeah.
Yeah. So, no.
As long as there were
people behind you,
you live to hopefully
secure that support
when they fall off the ballot.
Well, that was the crazy thing.
The people behind
you who dropped off
didn't go to one of the
top three candidates.
They went to you.
Yeah.
How did that happen?
Favourite
second choice.
Favourite second
choice. You know--
Did you know that
was going to happen?
No, no, but that was
my objective at the outset.
You know, I
wasn't trying
to be, like, a
superstar candidate.
I hoped that
people would say,
"You know, we could
live with that McGuinty guy.
We could do worse than
that McGuinty guy."
Compromise candidate.
Compromise candidate, right?
I'm okay with that.
You got to get
the job, right? So...
And that's how
it kind of unfolded.
This was an
extraordinary convention,
because, of course,
it started--
It not only started on one
day and ended on another day.
It started in one month and
ended in another month, right?
It was November 30 over
December 1st.
Yeah.
And fifth ballot,
4:30 in the morning,
and Joe Cordiano
was the kingmaker.
Yeah.
Did you talk
to Joe personally
in between the fourth
and fifth ballots
in order to try to
secure his delegates?
No. No.
Did you know he was
going to come to you?
No. I hoped
that he would.
The good news, I felt,
going into the campaign--
I was free and easy and
I had no obligations.
The bad news-- no
alliances.
Mm.
So I was really on my own.
Anyway, I was delighted
when Joe came over,
and then
I can recall, Steve,
what they did,
the organizers of
the convention.
They sent around
some people
to quietly whisper
into our ears
what the
results were.
So, it was me and
Gerard Kennedy
on the last vote.
Yeah.
So, I turn to
Terri and say--
(Whispering)
--"Honey, we won."
You knew before they
made the announcement.
(Aloud) We knew before
they made the announcement.
She whispered
back--
(Whispering) --"You said
you weren't going to win."
(Laughing)
So, anyway, and then the
adventure began.
Indeed. You
then become the leader
of the official opposition
at Queen's Park.
Yeah. Well, let me just
tell you one story.
Sure.
So, it took me a while
to kind of grow
into the job.
So, I had to, at 4:30
in the morning
when nobody wanted to hear
anything,
go make my way to
the podium,
leave my set
of seats, whatever,
up and walk down,
and make my way to the stage.
And there's people
everywhere, you know,
and lots of media
and all that stuff.
And at some point,
somebody says,
"Stand back and
make room for the leader."
So, I stood back.
I had yet to grow accustomed
to the notion that, somehow,
I was the leader.
So, I went up there,
gave some modest remarks,
and then I think, crazily,
there was a breakfast
the next morning,
and I had to give
a speech at breakfast.
And then, the party was over,
and everybody went home,
and Terri and the kids got
on a plane and went back home.
And then, I recall,
I was exhausted,
walking up
Yonge Street on my own,
thinking...
"What the hell
have I gotten myself into?
And I was feeling the weight of,
not of office, of expectation.
"How am I going to live up
to my party's expectations?
"How am I going to
pull them together?
"How am I going to
form a decent opposition?
"How am I going to inspire the
confidence of Ontarians?
"How am I going to
keep my family tight
"and safe throughout
all of this?"
So, that's--
(Chuckling)
That's what I was feeling,
honestly, at that time.
That's a lot.
Yeah.
How did you not,
sort of sink,
under the burden of all of that?
Day at a time.
Just a day at a time.
And I recall-- I recall, when I
first got into this building
and I had-- I got an office,
it had a security button
on it, and, um...
I pressed it.
Nothing happened.
And I thought to myself,
"Welcome to the powerlessness of
leader of the opposition."
And-- but I just took it--
just took it one day at a time.
Just take it one day at a time.
And you know,
my personal mantra
has always been
"never too high, never too low,
just relentless."
You've got to-- there are gonna
be smarter people,
they are gonna be
people who are--
have more capability
in different ways,
but I always told myself,
"Nobody will outwork me.
"I will keep doing what I need
to do to grow and to learn,
"to understand,
and to become stronger
"and more capable of meeting
the needs of Ontarians."
They say being the
leader of the opposition
is the worst job in public life.
It is. It is.
Well, on the other hand,
Mike Harris was the Premier.
So, you had a guy to oppose
who was an incredibly
polarizing figure
in Ontario political history.
Did that make the job
more invigorating for you?
Um...
In some ways.
He was a formidable foe. Right?
He had, um...
tapped into a vein
in Ontario
post the Bob Rae years.
And people were--
certainly at the outset,
were more of the view that
maybe the best government
is the least government.
Maybe if you just allow us to
keep more of our tax money
and make our own way in life,
that's what we're
looking for right now.
I had a different
philosophy, ideology,
and based on the notion
that we're at our best
when we do things together.
He said something to you
during one particularly tough
exchange during question period.
I have to say this, I think
your father would be embarrassed
to see you stand here day after
day after day in the gutter,
ruining-- ruining
the reputation of your father.
(Indistinct shouting)
SPEAKER:
Order.
(Scattered applauding)
How did you take that?
Not well.
Did you ever talk to
him about it afterwards?
No, I never did.
I just let it--
I let it pass by.
Julius Caesar,
2,000 years ago,
once said, "Nobody has ever
successfully consulted
"their reason and their
passion at the same time."
Hmm.
Or as my mother would say, "You
can't be smart and angry, Mick.
"Which one do you want to be?"
(Chuckling)
Okay.
Okay?
So, I tried to be smart, right?
And tried not to get lured
into these personal combats.
It wasn't always successful.
And probably, over time,
I may have even
launched a few of my own,
which I would have
subsequently regretted.
I think we are
at less than our best when we
stoop to those kinds of things.
Your first election
as leader is 1999,
and as I think about it,
it was a lot like
the last federal election we
just had in this country.
You got 40% of the vote,
which on most days of the week,
is enough to win
a majority government.
They ran ads against you saying,
"e's not up to the job."
Yep.
Were they right?
I was certainly
much better prepared
for my second provincial
election as leader,
I was learning on the fly.
Some days, I felt like
I was just hanging on.
But you know where I kind of
felt I turned the corner?
After the debate,
which I felt I did not do
particularly well in,
but I felt,
Steve, oddly, liberated.
I thought,
"I have nothing to lose now."
And then, my big learning
from that loss was that,
in an election,
as in public life generally,
conviction counts.
Stop trying to tell people
what you think
they want to hear.
Act as a leader
and tell them what you
think they need to hear.
They may like it,
and they may not like it.
What's important is
that you are honest with them.
I like to say
you got to worry about
what people think about you,
but you got to worry even more
about what you think about you.
Did you and Premier Harris
have a kind of a private call
after the election was over?
We did. We did.
Do you remember anything
that was said in that call?
Yeah. He was kind.
What did he say?
He said, if I can recall,
"Hang in there;
I've been there."
I remember you telling me
this many years ago,
which is why
I asked the question,
because my recollection was,
he said to you,
"You're going to be a much
better candidate next time out."
Yeah.
"Yeah, so hang in there."
Right. Right.
I mean, that's not
the kind of call
I would have expected
Mike Harris to make
to a guy he'd just defeated.
Yeah. With glee.
But he did.
Yeah, he did. He did.
2002, he steps down.
Ernie Eaves takes over,
calls an election for
October 2nd, 2003.
You have been an MPP
at this point for 13 years.
You have been the leader
of your party for seven.
How are you feeling
going into that campaign?
Feeling good.
Feeling good
not only in terms of how I felt
I was going to be stronger
as a campaigner, Steve,
I felt I had amassed
an arsenal of
really good ideas.
And I had spent--
you know, the, um...
Being leader of the opposition
is a terrible job,
as you mentioned,
but it also affords you the
luxury of taking time.
I had travelled to Ireland
to look at the Celtic Tiger,
the Irish economic
turnaround miracle.
What the hell
was that all about?
What do they do
and how do they do it?
And then, I went to the UK
and looked at Tony Blair
and what they were doing and
why that was working so well.
And then, I looked at--
you know,
the internet was
finally kicking around,
looked at other-- other
experiences across the world.
So, I felt I was coming
to the table with, um...
some great plans
and a strong vision
for what Ontario could be.
There was a moment in the
campaign when the PC party
put out a
press release calling you
"an evil reptilian
"kitten-eater
from another planet".
You're laughing now,
but your campaign reacted
with fury when that came out.
How did you react to it?
I thought it was...
I thought it was--
I thought it was funny.
I thought it was funny.
And you know what I did?
I did an event...
at a farm...
shortly after this happened,
I was in a barn,
there was a stray kitten
making its way across,
I thought,
"Do I pick this thing up?
"What if it scratches my face?"
Right?
There's a bit of a risk here.
I picked the thing up.
It was extremely cuddly.
And I gave 'em a picture,
which was well shared
in Ontario by Ontarians.
So, yeah, you know,
these things happen.
It was silly.
I saw it as more of a...
They kind of gave me
a bit of an opportunity, right?
It was so silly a criticism.
And then, that
kitten presented itself.
So, I was able
to kind of tie a bow.
And for the record,
you did not eat the cat.
I did not eat the cat,
petted it, and then put it down.
Just checking.
Yeah.
Okay.
What do you remember
from election night,
when you won 46% of
the total vote, 72 seats,
and the first Liberal majority
government since 1987?
Well, just feeling
really good, very proud.
I felt very grateful.
But, you know, because
it's kind of the McGinty way,
this is the way my dad used to
react to these kinds of things,
I also began thinking
immediately,
"Now we've got to deliver."
So, I immediately began
to turn my mind
to what kind of a construct
we needed to put in place
in order to ensure that I got
the best out of my people,
whoever those might be.
The first really tough moment
in your premiership
came when you realized that,
if you were going to keep all
the promises you made
about healthcare and education
and reinvesting in the system,
you were going to have to break
your pledge not to raise taxes,
which you had famously looked
into the camera and said.
I'm telling Ontario families
that their taxes will not
go up tomorrow or any day
under Liberal government.
Give us some sense about
how you and your team
weighed those options
about whether to break the
health and education promises,
about reinvesting in the system,
or do I break my promise
not to raise taxes?
Right, yeah. Okay, let's just
back up for a moment.
So, the Ontario Taxpayers
Federation, I think it was,
wanted me to sign a pledge.
And you did.
And I did.
In a flourish.
It was a big pledge on TV.
Now, before I did that,
of course, I said to my team,
"Are we sure that we can--
"we're going to have the
economic wherewithal
"to make the kinds of
investments that we want to make
"to restore health and vitality
to our public services,
"i.e. healthcare and education?"
They said, "No worries,
we're all over this.
"We've had independent
economists take a look at this.
"It's all good."
I said, "Okay, great."
So, I get in the government.
A couple of days later,
the senior bureaucrats
say, "Premier,
"we need to let you
in on something."
I said, "Yeah, what is that?"
"Well, you're running close
to a $6 billion deficit."
So, I kind of went into a shock.
Can I push back
on that right now?
Yeah. Yeah.
Because you had a very
smart finance critic
named Jerry Phillips, who used
to write his own newsletter
about the state of the
province's finances,
and in that newsletter,
he forecast
a $5.5 to $6 billion deficit.
So, you tell me
you were in shock.
Yeah.
He wasn't.
Okay.
Why were you?
Well, I don't recall
Jerry's prediction,
but I do recall
independent economists
telling us we were
going to be okay.
So, um...
I...
So, I kind of--
I had to grapple
with this--
you know, this, um...
huge challenge,
and it taught me a few things;
one is if you have
to swallow a toad,
don't stare at it for too long.
All right?
Just do it and
do it all at once.
You're gonna have to-- yeah.
The other expression
in politics is,
"If you know you're gonna
go there, go there."
Don't get dragged there
kicking and screaming.
Do what you have to do
in a way that is assertive
of what you believe we need
to do under the circumstances.
So, my choices were to
renege on my promise
to invest in
healthcare and education
or renege on my promise
not to raise taxes.
I decided to go with
raising taxes, which I did.
We called it a 'health premium'.
It was a tax hike.
And we dedicated all that money
to healthcare, in fairness.
And we made massive investments
in healthcare and education
over the next four years.
Now, I might as well
have given my opposition
and the media a two-by-four
so that they could hit me
about the head and shoulders
for the next four years,
which they happily did.
They did.
Right?
And then,
I got another majority.
If you're doing something
for the right reason,
that you honestly believe
is the right reason, right,
and it's not easy,
and it's not convenient,
and it may not even be popular,
if you take the time
to explain that -
and we did that
over the ensuing,
you know, three or four years -
then you will discover that
people are more understanding
than you might
otherwise have thought.
Just for fun, I'm going to
push back a little bit on this
because I recall, June 9, 2007,
you and your future opponent,
John Tory, who was leading
the PC party at the time,
were dead even in the polls.
And then, he came out with the
faith-based funding promise
to give public money
to all faiths,
not just the Catholic faith,
for their education systems,
and that's when the polls went
like that, and you pulled ahead.
So, yes,
you stuck with your conviction,
you were blunt with people,
you were honest about the way
you felt you needed to go back
on the tax hike promise;
you got really lucky, too.
Somebody made an ill-advised
promise, and you got lucky.
Is that fair to say?
Yeah. I think there's--
sure, there's some
truth to that, Steve.
But I also think that I wasn't,
in the eyes of Ontarians,
in the eyes of the electorate,
fatally flawed for
having broken that promise.
Your government
created the Greenbelt,
so I want to ask a couple
of questions about that.
This is the swath
of land all the way
from the Oak Ridges Moraine,
just north of Toronto,
around the Golden Horseshoe,
all the way to Niagara Falls.
It was an historic
decision of the time.
Why do it,
knowing that you were going to
get into a whole heap of trouble
with a lot of developers
and potential homebuyers
who wanted to build
and buy homes on that land?
Right.
If you visit places like London,
and Paris, and Madrid,
and New York,
nobody there is complaining
that previous generations
set aside too much green space.
So, I think I felt
a certain accountability
to generations yet to come.
And I thought
we need to be bold,
we need to be ambitious
on behalf of
future generations,
so that they'll have
some green space to enjoy
in days to come.
But when the rich developers,
who often gave money to your
party, came to you and said,
"Get my bloody land
out of the Greenbelt;
"I want to build there,"
how did you push back on that?
I get it. No, I understand it.
And, you know, there are--
there are always going to be
pressing immediate
financial imperatives.
and the responsibility
of leadership
is to weigh those against
other responsibilities
and other accountabilities.
So, we set this up.
It's the biggest urban
greenbelt in the world.
They came to me
originally and said,
"Here's a proposal
for 600,000 acres."
And I said,
"Let's take a look at this now
and let's consult some people
"and see how
we might make it bigger,"
and we got it to
1.8 million acres.
Okay, let me circle back
to the 2007 election now.
We talked about John Tory
and the faith-based
funding promise;
when that promise came out--
and as I say,
you two were tied in the polls
when that promise came out,
and then the you-know-what
hit the fan for him.
NEWS ANCHOR:
The only issue with
any traction,
it seemed,
was faith-based funding,
and eventually,
John Tory backed off.
JOHN TORY:
It turned out to be more
divisive than I thought.
The depth of feelings
was very strong.
And so,
I listened to the people.
Did you immediately understand
that that was
an opening for you?
Probably not at the outset.
The concern I had was,
as I thought about it,
is that the theory behind
publicly funded education
is that we bring all
our kids from all backgrounds,
all socioeconomic circumstances,
all religions together,
so that they can learn from each
other and grow together.
I remember you making speeches
during that campaign,
and you went to a Catholic,
you know, school system
when you were a kid.
Yes. Yeah.
Did you-- I mean,
when the words came out of your
mouth, did you realize,
"I might be sounding
a bit hypocritical here?"
Well, that's our
constitutional reality.
Would we rebuild a, um...
...two-school system
for our Ontario education,
if we had to do it
over from scratch today?
I don't know if we would.
I don't think we would,
but it's our reality.
But I can say that,
knowing what I know
of the Catholic schools today,
you're gonna
find all kinds of faiths now
going into our Catholic schools.
Yep. You won a second
consecutive majority government
on the 10th of October 2007.
Did you know at the time, you
were the first Liberal Premier
in 70 years to win
back-to-back majorities?
No. I didn't think
about those things.
Thank you, Ontario.
My friends, those are the first
words of the next four years.
(Audience cheering)
Now that you know it,
how cool do you think it is?
You were probably
the guy that told me about it
because you pay
attention to those things.
I thought it was--
it was great, right?
And I felt for my team.
And yeah, sure, you know,
I'm the leader of the party and
I'm the head of the government,
but you're only
as good as your team,
and I had a strong team,
and I worked hard
to get the best out of my team.
And to harken back to, you know,
one of the early life
experiences, you know, my dad,
six four,
240 pounds, PhD,
kind of, you know, towering
over us at the dinner table,
and one of the lessons
he would offer, he says,
"Kids, I want you to remember
something,
"nobody here is
as strong as all of us,
"nobody here is
as smart as all of us."
So, we're here today,
and we're talking a lot about
my leadership, my premiership,
and what I did.
The truth of the matter is -
and I'm not saying this
to be, you know, unduly...
Modest.
...modest,
I had a great team,
and I stood on their shoulders.
And you know,
if I ever thought,
for example, that, um...
I was meeting
with foreign dignitaries,
maybe here in my office,
and I thought for a moment,
"I may be the best versed
on this subject
"right now in this room,"
I thought to myself,
"Ontarians are now
in deep trouble
"because they're relying
on this brain alone."
So, I really worked hard
to leverage
collective wisdom.
Your third election,
October 6th, 2011,
was, in some respects,
the most fascinating one
because, of course,
you came one seat short
of a third consecutive
majority government.
And I wonder, at what point
does the premier of the day
stop asking himself
the question,
"Damn it all, if only we
could have won one more seat,
"how different that
third term might have been?"
Yeah, it's amazing.
It's amazing, Steve.
And I recall talking to, um,
Stephen Harper; he said,
"Too bad you didn't have
the minority first."
I didn't understand how
challenging--
I didn't really
understand how challenging
a minority government
was going to be.
You'd never been part of one.
I'd never been
part of one, right?
There was the Rae years,
the Harris years,
my first two governments.
It was like, you know,
easy breezy,
smooth sailing here, right?
You want something,
then, you get it done.
We got the numbers.
So, uh,
talk about a cold shower.
I quickly came to
understand how--
and it was not just the, um--
uh, the, um...
the parliamentary rules,
but the opposition
was sick of me.
They were sick of me.
I'd been around.
I had won two in a row,
two big majorities in a row.
They thought, "Okay, you know,
"it's time for
a change up here, right?
"It's time for me to sit over
there, and McGinty to sit,
"ideally, elsewhere,
outside of this place."
So, yeah, we didn't
have the best
kind of emotional platform
upon which to build warm
and fuzzy relationships.
I like to note, in history,
as well,
that, by winning three in a row,
you're the most successful
Liberal Premier
since Oliver Mowat
in the 19th century.
Yeah.
Did you know that, as well,
at the time?
Once you told me.
(Laughing)
Seriously? You didn't
know that before then?
No.
Really?
Okay.
Yeah.
What did one seat short
of a majority mean,
though, in terms of your ability
to get whatever program you
wanted to through the house?
It was hell. It was hell.
Like, from budgets
to committees, right?
It meant that
the opposition was,
by and large, in charge,
and any progress
we wanted to make
required the support of
somebody on the other side.
So, it became, uh...
slow and frustrating.
There was a lot of animosity.
Um... We were at--
you know, I think I would say,
in fairness, as a group,
all the members of
provincial parliament,
we were at less than our best
in terms of making
progress for Ontarians.
And so, you know,
that was my reality.
And so, we just worked as hard
as we could to find a way to--
you know, we got a budget
through at the outset.
I think one of the things that--
the expectations that,
in order to secure
the support of the NDP,
they wanted a tax
on the wealthiest Ontarians,
which we put in place.
And then, it was kind of a--
you know, kind of a...
an as-is basis to
see what you can get
tabled in the house,
passed through committee,
and then eventually
become, you know, law.
So, it was--
it was a lot of work.
You will be disappointed
if I don't raise
a few of the difficult
times that you had.
I got to go now, Steve.
(Chuckling)
No, not yet.
Not yet.
Get comfortable, in fact,
because I do want to put a few
of them on the record here.
There was a problem
around eHealth,
where certain corners were cut
in order to create a
digitised health record system.
Your health minister
resigned over that one.
There was the
Orange Air Ambulance problem,
where they were engaging in
some questionable spending
and business practices.
Your favourite, without
question, was the two gas plants
that you ended up cancelling
in Oakville and Mississauga,
but whose contracts
ultimately had to be
paid out and therefore,
at considerable expense,
those plants were cancelled.
I don't want to
relitigate all those issues
and go through
chapter and verse,
but I am interested in the
bigger question, which is,
when a premier is
in the midst of scandal,
and, every day,
he or she comes to office,
the papers are awful,
the opposition is awful,
you can't get away from it, what
are the lessons one takes away
from succeeding under
those circumstances?
Yeah. Okay.
So, there are a few
thousand agencies,
boards, and commissions
for which governments of all
stripes are responsible.
If you take your
eye off those things,
they can come back
and bite you,
and that's what happened with
eHealth, and with Orange,
and with the OPA when it
came to locating gas plants.
Do I bear
responsibility for those?
Of course.
That's how our democracy works.
Those boards are
ultimately accountable to me,
my government, our cabinet.
So, yeah, that's the
challenge, though,
is you've got so many--
you got so many balls in the air
that it's just a matter of time.
I don't care who you are,
what your political stripe is,
at some point in time...
there's gonna be a slip.
And I think the issue is not
whether there's gonna be a slip,
it's how you react
when there is that slip.
Let me ask about that. Did you
ever come into the office
one day and look at your team
on maybe day 87 of the
gas plant scandal, and say,
you know, "Guys,
what the hell are we doing here?
"Can we please
get our act together?"
And like, did you lose your...
you know what
with the with the team?
I'm not a screamer.
I'm not a screamer, Steve.
You know,
I might have, you know,
undoubtedly, pulled together
my senior team and said,
"Hey, you know, are we--
are we going to--
"are we going to
drown in this forever?
"I mean, is there any--
does anybody here see land?
"Are we going to
get out of this body of water
"and dry off
at some point in time?"
These things come and go.
And I'm not trying to
diminish their importance,
but they are part of a healthy,
vibrant, dynamic democracy.
And, um...
And people--
the opposition
has the right and, indeed,
the obligation to
point out shortcomings.
No government is going
to do things perfectly.
Ideally, they're going
to do some good things.
And the public
is entitled to see,
you know, the government
being held to account.
How does, though-- how does the
first minister show up for work
every day when you
can't get away from it?
It's in the papers all the time.
People are yelling at you,
presumably,
at protests and demonstrations.
Right.
How do you keep
your sense of sanity
under those circumstances?
For me, it's just
a strong sense of duty.
It's your job.
You signed on for it.
There are going
to be some easy days,
there are going
to be some hard days.
You can't just
sign on for sunshine.
There are going to
be storms on occasion.
And I think
the other thing, Steve,
is I also took a lot of pride
in what we were able to achieve.
Um...
We...
We were said to have
the best schools in the OECD.
We went from Canada's longest
healthcare wait times,
to its shortest
healthcare wait times.
We found family doctors
for 1.2 million more Ontarians.
We adopted the HST, right?
That was said
to be the third rail.
"You touch that one,
McGinty, you're dead."
You're the only guy, I think,
who brought in that
kind of tax reform
and won the next election.
Everybody else lost.
Right. And it saves--
still today,
it saves Ontario businesses
over $5 billion every year.
You know,
we talk about the coal plants.
When I left--
at their worst, Steve,
we had 52 smog days a year
in southern Ontario.
Since we shut down
the last one, we've had zero.
So, every government
is going to screw up
from time to time.
It's not whether you do,
it's whether you acknowledge it
and take steps to
ensure it doesn't recur.
For example,
just to go back to...
me changing my mind
and raising taxes,
in 2003, after I said
I wouldn't -
we passed a law in Ontario
saying that the books,
effectively,
have to be made transparent
before every election.
That was adopted
by every other province
and the federal government.
So, you can learn
from these things
and take steps to
ensure they don't recur.
You know, somebody
asked me, you know,
of which, um...
initiative
are you most proud?
I think it might be
full-day kindergarten -
250,000 kids every year,
since we've had that in place,
who are benefiting
from an early start.
When I think back of
my time as leader,
17 years as leader of my party,
Jean Chrétien said
that I'm the longest serving
party leader alive today.
Out of any party?
Out of any party.
Federal or provincial?
Yes.
Huh.
17 years, it's a long time.
So, it gives me a bit of
depth of an experience there.
Um...
I loved the experience.
I want to finish up with a few
personal questions, if I can.
Yep.
Starting with the
fact that you are
a few weeks away
from turning 70.
Right.
Can you believe it?
No.
Are you where you want to be
for a 70-year-old person?
Yeah, I feel very lucky.
I feel very lucky.
I've-- I've, um...
For me, Steve,
I've reduced it to six questions
I already know that
I'm gonna ask on my deathbed.
Mm-hmm.
And those questions are,
number one...
"Was I a good son?"
Number two,
"Was I a good brother?"
Number three,
"Was I a good husband?"
Number four,
"Was I a good dad?"
Number five,
"Was I there for my friends?
Was I a good friend?"
And number six, "Did I just
occupy space and consume goods
"or did I make
a difference for others?"
How do you answer all the
questions you just asked?
Well, I... like to think
I'm trying hard to be able to
answer a yes to all of those.
And interesting,
so "Was I a good premier?"
is not one of your questions,
or does that come
under the sixth question?
That would come under the sixth.
It does.
That would come
under the sixth, yeah.
What are you spending
your time on these days?
So, I got to know myself again
after getting out of politics
and discovered that
I'm quite entrepreneurial.
And so, I have
a kind of buffet of things
that I like to do
that I've been doing.
Right now, I serve as chair
of the University of Ottawa
Heart Institute.
I am working on developing
a new gap year program
for the city of Ottawa.
Ideally,
it will have spillover
and be adopted
by other communities
around the country.
I do work with everything from
an education technology company,
to a, um...
a rowing machine company,
to, um...
a cancer drug
development company.
I've just written another book
that's coming out shortly.
Um...
I'm...
What's it called,
the book?
Be a Good One.
It's based on a quote from
Jeremy Bentham, who once said,
"Whatever you are in life,
be a good one."
This one is
dedicated to politicians.
And maybe my most important
responsibility these days
is I'm a granddad.
I've got six grandkids,
and I've discovered,
Steve, that the interest is
even sweeter than the principle.
(Chuckling)
One question I've always
wanted to ask you
is that there has been
a kind of a post-political life
that many people who've enjoyed
the kind of success
you've had in politics take,
which is you
usually get ensconced
at a very big law firm
as a senior counsel
and then you go sit on,
you know, whatever,
a dozen different boards
of directors and so on,
and you get rich, frankly,
and you have not taken
that path. How come?
It's not-- well, you know,
you got to be--
you got to do what-- what--
what moves you, inspires you,
you know, turns your crank.
And so, I didn't-- I didn't--
I'm a fellow at a couple of
universities, as well,
so I get to hang around
young people,
and get to understand a world
that I never grew up in,
and they help teach me things,
so I can bring those to bear
in decision-making
that I may be making elsewhere.
But you've got to--
you know, life is short
and you better do--
you better spend it
doing things that
you really enjoy.
When does a premier
stop relitigating
or rethinking all of the
decisions that he or she made
and think, you know,
"If only I'd done this.
"I should have done that.
Why didn't I do it this way?"
Or do you still do
that in your own head?
I don't do that.
You don't do that.
I don't do that. I...
I live with what I have done.
I draw what lessons I might
from those, and ideally,
I'm able to
impart that to others.
I speak about leadership from
time to time, for example,
especially when
I'm working with young people.
I mentor young people,
a few business leaders,
as well.
So, no, I don't look back
on my--
any of my time
in politics with deep regret.
Could I have
done some things better?
Absolutely.
Who couldn't in any endeavour?
But I think that,
on the whole, I just--
I feel... very grateful.
I mean, what are there, 16
million people in Ontario now?
15 million people,
whatever the heck it is?
One gets to serve as premier.
I got to do that for ten years.
It's just...
What a privilege, what an honour
.
Were there ups and downs?
How could there not be?
Let's finish on this.
In spite of everything,
and boy, you have had some
high highs and some low lows,
would you do it again?
Absolutely.
Because?
In a minute.
Because it's-- you know,
to be in a position to...
You know what the real
privilege of government is?
You get to define
the public interest.
That's heady stuff.
"What do you think
is the best for all of us?"
And to be in a position
to define that,
and then flesh that out,
and lend shape to it,
and put in place policies,
to me, it was so--
Steve, it's just so
exceptionally rewarding
to have made differences
in our schools,
and in our healthcare,
and the quality of our air,
and the strength
of our economy.
Where else
can you do that stuff?
It's-- you know,
I think Davis said--
Bill Davis said,
"The best day
in the private sector
"can't compare
to the worst day as premier."
It's just, there's so--
I mean, the world is your oyster
when you're in that office,
and you can make
so many changes.
Premier McGinty,
thank you for your time.
Pleasure, Steve.
