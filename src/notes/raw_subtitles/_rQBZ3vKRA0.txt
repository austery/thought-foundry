[Music]


hi
 everyone
 and
 big
 thanks
 for
 taking


the
 time
 on
 you
 know
 we've
 been
 trying


to
 get
 you
 on
 the
 podcast
 since
 uh
 we


started
 it
 two
 years
 ago
 so
 we
 are
 super


pleased
 that
 we
 that
 we
 have
 you
 on
 and


indeed
 on
 your
 xplatform
 how
 cool
 yeah


uh
 it's
 pretty
 cool
 yeah
 I
 mean
 you
 have


like
 lots
 of
 people
 from
 all
 around
 the


world
 uh
 simultaneously
 do
 effectively
 a


realtime
 podcast
 and
 uh
 it
 works
 pretty


well
 very
 good
 well
 we
 have
 so
 much
 to


talk


about


[Music]


uh
 love
 to
 kick
 off
 with
 with
 AI
 um
 now


what's
 your
 take
 on
 where
 we
 are
 in
 the


AI
 race
 just


now
 wow
 that's
 a
 long
 answer


um
 there's
 there's
 so
 much
 happening
 in


AI
 is
 the
 fastest
 advancing
 technology


that
 I've
 ever
 seen
 of
 any
 kind
 and
 I've


seen
 a
 lot
 of
 Technology
 um
 you
 know


barely
 a
 week
 goes
 by
 with
 without
 some


new


announcement


so
 uh
 and
 if
 you
 look
 at
 the
 amount
 of


uh
 AI
 Hardware
 the
 computers
 coming


online
 that
 are
 dedicated
 to
 AI
 that
 is


increasing
 what
 looks
 like
 at
 least
 by
 a


factor
 of
 10
 every
 year
 if
 not
 every
 six


to
 n


months
 so
 when
 you
 combine
 the
 hardware


um
 Coming
 online
 really
 order
 of


magnitude
 increase
 every
 you
 know
 call


at
 least
 every
 9
 months
 um
 and
 uh
 many


many
 software
 breakthroughs


uh
 if
 you
 look
 at
 that
 that
 curve
 it


looks
 insane
 so
 I
 think
 we'll


um
 my
 my
 my
 guess
 is
 that
 we
 we'll
 have


ai
 that
 is
 smarter
 than
 any
 any
 one


human
 probably
 to
 around
 the
 end
 of
 next


year
 um
 and
 then


AI
 the
 total
 amount
 of
 sort
 of
 sentient


compute
 of
 AI
 I
 think
 will
 probably


exceed
 all
 humans
 in
 5


years
 what
 what
 is
 the
 what
 is
 the
 race


about
 just
 now
 is
 it
 algorithms
 is
 it


people
 is
 it
 computing
 power
 what
 what


is
 it
 about
 just
 now
 is
 it
 the
 supply
 of


chips
 just
 what
 is


it
 yeah
 last
 year
 it
 was
 uh
 chip


constraint
 um
 and
 the
 hardware


deployment
 if
 you
 break
 it
 down
 into
 the


three
 areas
 of
 people
 um
 data
 and


hardware
 and
 starting
 with
 Hardware
 last


year
 it
 was
 about
 a
 shift
 Supply
 people


could
 not
 get
 enough
 um
 in
 video
 chips


particularly
 um
 this
 year
 it's
 starting


to
 transition
 to
 a
 voltage
 Transformer


Supply
 so
 actually
 getting
 enough


voltage
 Transformers
 uh
 put
 in
 place
 so


my
 sort
 of
 very
 Niche
 joke
 is


Transformers
 for
 Transformers
 because
 a


lot
 of
 the
 AI
 That's
 run
 is
 called
 a


Transformer
 so
 you
 need
 Transformers
 to


run
 Transformers


um
 and
 then
 next
 in
 the
 if
 you
 look
 out


a
 year
 or
 two
 or
 certainly
 three
 years


um
 it's
 just
 electricity


availability


so
 that's
 those
 those
 constraints
 in
 the


hardware


side


um
 so
 many
 of
 the
 smart
 world's
 smartest


people
 are
 are
 doing
 AI
 people
 that


would
 have
 done
 physics
 before
 in
 fact


or
 had
 have
 done
 physics
 for
 example


have
 moved
 into
 AI
 because
 it's
 just
 the


fastest
 moving
 field


so
 we're
 seeing
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 best


talents
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 smartest
 humans


going
 into
 Ai
 and
 then
 uh
 we
 see
 along


with
 that
 algorithmic


breakthroughs
 um
 and
 then
 then
 you
 start


hitting
 the
 the
 wall
 with
 the
 the
 data


problem
 um
 so


the
 you
 know
 you
 can
 fit
 all
 books
 ever


written
 um
 just
 the
 text
 the
 the
 text
 in


compressed
 form
 uh
 on
 one
 hard
 drive
 or


call
 one
 one


computer
 um
 so
 when
 you
 when
 you're


looking
 at
 like
 so
 called
 tokens
 to


train
 on
 yeah
 uh
 and
 you
 you
 still
 think


of
 like
 all
 the
 books
 ever
 written
 in


every
 in
 in
 all
 languages
 by
 All
 Humans


sounds
 like
 a
 lot
 certainly
 it's
 far


more
 than
 any
 one
 human
 could
 could
 ever


read
 um
 it
 actually
 is
 a
 small
 it's
 a


small
 number
 of
 train
 training
 tokens


it's
 just
 not
 enough
 so
 then
 you
 you


start
 having
 to
 look
 at
 all
 the
 videos


of
 I
 created
 um
 you
 know
 all
 the


podcasts
 all
 the
 everything


um
 and
 and
 you
 start
 even
 running
 out
 of


data
 there
 well
 hopefully
 they
 hopefully


they
 will
 include
 this
 podcast
 uh
 that


definitely
 will
 include
 this
 podcast


what's
 the
 biggest
 challenge
 you
 have


with
 uh
 with


xai
 well
 xai
 is
 still
 relatively
 new
 so


it's
 not
 um
 you


know


uh
 like
 the
 limiting
 factor
 right
 now
 is


just
 training
 our
 Gro
 version
 2
 model


which
 should
 be
 do
 we
 think
 better
 than


GPD
 4
 um
 and
 that's
 we're
 hoping
 to


complete
 that
 in
 May
 so
 that's
 that's


training
 right
 now
 so
 it's
 just
 really


we're
 just
 trying
 to
 get
 enough
 gpus


online
 to
 train
 it
 fast
 enough
 to
 get


that
 done
 in
 May
 um
 which
 I
 think


probably
 will


happen
 um
 and


then
 and
 and
 that's
 with
 uh
 roughly


20,000


h100s
 uh
 and
 and
 doing
 I
 think
 very


efficient
 training
 then
 the
 next
 step


would
 be
 for
 GR
 3
 which
 would
 be
 I
 guess


G55
 or
 Beyond
 uh
 would
 you
 know
 requires


uh
 100,000
 Nvidia
 h100s
 training


coherently
 so
 that's
 you
 know
 a
 half


order
 of
 magnitude
 basically
 more


training
 um
 and
 then
 you
 really
 start
 to


have
 running
 into
 this
 data
 problem


where
 you
 you
 have
 to
 either
 create


synthetic
 data
 or
 use
 real
 world
 video


those
 the
 the
 two
 sources
 of
 kind
 of


like
 unlimited
 data
 are
 synthetic
 data


and
 real
 world
 video
 which
 I
 should
 say


Tesla
 has
 a
 pretty
 big
 advantage
 in
 real


world
 video
 um
 Tesla
 has
 by
 far
 the
 most


real
 world
 video
 of
 anyone
 yeah
 you've


got
 a
 huge
 Library
 there
 so
 when
 do
 you


think
 so
 when
 do
 you
 think
 we'll
 see


proper


AGI
 well
 it
 depends
 on
 how
 you
 define


AGI
 if
 you
 define
 AGI
 as
 smarter
 than


the
 smartest
 human
 I
 think
 it's
 probably


end
 of
 next
 year
 like
 like
 within
 two


years
 um
 but
 but
 that's
 that
 there's


still
 there's
 still
 a
 pretty
 big
 leap


beyond
 that
 to
 say
 smarter
 than
 the
 the


machine
 augmented
 human
 Collective
 so


like
 is
 it
 smarter
 than
 all
 humans


working
 together
 uh
 who
 are
 also
 using


computers
 to
 augment
 their
 output
 and


that
 that
 I
 think
 is
 probably
 five
 years


away
 one
 one
 way
 to
 look
 at
 it
 is
 is
 is


to
 try
 to


assess
 um
 like
 roughly
 what
 is
 the
 ratio


of
 digital
 to
 biological
 compute
 last


question
 on
 um
 on
 AI
 any
 new
 thoughts
 on


regulation
 and
 um
 how
 it
 should
 be


structured
 well
 I
 I
 think
 we
 probably
 do


need
 some
 sort
 of
 regulatory
 authority


to
 look
 at
 the
 safety
 of
 AI
 um
 just
 as


we
 have
 regulatory
 authorities
 and
 other


Arenas
 to
 um
 you
 know
 o
 oversee
 aircraft


and
 the
 safety
 of
 aircraft
 and
 cars
 and


and
 other
 things
 you
 know
 medication


so


uh
 now
 the
 rate
 at
 which
 AI
 is


progressing
 is
 is
 fast
 is
 faster
 than


probably
 any
 regulatory
 agency
 can
 keep


up
 with


um
 but
 but
 I
 do
 have
 a
 comment
 on
 what
 I


think
 is
 very
 important


before
 achieving
 safe
 AI
 which
 is
 that


uh
 it's
 very
 important
 to
 train
 the
 AI


to
 be
 as
 truthful
 as
 possible
 um
 and
 not


to


uh
 yeah
 just
 to
 be
 as
 truthful
 as


possible


um
 I
 think
 you
 can
 get
 some
 very


dangerous
 things
 when
 you
 program
 an
 AI


to
 be
 politically
 correct
 think
 that


things
 that
 may


seem
 uh
 relatively
 innocuous
 now
 but


will
 not
 be
 so
 in
 in
 the
 future
 if
 AI


has
 immense
 power
 you
 can
 take
 the


Google
 Gemini
 example
 where
 it
 it


refused
 to
 publish
 to
 produce
 a
 picture


of
 George
 Washington
 as
 a
 white
 man
 and


and
 any
 in
 fact
 any
 historical
 figure


would
 automatically
 be
 made


diverse
 um
 because
 it's
 been
 programmed


to
 insist
 on
 diversity
 which
 sounds
 you


know
 perhaps
 okay
 at
 first
 but
 not
 if


the
 AI
 has
 so
 much
 power
 that
 it
 can


actually
 enforce
 diversity
 and
 decide


there's
 too
 many
 of
 one
 kind
 of
 people


or
 too
 many
 of
 one
 sex
 and
 kill


off
 just
 just
 kill
 off
 enough
 until
 the


the
 diversity
 number
 is


is
 what
 it's
 programmed
 to
 believe
 is


correct
 but
 don't
 you
 think
 this
 will
 be


sorted
 out
 in
 the
 next


version
 no
 no
 they'll
 make
 it
 more


subtle
 okay
 and
 less
 obvious
 but
 it
 will


still
 be


there
 okay
 well
 we'll
 see
 but
 where


where
 is
 China
 where
 do
 you
 where
 is


China
 now
 in
 I
 relative
 to
 the


US
 um
 I
 I
 don't
 know
 exactly
 what
 China


is
 uh
 except
 there
 are
 a
 lot
 of
 very


smart
 people
 in
 China
 um
 and
 they
 they


won't
 be
 they
 won't
 be
 far
 behind
 the


rest
 of
 the
 world
 or
 far
 behind
 the
 US


um
 I
 mean
 the
 ai
 ai
 right
 now


is
 very
 concentrated
 in
 San
 Francisco


and


London
 um
 and
 then
 you
 know
 there's


there's
 you
 know
 a
 lot
 happening
 in
 in


China
 but
 I
 I'm
 I
 don't
 have
 insight


into
 what
 they're
 doing
 uh
 except
 that


they
 I'm
 confident
 they
 will
 not
 be
 f


behind
 uh
 what
 is
 developed
 in
 the
 west


yeah
 um


so
 but
 but
 but
 mark
 my
 words
 the
 if
 if


uh
 if
 we
 do
 not
 program
 an
 AI
 to
 be
 as


truthful
 as


possible
 that
 that
 is
 where
 it
 will
 go


arai
 that
 is
 where
 the
 danger


lies
 yeah
 mov
 moving
 T
 here
 moving
 to
 to


Tesla
 um
 is
 is
 the
 EV
 conversion
 now


going
 slower
 than
 you
 had
 expected
 just


where
 is
 the
 speed
 of
 conversion
 now


relative
 to
 your


expectations
 I
 think
 it's
 going
 quite


fast
 actually
 especially
 Norway
 um


absolutely
 well
 it's
 pretty
 much
 all


there
 is
 is
 your
 your


Teslas
 yeah
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 Teslas
 in


Norway
 it's
 crazy
 thanks
 i'
 once
 again


like
 to
 thank
 Norway
 for
 the
 support
 of


electric


vehicles
 um
 so
 much


appreciated
 time


so
 I
 think


it's
 we
 will
 the
 the
 that
 that
 electric


that
 all
 vehicles
 will
 go
 fully
 electric


uh
 it's
 only
 a
 matter
 of
 time
 um
 that


includes
 aircraft
 ultimately
 and
 boats


um
 obviously
 trains
 the
 only
 thing
 that


is
 ironically
 difficult
 to
 well
 you


can't
 really
 make
 it
 electric
 is
 Rockets


because
 you
 need
 you
 can't
 get
 away
 from


um
 having
 to
 expel
 Mass
 uh
 you
 sort
 of


Newton's
 third
 law
 um
 but
 but
 all
 cars


will
 be
 Electric
 it's
 only
 matter
 of


time
 and
 we'll
 look
 back
 on
 combustion


cause
 in
 the
 same
 way
 that
 we
 look
 at


back
 on
 uh
 steam


engines


um
 that
 that
 I
 was
 it
 was
 inevitable


that
 there
 would
 be
 internal
 combustion


cars
 and
 and
 it's
 just
 as
 inevitable


that
 o
 cost
 will
 go
 electric
 um
 and
 um


there
 will
 be
 some
 e
 and
 you
 know
 so


like
 it
 going
 to
 be
 a
 completely


straight
 up
 line
 there
 will
 be
 some
 uh
 e


and
 flow
 in
 how
 how
 far
 electric
 car
 is


going
 but
 that
 but
 the
 ultimate
 um


victory
 of
 electric
 cars
 is
 inevitable


um
 and
 and
 I
 think
 the
 sooner
 we
 get


there
 the
 better
 yeah
 how
 do
 you
 see
 the


Chinese
 competition
 here


now
 we
 generally
 find
 that
 the
 companies


in
 China
 are
 the
 most
 competitive
 in
 the


world
 and
 certainly
 in
 uh
 electric


vehicles
 or
 cars
 in
 general
 the
 Chinese


car
 companies
 are
 by
 far
 the
 most


competitive
 um
 yeah
 that's
 where
 where


we
 find
 the
 most
 toughest
 toughest


compet
 competitive


challenges
 that
 they
 make
 great
 cars
 and


they
 work
 very
 hard
 so
 when
 you
 ride
 in


one
 of
 the
 Chinese
 cars
 what
 do
 you


think
 I
 mean
 you're
 an
 engineer
 you
 know


what
 about
 it
 what
 do
 you
 what
 do
 you


think
 I
 haven't
 R
 I
 have
 not
 ridden
 in


one
 lately


but
 uh
 because
 they're
 not
 all
 available


here
 you
 know
 in
 the
 US
 or
 very
 few
 are


available
 in
 the
 US
 um
 some
 are


available
 in
 Europe
 um
 but
 from
 what
 my


team
 tells
 me
 there
 are
 very


[Music]


good
 moving
 moving
 out
 out
 in
 space


um
 what
 what
 would
 it
 take
 to
 be


self-sufficient
 at


Mars
 to
 be
 self-sufficient
 in
 Mars
 it's


really
 about
 the
 the
 total
 tonnage
 that


is
 delivered
 to
 the
 surface
 of
 Mars
 um


so
 you
 can
 say
 like


well
 um
 I
 I
 think
 it's
 probably
 on
 the


order
 of
 a
 million
 tons
 maybe
 it
 maybe


more
 but
 somewhere
 between
 probably
 a


million
 tons
 and
 10
 million
 tons
 are


needed
 to
 make
 Mars
 self-sufficient
 and


how
 many
 Rockets
 is


that
 well
 I
 gave
 a
 presentation
 on
 this


recently
 if
 people
 look
 at
 my
 my
 recent


uh
 SpaceX
 talk


but
 if
 you
 if
 you
 have


U
 really
 uh
 if
 you
 have
 100
 tons
 per


flight
 you
 need
 10,000
 flights
 to
 get
 to


a
 million
 million


tons
 um
 and
 that's
 100
 tons
 landed
 to


the
 surface
 of
 Mars
 so
 in
 order
 to
 get


100
 tons
 land
 to
 the
 surface
 of
 Mars
 you


need
 500
 five
 times
 that
 number
 in
 Earth


orbit
 um
 so
 we
 do
 a
 lot
 of
 orbital


refilling
 um
 so
 launching
 sort
 of
 uh


Rockets
 uh
 tanker
 ships
 over
 and
 over


again
 that
 that
 would
 replenish
 the


propellant
 of
 the
 ships
 that
 would
 go
 to


Mars
 um
 and
 then
 youd
 need
 a
 on
 roughly


on
 order
 of
 10,000
 of
 them
 to
 get
 to
 a


million
 tons
 um
 and


uh
 but
 we
 we
 plan
 to
 do
 that
 that
 that's


uh
 that's
 we
 think
 we
 can
 get
 that
 done


within
 20
 years
 really
 so
 and
 when
 do


you
 think
 so
 when
 do
 you
 think
 we'll
 be


there
 for
 the
 first


time
 first
 first
 uh
 well
 the


first
 Starship
 that
 will
 land
 on
 Mars


which
 obviously
 would
 not
 not
 have


people
 at
 first
 I
 think
 it's
 probably


within
 about
 5
 years
 um
 and
 then
 it


would
 probably
 launch
 several
 ships
 and


just
 confirm
 that
 they
 can
 land
 okay
 on


Mars
 um
 we'll
 also
 be
 doing
 the
 moon


simultaneously
 with
 that
 so
 uh
 go
 taking


well
 I
 think
 I
 think
 we'll
 get
 people


back
 to
 the
 Moon
 I
 should
 say
 within
 5


years
 and
 we'll
 get
 uh
 uncrewed
 ships


landed
 on
 Ms
 within
 5
 years
 and
 and
 then


we
 be
 building
 up
 the
 production
 rate
 um


and
 improving
 the
 design
 of
 the
 booster


in
 the
 ship
 so


um
 so
 in
 the
 first
 people
 on
 Mars
 I


think
 within
 seven
 years
 or
 so
 seven
 to


nine


years
 um
 and
 from
 from
 there
 we
 need
 to


rapidly
 increase
 we
 need
 massive
 numbers


of
 shifts
 going
 and
 Earth
 and
 Mars
 Only


are
 in
 the
 same
 quadrant
 of
 the
 solar


system
 roughly
 for
 six
 months
 every
 two


years
 or
 at
 least


it's
 only
 possible
 to
 really
 transfer


efficiently
 um
 from
 Earth
 to
 Mars
 I
 say


every
 six
 months
 but
 really
 there's


about
 there's
 a
 couple
 months
 where


where
 it's
 ideal
 every
 26
 months
 um
 so


every
 two
 years
 that
 you
 would
 see
 a


basically
 a
 fleet
 depart
 Mars
 and
 I


think
 it
 be
 quite
 a
 spectacular
 thing
 to


see
 a
 thousand
 ships
 depart
 from
 Mars


all
 at
 once
 like
 Battle
 Star


Galactica
 what
 kind
 of
 new
 technology
 do


we
 need
 before
 we'll
 be
 self-sufficient


there
 actually
 I
 think
 we
 have
 all
 the


tech
 we
 already
 know
 all
 the
 technology


that's
 necessary
 for
 that
 it
 just
 needs


we
 just
 need
 to
 build
 so
 no
 new
 physics


is
 needed
 for
 this
 why
 is
 it
 so


important
 for


you
 I
 think
 it's
 important
 for


Consciousness
 in


general
 um
 so
 if
 if
 we
 wish
 to
 maximize


the
 lifespan
 of


Consciousness
 then
 being
 a
 multipled


species
 will
 result
 in
 a
 much
 longer


uh
 existence
 of
 Consciousness


Consciousness
 than
 if
 we're
 on
 one


planet
 if
 we're
 on
 one
 planet
 we're


simply
 biting
 our
 time
 until
 there's


eventually
 a
 Calamity
 it
 could
 be
 soon


it
 could
 be
 a
 long
 time
 but
 eventually


something
 will
 happen
 it
 could
 be
 you
 a


global
 Therman
 nuclear
 war
 it
 could
 be


simply
 That
 civilization
 merely


subsides
 our
 civilization
 may
 not
 die


with
 a
 bang
 it
 may
 die
 with
 a
 whimper


just
 just


gradually
 falling
 into
 obsolescence
 but


if
 we're
 multiplet
 species
 then
 we've


got
 two
 planets
 and
 and
 they
 can
 support


each
 other
 um
 and
 we
 can
 go
 beyond
 two


planets
 ultimately
 to
 the
 moons
 of


Jupiter
 to
 the
 to
 the


uh
 um
 Beyond
 to
 the
 the
 outer
 parts
 of


the
 solar
 system
 and
 ultimately
 to
 other


star


systems
 so
 this
 tiny
 this
 tiny
 candle
 of


Consciousness
 that
 we
 have
 in
 this
 vast


Darkness
 can
 be


extended
 um
 and
 Amplified
 and
 we're
 just


far
 more
 likely
 to
 uh
 survive
 as
 for
 for


Consciousness
 to
 survive
 if
 we
 are


multiplet


species
 you
 don't
 think
 it'
 be
 better
 to


use
 all
 these
 resources
 and
 try
 to
 sort


out


Earth
 well
 just
 to
 put
 this
 into


perspective
 the
 amount
 of
 resources
 I'm


talking
 about
 for
 making
 life


multiplanetary
 would
 be
 less
 than
 1%
 of


all
 resources
 on


Earth
 so
 really
 you
 can
 think
 of
 it
 as


resource
 allocation
 do
 you
 think
 it's


worth
 spending
 half
 a
 percent
 of
 Earth


Resources
 to
 ensure
 uh
 that
 we
 have


redundancy
 in
 Consciousness
 and
 that
 we


extend
 Consciousness
 Beyond
 Mars
 to


other
 planets
 to
 to
 Mars
 and
 other


planets
 and
 ultimately
 other
 star


systems
 um
 and
 then
 also
 take
 into


account
 the
 fact
 that
 there
 are
 certain


inevit
 there
 are
 certain
 things
 we


simply
 cannot
 avoid
 on
 Earth
 um
 like
 is


it
 within
 your
 power
 of
 mind
 to
 stop


World
 War
 I
 I
 don't
 think
 so
 no
 if
 it


happens
 um
 and
 if
 we
 have
 theral
 Warfare


our
 technology
 level
 will
 drop
 to
 the


stern


age
 um
 and
 we
 may
 never
 survive
 and
 then


there
 are
 we
 maybe
 get
 may
 get
 hit
 like


by
 a
 comet
 like
 the
 dinosaurs
 and
 um
 you


know
 if
 the
 dinosaurs
 had
 spaceships


they
 they'll
 probably
 still
 be
 around
 um


so
 and
 then
 if
 if
 you
 wait
 long
 enough


the
 Earth
 the
 the
 sun
 will
 continue
 to


expand
 and
 eventually
 engulf
 Earth
 and


destroy
 it
 and
 destroy
 all
 life
 so
 just


to
 give
 it
 amount
 a
 certain
 amount
 of


time
 no
 matter
 what
 you
 do
 on
 Earth
 no


matter
 how
 careful
 you
 are
 um
 Earth
 will


life
 all
 life
 on
 Earth
 will
 die
 that
 it


will
 happen
 is
 a


[Music]


certainty
 on
 a
 slightly
 less
 gloomy
 note


uh
 X
 Twitter
 yeah
 um
 what
 is
 your
 vision


now
 what
 do
 you
 how
 do
 you
 see
 the
 the


vision
 of


x
 i
 goal
 of
 X
 is
 to
 be
 the
 best
 source


of
 Truth
 on
 the


internet
 um
 and
 I
 think
 we're
 making
 a


good
 you
 know
 good
 progress
 there
 and
 I


mean
 this
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 like
 I
 call


the
 everything
 app
 like
 if
 anything
 you


want
 to
 do
 you
 can
 do
 on
 the
 xplatform


um
 whether
 it's
 text
 audio
 video
 uh


payments
 Financial
 stuff


um
 Communications
 of
 all
 kinds
 um
 and


then
 but
 but
 then
 also
 where
 there
 is


publicly
 disseminated
 information
 is
 to


be
 the
 best
 source
 of
 Truth
 um
 and
 I


think
 it
 I
 think
 it
 already
 is
 that
 um


now
 people
 may
 say
 oh
 there's
 some
 piece


of
 misinformation
 disinformation
 I
 say


yes
 but
 look
 look
 at
 the
 replies
 the


reply
 is
 correct
 that
 misinformation
 and


look
 at
 Community
 notes
 and
 the
 and
 how


good
 the
 batting
 average
 of
 community


notes
 is
 it's
 extremely
 good
 it's
 by
 far


the
 best
 factchecking
 system
 on
 the


internet
 um
 so
 and
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 people


still
 labor
 under
 the
 illusion
 that
 the


the
 the
 Legacy
 newspapers
 that
 they
 read


are
 actually
 true
 there's
 so
 much


nonsense
 in
 them
 I
 mean
 ni


how
 many
 times
 when
 do
 you
 read
 an


article
 in
 a
 newspaper
 where
 you
 know


the
 circumstances
 of
 what
 that
 article


is
 and
 how
 often
 is
 it
 spot
 on
 no
 of


course
 it's
 uh
 normally
 no
 no
 of
 course


we
 all
 know
 it's
 normally
 wrong
 but
 but


how
 do
 you
 look
 not
 sure
 but
 how
 how
 do


you
 look
 at
 the
 situation
 now
 for


instance
 with
 with
 Russia
 uh
 you
 know


the
 work
 Russia
 does
 in
 Germany
 with


fake
 accounts
 on
 it's
 pretty
 pretty
 huge


uh
 activity


right
 I
 mean
 we
 don't
 see
 a
 lot
 of


Russian
 it
 to
 be
 frank
 um
 on
 the
 system


um


so
 we
 we
 see
 very
 little


um
 we
 do
 we
 do
 see
 a
 lot
 of
 lot
 of


attempts
 to
 influence
 things
 but
 they


seem
 to
 be
 coming
 from
 from
 the
 West
 not


from
 from


Russia
 right
 what
 about
 um
 what
 about


things
 like
 the
 latest
 developments
 in


in


Brazil
 and
 so
 on
 yeah
 sure
 yeah
 so
 the


the


uh
 we
 we
 kept
 getting
 these
 demands
 from


um
 uh
 this
 uh
 Judge
 Alexander
 um
 that's


his
 that's
 his
 name
 on
 Twitter
 Alexander


um
 and
 there
 would
 be
 to
 suspend


accounts
 um
 immediately
 we're
 given


typically
 two
 hours
 to
 suspend
 an


account
 or
 face
 massive
 fines
 um
 and
 the


the
 final
 sto
 we
 were
 were
 being
 given


given
 demands
 to
 suspend
 sitting
 sitting


members
 of
 the
 parliament
 and
 major


journalists
 and
 moreover
 we
 could
 not


tell
 them
 that
 it
 this
 was
 at
 the
 beest


of
 uh
 Alexander
 Morales
 we
 had
 to


pretend
 that
 it
 was
 due
 to
 our
 rules
 of


service
 and
 that
 was
 the
 final
 straw
 and


we
 said
 no
 now
 um
 when
 you
 when
 you


bought
 Twitter
 um
 now
 renamed
 X
 did
 you


expect
 that
 you
 would
 end
 up
 in
 these


type
 of
 situations
 so
 it's
 is
 all


unexpected


well
 I
 knew
 it
 wouldn't
 be
 just
 a
 total


B
 of
 roses
 um
 you
 know
 and
 it's
 fing
 I


[Laughter]


wouldn't
 um
 no
 I
 mean
 I
 thought
 it
 would


be
 since
 we're
 just
 like
 rigorously


trying
 to
 pursue
 the
 the
 the
 goal
 of


being
 the
 most
 accurate
 and
 truthful


place
 in
 the
 internet
 and
 that
 that


doesn't
 mean
 that


what
 is
 said
 is
 always
 true
 or
 accurate


but
 is
 it
 is
 perhaps
 another
 way
 to


frame
 it
 is
 as
 the
 least
 inaccurate


place
 on
 the
 internet
 do
 you
 do
 you
 see


clear
 do
 you
 secretly
 think
 this
 is
 a


bit


fun
 it's
 fun
 yeah
 yeah
 it's
 fun
 at
 times


it's
 stressful
 at
 times
 and
 it's
 fun
 at


times
 um
 but
 overall
 we're
 trying
 to


serve
 the
 people
 of
 Earth
 um
 and
 and
 and


this
 is
 sort
 of
 an
 S
 sort
 of
 maybe
 an


esic
 way
 of
 viewing
 it
 but
 um
 to
 try
 to


be
 kind
 of
 like
 the
 the
 group


consciousness
 of
 Earth
 so
 you
 can
 think


of
 like
 if
 each
 person
 is
 like
 a
 neuron


contributing
 to
 like
 the
 collective


brain
 of
 Earth
 and
 you
 want
 to
 try
 to


minimize
 the
 noise
 and
 maximize
 the


signal
 of
 every
 neuron
 that's
 connected


to
 the
 the
 X
 Network
 that
 that's


basically
 what
 what
 is
 what
 is
 the


collective
 will
 of
 of
 humanity
 and
 and


how
 and
 and
 and
 how
 to
 yeah
 just
 serve


the
 collective
 will
 of
 humanity
 and
 so


serve
 the
 greater
 good
 that
 that's
 our


goal
 um
 now


there
 there's
 definitely
 going
 to
 be


people
 who
 want
 to
 manipulate
 that


information
 and
 so
 we
 have
 to
 fight
 that


and
 try
 to
 have
 uh
 you
 know
 be
 it
 be
 the


most
 accurate
 place
 as
 part
 to
 the
 best


of
 our
 ability
 and
 have
 it
 be
 kind
 of
 a


Marketplace
 of
 ideas
 where
 people
 can


propose
 ideas
 and
 you
 know
 debate
 them


and
 um
 I
 think
 so
 far
 it's
 working


reasonably
 well
 in
 that
 regard
 um
 now


people
 that
 don't
 like
 the
 truth
 will


not
 like
 those


or
 if
 they
 want
 to
 manipulate
 things


they
 will
 not
 like
 it
 but
 only
 but
 only


a
 few
 years
 ago
 you
 were
 you
 were
 a
 guy


um
 producing
 electric
 vehicles
 now
 you


are
 you
 know
 through
 starlink
 you've
 had


some
 you
 know
 I
 mean
 some
 big
 impact
 in


in


Ukraine
 uh
 with
 Twitter
 you
 are
 kind


of
 into
 some
 issues
 in
 uh
 you
 know


Brazil
 India


Turkey
 um
 you
 know
 you're
 becoming
 like


a
 real
 geopolitical


force
 and
 a
 really
 important
 one
 how
 do


you
 how
 do
 you
 look
 at


that
 well
 like
 I
 said
 I'm
 really
 I'm


trying


to
 take
 the
 set
 of
 actions
 that
 maximize


the
 probability
 that
 the
 future
 is
 good


um
 I
 mean
 we
 have
 to
 keep


civilization
 going
 onward
 and
 upward
 as


much
 as
 possible
 and
 um
 and
 try
 to


minimize
 the
 civilizational
 threats
 that


occur
 um
 you
 know
 we
 we
 we
 can't
 get
 to


Mars
 if
 civilization
 collapses
 it's
 not


going
 to
 happen
 so


um
 you
 know
 we've
 got
 to
 we've
 got
 to


keep


um
 keep
 civilization
 going
 um
 and
 I


think
 we
 should
 view
 our
 civilization
 as


being
 much
 more
 fragile
 than
 we
 think
 we


kind
 of
 take
 for
 granted
 oh
 it's
 always


going
 to
 be
 there
 but
 actually
 if
 you


study
 history
 you
 realize
 that
 there


Rise
 you
 know
 there's
 rise
 and
 fall


civilization


um
 I
 mean
 I
 was
 I
 was
 reading
 in
 depth


about
 the
 ancient


samarians
 um
 who
 were
 arguably
 the
 first


civilization
 if
 you
 call
 civilization


like
 writing
 and
 stuff
 you
 know
 they


were
 the
 first
 to
 develop
 writing
 um
 and


uh
 but
 eventually
 they
 died
 out
 and
 they


were


gone
 so
 and
 then
 nobody
 could
 read
 the


writing
 at
 all
 and
 and
 they
 they
 just


faded
 out
 as
 a


civilization
 um
 but
 they're
 pretty


impressive
 in
 their
 time


and
 the
 ancient
 Egyptians
 the
 same
 thing


um
 and
 uh
 you
 know
 one
 sort
 of
 one
 after


another
 uh
 ancient
 Greek
 had
 it
 Greece


had
 its
 day
 uh
 you
 know
 China
 and
 India


had
 will
 have
 incredibly
 impressed


populations
 but
 there's
 been
 EVs
 and


flows
 in
 the
 uh
 CH
 China
 and
 Indian


civilizations
 over
 the
 the
 the
 aons
 you


know
 the


blenn
 as
 well
 um


so
 you
 know
 I
 I
 guess
 I'm
 just
 trying
 to


take
 this
 this
 set
 of
 the
 steps
 that


um
 increase
 uh
 the
 scope
 and
 scale
 of


Consciousness
 that's
 that's
 what
 I'm


trying
 to
 do
 it's
 not
 it's
 not
 that
 I'm


trying
 to
 have
 a
 put
 a
 political
 thumb


on
 the
 scale
 or
 anything
 like
 that
 um


but
 I
 I
 think
 I'm
 trying
 to
 have
 the


political
 will
 go
 where
 the
 people
 want


it
 to


[Music]


go
 you
 you
 mentioned
 some
 um


some
 uh
 uh
 really
 smart
 people
 here
 and


um
 kind
 of
 just
 moving
 t
 a
 bit
 here
 to


Copa
 culture
 now
 you
 manage
 a
 lot
 of


geniuses
 in
 your
 in
 your
 companies
 what


is
 the
 key
 to
 manage
 really
 smart
 people


you


think
 I
 don't
 I
 don't
 think
 I
 manage


smart
 people
 they
 manage
 themselves


um
 I
 I


think
 well
 I
 guess
 with
 really
 smart


people
 you
 know
 I
 don't
 really
 think
 of


of
 it
 like
 managing
 them
 I
 think
 that
 if


somebody's
 very
 smart
 and
 talented
 they


they
 can
 go
 anywhere
 and
 do
 anything


anytime
 like
 if
 they
 they
 they
 don't


have
 to
 work
 with
 me
 they
 could
 go


anywhere
 so
 I
 I
 really
 just
 say
 like


look
 this
 is
 the
 the
 goal
 we're
 after


and
 this
 is
 what
 we're
 trying
 to
 achieve


and
 do
 you
 agree
 with
 this
 goal
 and
 if


you
 do
 then
 let's
 try
 to
 get
 it
 done
 um


and
 um
 you
 know
 provide
 my
 opinion
 along


the
 way
 and
 once
 in
 a
 while
 I'll
 say


look
 guys
 you
 just
 got
 to
 trust
 me
 on
 on


this
 one
 we
 got
 to
 do
 this
 thing
 and
 if


it
 turns
 out
 to
 be
 a
 bad


decision
 you
 we
 can
 can
 all
 hold
 that


against
 me
 in
 the
 future
 but
 you
 have
 an


incredible
 eye
 for
 detail
 right
 I
 mean


when
 we
 read
 the
 is
 book
 um
 it's
 pretty


clear
 that
 you
 I
 mean
 you
 really
 are
 are


deep
 into
 detail
 and
 know
 what
 you
 talk


about
 so
 how
 do
 you
 how
 do
 you
 balance


this
 um
 kind
 of
 micromanagement
 of
 some


areas
 and
 then
 delegate


other
 I
 wouldn't
 I
 wouldn't
 call
 it


micromanagement


um
 it's
 just
 insisting
 on
 atttention
 to


detail
 that
 um
 if
 you're
 trying
 to
 make


a
 perfect
 product
 you
 must
 have


attention
 to
 attent
 attention
 to
 details


essential


um
 and
 I
 haven't
 actually
 read
 the


isacon
 book
 you
 should
 it's
 very
 good


actually
 I
 Lov


it
 well
 I
 I
 asked
 Walter
 isacon
 if
 I


should
 read
 it
 and
 he
 said
 I
 shouldn't


um


so
 so


then
 he
 said
 I
 shouldn't
 read
 it
 so
 okay


well
 I'll
 I'll
 ask
 you
 some
 questions


from
 the
 book
 then
 they
 you
 he
 talks


about
 you
 know
 you
 the
 kind
 of
 the


hardcore
 and
 Ultra
 Hardcore


culture
 what
 is
 an
 Ultra
 Hardcore


culture
 I
 guess
 it's
 work
 I
 mean
 it's


working
 culture
 right
 I
 mean
 how
 how
 I


mean
 Ultra
 hard
 work
 how
 hard
 is


that
 well
 when
 things
 get
 really
 intense


you're
 basically
 just
 working
 every


waking
 hour


and
 how
 and
 how
 long
 can
 you
 do
 that


for
 I've
 done
 that


for
 well
 continuously
 for
 sometimes
 like


a
 few
 years
 what
 does
 it
 what
 does
 it
 du


to
 you
 it
 really
 it's


pain
 um
 and
 and
 every
 waking
 hour
 maybe


it's
 an
 exaggeration
 because
 there
 are
 a


few
 hours
 um
 obviously
 with
 friends
 and


family
 and
 and
 critical
 other
 things
 um


but
 100
 hour
 weeks
 would
 be
 I
 I've
 done


many
 many
 stretches
 of
 100
 hour
 weeks


like
 true
 100
 hour
 weeks


um
 where
 roughly
 six
 hours
 per
 day
 is


sleeping
 um
 I
 would
 not
 recommend
 that


this
 is
 not
 that's
 for
 emergencies
 you


know
 it's
 not
 uh
 all
 the


time
 um
 you
 know
 during
 very
 difficult


times
 at
 Tesla
 I've
 had
 to
 do
 that
 and


sometimes
 at
 the
 beginning
 of
 my
 earlier


start
 offs
 I
 did
 that
 where
 I
 just


wouldn't
 leave
 the
 office
 I
 would
 just


sleep
 under
 my
 desk
 and
 just
 work
 seven


days
 a
 week


um
 sometimes
 it's
 necessary
 for
 success


or
 or
 to
 avoid


failure
 um
 but
 but
 do
 you
 you
 do
 you


enjoy
 being
 in
 this
 crisis


mode
 no
 I
 don't
 it


sucks
 okay
 no
 I
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 be


there
 it's


pain
 but
 sometimes
 it's
 the
 between


success
 and


[Music]


failure
 when
 you
 make
 decisions
 how


important
 is


speed
 he
 just
 gave
 me
 an
 idea
 which
 is


um
 I'm
 GNA
 invite
 the
 uh
 Judge
 Al


Alexander
 R
 uh
 to
 do
 a
 spaces
 and
 then


he
 can
 explain
 why
 what
 I'm
 doing
 is
 bad


and
 and
 and
 maybe
 he's
 right


I
 challenge
 I
 challenge
 him
 to
 a


spacers
 sounds
 good
 yeah
 but
 what
 about


when
 you
 make
 when
 you
 when
 you
 make


decisions
 how
 how
 important
 is
 speed
 and


how
 do
 you
 how
 do
 you
 balance
 analysis


with
 your
 gutfield


I
 think
 the


the
 the
 best
 offense
 and
 defense
 is


speed
 if
 you
 think
 of
 something
 like
 the


SR71
 Blackbird
 it
 really
 had
 almost
 no


defenses
 except


accelerate
 and
 it
 was
 never
 shut
 down


even
 once
 like
 I
 think
 over
 3,000


missiles
 were
 shot
 at
 the
 SR71
 blackb


and
 non


hit
 and
 and
 really
 what
 it
 did
 was
 just


go
 faster
 so
 the
 the
 power
 of
 speed


is
 uh
 underappreciated
 as
 a
 competitive


Dimension
 um
 is
 that


why
 um
 you
 know
 Space
 X
 expenence
 has


been
 so
 successful


because
 you've
 been
 mean
 and
 lean
 as
 an


organization
 and
 fast
 think
 speed
 speed


is
 uh
 definitely
 a
 factor
 now
 I
 should


say
 you
 want
 to
 go
 in
 the
 case
 of
 a


company
 you
 you
 need
 to
 be
 a
 vector
 not


a
 scaler
 so
 it
 can't
 be
 you
 need
 to
 go


at
 high
 speed
 in
 the
 right


direction


sure
 so
 can
 I
 just


so
 and
 no
 company's
 going
 to
 be
 going
 in


the
 right
 direction
 all
 the
 time
 you


have
 to
 do
 course


Corrections
 like
 a
 guided
 missile
 you


qued
 course
 Corrections
 um
 and
 uh
 but
 in


the
 case
 of
 SpaceX
 it's
 like
 okay
 our


goal
 is
 to
 extend
 Humanity
 beyond
 Earth


um
 and
 we
 didn't
 even
 know
 how
 to
 even


frame
 the
 question
 correctly
 like
 what


what
 which
 knew
 that
 that
 was
 the


General


goal
 um
 we
 didn't
 know
 what
 pent
 we'
 use


or
 what
 the
 raw
 materials
 would
 be
 or


for
 the
 how
 would
 the
 rocket
 be
 built


how
 would
 it
 be
 designed
 what's
 actually


important
 um
 and
 uh
 you
 know
 so
 for


example
 going
 from
 our
 Falcon


architecture
 which
 is
 um
 uses
 refined


jet
 fuel
 and
 liquid
 oxygen
 um
 in
 a
 um


open
 cycle
 gas
 generator
 architecture


engine
 to
 a
 to
 Starship
 which
 is
 a


uh
 liquid
 methane
 liquid
 oxygen


um
 uh
 propellant
 uh
 in
 a
 staged


combustion
 very
 high
 pressure


engine


um
 that
 that
 that's
 that's
 a
 big


architectural
 change
 um
 but
 we
 didn't


know
 that
 we
 we
 needed
 to
 make
 that


architectural
 change
 until
 we're
 pretty


far
 down
 the


road
 like
 about
 halfway
 took
 us
 about
 10


years
 to
 figure
 out
 that
 was
 even
 the


right
 architecture
 now
 we're
 confident


it
 is
 um
 just
 um
 we
 were
 on
 um
 uh
 risk-


taking
 and
 so
 on
 I
 think
 SpaceX
 is
 one


of
 the
 best
 example
 I
 know
 about
 uh
 what


we
 call
 failing
 well
 right
 learning
 from


mistakes
 and
 moving
 on
 um
 what
 generally


how
 do
 you
 how
 do
 you
 look
 at


mistakes
 well
 I
 mean
 which
 which
 ones
 do


you
 tolerate
 and
 which
 ones
 don't
 you


tolerate
 well
 I
 I
 I


think
 I
 don't
 really
 think
 of
 that
 way


uh
 you
 know
 the
 first
 three
 flights
 of


SpaceX
 failed
 um
 the
 fourth
 one


succeeded


and
 if
 if
 the
 fourth
 one
 had
 not


succeeded
 we
 would
 have
 gone
 bankrupt
 we


would
 have
 had
 no
 money
 left
 so
 it
 was
 a


very
 close


call
 um
 but
 since
 then
 space
 has
 done


very
 well
 it's
 now
 the
 the
 Falcon
 9
 you


know
 knock
 on
 wood
 is
 the
 most
 reliable


rocket
 in
 the
 world
 um
 and
 launches


about
 every
 um
 two
 to
 three
 days
 now
 um


last
 question
 on
 risk
 what
 are
 the
 types


of
 risk
 you
 would
 not
 want
 to


take


uh


well
 I
 I
 think
 in
 in
 terms
 of
 risks
 you


don't
 you
 you
 don't
 want
 to
 take
 risks


that
 where
 if
 if
 you
 only
 want
 to
 take


bet
 the
 company
 risks
 if
 they're


absolutely
 necessary
 so
 there
 have
 been


a
 few
 times
 where
 saying
 the
 T
 with


Tesla
 we
 we
 just
 had
 no
 choice
 but
 to
 V


the
 company
 because
 if
 if
 we're
 in
 if


we're
 doing
 a
 new
 vehicle
 program
 that


is
 uh
 in
 order
 of
 magnitude
 larger
 than


the
 past
 one
 then
 we're
 by
 we're
 just


unequivocally
 betting
 the
 company


because
 the
 new
 vehicle
 would
 be
 90%
 of


production
 so
 going
 from
 uh
 the
 original


Roadster
 to
 the
 model
 S
 original


Roadster
 was
 only
 you
 know
 about
 600
 6


700
 per
 year
 then
 Model
 S
 was
 20,000
 per


year
 and
 um
 and
 then
 model
 3
 is
 sort
 of


half
 sort
 of
 half
 a
 million
 per


year
 um
 model
 y
 over
 a
 million
 per
 year


so
 these
 are
 all
 bet
 the
 company


vehicles
 but
 the
 the
 the
 reason
 we
 could


do
 for
 example
 a
 cyber
 truck
 which
 was


kind
 of


a
 a
 radical
 new
 design
 was
 because
 it


wasn't
 a
 bet
 the
 company
 decision
 so
 I


was
 like
 okay
 look
 let's
 try
 something
 I


want
 to
 try
 something
 totally
 crazy
 uh


it's
 like
 what
 what
 truck
 would
 Blade


Runner
 Drive
 um
 except
 the
 when
 you're


going
 to
 drive
 on
 was
 yeah
 I
 think
 it


would
 be
 perfect
 for
 Ms
 um
 but
 like
 we


could
 try
 something
 that
 where
 there's


some
 chance
 that
 people
 might
 not
 like


it
 um
 but
 it's
 it's
 radical
 and
 new
 and


it's
 aesthetically
 aesthetically
 it's


not
 derivative
 it
 doesn't
 look
 anything


else
 on
 the
 road
 um
 whereas
 all
 the


other
 sort
 of
 pickup
 trucks
 look
 like


vague
 copies
 of
 one
 another
 um
 they
 we


could
 afford
 to
 take
 a
 chance
 on
 failure


and
 say
 like
 and
 talk
 it
 up
 to
 you
 know


well
 we
 tried
 you
 know
 we
 try
 to
 do


something
 interesting
 but
 but
 actually


by
 the
 way
 cyber
 truck's
 doing
 great
 um


so


uh
 but
 one
 of
 the
 things
 that
 I
 think
 is


important
 for
 Innovation
 is
 that
 you
 do


accept
 failure
 like
 like
 necessarily


you
 have
 to
 always
 look
 at
 the
 incentive


structure
 of
 an
 organization
 and
 say
 um


you
 know
 is
 is
 is
 that
 is
 that


organization
 properly
 incenting


Innovation
 um
 and
 in
 with
 if
 you
 do


Innovation
 you're
 necessarily
 going
 to


Uncharted
 Territory
 so
 they
 going
 to
 be


some
 mistakes
 they're
 going
 to
 be
 some


failures
 um
 and
 you
 have
 you
 have
 to


like
 like
 actually
 like
 for
 for
 SpaceX


uh
 rocket
 engine
 development
 like
 I
 keep


telling
 the
 team
 look
 if
 we're
 not


occasionally
 blowing
 up
 an
 engine
 on
 the


test
 stand
 we're
 not
 trying
 hard


enough
 you
 know
 um
 absolutely
 absolutely


how
 important
 are
 the
 P
 how
 important
 is


research
 and
 phds
 and
 that
 kind
 of
 stuff


think
 I've
 said
 seen
 somewhere
 you
 you


think
 most
 phds
 are


useless
 well
 I
 think
 most
 PhD
 thesis
 are


useless
 which
 I
 think
 is
 actually


objectively
 true
 if
 you
 look
 at
 how
 many


PhD
 you
 look
 at
 all
 how
 many
 phds
 are


created
 every
 year
 and
 how
 many
 of
 those


papers
 are
 actually
 used
 in
 anything


yeah
 um
 then
 objectively
 most
 PhD
 TCS


are
 have
 very
 low
 utility
 or
 maybe
 zero


um
 because
 nobody
 uses
 them
 um
 or
 so


once
 in
 a
 while
 you
 get
 something
 that


is
 spectacular
 but
 it's
 pretty


[Music]


rare
 perhaps
 something
 more
 useful
 um
 is


in
 the
 book
 that
 you
 haven't
 read
 uh


talks
 about
 your
 love
 for
 uh
 gaming
 in


particular
 like
 stret
 IC
 ability
 gaming


and
 I've
 been
 thinking
 quite
 a
 lot
 about


it
 um
 what
 have
 you
 learned
 from
 from


those
 games
 and
 have
 have
 that
 learning


and
 wisdom
 been
 helpful
 when
 you
 have


been
 planning
 your


companies
 yeah


I
 it's
 hard
 to
 say
 exactly
 what
 I've


learned
 from
 video
 games
 except
 that
 I
 I


do
 like
 playing
 video
 games
 as
 if
 I
 want


to
 take
 my
 mind
 off
 work
 I'll
 typically


play
 a
 very
 hard
 video
 game
 such
 such
 as


which
 one


well
 over
 the
 years
 it's
 been
 many
 many


different
 video
 games
 um
 so
 you
 know


when
 I
 was
 a
 little
 kid
 I
 was
 like
 you


know
 pong
 and
 little
 tank
 games
 and


things
 and
 um
 and
 but
 if
 you
 take
 a
 game


like
 for
 example
 civilization
 it's


actually
 quite
 a
 good
 um
 it
 tells
 you


how
 how
 civilizations
 are
 formed
 like
 I


remember
 I
 remember
 playing
 the
 original


civilization
 with
 the
 technology
 tree


and
 and
 how
 you
 invent
 different
 things


you'd
 like
 invent
 literacy
 and
 uh
 you


know
 invent
 democracy
 and
 invent
 gun


gunpowder
 all
 all
 these
 things
 that
 like


and
 you
 start
 to
 realize
 oh
 wow
 there's


there
 are
 stages
 to
 technology
 like
 you


can't
 um
 you
 know
 you
 can't
 actually
 get


to
 democracy
 without
 literacy
 um
 and
 um


you
 know
 so
 there's
 these
 these
 stages


of
 of
 Technology
 development
 or
 stages


of
 ideas
 that
 uh
 you
 know
 that's
 that's


a
 helpful
 framework
 for
 a
 company
 um


and
 I
 guess
 in
 in
 in
 like
 like
 I
 say
 in


recent
 years
 there
 there's
 a
 game
 I


played
 that
 was
 um
 actually
 developed
 in


Sweden
 called
 polyopia
 which
 is
 actually


quite
 a
 good
 game
 um
 like
 a
 lot
 of


people
 like
 playing
 chess
 but
 I
 think


chess
 is
 not
 a
 not
 a
 great
 um
 there's


not
 a
 lot
 of
 transfer
 learning
 from


chess
 to
 the
 real
 world
 because
 in
 chess


you've
 got
 only
 64
 squares
 uh
 it's
 a


setpiece
 battle
 same
 pieces
 every
 time


there
 are
 no
 terrain
 differences


uh
 there's
 no
 technology
 tree
 uh
 there's


no
 fog
 of
 War
 um
 but
 say
 a
 game
 like


polyopia
 has
 all
 of
 those
 things
 uh


random
 terrain
 generation
 uh
 you
 know


the
 differences
 in
 attack
 and
 defense


bonuses
 depending
 on
 what
 type
 of


terrain
 um
 you've
 got
 16
 tribes
 I
 think


each
 with
 different
 abilities
 um
 you've


got
 a
 a
 a
 technology
 tree
 that
 you
 can


choose
 to
 develop
 in
 different
 ways
 uh


and
 you've
 got
 of
 course
 fog
 of
 War
 um


so
 that
 I
 think
 is
 much
 more
 much
 closer


to
 reality
 yeah
 yeah
 um
 so
 I
 think


politopia
 I
 mean
 I
 I
 was
 I
 was
 playing


Diablo
 uh
 for
 a
 while
 pretty
 fun
 um


Diablo
 as
 high
 levels
 gets
 very


complicated
 they
 you
 could
 call
 it
 like


a
 a
 spreadsheet
 with
 a
 game
 attached
 um


so
 so
 that's
 that's
 and
 I
 briefly
 got


the
 the
 for
 about
 a
 day
 the
 world
 record


in
 this
 avire
 of
 zir
 on
 on
 a
 four-person


team
 of
 of
 clearing
 the
 the
 hardest


level
 um
 which
 was
 you
 know
 not
 bad
 for


someone
 who's
 like


53
 basically
 will
 be
 53


soon
 um
 there
 is
 still
 some
 uh
 twitch


element
 to
 it
 and
 um
 it's
 hard
 to
 beat


kids
 at
 games
 with
 a
 twitch


element
 um
 but
 yeah
 I
 like
 uh
 I
 find


these
 games
 interesting
 if
 you
 can
 be


fully
 immersed
 in
 a
 game
 some
 last


questions
 here
 um
 as
 you
 know
 we
 are
 big


shareholders
 and
 uh
 made
 a
 a
 lot
 of


money
 uh
 on
 our


investment


[Laughter]


o
 okay
 I
 can
 hear
 you


here
 okay
 good
 sounds


good
 good
 to


go
 sorry
 I
 can
 you
 I
 think
 everyone
 can


hear


me
 let's
 see
 thumbs
 up
 if
 you
 can
 hear


me
 let's
 try
 again
 okay
 okay
 sounds
 good


sounds
 good
 um
 now
 um
 what
 is
 the
 score


now
 of
 in
 terms
 of
 the
 Union
 in
 Sweden


and
 the
 collective


bargaining
 actually
 I
 I
 think
 uh
 I
 think


the
 storm
 has
 passed
 on
 that
 front
 I


think
 things
 are
 in
 reasonably
 good


shape
 in
 Sweden


um


so
 uh
 yeah
 I
 think
 things
 are


good
 um
 yeah
 overall
 yeah
 I
 feel
 pretty


good
 about
 the
 future
 I
 mean
 you
 know


there's
 going
 to
 be
 bumpy
 quarters
 from


you
 know
 here
 and
 there
 but
 I
 think
 the


long-term
 future
 of
 Tesla
 is
 extremely


strong
 uh
 for


example


um
 yeah
 I'm
 I'm
 back
 on
 just
 so
 um
 yeah


we
 met
 with
 uh
 we
 met
 with
 your
 chair


last
 month
 so
 we
 we
 have
 some
 update
 but


any
 any
 of
 view
 on
 it
 why
 are
 you


why
 why
 are
 you
 skeptical
 to


colletive
 I
 was
 playing
 with
 a


soundboard


here


wo
 hello
 hello


[Music]


hello
 yeah
 last
 question
 for
 me
 um
 sorry


I
 didn't
 hear
 the
 answer
 here
 because
 I


was
 out
 but
 um
 we
 have
 covered
 this
 with


with
 your
 chair
 but
 just
 a
 last
 question


here
 what
 do
 you
 want
 your
 legacy
 to


be
 I
 I
 don't
 I
 don't
 mind
 if
 uh
 my


legacy
 is
 accurate
 or
 inaccurate
 uh


provided
 that
 I
 I
 dive
 feeling
 that
 I've


done
 the
 right
 thing
 for
 the
 future
 of


Consciousness
 so
 just
 trying
 to
 trying


to
 have
 this
 SL
 of
 Consciousness
 last
 as


long
 as
 possible
 and
 maybe
 understand


more
 about
 the
 nature
 of
 the
 universe
 or


simulation
 or
 whatever
 this


is


so
 um
 I
 have
 a
 philos
 philosophy
 of


curiosity
 which
 is


to
 understand


the
 understand
 the
 universe
 understand


the
 nature
 of
 the
 universe
 um
 or
 even


what
 questions
 to


ask
 kind
 of
 like
 that
 I
 would
 say
 I


would
 subscribe
 to
 the
 Douglas
 Adams
 hus


guys
 of
 the
 Galaxy
 School
 of


philosophy
 that
 we're
 trying
 to


understand
 what
 questions
 to
 ask
 about


the
 answer
 that
 is
 the


universe
 okay
 I
 think
 that's
 a
 good


place
 to
 end
 um
 for
 sure
 the
 life
 on


this
 planet
 would
 have
 been
 been
 a
 lot


more
 boring
 without
 you
 I'm
 I'm
 glad
 to


 it
 up
 a
 little
 totally
 all
 right


well
 good
 talking
 bye
 take
 care
 now
 all


right
 bye
 thanks


[Music]


bye
