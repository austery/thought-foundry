[Music]


Thank
 you
 very
 much
 for
 that
 nice


introduction
 and
 thank
 you
 Nikolai
 for


letting
 me
 present
 uh
 Visma
 today.
 Uh


that
 is
 a
 true
 honor.
 Today
 I
 will
 be


talking
 about
 how
 we
 in
 our
 company
 use


culture
 as
 a
 value
 driver
 to
 drive
 our


success.
 And
 I
 have
 to
 say
 that
 in
 Visma


we
 have
 a
 strong
 culture
 that
 we
 are


immensely
 proud
 of.
 But
 culture
 in
 Visma


is
 more
 than
 warm


words.
 It's
 not
 just
 warm


words.
 In


addition,
 it's
 more
 than
 soft
 input
 to


financial
 outcomes.
 In
 Visma,
 we


quantify
 and
 we
 operationally
 execute
 on


how
 we
 drive
 the
 culture
 and
 how
 we
 make


sure
 that
 the
 leaders
 are
 equipped
 to


drive
 the
 business
 in
 the
 way
 that
 it


should


be.
 Recognizing
 that
 some
 of
 you
 do
 not


know
 Visma,
 I
 do
 appreciate
 that
 I
 want


to
 spend
 just
 one
 minute
 on
 our


company
 today.
 We
 are
 the
 largest


privatelyowned
 company
 in
 software
 in


Europe
 and
 we
 are
 present
 in
 33
 markets


both
 in
 Europe
 and
 in
 Latin


America.
 We
 do
 pride
 ourselves
 in
 making


a
 lot
 of


acquisitions.
 Now
 in
 uh
 2024
 we
 acquired


33
 companies
 and
 that's
 a
 normal
 year


for
 Visma.
 After
 I
 became
 CEO
 in
 2020,
 I


have
 been
 a
 part
 of
 more
 than
 180


acquisitions.
 So
 this
 is
 an
 important


part
 of
 our
 growth
 journey.


Definitely.
 What
 do
 we
 do?
 Well,
 you


mentioned
 that
 really
 nicely.
 We
 provide


missionritical
 business
 processes
 and


the
 core
 of
 our
 deliveries
 is


accounting,
 payroll,
 e
 invoicing
 and


tax.
 And
 our
 customers,
 they're
 SMBs
 and


their
 local
 governments.
 And
 our


products
 and
 our
 product
 suites
 are


perfectly
 tailored
 to
 the
 local
 needs
 in


the
 markets
 in
 which
 we
 operate,
 giving


them
 a
 competitive
 advantage.
 This
 is


our
 passion
 and
 through
 our
 story,
 it's


gone
 pretty
 well.
 So
 looking
 at
 our


performance,
 we
 are
 younger
 than
 several


of
 the
 companies
 that
 have
 been


presented
 today.
 Great
 companies
 I
 have


to
 say.
 So,
 we've
 not
 been
 around
 that


long,
 but
 we've
 been
 around
 from
 1996.


And
 as
 you
 see
 on
 the
 chart,
 we
 were


delisted
 back
 in
 2006
 and
 have
 been


privately
 owned
 ever


since.
 When
 I
 joined
 Visma
 back
 in
 2011,


our
 revenue
 was
 247
 million
 euros.


Today,
 we
 are
 closing
 up
 to
 three


billion
 million
 uh
 billion.
 And
 in


addition
 we
 have
 increased
 EBA
 by
 14


times
 in
 that
 period.
 So
 I
 have
 to
 say


that
 we
 are
 quite
 proud
 of
 uh
 our


results
 and
 I'm
 confident
 that
 we
 will


continue
 that
 journey
 going
 ahead.
 So


what
 is
 the
 reason
 for
 our
 success?
 I


usually
 say
 keep
 keeping
 it
 simple.
 It's


twofold.
 First
 of
 all
 it's
 about
 our


strategic
 positioning.


I
 talked
 about
 how
 we
 deliver


missionritical
 business
 software
 to
 the


markets
 that
 we
 are
 present
 in.
 We
 pride


ourselves
 in
 having
 the
 latest


technology.
 We
 have
 been
 on
 a
 cloud


journey
 for
 many
 many
 years
 and
 now
 more


than
 90%
 of
 our
 revenue
 is
 cloud
 and


with
 AI
 coming
 wow
 like
 like
 Nikolai


stated
 it's
 a
 really
 nice
 time
 to
 be


alive.
 So
 many
 changes
 so
 many
 positive


changes
 going
 along.


Definitely
 in
 addition
 to
 our
 strategic


positioning
 and
 stren
 staying
 true
 to


that
 we
 enter
 in
 to
 new
 countries


through
 acquiring
 stars
 with
 the
 latest


technology,
 great
 products
 within
 our


strategic


positioning
 and
 we
 try
 to
 make
 very
 good


companies
 become
 great
 companies
 based


on
 our
 competence
 and
 what
 we
 know


staying
 close
 to
 the
 core.


In
 addition,
 our
 culture
 is
 a
 second


reason
 for
 our


success.
 We
 have
 a
 very
 strong
 culture


in
 Visma.
 Through
 acquisitions,
 we
 today


actually
 present
 uh
 the
 largest


entrepreneurial
 network
 in
 Europe.
 70%


of
 our
 the
 founders,
 they
 stay
 put
 in


Visma
 after
 5
 years.
 And
 you
 can
 think


about
 how
 you
 would
 describe
 the
 culture


of
 Visma
 actually
 with
 all
 of
 the


entrepreneurs.
 I
 don't
 have
 time
 to
 go


through
 that
 today
 but
 the
 pace
 is
 quite


fast
 and
 as
 was
 mentioned
 by
 Mark
 yes
 we


make
 mistakes
 a
 lot
 but
 we
 learn
 from


them
 we
 experiment
 and
 we
 fail


fast
 and
 these
 two
 parts
 growth
 and


culture
 they
 are
 two
 sides
 on
 the
 same


coin
 we
 do
 believe
 that
 focusing
 on


culture
 drives
 value
 so
 let
 me
 showcase


how
 we
 do
 this
 in


Visma
 I'll
 present
 another
 flywheel


today
 where
 culture
 is
 a
 massive
 driver


of
 our
 business
 and
 since
 we
 do
 a
 lot
 of


M&A
 let
 me
 give
 you
 an
 example
 on
 how
 we


operationally
 work
 with
 M&A
 within
 the


business
 and
 drive


culture
 so
 first
 of


all
 when
 we
 look
 for
 companies
 we
 look


for
 stars
 we
 look
 for
 already
 successful


entrepreneurs
 that
 have
 a
 proven
 track


record
 of
 a
 great
 product
 that
 the


customers
 like
 and
 of
 course
 when
 you


meet
 these
 These
 entrepreneurs,
 several


of
 them
 we
 have
 been
 talking
 to
 five,


ten
 years,
 we're
 talking
 to
 them
 about


thinking
 about
 giving
 their
 baby
 a
 new


home.
 And
 for
 all
 of
 you
 that
 are


parents,
 of
 course,
 you
 want
 to
 make


sure
 that
 that
 home
 is
 the
 best
 home
 for


that
 baby.
 So,
 the
 first
 thing
 we
 do


when
 we're
 talking
 to
 all
 of
 these


amazing
 companies
 is
 that
 we
 put
 our


sales
 hat
 on
 naturally
 and
 then
 we
 dig


into
 the
 DD.


several
 of
 you
 as
 investors,
 you


probably
 do
 a
 lot
 of
 DD
 and
 I
 have
 the


privilege
 of
 doing
 lots
 of
 DDs
 myself.


I've
 been
 a
 part
 of
 more
 than
 300


acquisitions
 and
 of
 course
 lots
 more
 DDS


than
 that.
 And
 we
 do
 all
 the
 regular


stuff.
 We
 do
 the
 DD
 ourselves,
 the


legal,
 the
 tech,
 the
 commercial,
 the


list
 is
 long.
 But
 in
 addition
 to
 all
 of


those
 natural
 tracks,
 we
 also
 do
 a
 very


thorough
 people


DD.
 And
 to
 cut
 it
 short,
 there
 are
 two


things
 that
 are
 immensely
 important
 for


us.
 First
 of
 all,
 it's
 very
 important
 to


have
 clear


expectations.
 So
 companies
 in
 a
 process


when
 you
 do
 when
 you
 when
 you
 meet
 them,


they
 always
 have
 a
 business
 case.
 And
 of


course
 in
 the
 DD
 process,
 our
 job
 and


your
 job
 as
 investors
 is
 to
 make
 your


own
 business
 case.
 When
 we
 have
 done


that
 based
 on
 our
 knowledge,
 we
 focus
 on


having
 the
 tough
 discussions
 in
 the
 DD


where
 we
 showcase
 what
 our
 business
 case


looks
 like.
 Where
 do
 we
 believe
 they


should
 focus?
 Where
 do
 we
 believe
 that


they
 will
 grow?
 How
 much
 growth
 do
 we


see
 in
 the
 next
 five
 years?
 And
 we
 have


all
 the
 tough
 discussions
 there
 to


clarify
 the
 expectations.
 And
 if
 we
 do


not
 see
 in
 those
 meetings
 that
 we
 find


common
 grounds,
 we
 walk
 away
 from
 the


deal.
 If
 we
 see
 that
 we
 do
 not
 see
 the


same
 going
 into
 the
 future,
 we
 walk
 away


from
 the
 deal.
 If
 we
 see
 in
 the


negotiation
 that
 it's
 tough,
 we
 walk


away
 from
 the
 deal
 and
 we
 showcase
 our


business
 case
 and
 that
 actually
 becomes


the


budget.
 Creating
 mutual
 trust,
 no


surprises,
 all
 the
 tough
 discussions


taken
 while
 we
 do
 the
 DD.
 The
 second


thing
 that
 we
 do
 is
 that
 we
 do
 a
 lot


with
 respect
 to
 trying
 to
 figure
 out
 who


are
 you?
 What
 is
 your
 culture?
 Is
 it
 a


cultural
 fit?
 Can
 we
 work
 together?
 And


that's
 not
 about
 being
 the
 same.
 We
 have


lots
 of
 subcultures
 in
 Visma,
 but
 it's


about
 coming
 together
 with
 the
 same
 core


values
 because
 all
 of
 us
 are
 looking
 to


work
 with
 people
 that
 we
 trust.
 So
 we


talk
 about
 that
 as
 well
 and
 we
 look
 for


patterns.
 Do
 we
 find
 facts
 based
 on
 what


they're
 telling
 us?
 Can
 I
 trust
 the
 data


points
 coming
 in?
 We
 also
 talk
 a
 lot


about
 oneto
 ones
 with
 the
 talents.
 What


needs
 to
 be
 in
 place
 for
 you
 to
 stay
 put


in
 five
 years?
 Because
 these
 wonderful


entrepreneurs,
 these
 wonderful


employees,
 it's
 a
 successful
 company


already.
 And
 all
 of
 you
 know
 how
 costly


it
 is
 to
 recruit
 and
 possibly
 wrongly


recruit.
 We
 want
 to
 keep
 them
 put.
 So


addressing
 this
 and
 figuring
 out
 if


we're
 able
 to
 deliver
 on
 these
 promises,


that
 is
 also
 something
 that
 we
 really


double
 click
 on.
 And
 when
 we
 figure
 out


that
 it's
 a
 cultural
 fit,
 the
 strategic


position
 works,
 we
 agree
 on
 the
 business


case,
 well
 that
 is
 when
 we
 onboard
 them


to
 the
 Visma
 family.
 There
 are
 no


surprises.
 We
 onboard
 them
 to
 all
 the


KPIs
 that
 are
 important
 to
 us.
 Of


course,
 in
 addition
 to
 people,
 uh
 we


have
 tech,
 we
 have
 customers.
 I
 don't


have
 time
 to
 go
 through
 that,
 but
 we're


very
 data
 hungry.
 So,
 we
 roll
 them
 onto


the
 system.
 So,
 they
 get
 a
 lot
 of
 intel


on
 what
 kind
 of
 statistics
 actually
 will


drive
 growth
 into
 the
 future.
 Because
 in


general,
 financial
 results
 are
 just
 a


consequence
 of
 you
 focusing
 on
 what


really
 drives
 the
 business.
 We
 measure,


we
 reflect,
 and
 of
 course,
 we
 follow
 up


and
 take
 action.
 And
 just
 to
 give
 you


some
 flavor
 as
 to
 how
 we
 do
 that
 in


Visma,
 we
 have
 people
 dashboards
 that


are
 live
 that
 they
 get
 all
 the
 time


giving
 you
 the
 natural
 KPIs.
 In
 addition


to
 the
 people
 dashboards
 that
 we
 have


made
 ourselves,
 we
 of
 course
 measure


engagement.
 We
 know
 that
 engaged


employees
 and
 the
 right
 employees,
 they


provide
 a
 lot
 better
 performance.
 And


here
 you
 see
 our
 statistics.
 Many
 of
 you


probably
 are
 aware
 of
 the
 uh
 engagement


net
 promoter
 score.
 Our
 score
 is
 63


which
 was
 represents
 the
 5%
 top
 of
 the


tech
 industry
 which
 we
 are
 definitely


proud
 of.
 But
 most
 importantly
 is
 our


leaders.
 They
 get
 the
 measures.
 They're


transparent.
 All
 the
 employees
 see
 it.


We
 do
 it
 monthly.
 So
 you
 take
 a
 pulse
 on


the
 organization
 all
 the
 time.
 Not


taking
 a
 lot
 of
 time
 to
 get
 in
 the
 data.


It's
 just
 six
 questions
 and
 they
 tra


change
 depending
 on
 where
 the
 business


needs
 to
 be
 and
 what
 kind
 of
 KPIs
 you


need
 to
 get
 in
 so
 that
 they
 get
 valuable


input
 that
 they
 can
 act
 upon
 and
 that


they
 can
 address.
 They
 get
 facts
 to
 have


good
 discussions
 with
 their


teams
 and
 what
 is
 the
 massive
 driver
 of


engagement
 that
 is
 their
 leaders.
 People


follow
 leaders.
 They
 don't
 follow


companies.
 So
 we
 measure
 this
 as
 well.


We
 have
 a
 leadership
 index.
 All
 of
 us


are
 measured.
 1500
 leaders
 including


myself.
 I
 always
 find
 it
 immensely


interesting
 when
 I
 get
 the
 feedback


because
 the
 feedback
 is
 often


unspoken.
 So
 you
 get
 a
 lot
 of


interesting
 input
 and
 it
 helps
 you
 to


figure
 out
 actually
 what
 to
 focus
 on.


And
 being
 a
 leader
 all
 of
 us
 know
 it's


not
 a
 popularity
 contest.
 It's
 hard
 work


definitely.
 But
 getting
 this
 input
 very


important
 and
 it's
 not
 as
 though
 it


always
 needs
 to
 be
 high.
 We
 change
 a
 lot


in
 Risma.
 I
 usually
 say
 that
 change
 is


our
 stability
 and
 of
 course
 in
 the
 midst


of
 a
 transition
 and
 especially
 if
 it's


not
 a
 welcomed
 one
 of
 course
 it
 will


drop
 but
 in
 the
 long
 term
 we
 cannot
 have


the
 leadership
 index
 being
 weak
 because


then
 the
 talents
 will
 leave
 because
 the


people
 they
 follow
 leaders
 they
 don't


follow
 the


companies
 and
 this
 is
 not
 to
 fingerpoint


for
 anyone
 it's
 for
 development
 and
 we


coach
 them
 and
 we
 help
 them
 we
 have


leadership
 development
 tools
 we
 need
 to


equip
 our
 leaders


Because
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 leaders


today,
 they
 didn't
 educate
 themselves


into
 being
 a
 leader.
 They
 became
 leader


because
 they
 were
 great
 with
 regards
 to


the
 field.
 So
 we
 do
 spend
 a
 lot
 of
 time


making
 sure
 that
 we
 help
 them
 and
 follow


up
 with
 respect
 to
 actually
 getting
 the


tools
 you
 need
 to
 be
 a
 great
 leader
 for


your
 people.


And
 then
 in
 addition,
 we
 uh
 also
 of


course
 in
 addition
 to
 getting
 your


feedback
 and
 also
 looking
 at
 like-minded


companies,
 you
 don't
 only
 get
 feedback


from
 your
 own
 company,
 you
 get
 it
 from


everyone.
 We
 put
 together
 like-minded


companies,
 like-minded
 managing


directors
 so
 that
 they
 can
 learn
 from


one
 another.
 They
 learn
 from
 their


successes,
 they
 learn
 from
 their


mistakes.
 So
 typically
 we
 often
 say
 that


we
 actually
 we
 celebrate
 also
 when
 we


make
 a
 mistake
 because
 then
 we
 can
 put


master
 classes
 out
 to
 everyone
 making


sure
 that
 they
 don't
 make
 the
 same


mistake
 again
 and
 then
 we
 put
 master


classes
 with
 the
 best
 successes
 so
 that


the
 others
 can
 copy.
 It's
 a
 very
 fast


way
 to
 be
 quite
 successful
 early


out.
 And
 how
 do
 we
 make
 sure
 that
 we
 are


innovative
 and
 that
 we
 experiment?
 Of


course
 we
 make
 mistakes
 a
 lot.
 I
 share


my
 mistakes.
 so
 important
 actually
 to


foster
 this


culture.
 In
 addition,
 of
 course,
 to


putting
 companies
 together
 and
 people


together,
 there's
 lots
 of
 mobility


within
 the


firm.
 And
 then
 you
 go
 back
 to
 the


flywheel
 and
 we
 show
 the
 value
 and
 the


value
 you
 perceive.
 If
 you
 look
 back
 the


recent
 three
 years
 doing
 several


acquisitions,
 uh
 it's
 quite
 easy
 for
 me


to
 showcase
 the
 value
 that
 we
 provide


for
 our
 companies.
 We
 acquire
 very
 very


good
 companies
 and
 in
 tech
 we're
 always


measured
 on
 the
 rule
 of
 40.
 You
 add
 up


the
 margin,
 the
 EITA
 margin,
 and
 in


addition
 you
 add
 up
 the
 revenue
 growth.


And
 on
 average,
 you
 see
 here
 the
 light


blue
 is
 all
 of
 these
 100
 acquisitions


that
 we've
 done
 these
 recent
 years
 and


what
 their
 rule
 of
 40
 score
 was
 when


they
 entered
 in.
 The
 second
 bubble
 is


what
 their
 rule
 of
 40
 score
 was
 after


one
 year
 in
 Visma.
 And
 that
 actually


increased
 eight
 points.
 That's
 pretty


nice.
 So
 I
 will
 go
 back
 to
 where
 I


started.


We
 have
 historically
 done
 pretty
 good.


I'm
 very
 very
 proud
 of
 that.
 And
 why
 do


I
 feel
 confident
 that
 we
 will
 continue


our
 journey
 going
 forward?
 We
 will
 stay


very
 focused
 on
 our
 strategic


positioning.
 I
 like
 what
 was
 commented


early
 you
 earlier.
 You
 can't
 be


everything
 for
 everyone.
 Uh
 we
 are
 very


niche.
 We're
 very
 true
 to
 our
 strategic


positioning.
 And
 in
 addition
 to
 that,


even
 though
 we
 are
 a
 tech
 company,
 we


will
 be
 continuously
 working
 to
 build


this
 culture
 which
 is
 so
 so
 strong
 in


Visma.
 Because
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day,


people
 want
 connection.
 They
 don't
 want


perfection.
 Thank
 you.


[Applause]
