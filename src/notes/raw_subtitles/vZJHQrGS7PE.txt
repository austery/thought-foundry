[Music]


hi
 everybody
 I'm
 herin
 Oslo
 with
 the


co-founder
 of
 Oak
 Tre
 Capital
 the


investment
 Guru
 Howard
 marks
 great
 to


have
 you
 here
 now
 you
 are
 one
 of
 the


world's
 most
 impressive
 and
 respected


investors
 and
 also
 very
 famous
 for


writing
 various
 kinds
 of
 memos
 um
 now


we'd
 love
 to
 start
 off
 by
 just
 asking


you
 what
 got
 you
 started
 in
 finance
 in


the
 beginning
 you
 know
 I
 was
 very


fortunate
 and
 I
 went
 to
 the
 public


schools
 in
 New
 York
 and
 uh
 schools
 were


crowded
 and
 different
 ult
 but
 uh
 one
 day


one
 of
 my
 uh
 buddies
 said
 they're


teaching
 a
 course
 in
 accounting
 we


should
 take
 it
 and
 I
 took
 it
 I
 loved
 it


not
 many
 people
 love
 accounting
 not
 too


many
 uh
 but
 you
 know
 it
 has
 a
 it
 has
 a


symmetry
 that
 that
 a
 certain
 kind
 of


mind
 responds
 to
 so
 I
 took
 it
 and
 I


loved
 it
 and
 uh
 you
 know
 that
 I
 decided


to
 become
 an
 accountant
 excuse
 me
 what


what
 is
 that
 certain
 kind
 of
 mind
 what


is
 that
 well
 I
 I
 think
 very
 left
 brain


logical
 literal


mathematical
 um
 and
 but
 it's
 really
 the


Symmetry
 it's
 the
 balance
 between
 the


left
 and
 the
 right
 debit
 and
 credits


when
 I
 look
 when
 I
 walk
 through
 Oso
 and


I
 see
 the
 very
 symmetrical
 architecture


I
 enjoy
 it
 some
 other
 people
 might
 think


it's
 boring
 uh
 or
 too
 regular
 uh
 but
 uh


you
 know
 I
 responded
 very
 strongly
 and


so
 I
 went
 off
 to
 Wharton
 uh
 to
 become
 an


accountant
 and
 then
 I
 was
 introduced
 to


finance
 which
 is
 actually
 of
 course
 much


more
 interesting
 and
 switch
 to
 finance


it's
 interesting
 because
 most
 places


they
 say
 Finance
 but
 I
 Wen
 that
 they
 say


Finance
 I
 I
 think
 that's
 right
 yeah
 um


very
 good
 now
 um
 what
 is
 your
 investment


philosophy
 now
 what
 is
 it
 My
 Philosophy


is
 I
 guess
 it's
 Oak
 tre's
 philosophy
 six


very
 simple
 points
 uh
 number
 one
 risk


control
 I
 believe
 it's
 easy
 to
 make


money
 in
 the
 market
 that's
 especially


true
 in
 the
 good
 years
 and
 most
 years


are
 good
 years
 uh
 the
 challenge
 uh
 the


real
 skill
 is
 to
 make
 money
 with
 the


risk
 under
 control
 so
 that
 if
 it
 turns


out
 to
 be
 a
 bad
 year
 instead
 you
 won't


do
 too
 badly
 number
 two
 is


consistency
 U
 my
 clients
 don't
 want


results
 that
 are
 all
 over
 the
 lot
 and
 uh


at
 the
 top
 one
 year
 and
 at
 the
 bottom


the
 next
 uh
 so
 we
 try
 to
 be
 just


consistently
 a
 little
 bit
 above
 the


middle
 but
 then
 thanks
 to
 risk
 control


in
 the
 really
 bad
 years
 we
 do
 bounce
 up


to
 the
 top
 number
 three
 I
 believe


there's
 such
 a
 thing
 as
 market


efficiency
 and
 we
 Target
 only
 the
 less


efficient
 markets
 number
 four
 high


degree
 of
 specialization
 you
 can't
 be
 a


successful
 generalist
 in
 my
 opinion
 you


have
 to
 know
 more
 than
 everybody
 else


about
 a
 few
 things
 number
 five
 we
 don't


rely
 on
 macro
 forecasting
 to
 drive
 our


investments
 and
 number
 six
 we
 don't
 uh


expect
 much
 from
 Market
 timing
 so
 that's


the
 philosophy
 right
 right
 there
 has
 he


changed
 over
 time
 I
 knew
 all
 those


things
 50
 years
 ago
 but
 I
 think
 my
 uh


adherence
 to
 them
 has
 grown
 stronger
 my


conviction
 which
 ones
 in
 particular
 well


first
 of
 all
 I
 think
 market
 efficiency


is
 a
 very
 important
 concept
 um
 my


experience
 as
 an
 investor
 over
 the
 years


uh
 showed
 me
 why
 uh
 and
 introduced
 me
 to


uh
 to
 the
 limits
 on
 on
 uh
 un
 knowing


more
 than
 others
 uh
 and
 um
 that
 leads


into
 uh
 non-market
 timing
 and
 then
 my


experience
 with


forecasters
 basically
 in
 my
 opinion


showed
 me
 that
 it
 doesn't
 work
 macro


forecasting
 all
 the
 macroeconomists
 are


useless
 well
 you
 said
 that
 no
 no
 there


was
 a
 question
 I'm
 sorry
 I
 my
 ination


was
 wrong
 I
 would
 say
 they're
 not
 right


consistently
 enough
 to
 follow
 and
 uh
 you


know
 when
 I
 it
 at
 the
 bank
 55
 years
 ago


we
 used
 to
 say
 that
 an
 economist
 is
 a


portfolio
 manager
 who
 never
 marks
 the


market
 and
 I
 think
 that's
 true
 uh
 you


know
 uh
 if
 you
 were
 an
 active
 investor


uh
 you
 wouldn't
 uh
 hire
 somebody
 without


looking
 at
 their
 record
 but
 no
 Economist


ever
 presents
 his
 record
 no
 they
 can't


because
 they
 wouldn't
 be
 hired
 now
 which


of
 these
 which
 of
 these
 rules
 um
 have


been
 the
 most
 difficult
 to
 adhere
 to


have
 you
 never
 been
 tempted
 to
 break


some
 of
 them
 you
 must
 have
 been
 I've


never
 been
 tempted
 to
 break
 from
 them


because
 I
 think
 I
 think
 that
 that
 what


they
 all
 emphasize
 in
 my
 opinion
 is
 the


limits
 on
 knowledge
 and
 the
 longer
 I


live
 the
 more
 I
 understand
 the
 limits
 on


knowledge
 the
 more
 convinced
 I
 am
 what


what
 are
 the
 limits
 of
 knowledge
 number


one
 Randomness
 or
 lock
 is
 every
 place
 in


our
 business
 uh
 this
 is
 you're
 not


dealing
 with
 physical
 laws
 like
 in


physics
 or
 in
 engineering
 um
 you're


dealing
 with
 in
 large
 part
 people
 I
 mean


what
 are
 markets
 it's
 a
 collection
 of


people
 uh
 how
 is
 history
 made
 through


the
 actions
 of
 people
 and
 how
 do
 and
 the


world
 is
 governed
 through
 the
 actions
 of


people
 so
 uh
 you
 processes
 which
 are


basically
 built
 around
 people
 can't
 be


predicted
 uh
 uh
 the
 the
 physicist


Richard
 finans
 once
 said
 that
 uh
 physics


would
 be
 much
 harder
 if
 electrons
 had


feelings
 yeah
 people
 have
 feelings
 and


so
 their
 behavior
 is


unpredictable


um
 and
 uh
 Randomness
 plays
 a
 very
 big


part
 yeah
 you
 you
 often
 talk
 about
 that


um
 how
 you
 judge
 the
 quality
 of
 a


decision
 yes
 tell
 me
 about
 that
 well
 uh


thanks
 to


Randomness
 a
 good
 decision
 doesn't


always
 work
 and
 a
 bad
 decision
 doesn't


always
 fail
 m
 um
 the
 first
 book
 I
 read


when
 I
 got
 to
 Wharton
 uh
 61
 years
 ago


was
 uh
 decision
 making
 under
 uncertainty


in
 oil
 and
 gas
 and
 the
 the
 greatest


lesson
 I
 remember
 learning
 from
 that
 uh


book
 is
 that
 you
 can't
 tell
 the
 quality


of
 a
 decision
 from
 the
 outcome
 now
 this


is
 a
 concept
 that
 many
 many
 people


wouldn't
 get
 well
 of
 course
 you
 you
 can


but
 if
 you
 think
 about
 how
 random
 the


world
 is
 you
 know
 that
 in
 the
 short
 run


Randomness
 alone
 can
 produce
 just
 about


any
 outcome
 that's
 because
 also
 some


stupid
 people
 get
 rich
 well
 that's
 right


we
 all
 know
 people
 we
 say
 oh
 he
 was
 he


he
 was
 right
 for
 the
 wrong
 reason
 yeah


and
 uh
 there
 are
 stupid
 people
 who
 get


rich
 of
 course
 you
 know
 one
 of
 the


things
 I
 say
 the
 ingredients
 in
 success


are
 aggressiveness
 timing
 and
 skill
 and


if
 you
 have
 enough
 aggressiveness
 at
 the


right
 time
 you
 don't
 need
 much
 skill


uh
 now
 that
 that
 can
 make
 you
 right
 once


or
 twice
 but
 to
 be
 right
 repeatedly
 over


an
 entire
 career
 now
 you're
 talking


about
 skill
 you
 can't
 rely
 on
 on
 luck


for
 for
 decades
 what
 does
 age


do
 to
 investment
 process
 I
 think
 that


for
 the
 for
 the
 most
 part
 age
 um
 Mellows


you
 I
 think
 you
 I
 I
 hope
 in
 time
 you
 you


over
 you
 understand
 things
 more
 deeply
 M


that's
 the
 key
 um
 why
 are
 we
 more


patient
 when
 we
 get
 older
 or
 just
 about


to
 die
 well
 hopefully
 it's
 because
 we


learn
 that
 quick
 action
 is
 not
 the


answer
 we
 hopefully
 we
 we
 develop
 the


wisdom
 to
 understand
 that


uh
 if
 you
 want
 a
 good
 result
 you're
 more


likely
 to
 get
 it
 if
 you
 take
 a
 little


time
 to
 think
 about
 the
 question
 rather


than
 act
 wh
 on
 a
 whim
 no
 you're
 very
 um


dism
 I
 of
 economic
 forecasting
 as
 we
 as


we
 talked
 about
 but
 you
 are
 a
 strong


believer
 in
 cycles
 and
 knowing
 where
 we


are
 in
 the


cycle
 why
 why
 is
 the
 understanding
 of


Market
 cycle
 so
 important
 well
 the
 world


is
 cyclical
 uh
 and
 uh
 you
 know
 everybody


knows
 that
 the
 market
 and
 the
 economy
 um


and
 and
 uh


politics
 um
 move
 cyclically
 and
 uh
 you


know
 nothing
 moves
 in
 a
 straight
 line
 uh


where
 human
 behavior
 is
 involved
 and
 if


you
 were
 to
 count
 on
 it
 doing
 so
 you


would
 uh
 get
 into
 big
 trouble
 I've
 been


thinking
 about
 writing
 a
 memo
 uh
 lately


people
 have
 been
 asking
 me
 what
 is
 the


biggest


mistake
 that
 you've
 seen
 or
 what
 is
 the


mistake
 that
 people
 make
 most
 often
 and


I
 think
 it
 is
 that
 once
 the
 market
 is


moving
 in
 One
 Direction
 that
 it
 will


always
 continue
 to
 do
 so
 in


Truth
 uh
 regression
 toward
 the
 mean
 or


the
 correction
 uh
 of
 uh
 excesses
 is
 much


more
 dependable
 than
 continued
 moving
 in


a
 straight
 line
 why
 do
 things
 revert


back
 because


the
 I
 wrote
 a
 book
 uh
 in
 2018
 called
 the


mastering
 the
 market
 cycle
 and
 uh
 I'm
 a


great
 believer
 in
 Cycles
 I'm
 a
 student


of
 Cycles
 I
 I
 I've
 lived
 with
 cycles
 for


a
 long
 time
 and
 yet
 when
 I
 got
 about


2third
 of
 the
 way
 through
 writing
 the


book
 I
 said
 to
 myself
 why
 do
 we
 have


Cycles
 the
 economy
 grows
 at
 2%
 a
 year


why
 doesn't
 it
 just
 grow
 2%
 every
 year


why
 sometimes
 one
 and
 sometimes
 three


and
 sometimes
 minus
 one
 some
 what
 so


what's
 the
 answer
 the
 answer
 is
 that


people
 go
 to
 excess
 and
 for
 example
 if


the
 economy
 is
 growing
 well
 for
 a
 few


years
 business
 uh
 heads
 say
 oh
 well
 we


have
 to
 build
 a
 new
 Factory
 to
 get
 our


increased
 share
 of
 the
 growth
 in
 our


industry
 and
 so
 they
 do
 but
 so
 does


everybody
 else
 now
 there
 are
 too
 many


factories
 and
 now
 uh
 the
 uh
 Factory


utilization
 Falls
 and
 the
 companies
 go


into
 decline
 so
 then
 they
 pull
 back
 and


they
 and
 they
 stop
 building
 factories
 so


straightforward
 greet
 and
 fair
 greed
 and


fear
 is
 is
 a
 good
 way
 to
 put
 it
 and
 you


know
 uh
 you
 mentioned
 the
 the
 memos
 the


second
 memo
 I
 wrote
 uh
 1991
 was
 called


the


pendulum
 greed
 and
 fear
 optimism
 and


pessimism
 credulousness
 and
 skepticism


now
 you
 dismiss
 forecasting
 yet
 you
 are


a
 great
 believer
 in
 no
 or
 trying
 to


figure
 out
 where
 we
 are
 in
 the
 cycle


isn't
 that
 kind
 of
 counterintuitive
 it


sounds
 it
 on
 the
 face


but
 I
 think
 there
 is
 a


time
 when
 when
 forecasting
 becomes
 more


useful
 and
 that
 is
 when
 we're
 at
 an


extreme
 uh
 now
 if
 think
 about
 what
 I


said
 a
 minute
 ago
 that
 the
 biggest


mistake
 people
 make
 is
 to
 believe
 that
 a


process
 once
 in
 operation
 will
 continue


non-stop
 forever
 that's
 what
 takes


markets
 to


extreme
 highs
 which
 we
 call
 Bubbles
 and


lows
 which
 we
 call


crashes
 but
 when
 we're
 extremely
 high


and
 people
 get
 excited
 and
 say
 hey
 this


is
 going
 to
 go
 on
 for
 ever
 usually
 it


will
 collapse
 eventually
 of
 its
 own


weight
 so
 when
 the
 market
 is
 crazy
 high


or
 crazy
 low
 I
 think
 we
 can
 uh
 make
 a


profitable
 uh
 forecast
 the
 only
 thing
 is


uh
 ncai
 that
 we
 don't
 get
 too
 many


opportunities
 uh
 I
 was
 speaking
 with
 my


son
 when
 I
 was
 writing
 that
 book
 on


cycles
 and
 I
 said
 you
 know
 I
 think
 my


market
 forecasts
 have
 been
 about
 right


he
 says
 yes
 Dad
 that's
 cuz
 you
 did
 did


it
 five
 times
 in
 50
 years
 five
 times
 the


market
 has
 been
 at
 such
 an
 extreme
 that


regression
 toward
 the
 mean
 has
 been


dependable
 not
 in
 terms
 of
 when
 it
 will


happen
 or
 what
 will
 cause
 it
 or
 how
 fast


it'll
 happen
 but
 the
 fact
 that
 it
 will


where
 are
 we
 now
 I
 think
 we're
 in
 the


middle
 ground
 I
 think
 we're
 a
 little
 bit


above
 uh
 fair
 value
 but
 not
 so
 high
 that


a
 decline


is
 uh
 predictable
 or
 Dependable
 you
 know


are
 you
 are
 you
 talking
 about
 credit


cycle
 now
 or
 talking
 no
 I'm
 talking


right
 now
 about
 about
 the
 stock
 market


right
 pretty
 much
 and
 I'm
 not
 I'm
 not


involved
 in
 the
 stock
 market
 directly
 uh


you
 know
 most
 of
 Oak
 tre's
 activities


are
 in
 the
 credit
 markets
 yeah
 but
 it's


a
 I
 think
 the
 stock
 market
 is
 a
 good


barometer
 because
 it's
 very
 it's
 very


obvious
 uh
 we
 get
 a
 reading
 in
 the
 stock


market
 every
 day
 we
 don't
 get
 frequent


readings
 in
 the
 credit
 market
 and
 in


private
 credit
 we
 never
 get
 readings
 it


all
 takes
 place
 behind
 closed
 doors
 so
 I


take
 the
 stock
 market
 and
 particularly


the
 S&P
 500
 stock
 index
 in
 the
 US
 as
 a


very
 good
 indicator
 of
 what's
 going
 on


in
 Psychology
 how
 many
 more
 good
 years


do
 you
 think
 we
 have
 well
 see
 now
 now


you've
 crossed
 the
 line
 into
 we
 going


into
 prediction
 now
 into
 well
 but
 not


only
 that
 but
 you've
 crossed
 the
 line


into
 ask
 me
 to
 to
 make
 a
 prediction
 as


to
 time
 right
 one
 of
 my
 oak
 tree


colleagues
 in
 his
 quarterly
 letter
 to


his
 clients
 stated
 his
 rule
 if
 you
 name


a
 price
 don't
 name
 a
 date
 if
 you
 name
 a


date
 don't
 name
 a
 price
 yeah
 and
 then


you
 can
 never
 be
 wrong
 yeah


uh
 you
 know
 the


mar
 here's
 the
 important
 thing
 to
 think


about
 which
 I
 don't
 think
 many
 people
 do


let's
 just
 say
 that
 you
 and
 I
 can
 agree


that
 the
 S&P
 is
 20%
 overvalued
 today


which
 I
 think
 is
 probably
 a
 good


estimate
 the
 PE
 Ratio
 is
 21
 the
 post-war


Norm
 is
 16
 so
 20
 25%


overvalued
 and
 let's
 say
 let's
 say
 we


agree
 on
 that
 and
 let's
 say
 we're


right
 the
 next
 question
 is
 what
 is
 the


probability
 that
 it's
 going
 to
 decline


in
 the
 next


year
 it's
 modest
 it's
 probably
 a
 little


better
 than
 50/50
 but
 it's
 not
 100
 or


90


uh
 if
 you've
 lived
 as
 long
 as
 you
 and
 I


have
 we've
 seen
 markets
 that
 were


overpriced
 become
 more
 overpriced
 yeah


and
 then
 more
 overpriced
 and
 then
 get


into
 a
 genuine
 bubble
 uh
 if
 it
 was
 true


that
 every
 time
 the
 Market's
 overvalued


it


corrects
 then
 you
 wouldn't
 get
 bubbles


but
 do
 you
 see
 any
 bubbles
 within
 the


market
 now


on
 the
 positive
 side
 there
 are
 people


who
 believe
 that
 uh
 that
 the
 AI
 stocks


for
 example
 uh
 are
 are
 in
 a


bubble
 and
 most
 bubbles
 do
 surround


something
 that's
 new
 and
 this
 one
 does


and
 something
 that
 uh
 everybody's
 very


impressed
 by
 um
 I
 don't
 know
 enough


about
 AI
 to
 know
 if
 this
 is
 excessive
 or


or
 Justified
 m
 but
 but
 you
 know
 you


would
 look
 at
 the
 things
 that
 are
 most


exciting
 uh
 to
 most
 people
 and
 and


largely
 at
 the
 things
 that
 are
 new
 now


in
 in
 terms
 of
 excesses
 on
 the


downside
 you
 would
 have
 to
 wonder
 about


China
 I
 mean
 China
 has
 been
 marked
 down


by
 everybody
 many
 people
 describe
 it
 as


uninvestable
 um
 it
 has
 declined
 a
 lot


that
 Chinese
 market
 is
 it
 too
 cheap
 is


it
 well
 I
 again
 I
 don't
 know
 I
 I
 suspect


that
 it
 may
 be
 but
 I
 I
 don't
 know
 enough


about
 it
 uh
 to
 uh
 you
 know
 to
 uh
 make
 a


statement
 and
 and
 one
 of
 the
 rules
 as


you
 know
 is
 that
 it's
 okay
 to
 have
 an


opinion
 on
 these
 subjects
 it's
 just
 not


okay
 to
 bet
 the
 client's
 money
 yeah


that's
 an
 important
 principle
 in
 your


firm
 right
 right
 which
 brings
 us
 on
 to


uh
 risk
 management
 what
 you
 say
 is
 that


um
 your
 goal
 is
 to
 deliver
 Superior


investment
 results
 with
 risk
 and
 under


control
 now
 to
 you
 what
 is
 sound
 risk


management
 sound
 risk
 management
 first


of
 all
 importantly
 is
 not
 risk
 avoidance


risk
 avoidance
 usually
 results
 in
 return


avoidance
 yeah
 um
 if
 you
 want
 to
 make
 a


good
 return
 you
 have
 to
 take
 risk
 I
 put


out
 a
 memo
 last
 week
 on
 the
 subject
 and


I
 said
 uh
 you
 know
 if
 you
 want
 to
 make


money
 uh
 you
 have
 to
 take
 risk
 but
 you


should
 not
 expect
 to
 make
 money
 just
 for


taking
 risk
 you
 have
 to
 do
 it
 skillfully


so
 there
 is
 a
 process
 that
 I
 call
 uh
 the


intelligent
 bearing
 of
 risk
 for
 profit


we
 try
 to
 engage
 in
 that
 it
 has
 to
 be


risk
 you're
 aware


of
 risk
 you
 can
 analyze
 risk
 you
 can


diversify
 and
 risk
 you're
 highly
 paid
 to


take
 if
 if
 those


four
 necessities
 are
 uh
 satisfied
 then


it
 it
 pays
 to
 take
 risk
 when
 you
 talk


about
 um
 probabilistic
 go
 comes
 what
 do


you
 mean
 by
 that
 because
 we're
 not


dealing
 with
 the
 physical
 sciences


because
 we're
 not
 dealing
 with


physics
 uh
 there
 can
 always
 be
 a
 variety


of
 outcomes
 we
 we
 the
 future
 is
 never
 so


certain
 that
 only
 one
 thing
 can
 happen


in
 fact
 there
 was
 a
 professor
 at
 the


London
 Business
 School
 named
 Elroy


Dimson
 and
 he
 said
 risk
 means
 more


things
 can
 happen
 than
 will
 happen
 it's


a
 very
 simple
 statement
 but
 it's
 very


true
 and
 so
 you
 have
 to
 you
 have
 to
 uh


appreciate
 the
 fact
 that
 under
 any
 set


of
 circumstances
 a
 variety
 of
 outcomes


are
 possible
 and
 um
 you
 should
 always


allow
 for
 the
 vagaries
 of
 the
 future
 uh


Mark
 Twain
 the
 Great
 American
 humorist


once
 said
 it
 ain't
 what
 you
 don't
 know


that
 gets
 you
 into
 trouble
 it's
 what
 you


know
 for
 certain
 that
 just
 ain't
 true
 in


other
 words
 excessive
 certainty
 is
 the


enemy
 acknowledging
 your


limitations
 is
 your
 friend
 it
 keeps
 you


from
 getting
 into
 trouble
 what
 is
 the


common
 wisdom
 now
 which
 you
 think
 may
 be


wrong
 uh
 in
 December
 what
 I


thought
 might
 be
 wrong
 well
 you
 saw
 you


know
 in
 December
 there
 was
 a
 high
 Dee


degree
 of
 consensus
 that
 the
 FED
 would


cut
 rat
 six
 times
 this
 year
 yeah
 and
 I


said
 I
 thought
 that
 was
 excessively


optimistic
 I
 described
 it
 as
 goldilock


thinking
 remember
 Goldilocks
 not
 too
 hot


not
 too
 cold
 yeah
 everything's
 it's
 just


right
 everything's
 going
 to
 stay
 good


forever
 that
 kind
 of
 thinking
 is


dangerous
 because
 it
 it
 uh
 it
 it
 assumes


an
 optimistic
 future
 I
 thought
 that
 was


too
 optimistic
 now
 most
 people
 now
 say


two
 or
 three
 rate
 Cuts
 this
 year
 so
 that


error
 I
 think
 has
 been
 corrected
 um


um
 one
 of
 the
 reasons
 I
 think
 that
 that


that
 you
 can't
 predict
 the
 direction
 of


the
 stock
 market
 in
 the
 short
 term


excuse
 me
 just
 one
 one
 thing
 are
 you


surprised
 that
 the
 market
 hasn't
 reacted


more
 negatively
 on
 that
 pretty
 big


adjustment
 in
 expectations
 yes
 I
 am
 I
 am


a
 little
 bit
 surprised
 um


but
 it's
 kind
 of
 like
 calculus
 and
 the


second
 uh
 derivative
 you
 know
 I
 think


that
 I
 think
 that
 the
 market
 is
 still


governed
 by
 optimists
 just
 they're


they're
 a
 little
 less
 optimistic
 but
 The


Optimist
 is
 still
 holding
 sway


um
 but
 if
 you
 look
 at
 the
 if
 you
 look
 at


the
 S&P
 it's
 kind
 of
 flattened
 out
 in


the
 last
 6
 weeks
 and
 it
 hasn't
 gone
 down


but
 it
 also
 stopped
 going
 up
 um
 so
 I
 do


think
 that
 that


the
 the
 level
 of
 optimism
 is
 is
 down
 so


how
 do
 you
 work
 with
 risk
 at
 Oak
 Tre


separate
 risk
 people
 or
 just
 um
 how
 do


you
 structure
 the
 process
 no
 no
 uh
 I've


always
 uh
 resisted
 having
 um
 a
 risk


Management
 Department
 I
 think
 it's


everybody's
 job
 to
 control
 risk
 and
 the


the
 person
 who
 advocates
 for
 a
 given


investment
 and
 studies
 it
 should
 be
 the


person
 who
 not
 only
 thinks
 about
 the


return
 but
 also
 the
 risk


and
 and
 uh
 you
 know
 the
 the
 the
 concept


that
 I
 am
 the
 investor
 my
 job
 is
 to
 make


money
 I
 think
 about
 the
 upside
 there's


somebody
 who
 who
 sits
 over
 there
 in
 the


corner
 his
 job
 is
 to
 think
 about
 the


risk
 I
 think
 that
 gets
 you
 into
 D


dangerous
 territory
 uh
 because
 uh


everybody
 says
 well
 I
 can
 count
 on


somebody
 else
 to
 limit
 the
 risk
 I
 think


that's
 I
 think
 that's
 not
 a
 good
 idea
 I


think
 that
 that
 risk
 control
 is


everybody's
 responsibility
 and
 in
 fact


uh
 I
 I
 listed
 our
 investment
 philosophy


before
 risk
 control
 is
 number


one
 I
 want
 and
 and
 by
 the
 way
 oak
 tree


and
 I
 and
 my
 colleague
 started
 off
 doing


straight
 fixed
 income
 when
 you
 when
 you


buy
 bonds
 you
 buy
 an
 8%


bond
 in
 the
 long
 run
 the
 best
 you
 can
 do


is
 8%
 yeah
 there's
 no
 upside
 there's


only
 downside
 so
 uh
 so
 the
 the
 proper


fixed
 income
 investor
 uh
 has
 to
 think


about
 and
 avoid
 the
 downside
 doesn't


have
 to
 worry
 about
 the
 upside
 a
 Graham


and
 DOD
 in
 the
 Bible
 of
 security


analysis
 well
 the
 title
 of
 the
 book
 is


security
 analysis
 Ben
 Graham
 was
 Warren


Buffett


teacher
 they
 said
 in
 that


book
 that
 fixed
 income
 investing
 is
 a


negative
 art
 that
 the
 art
 is
 in
 avoiding


the
 downside
 not
 in
 capturing
 the
 upside


there
 is
 no
 upside
 in
 fixed
 income


investing
 Beyond
 The
 Promised
 return
 so


when
 bonds
 had
 negative
 rates
 what
 did


you
 think
 then
 I
 thought
 it
 was


unsustainable
 uh
 I
 mean
 uh
 but
 negative


rates
 were
 not
 a
 market
 phenomenon
 they


were
 uh
 administered
 by
 the
 central


banks
 yeah
 uh
 and
 of
 course
 in
 the
 short


run
 uh
 the
 central
 banks
 can
 do
 what


they
 want
 there's
 an
 old
 saying
 in


America
 don't
 fight
 the
 FED
 uh
 you
 know


and
 and
 by
 the
 way
 if
 you
 think
 about
 it


uh
 in
 December
 I
 mentioned
 that
 the


consensus
 was
 that
 there
 would
 be
 six


rate
 cuts
 the
 Dot
 Plot
 which
 is
 the


expression
 of
 the
 FED
 Executives


opinions
 said
 there
 would
 be
 three
 m
 now


what
 sense
 does
 it
 make
 for
 Market


participants
 to
 say
 there
 will
 be
 six


Cuts
 If
 the
 Fed
 itself
 is
 saying
 there


will
 be
 three
 so
 I
 think
 that
 so
 how
 did


you
 read
 that
 well
 I
 think
 that
 was
 I


think
 that
 was
 a
 mistake
 yeah
 I
 think


that
 was
 that
 was
 an
 excessive
 optimism


but


but
 you
 know


because
 uh
 risk
 control
 is
 job
 one
 in
 my


opinion
 because
 we
 started
 off
 as


straight
 fixed
 income


investors
 we
 came
 up
 with
 the
 motto
 for


oak
 tree
 if
 we
 avoid
 the
 losers
 the


winners
 take
 care
 of
 themselves
 yeah


yeah


now
 that
 was
 good
 for
 the
 first
 10
 plus


years
 after
 that
 we
 started
 getting
 into


what
 I
 call
 aspirational
 strategies


where
 we're
 trying
 to
 make
 not
 8%
 but
 15


or
 20
 avoiding
 the
 losers
 is
 not
 enough


in
 that
 case
 you
 have
 to
 actually
 find


some
 winners
 but
 we
 have
 kept
 risk


control
 as
 tenant
 number
 number
 one
 of


the
 investment
 philosophy
 because
 we
 do


think
 it's
 extremely
 important
 and
 I


want
 every
 uh
 analyst
 and
 portfolio


manager
 be
 to
 be
 thinking
 about
 risk
 and


not
 counting
 on
 the
 person
 in
 the
 risk


Department
 to
 do
 so
 you
 often
 talk
 about


various
 types
 of
 games
 yes
 uh
 C
 games
 uh


poker
 bridge
 backham
 and
 and
 you
 compare


them
 and
 uh
 talk
 about
 how
 you
 taught


your
 son
 to
 play
 and
 was
 so
 much
 fun


right
 what
 kind
 of
 learnings
 have
 you


drawn
 from
 this
 field
 card
 games
 back


Gam


chess
 are
 all
 very
 helpful
 for
 investing


and
 many
 many
 of
 the
 investors
 I
 know


play
 one
 or
 more
 of


them
 um
 it
 first
 of
 all
 it's


risk-taking
 you
 put
 up


money
 in
 the
 hope
 that
 you'll
 end
 up


with
 more
 but
 you
 could
 lose
 your
 stake


so
 it
 gets
 you
 used
 to
 the
 concept
 of


risk
 taking


secondly
 it's
 all


probabilistic
 uh
 you
 there's
 almost


nothing
 you
 can
 do
 that
 will
 always


work
 in
 in
 part
 because
 luck
 is
 involved


and
 in
 part
 because
 you're
 playing


against
 an
 opponent
 who
 is
 skillful
 so


uh
 assessing
 probabilities
 is
 very
 very


important
 uh
 structuring
 your
 bet


knowing
 when
 you
 have
 an
 advantage


knowing
 when
 you
 have
 don't
 have
 an


advantage
 do
 you
 look
 at
 financial


markets
 as
 as
 a
 game
 well
 not
 as
 a
 game


as
 in
 haha
 but
 as
 as
 a
 as
 a
 gamble
 uh
 I


don't
 use
 the
 word
 gamble
 negatively


but
 our
 job
 for
 our
 clients
 is
 to
 take


the
 money
 they've
 entrusted
 to
 us
 and


try
 to
 turn
 it
 into
 more
 uh
 and
 uh
 there


are
 very
 way
 few
 ways
 to
 do
 that


riskless
 and
 the
 riskless
 ways
 don't


have
 much
 reward
 so
 you
 know
 ever
 since


1978
 when
 City
 Bank
 asked
 me
 to
 move


into
 the
 bond
 department
 and
 start
 up


portfolios
 in
 convertible
 bonds
 on
 highi


bonds
 I
 have
 been
 involved
 in
 in
 Market


niches
 that
 are
 considered
 risky
 never


anything
 as
 comfortable
 as
 highgrade


bonds
 or
 uh
 S&P
 stocks
 uh
 these
 are
 real


risk
 markets
 and
 uh
 so
 I've
 had
 to


develop
 uh
 what
 I
 call
 the
 intelligent


bearing
 of
 risk
 for
 profit
 and
 implement


it
 in
 a
 consistent
 way
 now
 another


person
 who
 shares
 your
 love
 for
 games
 is


Annie
 Duke
 I
 think
 her
 work
 is
 great
 but


why
 do
 you
 why
 do
 you
 like
 her
 work
 well


Annie
 Duke
 for
 the
 benefit
 of
 your


listeners
 was
 uh
 at
 one
 point
 in
 time


the
 best
 woman
 poker
 player
 in
 the
 world


she
 was
 world
 champion
 not
 just
 for
 the


women
 but
 for
 everybody
 in
 the
 world
 uh


she
 most
 people
 don't
 know
 it
 but
 she
 uh


well
 when
 I
 first
 met
 her
 five
 years
 ago


she
 had
 completed
 all
 the
 coursework
 for


a
 PhD
 in
 in
 decision
 analysis
 and
 now


she
 has
 earned
 her
 degree
 um
 and
 so
 she


approaches


poker


professionally


analytically
 um
 and
 with
 discipline
 and


that's
 what
 my
 job
 is
 to
 do
 for
 my


clients
 your
 job
 for
 for
 your
 clients
 uh


here
 at
 at
 the
 bank


um
 and
 she
 wrote
 a
 book
 in
 9
 in
 2019


called
 thinking
 in


bets
 first
 of
 all
 I
 just
 love
 the
 title


that
 we
 can
 reduce
 our
 um
 our
 uh


analytical
 process
 to
 structuring
 things


as
 bets
 and
 and
 uh
 I
 uh
 met
 her
 at
 that


time
 was
 really
 impressive
 I
 the
 last


memo
 I
 published
 before
 the
 pandemic
 in


January
 of
 2020
 uh
 was
 entitled
 you
 bet


it
 was
 really
 about
 Annie
 and
 and
 her


approach
 and
 um
 and
 then
 I
 did
 a
 podcast


with
 her
 that
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 have
 told


me
 that
 they
 enjoyed
 um
 and


um
 I
 think
 it
 helps
 a
 great
 deal
 to


think
 about
 the
 process
 of
 structuring


bets
 um
 and
 most
 people
 people
 don't


really
 understand
 it
 they
 think
 that


well
 for
 example
 in
 let's
 say
 there's
 a


uh
 uh
 basketball
 game
 and
 the
 Lakers
 are


playing
 the
 Knicks
 there's
 usually
 very


broad
 agreement
 uh
 which
 team
 is
 better


which
 team
 is
 favored
 in
 that
 game
 but


if
 you
 bet
 on
 the
 underdog
 you
 get
 odds


you
 bet
 a
 if
 you
 bet
 a
 dollar
 and
 they


win
 you
 get
 two
 or
 three


so
 now
 the
 question
 changes
 it's
 not


what
 outcome
 is
 likely
 to
 happen
 but


it's
 is
 the


payoff
 better
 for
 investing
 in
 the
 team


that
 will
 probably


win
 sometimes
 the
 payoff
 is
 better
 for


investing
 in
 the
 team
 that
 will
 probably


lose
 and
 even
 the
 improbability
 of
 their


success
 is
 overcome
 by
 the
 fact
 that


you're
 offered
 sufficient
 op
 this
 is
 the


way
 the
 markets
 work
 too
 absolutely


which
 brings
 us
 to
 the
 whole
 contrarian


investing
 field
 so
 how
 important
 is
 it


to
 be
 contrarian
 in
 finance
 well
 I
 think


it's
 it's
 essential
 uh


contrarianism
 merely
 means
 uh
 betting


against
 the
 consensus
 yeah
 in
 every
 on


every


subject
 there's
 a
 consensus
 there's
 what


most
 people
 believe
 is
 is
 the
 case
 um


when
 the
 consensus
 is
 too
 strong
 and


there's
 too
 much
 optimism
 that
 the


consensus
 outcome
 will
 uh
 uh


apply
 maybe
 the
 odds
 for
 betting
 on
 the


improbable
 outcome
 are
 so
 high
 that
 it's


a
 compelling
 bet
 um
 the
 consensus
 if
 you


take
 that
 into
 the
 investment
 markets


the
 uh
 the
 knowledge
 consensus
 is


already
 embodied
 in
 the
 price
 of
 every


asset
 maybe
 you
 can
 find
 times
 when
 you


think
 the
 consensus
 is
 wrong
 and
 uh
 you


can
 do
 better
 by
 betting
 against
 it


um
 usually


because
 the


payoff
 is
 so
 high
 for
 doing
 the
 thing


that
 is
 considered


unlikely


now
 I
 want
 to
 stress


that
 I
 don't
 think
 it's
 a
 good
 idea
 to


routinely
 say
 well
 what
 does
 the


consensus
 think
 let's
 do
 the


opposite
 the
 process
 has
 to
 be
 much
 uh


deeper
 than
 that
 you
 have
 to
 say
 what


does
 the
 consensus
 think
 what
 do
 I


think
 what's
 wrong
 with
 the
 consensus


thinking
 why
 did
 they
 think
 that
 way


what
 could
 make
 the
 error
 of
 their
 ways


exposed
 so
 it's
 it's
 it's
 a
 very
 deep


question
 but
 uh
 you
 you
 don't
 usually


make
 much
 money
 by
 betting
 on
 the
 thing


that
 everybody
 else
 loves
 the
 big
 money


is
 made
 by
 betting
 on
 the
 things
 they


hate
 which
 as
 a
 result
 are


cheap
 if
 you're
 right
 does
 it
 take
 um


certain
 amount
 of
 personality
 to
 be
 good


at
 this
 it
 does
 take
 a
 certain


personality
 because
 number
 one
 you
 have


to
 be
 uh
 a
 contrarian
 person
 yeah
 you


have
 to
 be
 comfortable
 uh
 existing


outside
 the
 mainstream
 and
 what
 type
 of


people
 is
 that
 I
 think
 analytical
 and


and
 and
 relatively
 tough
 uh
 because
 it's


it's
 not
 pleasant
 uh
 you
 know
 you
 have


10
 people
 in
 a
 room
 all
 10
 are
 buying
 a


certain
 stock
 well
 maybe
 that
 means
 it's


expensive
 maybe
 it's
 more
 expensive
 than


it
 should
 be
 so
 uh
 you
 you
 don't
 buy
 it


or
 you
 sell
 short
 you
 have
 to
 be
 very


strong
 to
 be
 able
 to
 live
 with
 that
 does


it
 help
 to
 be
 a
 loner
 you
 have
 to
 be
 a


loner
 and
 and
 I
 wrote
 a
 memo
 called
 dare


to
 be
 grade
 2
 in
 2015
 I
 think
 it
 was
 and


what
 I
 said
 is
 that
 if
 you
 want
 to
 be
 an


exceptional
 investor
 number
 one
 you
 have


to
 be
 you
 have
 to
 dare
 to
 be
 different


yeah
 your
 portfolio
 has
 to
 be
 different


from
 other
 people
 or
 else
 you
 can't


distinguish
 yourself
 you
 have
 to
 be
 dare


to
 be
 wrong
 uh
 because
 you
 have
 to
 take


on
 these
 unpopular
 positions
 and
 number


three
 you
 have
 to
 dare
 to
 look
 wrong


because
 even
 if
 you're
 right


that's
 probably
 not
 going
 to
 be
 clear


for
 some
 time
 and
 in
 that
 period
 you're


going
 to
 look
 wrong
 out
 of
 Step
 be


criticized
 feel
 inadequate
 you
 have
 to


be
 a
 to
 live
 with
 that
 so
 how
 come


Howard
 Marx
 managed
 to
 be
 wrong
 for
 a


long
 period
 of
 time
 and
 sit
 through
 it


first
 of
 all
 I
 think
 it
 must
 be
 some


Quirk
 of
 my


personality
 uh
 were
 you
 a
 loner
 when
 you


were
 young
 I
 guess
 so
 yeah
 and
 I
 I
 and
 I


and
 I
 believe
 in
 the
 power
 of
 the
 brain


uh
 you
 see


uh
 but
 number
 two
 I
 have
 a
 partner
 named


Bruce
 K
 who
 gets
 less
 attention
 than
 I


do
 uh
 popularly
 he
 likes
 it
 that
 way
 but


uh
 he's
 been
 my
 partner
 since
 '
 87
 and


when
 we
 do
 these
 things
 which
 are


cyclically
 difficult
 that
 is
 like
 for


example
 we
 we
 were
 very
 steady
 buyers
 in


the
 15
 weeks
 following
 the
 bankruptcy
 of


Leman
 Brothers
 650
 million
 a
 week
 on


average
 for
 15
 weeks
 that's
 $10
 billion


we
 support
 each
 other
 and
 uh
 things
 that


would
 be
 difficult


individually
 become
 easier
 when
 you
 have


somebody
 you
 respect
 who
 who
 supports


you
 I
 think
 that's
 a
 very
 very
 good


point
 a
 lot
 of
 fantastic
 fund
 managers


are
 uh
 you
 know
 work
 in
 in
 Paris
 right


um
 but
 is
 it
 easier
 to
 do
 this
 when
 you


have
 more
 experience
 and
 have
 been


proven
 right
 a
 few
 times
 I
 think
 that's


right
 uh
 Nikolai
 you
 have
 to
 um
 I
 mean


on
 the
 one
 hand
 you
 can
 reason
 out
 what


you
 think
 is
 the
 right
 answer
 but
 uh
 I


think
 that
 it
 helps
 to
 as
 you
 say
 have


been
 proved
 right
 in
 the
 past
 and
 you


gain
 a
 certain
 respect
 for
 your
 process


yeah
 um
 and
 U
 and
 also
 the
 other
 thing


is


that
 these
 kinds
 of


behaviors
 which
 we
 we've
 done


successfully
 on
 balance
 have
 been
 done


when
 the
 world
 went
 to
 one
 extreme
 and


we
 were
 contrarian
 and
 after
 you
 do
 it
 a


few
 times
 you
 kind
 of
 it's
 kind
 of
 like


muscle
 memory
 yeah
 and
 you
 kind
 of


develop
 a
 feeling
 oh
 yes
 uh
 I
 think
 I


said
 in
 my
 book
 on
 Cycles
 you
 just
 say


to
 yourself
 oh
 yeah
 this
 is
 one
 of
 those


yeah
 do
 you
 think
 it's
 easier
 to
 be


contrarian
 when
 markets
 are
 really


frothy
 and
 uh
 bullish
 or
 when
 they
 are


fearful
 that's
 a
 great
 question
 um
 I


think
 it's
 easier


when
 the
 markets
 are


frothy
 because
 but
 froth
 is
 difficult
 to


measure
 right
 well
 it
 is
 but
 and
 and
 uh


you
 know
 I
 I
 use
 a
 certain
 uh


barometer
 nothing
 uh
 tangible
 but
 I
 you


know
 I
 spend
 a
 lot
 of
 time
 trying
 what
 I


call
 take
 the
 temperature
 of
 the
 market


and
 get
 a
 sense
 for
 whether
 other
 people


are
 operating
 out
 of
 extreme
 optimism
 or


extreme
 pessimism
 how
 do
 you
 do
 it
 what


do
 a
 bar
 look
 like
 uh
 I
 just
 look
 at


what
 opinions
 are
 being
 expressed
 how


uniformly
 are
 they
 held
 how
 strongly
 are


they
 held
 how
 self-satisfied
 are
 the


people
 who
 are
 holding
 them
 uh
 you
 know


and
 you
 get
 into
 for
 example
 a
 bubble


like
 the
 the
 uh
 internet
 bubble
 uh
 of


2000
 and
 uh
 you
 know
 the
 people
 who
 are


holding
 those
 opinions
 and
 making
 the


most
 money
 are
 doing
 it
 for
 the
 silliest


of
 reasons
 their
 justifications
 just


don't
 hold
 and
 so
 hopefully
 you
 can
 see


through
 that
 and
 and
 get
 off
 the
 train


uh
 before
 they
 ride
 it
 off
 the
 off
 the


cliff
 and
 the
 how
 it
 marks
 uh
 barometer


just
 now
 well
 moderate
 um
 I
 mean
 in
 fact


uh
 I
 I
 wrote
 in
 one
 of
 my
 memos
 recently


that


um
 people
 say
 that
 they
 this
 is
 they're


the
 most
 uncertain
 they've
 ever
 been
 in


my
 book
 that's
 healthy
 you
 should


be
 uncertain
 when
 you're
 certain
 that's


dangerous
 uh
 and


uh


um
 well
 it
 goes
 back
 to
 Twain's
 quote


about
 what
 you
 don't
 know
 but
 uh
 but
 you


you
 know
 it
 for
 certain
 and
 it's
 not


true
 um
 I
 wrote
 a
 book
 a
 memo
 in
 the


October
 of
 uh
 22
 uh
 called
 the
 illusion


of
 knowledge
 there's
 a
 great
 historian


called
 Daniel
 boron
 he
 says
 the
 enemy
 of


knowledge
 is
 not
 ignorance
 it's
 the


illusion
 of
 knowledge
 it's
 the


fallacious
 belief
 that
 you
 know
 which


stops
 you
 from


inquiring
 um
 so
 I
 think
 that


acknowledging
 that
 you
 don't
 know


something
 is
 extremely
 healthy
 what
 is


your
 source
 of
 information
 what
 do
 you


what
 do
 you
 read
 what
 are
 your
 um
 what's


the
 information
 flow
 mostly
 the


newspapers
 I
 try
 to
 uh
 consume
 two
 or


three
 newspapers
 a
 day
 plus
 The


Economist
 um
 uh
 I
 say
 magazine
 they
 call


it
 a
 newspaper


um
 to
 me
 the
 most
 important
 thing
 is
 not


to
 have
 the
 data
 everybody
 has
 the
 data


everybody
 knows
 what's
 happening
 in
 the


world
 today
 and
 what
 happened
 yesterday


to
 me
 the
 most
 important
 thing
 is
 to
 sit


and
 say
 what
 does
 it
 mean
 figure
 out
 the


import
 of
 the
 things
 that
 are
 happening


uh
 the


implications
 um
 and
 uh
 I
 am
 not
 highly


data
 driven
 compared
 to
 other
 people
 but


rather
 um
 driven
 by
 this
 idea
 of


figuring
 out
 where
 we
 stand
 in
 the
 cycle


taking
 the
 temperature
 of
 the
 market
 uh


I
 put
 out
 a
 a
 memo
 in
 the
 roughly
 July


of
 23
 called
 taking
 the
 temperature
 and


I
 say
 that
 there
 were
 as
 as
 as
 I


mentioned
 with
 my
 conversation
 with


Andrew
 there
 were
 five
 times
 in
 my


career
 that
 I
 took
 U
 contrarian
 stands


on
 the


Market
 they
 were
 essentially
 not
 data


driven
 for


example
 I
 was
 very
 concerned
 about
 uh


the
 uh
 conditions
 heading
 into
 what


turned
 out
 to
 be
 the
 global
 financial


crisis
 now
 it
 was
 caused
 by
 the
 housing


bubble
 and
 especially
 the
 subprime


mortgages
 and
 mortgage
 back
 Securities
 I


had
 no
 idea
 about
 subprime
 I
 didn't
 know


it
 existed
 I
 didn't
 know
 much
 about


mortgage
 back
 Securities
 I
 only
 knew


that
 the
 markets
 were
 acting
 in
 a


Carefree
 nonrisk
 conscious
 manner
 which


to
 me
 is
 the
 most
 dangerous
 thing
 so
 who


do
 you
 speak
 to
 who
 do
 you
 advice
 I
 try


to


um
 glean
 knowledge
 broadly
 um
 there
 are


really
 no
 particular
 individuals
 of


course
 I
 always
 like
 to


uh
 I
 used
 to
 know
 uh
 try
 very
 hard
 to


know
 what
 Charlie
 Munger
 was
 thinking


and
 uh
 I
 try
 to
 keep
 up
 with
 Warren


Buffett
 but
 he
 doesn't
 say
 much
 um
 um


Stan
 druck
 and
 Miller
 uh
 he
 you
 can
 get


you
 can
 get
 Stan
 at
 talk
 but
 he's
 a


traiter
 so
 his
 his
 opinion
 changes
 in


the
 short
 term
 yeah
 um


there
 Seth
 claran
 is
 a
 very
 uh


intelligent
 money
 manager
 in
 Boston


um
 and
 uh
 I
 I
 just
 try
 to


um
 I
 would
 call
 myself
 an


observer
 uh
 and
 uh
 I
 just
 try
 to
 U


critically
 observe
 what's
 going
 on


around
 me
 now
 Howard
 you
 are
 um
 let's


say
 now
 you
 are
 2025
 you
 are
 um
 studying


business
 and
 you
 want
 to
 plan
 a
 life
 in


in


finance
 how
 do
 you
 go
 about
 this
 what
 is


your
 advice
 to
 young
 people
 who
 are


interested
 in
 this
 field
 my
 most


important
 advice
 is


this
 due
 to
 the
 prevalence
 of


Randomness
 in
 the
 financial
 world
 you


can't
 be
 an


investor


satisfactorily
 if
 you
 have
 to
 be
 right


all
 the


time
 uh
 there's
 a
 book
 called
 Fooled
 by


Randomness
 by
 Nasim
 Nicholas
 TB
 and
 he


contrasts
 investing
 against
 Dentistry
 he


says
 if
 you
 if
 you
 go
 to
 dental
 school


and
 you
 learn
 to
 fill
 a
 cavity
 and
 you


fill
 it
 that
 way
 every
 time
 you'll
 be


successful
 every
 time
 there's
 nothing


you
 can
 do
 in
 investing
 that
 will
 make


you
 successful
 every
 time
 if
 you
 if


you're
 right
 60%
 or
 70%
 of
 the
 time
 you


you'll
 be
 the
 smartest
 man
 in
 the
 world


so
 I
 if
 you're
 the
 kind
 of
 person
 who


has
 to
 be
 right
 all
 the


time
 don't
 become
 an
 investor
 no
 but


investing
 is
 a
 great
 puzzle
 with
 many


many


considerations
 that
 have
 to
 be
 peeled


like
 an
 onion
 and
 if
 you
 like
 responding


to
 an
 intellectual
 puzzle
 and
 you
 can


stand
 the
 ups
 and
 downs
 and
 the
 vagaries


of
 being
 wrong
 I
 think
 it's
 a
 great
 area


but
 you
 have
 to
 equip
 yourself


philosophically
 to
 do
 it
 and
 then
 you


have
 to
 have
 an
 apprenticeship
 in
 which


you
 learn
 from
 somebody
 else
 who
 knows


how
 to
 do
 it
 you
 have
 solved
 his
 puzzle


better
 than
 most
 people
 the
 whole
 world


big
 thanks
 for
 being
 with
 us
 and
 all
 the


best
 going
 forward
 thank
 you
 for
 your


interesting
 questions
 thank
 you
