Minister,
 distinguished
 guests,
 ladies


and
 gentlemen,
 it
 is
 an
 honor
 and
 a


privilege
 for
 me
 to
 welcome
 you
 to


Norisbank
 Climate
 Conference
 2025.


both
 those
 of
 you
 present
 here
 today
 and


those
 of
 you
 who
 are
 following
 the


conference
 online


and
 as
 the
 central
 bank
 and
 MBIM
 are


co-hosting
 this
 event
 it
 is
 a
 pleasure


to
 share
 the
 stage
 with
 you
 Nikolai


climate
 change
 is
 one
 of
 the
 greatest


challenges
 of
 our
 time
 its
 consequences


are
 far
 and
 wide
 threatening


biodiversity


damaging
 homes
 and
 infrastructure
 and


putting
 health
 and
 lives
 at
 risk.
 And


the
 science
 is
 clear.
 Global
 warming
 is


caused
 by
 human
 activity
 and
 global


temperatures
 continue
 to
 rise.
 2024
 was


the
 hottest
 year
 on
 record.


But
 in
 a
 time
 of
 global
 uncertainty,
 it


is
 easy
 to
 lose
 focus
 on
 the
 climate


crisis.
 And
 yet,
 addressing
 it
 remains


an
 urgent
 task.


This
 year
 marks
 10
 years
 since
 the
 Paris


Agreement
 was
 signed,
 aiming
 to
 limit


global
 warming
 to
 1.5
 degrees
 above


pre-industrial


levels.


However,
 even
 if
 the
 world
 manages
 to


limit
 global
 warming,
 the
 impacts
 of


past
 greenhouse
 gas
 emissions
 on
 the


climate
 will
 remain
 with
 us
 for
 years
 to


come.
 And
 neither
 the
 central
 bank
 nor


the
 MBIM
 can
 ignore
 this
 fact.


>> No,
 that's
 right.
 Um
 so
 let
 me
 start


with
 um
 a
 question.
 Uh
 how
 many
 of
 you


have
 been
 to
 Rome?


That's
 pretty
 good.
 Well
 then
 you
 may


have
 seen
 this
 sculpture.


It's
 the
 capital
 line
 wolf
 and
 is
 one
 of


the
 most
 famous
 sculptures
 in
 Rome.
 Now


it
 depicts
 two
 twins
 Romelus
 and
 Remis


who
 according
 to
 the
 myth
 later
 went
 on


to
 found
 the
 city
 and
 they
 survived
 by


circling
 on
 the
 shewolf
 and
 she
 became


their
 mother
 earth
 so
 to
 say.
 So
 where


am
 I
 taking
 this?


Well,
 uh,
 second
 question.
 How
 many
 of


you
 have
 been
 to
 the
 cosmopolitan
 city


of
 Lilism?


[Laughter]


That's
 good.
 Here
 you
 may
 find
 this


sculpture
 by
 contemporary
 artist
 Eric


Palt,
 the
 capital
 wolf,
 too.


Now,
 what
 happened
 to
 Romelus
 and
 Remos?


Quite
 greedy,
 aren't
 they?


And
 I
 kind
 of
 think
 this
 is
 visualizing


what's
 going
 on
 just
 now.


If
 the
 day
 if
 the
 way
 we
 live
 dayto-day


is
 not
 sustainable
 in
 the
 long
 run,
 this


is
 what's
 going
 to
 happen.
 Economics
 and


finance
 are
 dependent
 on
 a
 sustainable


world.
 Climate
 affects
 the
 economy
 and


so
 therefore
 climate
 risk
 is
 a
 financial


risk.
 And
 while
 being
 wellfed
 in
 the


short
 term
 is
 a
 good
 thing
 in
 the
 long


run
 it
 all
 needs
 to
 be
 sustainable
 and


we
 are
 all
 in
 it
 for
 the
 long
 run.


Absolutely
 Nicolai.


Now
 the
 responsibility
 for
 reducing


emissions
 rests
 with
 political


authorities


who
 also
 have
 the
 most
 effective


instruments.


But
 climate
 change
 and
 the
 climate


transition
 affect
 the
 economy
 and


therefore
 it
 also
 affects
 the
 work
 of


the
 central
 bank.


A
 decade
 ago,
 the
 then
 governor
 of
 the


Bank
 of
 England,
 Mark
 Carney,
 gave
 a


speech
 titled
 Breaking
 the
 Tragedy
 of


the
 Horizon:
 Climate
 Change
 and


Financial
 Stability.


With
 that
 speech,
 he
 ushered
 us
 into
 a


new
 era.
 Central
 banks
 started
 taking


the
 effects
 of
 climate
 change
 more


seriously
 and
 the
 network
 for
 greening


the
 financial
 system
 was
 launched
 in


2017
 by
 central
 banks
 and
 financial


supervisors
 with
 the
 idea
 that
 we
 can


approve
 our
 analysis
 by
 working
 together


and
 sharing
 experiences.


Now
 central
 banks
 are
 mandated
 to
 ensure


price
 stability
 and
 financial
 stability.


Climate
 change
 can
 affect
 both.


More
 frequent
 and
 more
 severe
 weather


events
 can
 lead
 to
 increased
 inflation


volatility
 and
 make
 it
 harder
 to
 achieve


price
 stability.


For
 example,
 the
 rapid
 rise
 in
 food
 and


beverage
 prices
 in
 Norway
 over
 the
 past


year
 can
 in
 part
 be
 traced
 back
 to
 a


sharp
 increase
 in
 the
 prices
 of
 cocoa


and
 coffee
 and
 further
 back
 to
 drafts
 in


Brazil
 and
 heat
 waves
 in
 West
 Africa.


Ensuring
 financial
 stability
 could
 also


become
 more
 demanding.
 Banks
 and


insurance
 companies
 may
 experience


greater
 losses
 both
 from
 the


restructuring
 of
 the
 business
 sector


resulting
 from
 the
 energy
 transition
 but


also
 from
 the
 fact
 that
 extreme
 weather


can
 destroy
 both
 crops
 and
 buildings.


So
 inspire


strategy
 gaining
 a
 better
 understanding


of
 the
 effects
 of
 climate
 change
 on
 the


Norwegian
 economy
 has
 been
 a
 priority.


We
 are
 learning
 more
 every
 day
 but
 still


do
 not
 have
 any
 definite
 answers.


So
 climate
 change
 is
 affecting
 the
 work


of
 the
 central
 bank
 but
 it's
 also


affecting
 the
 work
 you
 do
 Nikolai.


>> Absolutely.
 So
 our
 fund
 uh
 our
 goal
 is


to
 generate
 returns
 in
 financial
 markets


not
 for
 ourselves
 but
 for
 gen
 for


Norwegians
 now
 and
 future
 generations.


We
 invest
 for
 the
 long
 term.
 We're


invested
 in
 9,000
 companies
 across
 70


countries
 and
 we
 own
 roughly
 one
 and
 a


half%
 of
 all
 the
 listed
 equities
 in
 the


world.
 Now
 when
 you
 own
 the
 whole
 world,


what
 happens
 in
 one
 part
 of
 the
 world


impacts
 the
 rest
 of
 it.
 What
 happens


with
 one
 company
 is
 captured
 by
 all
 the


other
 companies.
 That
 is
 why
 climate


change
 impacts
 us.


Climate
 risk
 is
 long-term,


systematic
 and
 very
 uncertain.


But
 mitigating
 and
 adapting
 to
 climate


change
 also
 create
 economic


opportunities.
 And
 our
 goal
 is
 to


capture
 those
 opportunities.


We
 worked
 on
 climate
 change
 for
 nearly


20
 years
 to
 understand
 the
 effects
 on


our
 portfolio.


Three
 years
 ago,
 we
 launched
 the
 2025


climate
 action
 plan
 with
 a
 very
 bold


ambition
 to
 be
 the
 world
 leading
 in
 this


area.
 Because
 if
 you
 have
 really
 high


ambitions,
 you
 achieve
 great
 things
 even


if
 you
 fall
 sh
 slightly
 short.
 If
 you


have
 low
 ambitions,
 you
 achieve
 nearly


nothing
 even
 if
 you
 succeed.


This
 decade
 is
 crucial
 for
 achieving
 an


orderly
 climate
 transition.
 It's
 complex


and
 there
 will
 be
 winners
 and
 losers.


Some
 high
 emitting
 companies
 will


decline
 and
 perhaps
 disappear
 while


others
 will
 transform
 and
 grow.


And
 OA
 goal
 is
 to
 drive
 our
 companies


towards
 net
 zero
 emissions
 by
 2050.


And
 this
 target
 guides
 all
 our
 work.


Now,
 are
 we
 succeeding?


Well,
 this
 is
 a
 marathon
 and
 not
 a


sprint.
 And
 even
 as
 large
 investors,
 we


need
 the
 help
 from
 the
 rest
 of
 you.
 We


engage
 with
 companies
 with
 standard


setters
 because
 we
 believe
 that
 climate


risk
 is
 a
 financial
 risk
 and
 managing
 it


is
 good
 for
 business.


Our
 current
 plan
 ends
 this
 year,
 but


tomorrow
 we
 are
 launching
 the
 climate


action
 plan
 2030.


But
 no
 spoilers
 now.


>> So
 let's
 instead
 turn
 to
 today's


wonderful
 program
 and
 let
 me
 first
 say


we
 are
 delighted
 to
 have
 so
 many


outstanding
 speakers
 here
 with
 us
 today.


Now
 in
 the
 first
 session
 we
 will
 learn


more
 about
 how
 the
 climate
 is
 changing


and
 how
 the
 economy
 is
 impacted
 by
 those


changes.
 The
 theme
 in
 the
 second
 session


will
 be
 on
 the
 macroeconomic
 impacts
 and


challenges
 of
 the
 lowcarbon
 transition.


And
 after
 the
 lunch
 break,
 we
 are
 very


fortunate
 to
 have
 the
 president
 of
 the


European
 Central
 Bank
 Christine
 Lagard


and
 former
 US
 vice
 president
 Al
 Gore


deliver
 keynote
 addresses
 which
 will
 be


followed
 by
 a
 conversation
 between
 the


two
 moderated
 by
 Christine
 Halvan
 from


Caesar
 and
 then
 in
 the
 final
 session
 we


will
 delve
 into
 the
 consequences
 of


climate
 change
 for
 financial
 markets
 and


investors.


Today's
 moderators
 are
 Deputy
 Governor


Estein
 Basham
 and
 Karolina
 Espigen
 who


is
 a
 researcher
 on
 climate
 economics


here
 at
 the
 bank.
 So
 welcome
 to
 the


stage
 Estean
 and
 Karolina.


Thank
 you
 very
 much.
 It's
 so
 good
 to
 see


all
 of
 you
 here
 today.
 And
 asa
 just


said,
 Caroline
 and
 I,
 we
 will
 be


chairing
 this
 event
 today.
 Yes.
 And
 we


have
 a
 great
 program
 ahead
 of
 us
 and


we're
 very
 excited
 for
 this
 allstar


gathering
 of
 speakers.
 When
 we
 put


together
 the
 program
 we
 started
 by


asking
 the
 top
 climate
 experts
 on
 the


field
 if
 they
 would
 like
 to
 participate


and
 believe
 it
 or
 not
 everyone
 accepted


our
 invitation.


>> So
 we
 really
 have
 something
 to
 look


forward
 to.
 Now
 I
 have
 the
 pleasure
 of


sharing
 this
 first
 session
 and
 Caroline


will
 be
 back
 for
 the
 second.


And
 this
 first
 session
 is
 about
 uh


climate
 change
 and
 macroeconomic
 uh


impacts.
 And
 we
 have
 three
 speakers
 that


will
 shed
 light
 on
 this
 uh
 this
 matter.


And
 first
 we're
 delighted
 to
 welcome


Bernset
 from
 Cicero,
 the
 center
 for
 uh


international
 climate
 research
 located


here
 uh
 in
 Oslo.
 And
 Bjern
 Samset
 is


also
 a
 professor
 at
 the
 Norwegian


University
 of
 Life
 Sciences.
 and
 he's
 a


renown
 climate
 scientist,
 a
 former
 IPCC


member
 who
 combines
 rigorous
 scientific


expertise
 with
 exceptional
 communication


skills.
 So
 today
 he
 will
 go
 to
 the
 core


of
 the
 problem
 and
 update
 us
 on
 how
 the


climate
 is
 actually
 changing.
 So
 please


give
 a
 warm
 welcome
 to
 Bjorn
 Sunset.


Thank
 you
 and
 good
 morning.


I
 was
 asked
 to
 set
 the
 stage
 for
 today's


events.
 And
 if
 climate
 change
 was
 indeed


a
 stage
 play
 and
 not
 hardcore
 reality,


the
 point
 we're
 at
 would
 be
 a
 very


dramatic
 one.
 It
 would
 be
 one
 of
 the


points
 in
 the
 play
 where
 we
 really
 rack


up
 the
 tension,
 where
 the
 audience


really
 feels
 that
 something
 is
 going
 on


and
 the
 actors
 of
 the
 play
 haven't


realized
 the
 seriousness
 yet.


We
 of
 course
 have
 been
 monitoring
 from


the
 science
 side
 climate
 change
 for
 a


long
 time
 and
 we
 still
 are.
 And
 this


monitoring
 is
 revealing
 some
 dramatic


facts
 that
 climate
 change
 itself


currently
 seems
 to
 be
 changing.


One
 of
 the
 changes
 is
 that
 the
 human


impacts
 or
 so
 the
 impacts
 of
 human


induced
 climate
 change
 are
 becoming


clearer
 to
 us
 yearbyear.
 Not
 just


because
 we're
 looking
 harder,
 but


because
 we're
 feeling
 them
 more
 acutely.


For
 a
 long
 time,
 climate
 change
 has
 been


real
 and
 dramatic,
 but
 still
 its
 changes


have
 been
 on
 par
 with
 ve
 weather


variations.
 This
 is
 no
 longer
 the
 case


as
 is
 evident
 from
 all
 the
 natural


disasters
 natural
 disasters
 that
 are


fueled
 by
 climate
 change
 that
 we
 keep


seeing
 yearby
 year.


We
 can
 take
 examples
 the
 2022


flood
 in
 Pakistan
 which
 was
 started
 by
 a


heat
 wave
 made
 worse
 by
 climate
 change.


Then
 came
 um
 um
 uh
 the
 monsoon
 season


which
 was
 also
 more
 intense
 by
 climate


change
 made
 more
 intense
 by
 climate


change
 and
 the
 combination
 of
 these
 two


led
 to
 about
 a
 tenth
 of
 the
 country


falling
 underwater
 with
 long-term


consequences.
 You
 do
 not
 clean
 up


something
 like
 that
 overnight.


2023
 we
 had
 the
 historically
 strong


fires
 of
 Canada
 with
 local
 effects
 but


also
 with
 long
 ranging
 effects
 across


the
 Arctic.
 And
 this
 fire
 is
 only
 one
 of


many
 examples
 of
 fires
 in
 the
 Arctic.


The
 Arctic
 is
 burning.


2024
 we
 had
 the
 unprecedented
 floods
 in


Valencia
 with
 their
 catastrophic


impacts.
 One
 of
 the
 reasons
 that
 the


impacts
 of
 the
 Valencia
 flood
 became
 as


bad
 as
 they
 were
 is
 that
 the
 local


authorities
 did
 not
 really
 believe
 it


could
 get
 that
 bad


until
 it
 was
 too
 late.
 The
 same
 story


unfortunately
 was
 repeated
 in
 2025
 in


Texas.
 But
 I'll
 take
 another
 example


which
 hasn't
 reached
 at least
 the


Norwegian
 news
 as
 quite
 as
 much
 and
 that


is
 a
 series
 of
 glacier
 collapses
 in


Nepal
 and
 surrounding
 regions
 with


ensuing
 floods
 and
 massive
 massive


damages.


All
 these
 are
 but
 examples
 of


na
 events
 with
 major
 consequences
 that


we
 now
 know
 have
 been
 made
 worse,
 more


intense
 and
 more
 frequent
 by
 by
 climate


change.
 This
 is
 where
 science
 takes
 us.


This
 is
 an
 example
 of
 an
 overview
 from


um
 the
 grouping,
 the
 UK
 grouping
 called


World
 Weather
 Attribution,
 which


routinely
 tracks
 all
 these
 major
 events,


picks
 out
 the
 most
 damaging
 ones
 and


checks
 what
 does
 science
 say
 about
 this


particular
 event.
 And
 everywhere
 you
 see


a
 red
 dot,
 there
 was
 a
 catastrophic


damaging
 event
 in
 2024
 that
 was
 made


worse
 by
 climate
 change.
 Everywhere
 you


see
 a
 blue
 dot,
 there
 was
 an
 event
 that


was
 made
 less
 likely
 by
 climate
 change.


And
 those
 of
 you
 with
 sharp
 eyes
 will


see
 that
 one
 of
 the
 few
 blue
 dots
 is


here
 where
 we're
 standing.
 That
 was
 a


cold
 winter.
 So
 those
 of
 you
 who


remember
 the
 cold
 winter
 of
 early
 24,


remember
 that
 one
 because
 you
 will
 be


seeing
 less
 of
 it.


But
 the
 real
 drama
 is
 not
 necessarily


the
 extreme
 events
 themselves.
 We
 are


learning
 about
 those.
 We
 are
 learning
 to


adapt
 to
 them.
 The
 drama
 lies
 behind


because
 what
 is
 driving
 these
 extreme


events
 is
 of
 course
 global
 warming.
 The


fact
 that
 the
 earth
 is
 getting
 warmer,


the
 surface
 is
 getting
 warmer,
 the


climate
 is
 getting
 more
 extreme,
 there


is
 more
 precipitation.
 So
 the
 question


becomes
 what
 is
 happening
 to
 global


warming?
 Maybe
 the
 most
 important
 graph


of
 this
 century
 is
 this
 one.
 This
 is


global
 warming
 from
 1850
 until
 today.


It's
 probably
 the
 one
 graph
 you've
 seen.


If
 you've
 seen
 one
 graph
 from
 climate


science,
 you
 see
 all
 the
 wiggles
 from


year
 to
 year.
 You
 see
 that
 not
 a
 lot


happened
 from
 1850
 up
 until
 about
 1920


or
 so.
 But
 then
 things
 kick
 off.
 And
 if


like
 me,
 you've
 been
 alive
 since


sometime
 in
 the
 1970s,


you
 have
 lived
 through
 a
 situation
 with


constant
 steady
 global
 warming
 on


average
 for
 every
 year
 throughout
 the


lifetimes
 of
 just
 about
 everyone
 in
 this


room.


This
 constant
 evolution
 has
 been
 steady


enough
 that
 when
 the
 IPCC
 made
 its
 one


and
 a
 half
 degree
 report
 in
 2028,


their
 assessment
 of
 when
 we
 would
 hit


1.5
 degrees
 was
 made
 just
 by
 drawing
 a


straight
 line
 which
 was
 well
 justified.


However,
 since
 2018
 and
 somewhat
 before,


global
 warming
 has
 been
 speeding
 up.
 And


if
 you're
 honest
 from
 the
 natural


science
 side,
 we
 do
 not
 fully
 know
 why.


There
 is
 a
 quite
 intense
 activity
 now
 in


understanding
 why
 the
 most
 recent
 years


have
 been
 not
 just
 record
 warm,
 but


record
 warm
 to
 a
 record
 degree.


This
 is
 the
 um
 usual
 red
 picture
 that


the
 uh
 newspapers
 pull
 up
 showing
 the


temperature
 anomaly
 from
 a
 certain


baseline
 in
 2024.
 You
 can
 essentially


see
 that
 it's
 all
 red.
 There
 are
 no
 blue


areas.
 The
 whole
 world
 has
 warmed.
 We


know
 this.
 But
 what
 we
 don't
 know
 is
 why


it
 got
 quite
 as
 warm.
 And
 there's
 quite


a
 lot
 of
 interesting
 discussion
 around


that
 which
 we
 need
 to
 learn
 from
 because


our
 concern
 here
 is
 of
 course
 what
 will


happen
 into
 the
 future.


So
 one
 thing
 that
 has
 got
 a
 lot
 of


attention
 was
 the
 fact
 that
 in
 2020


um
 something
 really
 positive
 happened


that
 the
 international
 maritime


organization
 mandated
 that
 sulfur
 should


no
 longer
 be
 a
 part
 of
 shipping
 fuels.


That
 is
 excellent.
 But
 it
 also
 means


that
 um
 the
 sulfur


or
 the
 process
 that
 happens
 after
 you


emit
 sulfur
 stopped.
 What
 is
 this


process?
 Not
 something
 you
 usually
 think


about.
 Well,
 it's
 chemistry
 in
 the


atmosphere.
 You
 emit
 sulfur.
 It
 gets
 up


in
 the
 atmosphere
 and
 it
 forms
 particles


and
 these
 small
 particles
 reflect


sunlight.
 So,
 the
 shipping
 fuel


contributed
 to
 cooling
 the
 Earth


somewhat,
 a
 little
 bit.
 This
 particular


change
 has
 gotten
 a
 lot
 of
 attention.
 We


now
 believe
 it
 is
 not
 the
 major


contributor
 to
 the
 fact
 that
 the
 last


few
 years
 have
 been
 very
 warm,
 but
 it


still
 gets
 a
 lot
 of
 attention
 and
 we


still
 need
 to
 focus
 on
 it.
 Something


else
 that
 has
 happened
 though
 over
 about


the
 same
 time
 scale
 is
 that
 the
 same
 has


actually
 happened
 in
 China.
 Air


pollution
 is
 a
 major
 concern
 across
 the


world
 and
 in
 all
 industrial
 regions.


Many
 industrial
 regions
 have
 worked
 hard


to
 remove
 air
 pollution
 and
 have
 gotten


far
 uh
 in
 the
 uh
 Europe
 in
 Europe
 and
 in


the
 US
 there
 isn't
 all
 that
 much
 air


pollution
 left.
 However,
 in
 Asia,
 in


particular
 in
 South
 and
 East
 Asia,
 there


has
 for
 many
 decades
 been
 a
 strong


growth
 in
 air
 pollution.
 That
 air


pollution
 has
 also
 been
 cooling
 the


earth.
 So,
 we've
 had
 quite
 strong


cooling
 from
 our
 own
 pollution.
 Now,


China
 about
 10-15
 years
 ago
 decided
 to


do
 something
 about
 this.
 And
 when
 China


decides
 to
 do
 something,
 they
 are


efficient.
 So,
 they
 really
 succeeded.
 So


about
 80%
 of
 the
 sulfur
 from
 Chinese


coal
 fire
 power
 plants
 and
 other


factories
 and
 road
 traffic
 has


disappeared
 over
 this
 time
 scale.
 So
 it


shows
 that
 or
 we
 we
 we've
 been
 able
 to


show
 we
 and
 other
 scientists
 that
 this


has
 actually
 contributed
 to
 speeding
 up


global
 warming
 over
 the
 last
 10
 to
 15


years.


Now
 that's
 of
 course
 a
 little
 bit


dramatic
 because
 you
 remove
 one
 negative


effect
 and
 you
 get
 another.
 On
 the
 other


hand,
 it
 also
 means
 that
 this
 was
 a


temporary
 growth
 in
 the
 speed
 of
 global


warming.
 That
 is
 potentially
 positive.


However,
 there
 are
 other
 things


happening
 now
 that
 we've
 warmed
 the


earth,
 of
 course,
 or
 we
 are
 warming
 the


earth.
 The
 earth
 is
 responding.
 One
 of


these
 things
 I
 showed
 you
 already.
 It
 is


the
 fires
 in
 the
 Arctic.


Canada
 in
 23
 was
 one
 example,
 but
 there


are
 many
 of
 these
 fires
 also
 in
 more


remote
 regions
 like
 Siberia,
 like
 the
 in


of
 Siberia
 that
 we
 don't
 look
 as
 much


into.
 The
 smoke
 across
 the
 Arctic
 is
 now


such
 that
 we
 can
 easily
 see
 it
 from


satellites.
 We
 can
 easily
 see
 it
 from


monitoring
 and
 it
 is
 affecting
 the
 whole


Arctic
 region.
 This
 is
 one
 of
 the


feedbacks
 that
 is
 rapidly
 happening
 as


part
 of
 climate
 change.
 Another
 feedback


that
 rarely
 crosses
 our
 minds
 is
 what's


going
 on
 far
 out
 in
 the
 Pacific.
 I'm


willing
 to
 bet
 that
 nobody
 here
 pays


much
 attention
 to
 the
 goings
 on
 in
 the


middle
 of
 the
 Pacific
 Ocean.
 However,
 we


we
 scientists
 do
 and
 we're
 seeing


changes
 in
 the
 cloud
 cover
 over
 the


Pacific,
 most
 likely
 in
 response
 to
 the


world
 warming.


Now,
 when
 the
 clouds
 disappear
 or


change,
 that
 will
 also
 change
 the
 rate


of
 global
 warming.
 So
 these
 things
 are


important
 and
 we
 need
 to
 monitor
 these


things.
 Unfortunately,
 the
 country
 that


has
 been
 doing
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 monitoring,


the
 US,
 has
 now
 partially
 decided
 to


turn
 off
 some
 of
 its
 monitoring
 program


for
 various
 political
 reasons.
 And
 this


is
 a
 dramatic
 loss
 in
 our
 capacity
 to


continue
 to
 track
 these
 detailed


developments
 that
 we
 need
 to
 know
 in


order
 to
 give
 you
 the
 message
 of
 what's


going
 on
 into
 the
 future.


But
 of
 course
 the
 main
 effect
 is
 the


fact
 that
 we
 are
 still
 setting
 records


in
 CO2
 emissions
 every
 year.
 This
 is
 and


will
 continue
 to
 be
 the
 main
 cause
 of


warming.
 Let
 us
 not
 change
 this
 fact
 or


or
 um
 get
 away
 from
 from
 this
 fact.
 And


the
 more
 we
 warm
 the
 earth,
 the
 more


questions
 appear
 because
 we
 do
 not
 know


what
 will
 happen
 to
 the
 earth
 as
 it


warms.
 We
 have
 never
 performed
 this


experiment
 before.
 We
 are
 in
 unknown


territory
 as
 I
 know
 we
 will
 hear
 more


about
 later
 on
 today.


Of
 course,
 however,
 we
 are
 able
 to
 give


projections


and
 the
 most
 important
 projection
 now
 is


that
 regardless
 of
 our
 emission
 changes


today,
 we
 are
 still
 looking
 at
 several


decades
 of
 rapid
 global
 warming.
 That
 is


a
 depressing
 message,
 but
 it
 is
 an


important
 message.


is
 however
 not
 the
 only
 message.


What
 happens
 after
 that
 is
 significantly


impacted
 by
 our
 decisions
 today.
 So
 do


not
 think
 that
 our
 decisions
 do
 not


matter.
 It's
 just
 that
 they
 matter
 in


the
 longer
 term.
 So
 the
 second
 kind
 of


most
 important
 graph
 of
 this
 century


would
 be
 this
 one.
 It's
 a
 few
 years
 old


now,
 but
 it's
 still
 relevant.
 It's
 from


the
 last
 IPCC
 report
 and
 shows
 what
 will


happen
 to
 global
 temperature
 into
 the


future.
 So
 the
 bit
 I've
 shown
 you


already
 is
 the
 black
 part.
 That's
 the


historical
 temperature
 change.
 And
 what


will
 happen
 into
 the
 future
 depends
 on


our
 emissions.
 The
 dark
 lines
 show


futures
 with
 high
 CO2
 emissions.
 The


blue
 lines
 show
 uh
 futures
 with
 low
 CO2


emissions.
 We
 know
 this.
 The
 more
 we
 cut


the
 lower
 we
 can
 make
 global
 warming


into
 the
 future.
 But
 the
 important
 bit


is
 really
 what
 for
 me
 now
 for
 us
 now
 is


what
 happens
 over
 the
 next
 20
 years.


There
 is
 very
 little
 change,
 very
 little


difference
 between
 these
 lines
 over
 the


coming
 20
 years.
 And
 in
 particular
 in
 a


situation
 like
 now
 where
 global
 warming


is
 progressing
 more
 rapidly
 than
 before.


And
 that
 brings
 us
 back
 to
 where
 I


started
 because
 these
 events
 are


unfortunately
 only
 the
 beginning
 and


they're
 only
 part
 of
 the
 symptom.
 We


already
 heard
 examples
 of
 all
 the
 other


consequences
 of
 climate
 change
 on
 food


production,
 on
 health,
 on
 migration,
 on


all
 these
 kind
 of
 things.


So
 with
 climate
 change
 progressing


rapidly,
 the
 most
 important
 message
 we


have
 now
 except
 cut
 emissions
 as
 rapidly


as
 we
 can
 is
 that
 whatever
 we
 plan,
 be


it
 industrial,
 be
 it
 societal,
 be
 it
 for


your
 own
 family,
 we
 must
 plan
 for
 a


climate
 that
 is
 much
 warmer,
 much


wetter,
 and
 much
 wilder
 than
 today.


because
 that
 is
 what
 we
 will
 get


regardless.
 If
 we
 do
 this,
 we
 can
 adapt.


This
 is
 of
 course
 where
 it
 gets


complicated
 and
 you
 get
 graphs
 like
 this


one
 which
 shows
 an
 unadapted
 world
 to


the
 left
 and
 an
 adapted
 world
 to
 the


right
 and
 you
 can
 bring
 this
 one
 home


with
 you
 and
 study
 it
 in
 detail.
 The


point
 is
 we
 need
 to
 cut
 emissions
 but
 at


the
 same
 time
 we
 need
 to
 plan
 for
 a


future
 with
 a
 wilder
 climate
 because


climate
 change
 is
 getting
 stronger.
 It


will
 become
 stronger
 and
 it
 is
 not
 going


away.
 Thank
 you.


Thank
 you.
 Thank
 you
 very
 much
 Bren.
 You


have
 really
 made
 clear
 the
 gravity
 of


the
 situation
 and
 now
 both
 I
 and
 you
 all


are
 asking
 yourself
 the
 question
 so
 what


does
 this
 mean
 for
 the
 economy?
 And


that's
 where
 we
 move
 on
 to
 our
 next


speaker
 uh
 to
 tell
 us
 more
 about
 the


impacts
 the
 economic
 impacts
 of
 climate


change.
 We
 are
 honored
 to
 welcome


Professor
 Solomon
 Young
 from
 Stanford


University.
 He
 is
 a
 pioneering
 scholar


who
 has
 fundamentally
 shaped
 how
 we


understand
 climate
 economics.
 And
 as


co-founder
 of
 the
 climate
 impact
 lab
 and


the
 first
 chief
 environmental
 economist


at
 the
 White
 House,
 Professor
 Young
 has


also
 bridged
 academic
 research
 and


realworld
 policy
 uh
 impacts.
 And
 for
 us


here
 at
 Noguspank,
 his
 work
 has
 been


particularly
 valuable
 in
 the
 area
 of


investment
 management
 where
 he
 has
 been


a
 trusted
 partner
 for
 uh
 for
 years.
 So,


Professor
 Xang,
 welcome
 to
 the
 stage.


Thank
 you
 so
 much
 for
 having
 me.
 Uh,
 I


flew
 in
 yesterday
 from
 eight
 time
 zones


away,
 but
 Bjorn,
 that
 was
 brilliant,
 and


now
 I'm
 wide
 awake.
 Um,
 so
 I
 want
 to


talk
 to
 you
 about
 how
 we
 think
 about


what
 the
 macroeconomic
 implications
 of


these
 dramatic
 changes
 to
 the
 planet


might
 mean.
 So
 here's
 a
 graph
 where
 on


the
 top
 you
 see
 countries
 sort
 of


positioned
 based
 on
 where
 their


temperatures
 might
 be
 in
 the
 future
 and


where
 their
 distribution
 of
 historical


temperatures
 have
 been
 in
 the
 past.
 And


so
 what
 you
 can
 do
 with
 this
 graph
 is


you
 can
 make
 vertical
 comparisons
 and


see
 for
 example
 that
 in
 the
 future
 we


expect
 the
 temperature
 of
 Norway
 to
 look


more
 analogous
 to
 what
 we
 see
 in
 Germany


today.
 We
 also
 expect
 in
 the
 future


Indonesia
 will
 look
 more
 like
 Sudan.
 And


then
 quite
 importantly,
 we
 expect
 that


Sudan
 will
 look
 like
 nothing
 we've
 ever


seen
 before.
 So
 how
 do
 we
 understand


what
 this
 shift,
 seemingly
 simple
 shift


in
 the
 distribution
 might
 mean
 for
 the


global
 economy?
 So
 the
 thing
 I
 would


love
 to
 do
 is
 the
 sort
 of
 science
 fair


version
 of
 the
 experiment
 where
 I
 take


two
 planets
 and
 I
 heat
 up
 one
 of
 them


and
 I
 look
 after
 the
 fact
 to
 understand


what
 the
 economies
 of
 the
 two
 look
 like.


That's
 obviously
 a
 difficult
 experiment


to
 run.
 So
 what
 we
 do
 instead
 is


something
 that's
 like
 a
 natural


experiment,
 a
 quasi
 experiment
 where
 we


follow
 populations
 over
 time
 and
 as
 they


experience
 different
 climates,
 we


observe
 what
 their
 economy
 does
 in


response.
 And
 so
 just
 to
 give
 you
 an


example,
 consider
 hurricanes.
 Now
 I
 know


this
 is
 not
 something
 you
 think
 about
 as


much
 in
 Norway
 here
 as
 we
 do
 in
 the


United
 States.
 Uh
 this
 is
 an
 image
 of
 at


the
 night
 of
 an
 image
 at
 night
 of


hurricane
 Ivan
 bearing
 down
 on
 the
 US


coastline.


So
 when
 we
 try
 to
 understand
 the
 effect


of
 hurricanes,
 one
 thing
 we
 do
 is
 we


first
 build
 a
 physical
 model
 of
 the


storms
 themselves.
 So
 this
 is
 what
 we


call
 a
 wind
 field
 and
 it
 describes
 the


intensity
 of
 winds
 within
 one
 of
 these


storms
 and
 then
 you
 can
 take
 this
 and


you
 can
 match
 it
 to
 the
 historical


record
 and
 try
 to
 rebuild
 the
 historical


experience
 of
 different
 countries
 as


this
 particular
 storm,
 in
 this
 case
 one


that
 was
 happening
 in
 the
 70s,
 uh
 passes


over
 a
 location.
 And
 the
 colors
 here
 are


showing
 you
 what
 the
 populations
 in
 the


storm
 might
 experience
 as
 it
 passes


overhead.
 So
 we
 can
 rebuild
 all
 the


storms
 in
 the
 historical
 record.
 This
 is


a
 single
 year.
 There's
 about
 a
 hundred


of
 these
 storms
 on
 the
 planet
 in
 any


given
 year.
 And
 then
 we
 can
 rebuild
 many


different
 years.
 So
 then
 we
 can
 use
 this


variation
 to
 understand
 these
 storms
 are


basically
 beating
 up
 on
 the
 global


economy
 and
 try
 to
 understand
 what


different
 countries
 are
 doing
 in


response.


So
 people
 before
 we
 had
 done
 this
 type


of
 analysis
 had
 had
 different
 theories


about
 how
 countries
 might
 respond
 to


these
 types
 of
 extreme
 disasters.
 So


here
 on
 the
 x-axis
 you
 see
 time
 and
 on


the
 y-
 axis
 is
 sort
 of
 GDP.
 So
 the
 top


line
 here
 is
 labeled
 sort
 of
 a
 creative


destruction
 idea.
 It's
 a
 theory
 that


maybe
 these
 events
 kind
 of
 jostle


society.
 They
 change
 the
 economy.
 Maybe


uh
 Bart
 and
 I,
 you
 know,
 some
 trees
 fall


down
 in
 our
 yard.
 We
 work
 together
 to


clear
 them
 and
 we
 realize
 through
 that


work
 that
 we
 have
 business
 interests


together
 and
 we
 do
 something
 new.
 So


actually
 sort
 of
 a
 little
 bit
 of


pertabbation
 could
 be
 stimulating
 for


the
 economy.
 Another
 theory
 is
 this


build
 back
 be
 better
 notion.
 Maybe
 we


don't
 replenish
 the
 capital
 in
 the


economy
 at
 the
 efficient
 rate
 and
 so
 a


storm
 comes
 through
 it
 clears
 out
 some


old
 capital.
 We
 rebuild
 and
 that's
 new


capital
 that's
 better.
 That's
 kind
 of


like
 I
 had
 this
 really
 old
 phone
 and
 it


was
 outdated
 and
 very
 slow.
 It
 was


bugging
 me
 and
 then
 I
 dropped
 it.
 It


broke.
 I
 bought
 a
 new
 phone
 and
 I
 was


like
 oh
 why
 didn't
 I
 buy
 a
 new
 phone


earlier?
 Right?
 That's
 like
 I
 should


have
 updated
 my
 capital
 earlier.


The
 third
 idea
 here
 is
 this
 recovery
 to


trend.
 Maybe
 really
 what
 matters
 is
 the


frontier
 of
 global
 technology.
 And
 so
 as


the
 global
 frontier
 moves
 forward,


countries
 will
 just
 catch
 up
 to
 that


frontier
 over
 time.
 And
 the
 fourth


hypothesis
 is
 that
 there's
 no
 recovery.


Getting
 hit
 by
 a
 disaster
 like
 this
 is


essentially
 the
 same
 as
 moving
 backwards


in
 time
 for
 an
 economy.
 You
 destroy


capital
 and
 we
 simply
 just
 have
 to


rebuild
 it
 again.
 When
 you
 look
 at


thousands
 of
 storms
 around
 the
 world,


what
 we
 see
 is
 that
 this
 no
 recovery


hypothesis
 is
 actually
 what
 we
 see
 what


occurs
 to
 most
 countries.
 So
 over
 the


course
 of
 20
 years
 after
 a
 hurricane,
 we


see
 that
 the
 economy
 declines
 relative


to
 trend
 somewhat
 slowly
 and
 never


recovers.
 What
 does
 this
 mean
 for
 some


of
 our
 new
 experiences
 that
 we
 are


having
 in
 this
 unprecedented
 new
 normal?


So,
 here's
 a
 map
 that
 we
 put
 together
 in


the
 week
 after
 Hurricane
 Maria
 struck


Puerto
 Rico
 in
 the
 United
 States.
 I


apologize
 for
 the
 units
 here.
 Uh,
 what


happened
 during
 this
 storm
 was


unprecedented
 in
 the
 Atlantic.
 The


average
 wind
 speed
 of
 a
 randomly


selected
 location
 anywhere
 in
 this


territory
 was
 200
 kmh.


So,
 to
 get
 a
 sense
 of
 scale
 of
 what
 that


means,
 I
 tell
 people
 to
 imagine
 driving


200
 kilometers
 per
 hour.
 Maybe
 you


haven't
 done
 that.
 You
 stick
 your
 hand


out
 the
 window
 of
 your
 car.
 You
 feel


that
 pressure
 on
 your
 arm.
 Now
 imagine


getting
 out
 and
 standing
 on
 the
 hood
 of


your
 car.
 Okay,
 that
 is
 what
 happened
 to


the
 entire
 territory
 on
 average.


When
 we
 match
 those
 types
 of


calculations
 to
 our
 estimates,
 what
 we


think
 is
 that
 in
 the
 course
 of
 12
 hours,


Puerto
 Rico
 basically
 reversed
 a
 quarter


century
 of
 economic
 development.
 And


sort
 of
 these
 projections
 which
 came
 out


early
 on
 seem
 to
 have
 been
 borne
 out
 on


the
 ground.
 One
 point
 we
 also
 make
 with


this
 graph
 is
 that
 the
 scale
 of
 these


disasters
 is
 comparable
 to
 other
 type
 of


financial
 crises
 that
 we
 in
 this
 room


often
 talk
 about
 maybe
 with
 a
 bit
 more


attention.


So
 now
 to
 think
 about
 other
 effects
 of


climate
 change
 besides
 hurricanes.


There's
 many
 of
 them.
 There's
 impacts
 on


human
 health,
 on
 sea
 level
 rise,
 on


people's
 sleep.
 Okay,
 I
 I'm
 not
 going
 to


be
 able
 to
 talk
 through
 all
 of
 them


today,
 but
 what
 I
 want
 to
 do
 is
 focus


your
 attention
 on
 something
 that
 is
 very


simple,
 but
 seems
 to
 be
 from
 the
 data
 to


be
 extremely
 important
 for
 the
 world.


So,
 you
 know,
 many
 things
 in
 the
 world


change
 when
 the
 temperature
 changes.


This
 is,
 you
 know,
 in
 the
 ' 40s,
 uh,


Charles
 Mworth
 did
 a
 whole
 bunch
 of


really
 interesting
 studies
 for
 the


British
 military.
 He
 was
 a
 British


military
 researcher.
 They
 were
 sending


troops
 to
 to
 hot
 countries
 and
 he
 wanted


to
 understand
 what
 the
 effect
 was
 on


their
 productivity.
 So
 here's
 an


experiment
 where
 he
 just
 took
 soldiers,


sat
 them
 at
 a
 table,
 and
 they
 were


forced
 to
 do
 arm
 curls
 until
 they


collapsed
 on
 the
 floor.
 Okay?
 And
 so


this
 is
 a
 graph
 what
 you
 see
 where
 the


x-axis
 is
 the
 temperature
 of
 the
 room,


which
 they
 experimentally
 manipulate,


and
 the
 y-axis
 is
 how
 many
 arm
 curls


they
 could
 do.
 Okay?
 And
 what
 you
 see
 is


as
 the
 temperature
 increases,


the
 soldiers
 are
 collapsing
 uh
 at
 an


earlier
 and
 earlier
 moment
 in
 time.
 We


see
 this
 in
 modern
 data
 when
 we
 look
 at


different
 types
 of
 outcomes.
 And
 so
 on


one
 side
 here
 you're
 looking
 at
 the


productivity
 of
 an
 individual
 corn


plant.
 You
 can
 think
 of
 that
 as
 a
 unit


of
 capital
 or
 on
 the
 other
 side
 you
 can


think
 of
 it
 as
 you
 can
 look
 at
 the


productivity
 or
 whether
 or
 not
 people


show
 up
 to
 work
 uh
 in
 the
 labor
 market.


And
 what
 we
 see
 in
 a
 variety
 of
 contexts


is
 that
 as
 temperatures
 increase


productivity
 might
 increase
 somewhat


slightly
 but
 at
 some
 critical
 threshold


productivity
 of
 most
 units
 in
 the


economy
 tanks
 and
 becomes
 much
 lower.


Now
 when
 you
 have
 many
 different


fundamental
 units
 of
 the
 economy
 that


are
 all
 undergoing
 the
 similar
 process,


what
 you
 end
 up
 with
 when
 you
 aggregate


the
 data
 is
 that
 the
 productivity
 over


the
 overall
 macroeconomy
 follows
 this


type
 of
 curve.
 Okay?
 And
 so
 what
 you


have
 here
 is
 on
 the
 x-axis
 the
 average


temperature
 of
 a
 country
 and
 on
 the


y-axis
 output
 in
 of
 GDP.
 What
 we
 see
 is


that
 as
 temperatures
 increase,


productivity
 tends
 to
 increase.


Sometimes
 it's
 actually
 a
 little
 flatter


in
 some
 newer
 studies.
 And
 then
 at


around
 15
 to
 13
 degrees
 Celsius,
 it


peaks
 and
 then
 begins
 to
 decline.
 And


the
 slope
 of
 the
 decline
 here
 is
 about


one
 to
 one
 and
 a
 half
 percent
 per
 degree


Celsius.


This
 curve,
 if
 you
 don't
 remember


anything
 else
 from
 this
 talk,
 this
 curve


probably
 after
 15
 years
 of
 research,


I've
 decided
 that
 this
 curve
 probably


has
 more
 to
 do
 with
 the
 structure
 of
 the


future
 global
 economy
 than
 anything
 else


we've
 looked
 at.
 What
 is
 the
 implication


of
 this
 curve?
 So
 well,
 first
 of
 all,


you
 can
 ask,
 are
 we
 adapting?
 You
 know,


the
 world
 is
 like
 we
 have
 a
 lot
 of


technology.
 It's
 very
 sophisticated.


Have
 things
 changed?
 Are
 we
 figuring
 out


how
 to
 cope
 with
 temperature
 more


effectively?
 The
 answer
 is
 no.
 We
 find


no
 evidence
 that
 the
 global
 economy
 is


changing
 and
 how
 responsive
 it
 is
 to


average
 temperatures.
 You
 can
 look
 over


time
 and
 what
 we
 see
 today
 is
 the
 same


thing
 we
 saw
 in
 the
 60s.


You
 can
 also
 look
 around
 the
 world
 at


different
 types
 of
 data
 sets.
 Whether


you
 look
 at
 a
 very
 wealthy
 country
 like


the
 United
 States,
 whether
 you
 look
 at


China,
 rapidly
 developing,
 whether
 you


look
 at
 India,
 Brazil,
 hundreds
 of


household
 surveys
 done
 by
 the
 World


Bank,
 we
 see
 essentially
 the
 same
 shape


over
 and
 over
 again.


You
 can
 also
 ask,
 well,
 what
 happens
 if


I
 were
 to
 just
 look
 within
 countries
 and


do
 something
 that's
 almost
 like
 that


first
 experiment
 I
 told
 you
 about
 and


look
 at
 the
 parts
 of
 the
 countries
 that


are
 heating
 up
 faster
 historically


versus
 heating
 up
 less
 quickly.
 So
 here


what
 I'm
 showing
 you
 is
 you
 know
 the


10th
 the
 top
 10%
 of
 uh
 locations


actually
 the
 bottom
 10%
 of
 locations
 in


India
 in
 terms
 of
 how
 quickly
 they
 are


warming
 up.
 So
 they
 are
 warming
 up
 the


most
 slowly.
 They're
 the
 coolest


locations
 in
 India
 over
 the
 last
 couple


decades.
 And
 if
 you
 compare
 them
 to
 the


locations
 in
 India
 that
 have
 been


warming
 more
 quickly
 what
 you
 see
 is
 a


wedge
 is
 already
 emerging
 and
 that


historically
 over
 the
 last
 couple


decades
 the
 places
 that
 are
 warming


quicker
 are
 now
 growing
 slower.
 This


type
 of
 relationship
 shows
 up
 in
 other


emerging
 economies
 around
 the
 world.
 So


this
 is
 the
 last
 several
 decades
 we
 can


see
 this
 type
 of
 experiment
 already


unfolding.


You
 can
 also
 ask
 what
 are
 the


implications
 for
 wealthier
 economies


that
 we've
 seen
 over
 the
 last
 couple


decades.
 So
 here
 what
 we've
 done
 is


we're
 looking
 at
 Europe
 and
 the
 United


States
 and
 we're
 essentially
 trying
 to


remove
 the
 effect
 of
 historical
 warming


and
 simulate
 what
 the
 economies
 would


have
 done
 had
 we
 not
 already
 experienced


several
 decades
 of
 climate
 change.
 When


you
 compare
 that
 to
 what
 has
 actually


been
 the
 output
 of
 these
 economies
 over


time,
 what
 you
 see
 is
 that
 there


actually
 is
 a
 substantial
 wedge
 that's


already
 occurring
 and
 the
 numbers
 are


quite
 large
 because
 the
 scale
 of
 these


economies
 are
 so
 significant.
 So
 we


estimate
 that
 over
 the
 last
 several


decades,
 we've
 already
 foregone
 several


trillion
 dollars
 in
 income
 because
 of


warming
 that
 has
 already
 occurred
 to


date.


Now,
 one
 idea
 that
 is
 baked
 into
 the


Paris
 agreement
 is
 this
 notion
 of
 loss


and
 damage,
 which
 is
 this
 idea
 that
 the


economies
 that
 have
 been
 emitting
 carbon


or
 other
 greenhouse
 gases
 might
 be
 held


accountable
 for
 the
 damage
 it
 has


imposed
 on
 other
 countries.
 So
 if
 you
 do


the
 type
 of
 exercise
 I
 was
 just
 showing


you
 and
 compute
 how
 much
 income
 a


country
 like
 the
 United
 States
 has


caused
 other
 countries
 to
 lose
 through


the
 channel
 of
 its
 emissions,
 we


estimate
 that
 for
 example
 the
 United


States
 with
 a
 great
 degree
 of


uncertainty
 might
 have
 imposed
 roughly


10
 trillion
 dollars
 of
 losses
 around
 the


world
 if
 you
 add
 it
 all
 up.
 Okay.


Okay.
 So
 everything
 I've
 shown
 you
 so


far
 is
 just
 about
 the
 past
 climate


change
 that
 has
 already
 occurred.
 But


what
 about
 the
 future?
 So
 here's
 a


graph.
 where
 on
 the
 x-
 axis
 is


temperature,
 the
 dots
 are
 countries,
 and


the
 height
 of
 the
 dots
 is
 just
 the
 GDP


growth
 projection
 and
 kind
 of
 a


run-of-the-mill
 economic
 model.
 So,
 it's


like
 2%
 growth
 around
 the
 world
 on


average
 over
 the
 next
 century.
 And
 if


you
 were
 to
 impose
 climate
 change
 on


these
 countries,
 what
 you
 see
 is
 a


depression
 of
 growth
 rates.
 And
 the


depression
 is
 larger
 for
 hotter


countries
 because
 they're
 on
 that


downward
 sloping
 side
 of
 that
 curve.


uh
 if
 you
 were
 to
 roll
 that
 forward
 and


ask
 what
 does
 that
 mean
 for
 what
 the


structure
 of
 the
 global
 economy
 looks


like
 in
 the
 future
 you
 over
 and
 over
 see


maps
 that
 have
 this
 basic
 structure


where
 throughout
 the
 tropics
 and
 the


subtropics
 you
 have
 large
 economic


impacts
 and
 then
 at
 higher
 latitudes
 you


might
 have
 smaller
 impacts
 in
 some
 cases


positive
 impacts
 and
 I
 realized
 just
 now


that
 this
 is
 a
 slightly
 older
 figure


that
 makes
 things
 look
 pretty
 good
 for


Europe
 but
 once
 we've
 actually
 updated


10
 more
 years
 of
 data
 it
 doesn't
 quite


look
 so
 good
 anymore.


When
 we
 take
 this
 and
 we
 think
 about


what
 this
 means
 in
 terms
 of,
 you
 know,


what
 are
 the
 implications,
 there's


really
 three
 takeaways
 that
 you
 can
 kind


of
 remember.
 So,
 first
 of
 all,
 when
 you


add
 up
 global
 output
 and
 ask
 what
 are


the
 implications
 for
 world
 GDP,
 we
 see
 a


decline.
 And
 that
 there's
 a
 great
 deal


of
 uncertainty,
 but
 it's
 to
 the
 tune
 of


20
 to
 40%
 of
 GDP
 depending
 on
 the


different
 types
 of
 models
 people
 use.


Now,
 that's
 a
 central
 estimate.
 The


other
 thing
 you
 see
 is
 that
 there's
 a


great
 deal
 of
 spread,
 tremendous


uncertainty
 in
 what
 the
 effect
 of


climate
 change
 will
 be
 on
 the
 global


economy.
 And
 you
 know,
 I
 point
 out
 to


folks
 that
 that
 should
 be
 thought
 of
 as


an
 additional
 type
 of
 cost.
 We
 as
 a


society
 do
 not
 like
 uncertainty.
 And
 by


creating
 all
 this
 new
 uncertainty
 for


ourselves,
 we
 are
 imposing
 a
 great
 deal


of
 uh
 great
 a
 great
 cost
 on
 ourselves


going
 forward.


The
 third
 point
 is
 that
 because
 the


tropical
 regions
 and
 that
 subtropical


regions
 that
 have
 the
 greatest
 impact
 on


their
 macroeconomy
 are
 today
 also
 the


poorer
 regions
 of
 the
 world.
 We
 generate


graphs
 that
 look
 like
 this
 where
 the


poorer
 twothirds
 of
 the
 world
 are


experiencing
 climate
 change
 with
 much


more
 intensity,
 much
 greater


macroeconomic
 impact.
 So
 that
 you
 have


this
 divergence
 in
 the
 future
 that


emerges
 as
 a
 result
 of
 warming.


So
 in
 my
 last
 example,
 what
 I
 want
 to
 do


is
 talk
 about
 some
 of
 the
 uh
 more
 subtle


sorry
 some
 of
 the
 more
 extreme


implications
 of
 what
 this
 might
 mean.
 So


we
 have
 begun
 to
 start
 asking
 the


question
 uh
 could
 this
 lead
 to
 the
 m


material
 risk
 of
 so
 societies
 breaking


down


and
 to
 think
 about
 that
 what
 we've
 done


is
 we've
 focused
 on
 in
 this
 case
 Africa


and
 ask
 the
 question
 could
 this
 push


countries
 sort
 of
 over
 a
 cliff
 beyond


which
 it
 becomes
 extremely
 difficult
 to


recover.
 So
 on
 this
 graph,
 what
 I'm


showing
 you
 on
 the
 y-axis
 is
 GDP
 growth.


Positive
 is
 good,
 negative
 is
 bad.
 And


on
 the
 horizontal
 axis,
 we're
 looking
 at


civil
 conflict
 risk.
 Could
 it
 be
 the


case
 that
 declines
 in
 the
 macroeconomy


lead
 to
 political
 instability,
 which
 in


turn
 then
 feedback
 on
 the
 macroeconomy


make
 growth
 more
 difficult,
 which
 then


leads
 to
 sort
 of
 this
 downward
 spiral
 in


which
 countries
 have
 difficulty


recovering.
 So
 the
 concern
 is
 that
 some


countries
 might
 move
 into
 a
 position


where
 they
 have
 persistent
 negative


growth,
 economic
 decline


and
 much
 higher
 rates
 of
 political


instability
 and
 conflict.
 So
 this
 is
 a


heristic.
 When
 we
 look
 at
 the
 data
 and


try
 to
 calibrate
 a
 model
 and
 make
 a


projection
 going
 forward,
 what
 we
 see
 is


that
 throughout
 Africa,
 there
 are
 some


countries
 that
 will
 that
 have
 been


extremely
 productive
 historically
 and


warming
 will
 make
 them
 grow
 slower.
 But


that
 is
 not
 enough
 to
 really
 push
 them


over
 the
 edge.
 However,
 the
 the
 concern


is
 that
 there
 are
 many
 countries
 in


Africa
 that
 are
 sort
 of
 on
 the
 cusp


where
 warming
 is
 expected
 to
 reduce


output
 to
 the
 point
 where
 it
 might


amplify
 conflict
 risk
 and
 then
 push
 them


into
 this
 bad
 stable
 equilibrium
 where


essentially
 conflict
 risk
 and
 macro
 bad


macroeconomic
 performance
 lead
 to
 a


persistent
 bad
 outcome
 that
 is
 hard
 to


escape.


Part
 of
 our
 work
 has
 been
 trying
 to


understand
 the
 scale
 of
 this
 risk.
 And


what
 we
 see
 is
 that
 for
 a
 substantial


fraction
 of
 countries
 in
 Africa,
 the


risk
 of
 persistent
 economic
 decline


increases
 by
 roughly
 25%
 due
 to
 sort
 of


business
 asusual
 scenarios.
 We
 think


that
 this
 is
 a
 major
 risk
 and
 a
 lot
 of


our
 new
 work
 is
 trying
 to
 focus
 on
 this


type
 of
 question.


So
 to
 wrap
 up,
 I
 want
 to
 leave
 you
 with


a
 few
 sort
 of
 straightforward
 take-home


messages.
 The
 first
 is
 that
 the
 evidence


is
 very
 clear
 that
 high
 temperatures
 and


in
 tropical
 cyclones
 that
 I've
 shown
 you


slow
 GDP
 growth.
 The
 effective


temperature
 is
 highly
 nonlinear
 and
 this


is
 very
 important
 for
 the
 structure
 of


the
 global
 income
 distribution
 in
 the


future.
 Historically
 we
 see
 no
 evidence


of
 adaptation.
 Okay,
 we
 do
 probably
 all


adapt
 in
 our
 personal
 lives
 but
 in


aggregate
 that
 has
 not
 been
 enough
 to


move
 the
 dial.
 And
 recent
 warming
 over


the
 last
 several
 decades
 has
 already


substantially
 slowed
 growth
 to
 the
 tune


of
 tens
 of
 trillions
 of
 dollars


worldwide.


By
 2100,
 we
 project
 that
 every
 one


degree
 of
 warming
 will
 lead
 to
 a


reduction
 of
 global
 GDP
 by
 roughly
 10%.


That's
 sort
 of
 like
 a
 benchmark
 number


you
 can
 hold
 in
 your
 mind.


And
 we
 have
 real
 concerns
 now
 that
 sort


of
 the
 coupling
 of
 macroeconomic
 decline


and
 political
 instability
 could
 be


really
 disastrous
 for
 certain
 economies


in
 the
 world
 that
 are
 at
 particularly


high
 risk.


Finally,
 the
 last
 point
 which
 I
 haven't


talked
 too
 much
 about
 is
 that
 there's


this
 idea
 of
 the
 social
 cost
 of
 carbon


which
 is
 if
 we
 try
 to
 compute
 a
 single


number
 that
 represents
 the
 overall


economic
 harm
 to
 the
 global
 economy
 as
 a


result
 of
 the
 emission
 of
 one
 ton
 of


CO2,
 what
 would
 that
 number
 be?
 And


based
 on
 these
 various
 new
 macroeconomic


calculations
 and
 other
 work
 in
 the
 room


here,
 uh,
 new
 estimates
 are
 suggesting


that
 just
 through
 the
 channel
 of
 the


effects
 on
 GDP,
 these
 costs
 amount
 to


roughly
 1,000
 to
 2,000
 US
 per
 ton
 of
 CO2


with
 some
 substantial
 uncertainty.


So
 with
 that,
 I
 want
 to
 just
 leave
 you


with
 this
 sort
 of
 image
 like
 this
 is


very
 similar
 to
 that
 experiment
 I
 laid


out
 at
 the
 beginning.
 Here
 the
 colors


are
 reflecting
 the
 temperatures
 in
 two


different
 projections.
 one
 in
 which
 we


have
 high
 mitigation,
 one
 in
 which
 it's


sort
 of
 business
 as
 usual
 emissions.
 But


what
 I've
 done
 to
 the
 image
 is
 I've


taken
 the
 nightlights,
 which
 we
 tend
 to


think
 reflect
 economic
 activity,
 and


I've
 turned
 them
 up
 or
 down
 to
 reflect


what
 our
 projections
 of
 global
 output


might
 look
 like
 in
 those
 two
 different


scenarios.
 Thank
 you
 very
 much.


Thank
 you.
 Thank
 you
 very
 much.
 What
 a


presentation.
 Fast-paced
 and
 thick
 on


content.
 And
 I
 think
 over
 and
 above
 the


big
 numbers
 that
 speak
 to
 the
 importance


of
 what
 could
 be
 gained
 fixing
 the


issue,
 I
 will
 also
 take
 with
 me
 the


distribution
 of
 those
 uh
 those
 bad


outcomes
 and
 they
 speak
 to
 how
 difficult


it
 is
 to
 actually
 cooperate
 on
 fixing


it.
 Now
 um
 now
 that
 we
 have
 covered


consequences
 uh
 of
 climate
 change


globally,
 we
 will
 uh
 shift
 our
 focus
 and


have
 a
 look
 at
 what
 happens
 closer
 to


home.
 Are
 we
 seeing
 any
 impacts
 already


here
 uh
 in
 Norway
 and
 we
 are
 fortunate


to
 have
 uh
 Amelia
 Garcia
 Aendini
 here


today.
 She's
 an
 associate
 professor
 at


the
 University
 of
 St.
 Allen,
 faculty


member
 at
 the
 Swiss
 Finance
 Institute


and
 also
 an
 affiliated
 researcher
 uh


with
 with
 us
 here
 at
 Nogisbunk
 for
 some


years
 now.
 So
 together
 with
 uh
 other


colleagues
 here
 at
 the
 bank,
 she
 has


explored
 how
 extreme
 weather
 events
 uh


already
 now
 affect
 Norwegian
 households


and
 will
 present
 to
 us
 uh
 these


findings.
 So
 Amelia,
 please
 take
 the


floor.


[Applause]


>> So
 thank
 you
 very
 much.
 Um
 so
 it's
 a


great
 honor
 for
 me
 to
 be
 standing
 here


on
 this
 stage
 to
 talk
 to
 you
 about
 the


research
 that
 I've
 conducted
 together


with
 my
 dear
 colleagues
 at
 Norgis
 Bank


Carolyn
 Espigrin
 as
 well
 as
 Secret


Galassan
 and
 Matis
 Melum.
 So
 um
 let
 me


start
 the
 presentation
 with
 a
 personal


note.


So
 when
 I
 tell
 people
 that
 I'm
 working


on
 a
 paper
 that
 is
 estimating
 the


impacts
 of
 natural
 disasters
 on
 the


Norwegian
 economy,
 the
 reaction
 that
 I


often
 get
 is,
 "Oh,
 are
 there
 natural


disasters
 in
 Norway?
 Uh
 especially
 from


my
 friends
 from
 southern
 uh
 Europe,
 I


get
 this
 reaction."
 So
 there
 seems
 to
 be


this
 perception
 that
 Norway
 is
 pretty


much
 shielded
 from
 the
 worst
 effects
 of


climate
 change.
 Um,
 of
 course
 we
 know


this
 is
 not
 true
 as
 shown
 by
 this
 image


which
 was
 taken
 after
 extreme
 weather


hands
 hit
 Norway.


Now
 uh
 the
 projection
 from
 the
 IPCC


suggests
 that
 such
 events
 are
 going
 to


be
 much
 more
 likely
 in
 in
 the
 future
 as


well
 as
 we
 can
 expect
 also
 having
 u
 sea


level
 rise
 and
 other
 other
 things
 in


Norway.
 So
 we
 started
 off
 this
 project


um
 trying
 to
 figure
 out
 what
 the
 the


recent
 trends
 have
 been.
 So
 have
 we


started
 observing
 already
 now
 that
 such


events
 like
 these
 are
 more
 frequent
 and


um
 for
 this
 purpose
 we


rely
 on
 detailed
 data
 on
 insurance


payments


insurance
 payouts
 from
 finance
 Norway


and
 well
 you
 may
 know
 that
 actually


insurance
 in
 in
 Norway
 is
 very


particular.
 So
 every
 asset,
 so
 every


home
 or
 also
 every
 machine
 that
 is


insured
 against
 fire
 is
 going
 to
 be


automatically
 insured
 also
 against


extreme
 weather
 events.
 The
 premiums
 are


very
 small.
 They
 are
 the
 same
 for


everybody
 and
 if
 a
 person
 gets
 hit
 by
 a


natural
 disaster
 um
 they
 will
 have
 to


pay
 only
 a
 very
 small
 deductible.


So
 um
 this
 this
 data
 provides
 very


unbiased
 data
 very
 unbiased
 data
 on
 what


the
 prevalence
 of
 natural
 disasters
 has


been.


So
 this
 is
 what
 we
 found.
 So
 these
 are


uh
 in
 US
 dollars
 and
 deflated
 amounts.


So
 we
 see
 that
 the
 payouts
 have


increased
 enormously
 over
 the
 time.
 And


if
 we
 think
 about
 the
 number
 of


Norwegian
 municipalities
 that
 have
 been


hit
 by
 especially
 strong
 uh
 events
 like


this
 that
 has
 also
 increased
 over
 time.


So
 we
 define
 strong
 events
 as
 those
 that


cause
 that
 for
 which
 payouts
 insurance


payouts
 are
 at
 least
 5%
 of
 the
 local


income.
 So
 that
 is
 uh
 that
 is
 a
 lot.
 So


we
 next
 went
 to
 the
 main
 part
 of
 our


analysis.
 So
 which
 is
 to
 ask
 a
 question


what
 are
 the
 e economic
 impacts
 of
 these


events
 on
 the
 Norwegian
 households.
 Now


for
 this
 um
 we
 took
 the
 insurance


payouts
 data
 which
 from
 which
 we
 got


information
 about
 where
 these


municipalities
 are
 that
 were
 hit
 at
 some


point
 in
 time
 from
 an
 extreme
 weather


event.
 So
 those
 are
 the
 red


municipalities
 in
 this
 map.
 And
 then
 we


combined
 this
 data
 with
 very
 detailed


anonymized
 information
 on
 the


characteristics
 of
 the
 households
 that


are
 living
 in
 those
 municipalities.


And
 then
 from
 other
 municipalities,


similar
 municipalities
 in
 Norway,
 we
 try


to
 find
 the
 most
 similar
 households
 in


Norway
 um
 that
 are
 comparable
 to
 those


households
 that
 were
 living
 in
 those
 uh


affected
 areas.


So
 through
 this
 comparison
 what
 we
 can


do
 is
 to
 follow
 the
 trends
 on
 in


households
 income
 their
 wealth
 and
 their


consumption
 before
 and
 after
 the


disaster.


Now
 precisely
 because
 the
 insurance
 in


Norway
 is
 universal
 people
 are
 going
 to


be
 paid
 back
 for
 the
 direct
 damages
 of


the
 extreme
 weather
 events.
 So
 what
 we


are
 estimating
 and
 what
 I
 will
 show
 you


the
 results
 are
 basically
 the
 indirect


impacts
 of
 these
 extreme
 weather
 events


um
 due
 to
 broader
 repercussions
 of
 the


extreme
 weather
 on
 the
 Norwegian


economy.
 So


let
 me
 walk
 you
 through
 the
 results.
 So


this
 is
 a
 graph
 um
 of
 the
 income.
 It


shows
 the
 difference
 in
 the
 income
 of


households


and
 um
 that
 those
 that
 were
 affected


relative
 that
 those
 to
 those
 that
 were


not
 affected.
 So
 to
 the
 left
 of
 the


vertical
 line
 you
 have
 the
 trends
 over


the
 four
 years
 previous
 to
 the
 to
 the


disaster.
 And
 as
 you
 can
 see
 the
 black


line
 is
 pretty
 much
 oscillating
 around


zero.
 And
 this
 is
 by
 design
 because
 we


chose
 to
 compare
 income
 uh
 with
 very


similar
 households
 that
 were
 not


affected.
 Now
 of
 course
 after
 the


disaster
 we
 found
 that
 there
 was
 a
 sharp


decrease
 in
 the
 income.
 So
 cumulatively


the
 decrease


was
 about
 $720
 US.
 Um
 then
 we
 zoomed
 in


a
 little
 bit
 closer
 on
 these
 data
 and
 we


found
 that
 this
 result
 which
 is
 for


income
 after
 taxes
 was
 basically
 driven


by
 income
 uh
 from
 labor
 labor
 income.


Now
 the
 picture
 is
 similarly
 negative


for
 wealth.
 So
 we
 we
 found
 that
 after


the
 disaster,
 Norwegians
 that
 were


affected
 by
 the
 by
 by
 the
 events,


extreme
 events,
 saw
 a
 loss
 in
 their


wealth
 in
 the
 two
 years
 after
 the


disaster
 of
 about
 13,000
 US.


We
 also
 found
 that
 this
 result
 comes


from
 a
 decrease
 in
 the
 housing
 wealth
 of


the
 Norwegians,
 which
 is
 most
 likely
 due


to
 a
 drop
 in
 the
 housing
 prices
 in
 the


local
 area.
 So
 neighborhoods
 that
 have


been
 hit
 by
 a
 disaster
 are
 not
 very
 nice


to
 live
 in
 anymore.
 So
 the
 prices
 go


down.


Finally,
 we
 also
 have
 transaction
 data


from
 debit
 cards
 um
 of
 the
 Norwegians


and
 we
 could
 also
 compare
 that
 the
 the


consumption
 therefore
 of
 Norwegians
 that


were
 affected
 versus
 those
 were
 not


affected.
 And
 we
 see
 that
 the
 fall
 in


consumption
 is
 um
 also
 notable
 and
 it's


about
 twice
 as
 large
 as
 the
 fall
 in


income.
 So
 100461,460


US
 over
 the
 three
 years
 after
 the


disaster.
 Okay.
 And
 this
 is
 probably
 an


over
 an
 underestimate
 of
 the
 true
 impact


of
 on
 consumption
 because
 at least
 one


part
 of
 this
 consumption
 was
 used
 to


repair
 and
 replace
 the
 assets
 that
 were


that
 that
 were
 damaged
 and
 that
 were


then
 reimbursed
 by
 the
 insurance


company.


So


we
 then
 we
 next
 asked
 why
 do
 we
 find


these
 results?
 Why
 if
 Norwegians
 are


completely
 um
 insured
 against
 the
 direct


effects
 why
 do
 we
 find
 these
 this
 fall


in
 income
 in
 wealth
 and
 so
 on?
 So


because
 we
 have
 such
 detailed
 data
 and


so
 many
 events
 in
 our
 sample,
 we
 can


actually
 compare
 those
 events
 for
 which


firms
 in
 the
 local
 economy
 were


particularly
 hard
 hit
 with
 events
 where


the
 uh
 the
 natural
 disaster
 hit
 mostly


households.
 And
 we
 found
 that
 the


impacts
 on
 income


um
 are
 much
 stronger
 as
 you
 can
 see
 on


the
 left
 hand
 side
 uh
 of
 this
 graph
 for


events
 where
 firms
 were
 particularly


hit.
 So
 this
 seems
 to
 suggest
 that
 the


drop
 in
 income
 that
 we
 observed
 was
 due


to
 firms
 having
 to
 close
 maybe


temporarily
 or
 people
 not
 being
 able
 to


go
 to
 to
 work
 which
 affected
 their
 labor


income.


Then
 we
 explored
 um
 also
 differences


across
 Norwegian
 households
 that
 own
 a


home
 and
 those
 that
 do
 not.
 So
 renters.


So
 on
 the
 left
 hand
 side
 of
 each
 of


these
 graphs
 you
 see
 the
 impact
 on


wealth
 on
 the
 middle
 and
 on
 the
 right
 on


consumption
 for
 homeowners
 and
 on
 the


right
 hand
 side
 you
 see
 that
 impacts
 for


for
 renters.


And
 as
 you
 can
 see
 the
 impact
 on
 wealth


is
 much
 more
 negative
 and
 statistically


significant
 only
 for
 homeowners


as
 well
 as
 then
 the
 same
 is
 true
 for


consumption.
 So
 this
 seems
 to
 suggest


that
 the
 lower
 housing
 prices
 are


amplifying
 these
 impacts
 on
 uh
 on


consumption.


So


this
 leads
 me
 to
 the
 end
 of
 my


presentation.


So
 we
 I
 have
 I
 I
 have
 uh
 shown
 you
 three


main
 takeaways


uh
 from
 from
 our
 research.
 So
 the
 first


one
 is
 that
 already
 today
 extreme


weather
 events
 are
 becoming
 more


frequent
 and
 more
 costly
 even
 in
 Norway.


The
 second
 main
 result
 is
 that
 well


despite
 the
 fact
 that
 Norwegians
 are


fortunate
 enough
 to
 be
 uh
 insured


against
 the
 worst
 impacts
 of
 climate


change
 about
 the
 direct
 impacts
 of
 of


such
 extreme
 weather
 events.
 Affected


households
 are
 seeing
 a
 strong
 and
 also


persistent


uh
 decline
 in
 their
 income,
 their
 wealth


and
 their
 consumption.
 So
 you
 saw
 from


those
 graphs
 how
 these
 declines
 incomes


did
 not
 recover
 even
 after
 3
 years
 after


the
 event.


And
 finally,
 given
 the
 richness
 of
 the


administrative
 data
 that
 we


uh
 can
 access
 in
 Norway,
 we
 also
 could


shed
 some
 light
 on
 the
 mechanisms
 that


drive
 these
 decreases
 in
 the
 income
 and


wealth
 and
 consumption
 of
 the
 affected


households.
 And
 we
 saw
 that
 when
 firms


so
 the
 local
 economy
 is
 particularly
 hit


that
 is
 going
 to
 hit
 the
 individual's


income
 and
 through
 possibly
 through
 uh


housing
 prices
 consumption
 of
 Norwegians


is
 going
 to
 fall.
 So
 thank
 you
 very


much.


[Applause]


Thank
 you
 and
 thank
 you
 very
 much
 for
 uh


and
 thanks
 to
 all
 of
 you
 for
 your


brilliant
 contributions.
 You
 have
 given


us
 a
 lot
 to
 think
 about.
 Uh
 and
 now


there
 will
 be
 a
 break
 that
 will
 allow


you
 all
 not
 just
 to
 get
 a
 few


refreshments
 as
 you
 can
 see
 they've
 been


served
 over
 there
 but
 also
 to
 share
 your


reflections
 uh
 together.
 So
 we
 will


resume
 here
 at
 10:30
 sharp.


[Applause]


[Music]


[Music]


Welcome
 back
 everyone.


I
 have
 the
 pleasure
 of
 guiding
 you


through
 this
 second
 session.
 The
 first


session
 covered
 climate
 change
 itself


and
 the
 macroeconomic
 impacts.
 In
 this


session,
 our
 focus
 shifts
 to
 the
 energy


transition
 needed
 to
 mitigate
 climate


change.
 And
 our
 first
 speaker
 will


elaborate
 on
 the
 macroeconomic
 impacts


of
 climate
 policies.
 It
 is
 my
 pleasure


to
 introduce
 Diego
 Kenzich,
 a
 rising


star
 in
 the
 fields
 of
 climate
 economics.


Kenzich
 is
 an
 assistant
 professor
 at


Northwestern
 University
 and
 a
 leading


researcher
 in
 macroeconomics,
 climate


economics,
 and
 monetary
 policy.
 Please


join
 me
 in
 welcoming
 Diego
 Genses.


[Applause]


With
 all
 the
 things
 that
 are
 going
 on


these
 days,
 it's
 sometimes
 easy
 to


forget
 that
 climate
 change
 is
 still


happening.
 So,
 I
 wanted
 to
 thank
 Noris


Bank
 and
 the
 Sovereign
 Wealth
 Fund
 for


giving
 this
 platform
 to
 talk
 about
 this


important
 topic


and
 thank
 you
 all
 in
 the
 audience
 and


online
 for
 being
 here
 today
 uh
 and


engaging
 with
 us.
 I'm
 very
 excited
 to
 be


here
 to
 talk
 about
 the
 macroeconomic


impacts
 of
 climate
 policies.


Climate
 change
 is
 probably
 the
 defining


problem
 of
 our
 time


leading
 to
 devastating
 risks
 to
 our


lives
 like
 livelihoods
 and
 also
 the


global
 economy.
 And
 in
 the
 first


session,
 Saul
 Amelia
 Dave
 illustrated


the
 potentially
 devastating
 consequences


that
 climate
 change
 may
 bring
 at
 the


global
 and
 at
 the
 local
 level.
 So
 what


can
 we
 do
 to
 confront
 this
 climate


challenge?
 As
 economists,
 we
 know
 how
 to


solve
 the
 problem
 in
 principle,
 right?


We
 have
 to
 put
 a
 price
 on
 carbon.


In
 this
 way,
 we
 make
 emitters


internalize
 the
 costs
 that
 are


associated
 with
 producing
 emissions.


In
 practice,
 it
 has
 proven
 to
 be
 a


little
 bit
 more
 difficult
 because


especially
 at
 the
 global
 level,
 it's


very
 hard
 to
 make
 progress
 because
 it


requires
 coordination
 among
 many


countries
 with
 very
 different
 interests.


Much
 more
 progress
 has
 been
 made
 at
 the


national
 or
 in
 some
 cases
 the
 regional


level
 with
 a
 growing
 number
 of


jurisdictions
 having
 implemented
 carbon


pricing
 policies
 either
 in
 the
 form
 of


carbon
 markets,
 carbon
 taxes
 or


alternative
 policy
 instruments
 and
 this


is
 illustrated
 in
 this
 map.
 So
 here
 you


can
 see
 basically
 a
 map
 of
 the
 globe


with
 the
 countries
 that
 have
 already


implemented
 some
 form
 of
 car
 pricing


instruments
 and
 you
 can
 see
 that
 to
 this


day
 over
 a
 100
 such
 instruments
 have


been
 implemented
 in
 55
 jurisdictions.
 So


this
 is
 great.
 There
 is
 visible
 progress


across
 the
 world.
 A
 key
 question
 is


though
 how
 effective
 are
 these
 national


policies
 at
 reducing
 emissions
 and
 also


thinking
 about
 the
 economic
 consequences


because
 the
 worry
 may
 be
 this
 is
 a


national
 policy
 so
 maybe
 some
 of
 the


emissions
 some
 of
 the
 economic
 activity


may
 shift
 to
 other
 places
 in
 the
 world


that
 have
 still
 less
 stringent
 climate


policies
 in
 place.
 So
 these
 are
 the


questions
 that
 are
 going
 to
 guide
 my


talk
 here
 and
 I'm
 organizing
 them
 along


these
 three
 guiding
 research
 questions.


So
 the
 first
 one
 is
 are
 these
 national


carbon
 pricing
 policies
 effective
 at


reducing
 emissions?
 What
 are
 their


impacts
 on
 the
 macroeconomy?
 How
 do
 they


affect
 output,
 employment,
 and


inflation?
 And
 lastly,
 what
 are
 the


distributional
 consequences
 of
 these


policies?
 because
 that's
 particularly


important
 when
 we
 think
 about
 the


sustainability
 of
 these
 policies
 in
 a


democracy.
 We
 require
 public
 support
 to


achieve
 a
 successful
 transition.


The
 traditional
 approach
 to
 answer
 these


questions
 is
 through
 the
 lens
 of


computable
 general
 equilibrium
 models.


Now
 that
 sounds
 a
 bit
 whimsical,
 but


essentially
 it's
 just
 a
 set
 of


assumptions
 on
 how
 markets
 work,
 on
 how


firms
 and
 consumers
 behave.
 And
 if
 you


calibrate
 this
 economy,
 we
 can
 do


simulations
 to
 be
 able
 to
 answer
 these


questions
 that
 I
 just
 laid
 out.
 So
 what


do
 we
 learn
 from
 this
 more
 theoretical


literature
 about
 these
 questions?


Yes,
 these
 national
 policies,
 they
 can


be
 effective
 at
 reducing
 emissions
 if


leakage
 is
 prevented
 to
 a
 significant


extent.


Turning
 to
 the
 economic
 effects,
 there


are
 some
 macroeconomic
 costs,
 but
 they


tend
 to
 be
 small
 to
 moderate
 at
 best.


And
 finally,
 regarding
 the


distributional
 impacts,
 these
 policies


can
 be
 somewhat
 regressive,
 but
 because


the
 energy
 expenditure
 share
 of


households
 and
 firms
 tends
 to
 be
 rather


low,
 these
 distributional
 effects
 are


not
 that
 large.
 Now,
 this
 is
 what
 the


models
 say.
 With
 over
 20
 years
 worth
 of


experience
 with
 carbon
 pricing
 policies


in
 certain
 jurisdictions,
 we
 can
 also


have
 a
 look
 at
 the
 data
 and
 ask,
 okay,


what
 are
 the
 answers
 that
 the
 data


provides
 to
 these
 questions?
 And
 today


I'm
 going
 to
 provide
 you
 some
 evidence


based
 on
 the
 experience
 with
 the


European
 emissions
 trading
 scheme
 which


is
 uh
 the
 largest
 carbon
 market
 in
 the


world.
 And
 this
 is
 based
 uh
 some
 of
 my


own
 based
 on
 some
 of
 my
 own
 research.


Now
 answering
 the
 question
 of
 how
 carbon


prices
 affect
 emissions
 affect
 the


economy
 that's
 a
 very
 challenging
 task


and
 that's
 because
 carbon
 prices
 are
 not


set
 in
 a
 vacuum.
 Policy
 makers
 they


respond
 to
 economic
 conditions
 when


deciding
 on
 their
 climate
 policies.
 So


if
 there
 is
 if
 there
 is
 a
 recession


maybe
 they
 tune
 down
 their
 climate


policy
 stance
 a
 little
 bit.
 Another


issue
 is
 confounding
 factors.
 Right?
 At


the
 same
 time
 where
 there
 is
 a
 change
 in


carbon
 taxes,
 there
 may
 be
 another


macroeconomic
 shock,
 an
 oil
 price
 shock,


and
 we
 may
 misattribute
 the
 consequences


of
 the
 policy
 of
 the
 shock
 to
 that


policy.
 So,
 it's
 important
 to
 get
 that


right
 empirically.
 In
 a
 carbon
 market,


this
 is
 an
 even
 more
 daunting
 task


because
 there
 we
 have
 market
 prices.


It's
 not
 like
 a
 text
 that
 is
 maybe


revised
 every
 other
 year.
 like
 every
 day


traders
 trade
 these
 allowances
 and


prices
 change
 in
 response
 to
 demand
 and


supply
 factors
 and
 that's
 what
 I


illustrate
 here
 in
 this
 chart.
 So
 here


you
 can
 see
 the
 evolution
 of
 the
 carbon


price
 in
 the
 European
 carbon
 market
 from


2005
 when
 the
 market
 was
 established
 to


2019.
 And
 you
 can
 see
 large
 swings
 in


this
 price.
 Some
 of
 which
 were
 driven
 by


policy
 changes
 other
 were
 driven
 by


demand.
 For
 instance,
 after
 the
 global


financial
 crisis,
 this
 sharp
 fall
 in
 the


price
 was
 largely
 driven
 by
 demand


factors.


Fortunately,
 at
 least
 that's
 what
 I've


come
 to
 realize
 in
 my
 research.
 There
 is


ways
 to
 approach
 this
 identification


challenge
 and
 it
 exploits
 institutional


features
 of
 this
 carbon
 market.
 So
 the


European
 emissions
 trading
 scheme
 is
 a


cap
 and
 trade
 system.
 So
 unlike
 a
 carbon


tax
 which
 directly
 regulates
 the
 price,


it
 regulates
 the
 quantity.
 So
 there
 is
 a


cap
 on
 overall
 emissions
 covered
 by
 the


market
 and
 within
 this
 cap
 allowances


are
 allocated
 and
 then
 traded
 therefore


effectively
 establishing
 a
 market
 price.


At
 the
 same
 time
 there
 are
 financial


markets.
 So
 there
 exist
 pretty
 liquid


futures
 markets
 where
 these
 allowances


are
 traded.
 So
 we
 have
 information
 on


price
 development
 at
 a
 high
 frequency


that
 we
 can
 exploit.
 The
 second
 factor


that
 will
 come
 in
 handy
 is
 that


establishing
 this
 carbon
 market
 this


didn't
 happen
 overnight.
 It
 was
 more
 of


a
 learning
 by
 doing
 process
 and
 the


regulations
 in
 this
 market
 have
 changed


considerably
 over
 time.
 This
 is
 exactly


what's
 going
 to
 help
 me
 to
 address
 this


identification
 problem.
 In
 particular,


the
 idea
 is
 to
 isolate
 some
 variation
 in


the
 current
 price
 that
 is
 plausibly


exogenous
 by
 looking
 at
 price
 changes
 in


a
 narrow
 window
 around
 policy
 events


concerning
 the
 supply
 or
 allocation
 of


emission
 allowances.
 And
 the
 idea
 is
 to


the
 extent
 that
 the
 economic
 outlook
 is


already
 priced
 in
 this
 market
 before
 the


announcement,
 the
 change
 in
 the
 current


price
 will
 basically
 reflect
 the
 policy


news.


So
 for
 those
 not
 that
 familiar
 with
 this


markets,
 let
 me
 take
 a
 step
 back
 and
 let


me
 tell
 you
 a
 bit
 more
 about
 this
 market


work.
 So
 this
 European
 carbon
 market,
 it


was
 established
 in
 2005.
 It
 covers


around
 40%
 of
 total
 EU
 greenhouse
 gas


emissions.
 Again,
 it's
 a
 tra
 cap
 and


trade
 system.
 So
 there
 is
 a
 cap
 on
 total


emissions
 that
 are
 covered
 by
 the


system.
 And
 to
 ensure
 that
 emissions


fall
 over
 time,
 this
 cap
 is
 reduced
 at
 a


certain
 rate
 every
 year.
 Within
 this


cap,
 emission
 allowances
 are
 allocated.


And
 there
 are
 different
 ways
 of
 doing


so.
 In
 particular,
 during
 the
 first


years
 of
 this
 market,
 most
 of
 the


allowances
 they
 were
 allocated
 for
 free.


I
 guess
 this
 was
 just
 a
 politically


feasible
 way
 to
 get
 this
 market
 going.


Later
 on,
 auctioning
 became
 the
 default


way
 of
 allocating
 these
 allowances.
 So


firms
 has
 to
 purchase
 these
 allowances


at
 an
 increasing
 rate
 in
 auctions.
 And


finally
 there
 is
 also
 the
 option
 of


international
 credits.
 So
 these
 are


similar
 to
 offset
 that
 firms
 can
 use
 to


a
 limited
 extent
 uh
 to
 cover
 for
 their


emissions.
 And
 the
 idea
 is
 that
 maybe


cheaper
 in
 other
 places
 to
 abate
 than
 in


Europe
 and
 we
 want
 to
 make
 use
 of
 that


companies
 at
 the
 end
 of
 every
 year
 that


are
 covered
 by
 this
 market
 must


surrender
 sufficient
 emission
 allowances


to
 cover
 their
 yearly
 emissions.
 And


this
 is
 enforced
 with
 heavy
 fines.
 So


compliance
 is
 almost
 perfect
 in
 this


market.
 And
 again
 as
 I
 mentioned
 these


allowances
 are
 traded
 on
 secondary


markets
 in
 particular
 spot
 and
 futures


markets
 which
 we're
 going
 to
 focus
 on


today.


So
 in
 the
 next
 step
 I
 went
 to
 the
 books.


I
 looked


at
 the
 official
 journal
 of
 the
 European


Union
 and
 European
 Commission's
 climate


news
 archive
 and
 I
 collected
 a


comprehensive
 list
 of
 regulatory
 update


events
 in
 this
 market.
 So
 these
 can
 take


the
 form
 of
 decisions
 of
 the
 European


Commission,
 votes
 of
 the
 European


Parliament
 or
 judgments
 by
 European


courts.
 And
 of
 key
 interests
 in
 this


research
 are
 regulatory
 news
 concerning


the
 supply
 or
 allocation
 of
 emission


allowances.
 And
 again,
 some
 of
 these
 may


be
 related
 to
 the
 free
 allocation
 of


allowances.
 So
 in
 the
 first
 years


countries
 uh
 that
 are
 part
 of
 this


market
 had
 to
 submit
 national
 allocation


plans
 and
 sometimes
 the
 commission
 was


not
 happy
 with
 them
 and
 and
 sometimes


there
 were
 legal
 conflicts.
 So
 there
 are


a
 lot
 of
 events
 concerning
 these


national
 allocation
 plans.
 Later
 on
 when


auctioning
 became
 the
 default
 way
 of


allocating
 these
 allowances
 there
 are


lots
 of
 events
 regarding
 the
 timing
 and


quantities
 of
 allowances
 to
 be
 auctioned


off
 and
 there
 are
 also
 some
 events


regarding
 the
 use
 of
 international


credits.
 So
 in
 the
 end
 going
 through
 um


these
 documents
 online
 I
 was
 able
 to


identify
 around
 100
 over
 like
 114


relevant
 events
 from
 2005
 to
 2019
 and


based
 on
 these
 events
 I
 then
 looked
 how


prices
 changed
 around
 them
 and
 this
 is


basically
 what
 comes
 out.
 So
 here
 you


can
 see
 these
 these
 policy
 surprises


around
 these
 regulatory
 policy
 events


and
 you
 can
 see
 some
 of
 these
 events
 led


to
 quite
 significant
 changes
 in
 carbon


prices.
 So
 this
 is
 expressed
 relative
 to


wholesale
 electricity
 prices.
 So


assuming
 a
 full
 pass
 through
 which
 some


of
 the
 literature
 has
 found
 to
 be
 pretty


accurate.
 We
 see
 that
 some
 of
 these


events
 moved
 wholesale
 electricity


prices
 in
 excess
 of
 1%.
 And
 let
 me
 just


to
 like
 make
 this
 a
 bit
 more
 tangible


give
 you
 maybe
 an
 example
 of
 of
 a
 series


of
 events
 that
 was
 pretty
 important
 in


this
 market
 and
 it
 was
 related
 to
 this


fact
 that
 after
 the
 global
 financial


crisis
 emissions
 fell
 by
 a
 lot
 because


the
 economy
 was
 not
 doing
 well.
 But
 this


was
 not
 reflected
 in
 the
 way
 the
 caps


were
 set
 right
 the
 caps
 were
 kept
 sort


of
 pretty
 constant
 and
 therefore
 over


time
 an
 overupp
 of
 allowances
 emerged


weighing
 down
 on
 prices
 but
 the


commission
 didn't
 like
 that
 so
 they


wanted
 to
 address
 this
 by
 postponing
 by


backloading
 the
 auctioning
 of
 new


allowances
 so
 this
 happened
 the
 end
 of


2012
 and
 then
 in
 April
 2013
 the
 European


Parliament
 voted
 against
 this
 proposal


and
 this
 sent
 prices
 down
 significantly


and
 the
 concerns
 were
 very
 similar
 to


also
 what
 we
 observe
 today
 in
 the
 public


debate.
 They
 were
 worried,
 politicians


were
 worried
 that
 higher
 carbon
 prices


may
 hurt
 the
 still
 fragile
 European


economy
 that
 was
 still
 recovering
 from


the
 crisis.
 Only
 later
 on
 they
 agreed
 to


a
 modified
 version
 of
 this
 backloading


proposal
 paving
 the
 way
 for
 higher


carbon
 pricing
 in
 Europe
 as
 we
 also


observe
 them
 today.
 So
 in
 the
 second


step
 we
 then
 use
 this
 variation
 as
 an


instrument
 to
 estimate
 the
 effects
 of
 a


carbon
 policy
 induced
 energy
 price
 shock


and
 these
 are
 the
 estimated
 effects.
 So


here
 you
 can
 see
 the
 dynamic
 effects
 of


a
 shock
 that
 increases
 consumer
 energy


prices
 by
 1%
 on
 impact.
 So
 you
 can
 see


this
 is
 a
 pretty
 significant
 and


persistent
 effect
 on
 energy
 prices
 and


it
 also
 leads
 to
 a
 substantial
 fall
 in


greenhouse
 gas
 emissions.
 So
 these
 are


total
 greenhouse
 gas
 emissions
 in


Europe,
 not
 only
 those
 covered
 by
 the


market
 where
 you
 would
 expect


mechanically
 some
 decrease.
 So
 this
 is


great
 news,
 right?
 So
 the
 policy
 appears


to
 work,


emissions
 fall
 because
 the
 price
 of


emitting
 actually
 increases.
 But
 there


are
 also
 macroeconomic
 consequences
 and


this
 is
 what
 you
 can
 see
 in
 the
 second


line.
 So
 you
 can
 see
 consumer
 prices


overall
 consumer
 prices
 also
 increase
 to


some
 extent
 around
 0.2%


uh
 and
 real
 GDP
 falls
 by
 around
 0.25%.


So
 these
 are
 non-negligible


macroeconomic
 costs
 and
 based
 on
 these


responses
 we
 can
 estimate
 one
 of
 the
 key


parameters
 uh
 in
 um
 that
 that
 goes
 into


cost
 benefit
 analysis
 of
 climate


policies
 and
 that's
 the
 so-called


marginal
 abatement
 cost.
 So
 that
 that


captures
 how
 expensive
 it
 is
 to
 abate


one
 additional
 ton
 of
 emissions
 and


based
 on
 these
 responses
 we
 arrive
 at
 an


estimate
 for
 the
 marginal
 abatement
 cost


of
 around
 €17
 per
 ton
 of
 CO2.
 Obviously,


there
 is
 uncertainty
 around
 that.
 It's


an
 estimate.
 But
 what's
 interesting
 here


is
 that
 this
 is
 much
 higher
 than


engineering
 estimates
 of
 this
 marginal


baitment
 cost.
 And
 it's
 also
 much
 higher


than
 the
 average
 ETS
 price
 in
 this


carbon
 market
 that
 firms
 internalize


which
 was
 around
 12
 over
 our
 sample.


What
 does
 this
 show?
 This
 shows
 that


market
 prices
 in
 this
 market
 do
 not


necessarily
 internalize
 indirect
 effects


that
 occur
 via
 energy
 prices,
 via


employment
 and
 ultimately
 consumption.


And
 these
 indirect
 these
 general


equilibrium
 effects
 are
 important
 uh
 to


basically
 get
 at
 the
 aggregate
 the


economywide
 costs
 of
 decarbonization


which
 may
 be
 higher
 than
 the
 costs
 that


firm
 internalize.
 And
 again
 that's
 an


important
 insight
 if
 we
 think
 about


costbenefit
 analysis
 of
 climate
 change


mitigation
 policies.


Okay.
 So
 we
 talked
 about
 the
 impacts
 of


carbon
 prices
 on
 the
 economy
 on


emissions.
 Now
 let's
 talk
 about
 the


distributional
 impacts
 because
 I
 think


that's
 also
 a
 very
 very
 crucial
 aspect.


So
 how
 do
 we
 do
 this?
 We
 study
 how


carbon
 price
 shocks
 affect
 different


households.
 And
 we're
 going
 to
 measure


the
 effects
 on
 living
 standards
 by


tracking
 how
 these
 shocks
 move
 key
 parts


of
 households
 budget.
 In
 particular,


we're
 going
 to
 look
 at
 how
 prices
 that


households
 pay
 change
 after
 these


shocks,
 how
 the
 income
 changes
 that
 they


earn,
 and
 how
 the
 value
 of
 their
 saving


and
 transfers
 they
 receive
 changes.
 And


we
 will
 combine
 this
 channel
 to
 get
 a


simple
 moneymetric
 measure
 of
 welfare


loss.
 So
 this
 is
 sort
 of
 the
 amount
 of


euros
 that
 households
 would
 be
 willing


to
 pay
 to
 not
 experience
 the
 increase
 in


carbon
 prices.


And
 this
 is
 what
 we
 find.
 So
 here
 we
 can


see
 two
 charts
 that
 basically
 show
 you


this
 welfare
 loss
 by
 income
 and
 age


groups
 and
 by
 regions
 and
 age
 groups.


And
 what
 stands
 out
 here,
 I
 mean
 this
 is


expressed
 not
 in
 euros
 but
 as
 a
 share
 of


households
 consumption.
 And
 what's
 what


stands
 out
 here
 is
 that
 it's
 younger


households,
 it's
 poorer
 households
 that


experience
 the
 largest
 welfare
 losses


while
 older
 households
 in
 particular
 and


also
 richer
 households
 to
 some
 extent


appear
 to
 be
 more
 shielded
 from
 these


policies.
 And
 why
 is
 that
 the
 case?


Before
 I
 told
 you
 these
 distributional


effects
 through
 the
 lens
 of
 our
 models,


they're
 sort
 of
 moderate.
 Why
 do
 we
 find


here
 such
 big
 effects?
 Because
 we
 here


we
 also
 take
 into
 account
 the
 indirect


effects
 via
 income
 and
 employment


because
 these
 policies,
 they
 not
 only


make
 uh
 the
 goods
 that
 you
 consume
 more


expensive.
 They
 also
 have
 effects
 on


labor
 markets.
 So
 your
 wages
 may
 fall
 uh


or
 you
 may
 lose
 your
 job.
 And
 these


risks
 are
 concentrated
 among
 lower


income
 households.


We
 can
 also
 look
 at
 the
 regional


heterogeneity.
 So
 here
 you
 can
 see
 the


welfare
 effects
 by
 regions
 and
 we
 see


they're
 particularly
 concentrated
 in


southern
 European
 countries
 and
 then


Eastern
 European
 countries
 but


especially
 in
 the
 south
 these
 effects


are
 pretty
 substantial.
 And
 that
 may


also
 be
 related
 to
 labor
 market


regulations
 because
 if
 you
 have
 like


more
 rigid
 labor
 markets,
 these
 indirect


effects
 via
 income
 may
 be
 even
 more


pronounced.


Okay.
 Now,
 let
 me
 take
 a
 bit
 more
 of
 a


long-term
 perspective
 because
 we
 we
 have


seen
 that
 these
 these
 current
 pricing


policies
 they're
 associated
 with


shortrun
 costs
 but
 they
 also
 have
 long


run
 gains.
 I
 mean
 one
 we
 already


discussed
 they
 reduce
 emissions
 which
 is


great
 which
 because
 this
 will
 help
 us
 to


avoid
 future
 climate
 damages
 that
 we


have
 discussed
 in
 the
 first
 session.
 Uh


but
 another
 key
 motivation
 to
 uh


introduce
 these
 policies
 is
 green


innovation
 because
 that's
 what's
 going


to
 allow
 us
 to
 sustain
 these
 emission


reductions
 without
 curbing
 economic


growth.
 Right?
 And
 it's
 intuitive
 to


think
 if
 you
 if
 you
 increase
 the
 cost
 of


emitting
 maybe
 this
 will
 encourage
 green


innovation.


But
 does
 this
 actually
 hold
 up
 in
 the


data
 as
 well?
 Obviously
 it's
 hard
 to


measure
 innovation.
 There
 is
 no
 perfect


measure
 of
 innovation.
 One
 metric
 that


many
 people
 are
 interested
 in
 is


patenting.
 And
 patents
 are
 nice
 because


we
 can
 classify
 them
 into
 patents
 that


are
 green.
 So
 sort
 of
 climate
 change


mitigation
 or
 adaptation
 patterns
 or
 or


non-green
 other
 types
 of
 patents.
 And


here
 you
 can
 see
 the
 response
 um
 of


patenting
 activity


in
 green
 technologies
 to
 such
 a
 carbon


price
 shock.
 And
 we
 can
 see
 that
 the


overall
 share
 of
 green
 patenting


increases
 increases
 significantly
 and
 in


increases
 in
 particular
 in
 industries


such
 as
 energy,
 transportation
 and


buildings.
 So
 this
 is
 great.
 This
 really


shows
 that
 this
 policy
 helps
 maybe
 to
 uh


to
 foster
 this
 technical
 change
 that
 we


need
 to
 to
 make
 this
 transition
 work.


But
 it
 may
 be
 not
 enough
 because
 here
 I


show
 you
 energy
 and
 transportation
 and


buildings.
 In
 other
 categories
 in


particular
 related
 to
 adaptation,
 you


say
 you
 see
 much
 less
 of
 a
 response.
 So


I
 think
 this
 shows
 that
 maybe
 carbon


pricing
 alone
 is
 not
 enough.
 We
 have
 to


complement
 these
 policies
 maybe
 with


innovation
 subsidies
 targeted
 to
 these


specific
 technologies
 that
 are
 hard
 uh


to
 make
 progress
 just
 uh
 via
 the


emissions
 trading
 emissions
 trading


scheme.
 Another
 long-term
 challenge
 and


we
 touched
 upon
 this
 before
 is
 that
 to


be
 able
 to
 make
 this
 transition
 a


success
 we
 need
 public
 support.
 I
 mean


we
 live
 in
 a
 democracy
 so
 uh
 the
 voters


also
 have
 to
 be
 in
 on
 board
 and
 we
 have


seen
 that
 this
 is
 a
 challenge
 time
 and


time
 again.
 For
 instance
 the
 yellow
 west


movement
 in
 France
 which
 started
 as
 an


opposition
 against
 higher
 fuel
 taxes
 in


the
 US
 the
 efforts
 to
 legislate
 cap
 and


trade
 policies
 which
 in
 the
 end


ultimately
 failed
 or
 in
 Canada
 more


recently
 right
 where
 Mark
 Carney


essentially
 abolished
 the
 national


carbon
 tax
 for
 political
 reasons.
 Uh
 so


this
 is
 definitely
 a
 concern
 that
 we


have
 to
 take
 seriously
 and
 this
 is
 also


backed
 up
 by
 the
 data
 because
 here
 I


show
 you
 some
 evidence
 that
 in
 response


to
 these
 current
 pricing
 shocks
 there
 is


an
 increase
 in
 extremist
 vote
 share.
 So


this
 is
 based
 on
 on
 regional
 electoral


data
 in
 Europe.
 So
 an
 increase
 in


extremist
 vshare
 and
 in
 euroskeptic
 vote


share.
 So
 I
 think
 these
 are
 concerns


that
 we
 have
 to
 take
 seriously
 if
 we


want
 to
 make
 this
 transition
 work.
 All


right.
 So
 now
 let's
 revisit
 these


research
 questions
 that
 we
 started
 with.


So
 based
 on
 our
 experience
 with
 like
 20


plus
 years
 of
 EUS


we
 have
 learned
 the
 following.
 So
 our


national
 carbon
 pricing
 policies


effective
 at
 reducing
 emissions.
 Yes
 we


have
 seen
 that
 these
 current
 prices
 led


to
 a
 substantial
 reduction
 in
 emissions.


But
 when
 we
 look
 at
 the
 macroeconomic


effects,
 we
 also
 saw
 that
 these
 come


with
 uh
 non-negligible
 macroeconomic


costs
 and
 these
 costs
 turn
 out
 to
 be


unequally
 distributed
 across
 society


with
 poorer
 households
 with
 younger


households
 uh
 shouldering
 a
 larger
 a


much
 larger
 share
 of
 the
 burden.


So
 let
 me
 end
 with
 some
 policy


implications.
 Um
 so
 I
 think
 this
 really


shows
 that
 it's
 important
 to
 address
 the


economic
 and
 distributional
 effects
 of


these
 carbon
 pricing
 policies
 and
 we
 can


do
 so.
 So
 in
 fact
 I
 I
 have
 some
 work


obviously
 for
 that
 maybe
 it's
 it's
 hard


to
 just
 do
 this
 with
 the
 data
 then
 you


need
 a
 model
 to
 do
 sort
 of
 these
 policy


counterfactuals
 but
 I
 have
 some
 work


that
 shows
 if
 you
 use
 targeted
 transfers


so
 you
 target
 the
 households
 that
 are


more
 affected
 by
 most
 affected
 by
 the


policy
 you
 can
 mitigate
 both
 the


aggregate
 effects
 of
 the
 policy
 and
 the


economy
 and
 also
 the
 distributional


impacts.
 If
 you
 do
 this
 though,
 you
 may


be
 worried
 that
 by
 by
 doing
 so,


emissions
 may
 increase
 again,
 right?


Because
 you
 sort
 of
 compensate
 these


households
 that
 that
 may
 be
 driving
 some


of
 these
 emission
 reductions
 and
 then


they
 still
 emits
 more.
 But
 at least
 in


that
 model,
 that's
 not
 necessarily
 the


case
 because
 if
 you
 do
 this
 in
 a


targeted
 way,
 you
 compensate
 households


whose
 energy
 demand
 is
 particularly


inelastic.
 I
 mean
 that's
 what
 you
 find


that
 poor
 households,
 younger


households,
 they
 I
 mean
 you
 have
 you


sort
 of
 have
 to
 heat
 your
 home,
 you
 have


to
 go
 to
 work
 and
 uh
 it's
 hard
 to
 change


these
 types
 of
 behaviors.
 So


redistribution
 does
 not
 need
 to


undermine
 the
 emission
 reductions
 that


you
 achieve
 with
 these
 type
 of
 policies.


It's
 just
 important
 to
 design
 them
 in
 a


clever
 way.
 Now
 obviously
 in
 practice


it's
 very
 hard
 to
 legislate
 targeted


transfers,
 right?
 Because
 it
 also
 has


distributional
 implications.
 So
 you


always
 have
 to
 communicate
 this
 in
 a
 way


that
 is
 palatable
 to
 the
 voter.
 Maybe


it's
 not
 possible.
 Maybe
 you
 can
 do
 a


second
 best.
 Um
 but
 I
 do
 think
 this


evidence
 just
 shows
 that
 you
 want
 to
 do


some
 redistribution
 here.
 Currently
 in


the
 EUS,
 there
 are
 no
 direct


redistributive
 measures
 that
 compensate


households
 most
 affected.
 And
 that's


because
 these
 policies,
 they're
 paid
 for


by
 the
 firms.
 But
 firms
 don't
 just


swallow
 these
 costs.
 they
 increase
 their


product
 prices
 which
 eventually
 um
 leads


to
 the
 fact
 that
 households
 end
 up


shouldering
 most
 of
 these
 costs.
 So
 I
 do


think
 it's
 important
 to
 think
 about
 that


and
 incorporate
 these
 indirect
 impacts


when
 evaluating
 these
 policies.
 Let
 me


also
 say
 here
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 trash
 the


EUS.
 I
 think
 uh
 it's
 it's
 it's
 been
 a


great
 success
 in
 reducing
 emissions
 and


like
 thinking
 about
 it
 even
 without


these
 offsetting
 measures
 that
 could


make
 it
 even
 a
 better
 policy.
 It
 is


still
 optimal
 for
 Europe
 to
 decarbonize


at least
 according
 to
 recent
 estimates


of
 the
 other
 side
 of
 this
 costbenefit


analysis
 of
 climate
 policy.
 That
 is
 the


social
 or
 maybe
 more
 relevant
 the


domestic
 cost
 of
 carbon.
 So
 we
 have


talked
 about
 the
 social
 cost
 of
 carbon.


That's
 that's
 sort
 of
 the
 metric
 that


policy
 makers
 are
 interested
 in
 because


it
 it
 captures
 sort
 of
 the
 current
 and


future
 discounted
 damages
 of
 emitting


one
 additional
 ton
 of
 CO2.
 But
 policy


makers
 in
 a
 given
 country,
 they
 may
 not


be
 worried
 about
 the
 worldwide
 costs
 of


climate
 change
 necessarily.
 I
 mean
 some


of
 them
 may
 be
 across
 of
 the
 Atlantic.


They're
 almost
 surely
 not.
 uh
 they're


concerned
 uh
 with
 the
 domestic
 cost
 of


carbon
 right
 these
 are
 the
 damages
 that


are
 occurring
 in
 your
 own
 jurisdiction


in
 your
 own
 country
 but
 according
 to


recent
 estimates
 so
 this
 is
 based
 on


some
 of
 my
 own
 work
 with
 Adrien
 Bilal
 at


Stanford
 we
 find
 that
 even
 the
 domestic


cost
 of
 carbon
 when
 you
 try
 to
 estimate


these
 effects
 more
 comprehensively


accounting
 for
 extremes
 like
 very
 much


building
 on
 the
 excellent
 work
 that
 Saul


uh
 and
 co-authors
 have
 done
 we
 find
 a


domestic
 cost
 of
 carbon
 of
 around
 €200


euros
 per
 ton
 of
 CO2
 too.
 Now
 remember


what
 I
 told
 you
 about
 this
 marginal


abatement
 costs.
 According
 to
 my


estimates,
 this
 was
 around
 €100.
 So
 this


domestic
 cost
 of
 carbon
 is
 significantly


larger
 than
 that.
 So
 this
 implies
 it's


still
 optimal
 to
 decarbonize.
 What
 I'm


trying
 to
 convey
 here,
 there
 is
 ways
 to


improve
 the
 policy
 further
 and
 maybe


this
 trade-off
 could
 look
 even
 uh
 much


clearer.
 The
 last
 part
 that
 I
 want
 to


touch
 upon
 is
 about
 this
 issue
 of
 losing


public
 support
 and
 that's
 really
 an


issue
 that
 I
 think
 is
 important.
 The


political
 economy
 of
 this
 problem
 is


something
 that
 we
 as
 economists
 have
 to


think
 harder
 about.
 And
 in
 that
 light,
 I


think
 it's
 really
 important
 to
 also


focus
 on
 how
 we
 communicate
 these


policies.
 We
 always
 say,
 okay,
 it's
 a


carbon
 tax.
 It's
 a
 cost
 to
 the


households.
 But
 maybe
 we
 should


communicate
 the
 benefits
 of
 the
 policy


more
 because
 a
 tax
 creates
 revenues.


Revenues
 could
 create
 money
 for
 society


as
 a
 whole,
 right?
 And
 I
 think
 that
 was


an
 issue
 with
 with
 some
 of
 these


policies.
 Uh
 and
 some
 examples
 of
 how
 to


do
 this.
 Well,
 in
 Switzerland,
 where
 I'm


from,
 people
 are
 really
 really
 concerned


about
 uh
 health
 care
 costs.
 They
 have


been
 increasing
 a
 lot
 over
 the
 last


decades.
 And
 so
 one
 thing
 that


Switzerland
 did
 is
 to
 introduce
 a
 rebate


on
 these
 health
 insurance
 premiums.
 And


the
 rebate
 is
 specifically
 from
 the


carbon
 tax.
 So
 each
 time
 you
 see
 sort
 of


your
 medical
 bill,
 your
 insurance,


medical
 insurance
 bill,
 you
 see,
 okay,


that
 would
 be
 my
 premium.
 This
 is
 what


the
 carbon
 tax
 like
 reduces
 it
 and
 and


you
 see
 that
 sort
 of
 directly
 every


month.
 I
 think
 that's
 nice.
 It
 could
 be


even
 better,
 right?
 Maybe
 we
 could
 also


learn
 a
 bit
 from


policy
 makers
 uh
 in
 the
 US,
 right?
 I


think
 they're
 they're
 the
 experts
 on


this.
 So
 if
 you
 think
 about
 it,
 you


could
 send
 out
 checks
 to
 households
 and


say
 this
 is
 your
 carbon
 rebate.
 This
 is


what
 the
 EUTS
 provided
 for
 you.
 And
 I


think
 this
 will
 go
 a
 long
 way
 of


overcoming
 these
 issues
 uh
 with
 uh


public
 support
 for
 these
 policies.
 And


with
 that,
 thank
 you
 very
 much.


Thank
 you
 so
 much.
 That
 was
 truly


remarkable.


Now
 we
 are
 very
 pleased
 to
 welcome
 home


one
 of
 Norway's
 most
 distinguished


economists,
 Professor
 Bour
 Hashtra,
 who


holds
 prominent
 positions
 at
 Stanford.


He
 is
 one
 of
 the
 world's
 leading


scholars
 in
 environmental
 economics


through
 his
 influential
 work
 on
 climate


coordination
 and
 international


bargaining
 mechanisms.


His


research
 provides
 essential
 insights


into
 the
 political
 economy
 challenges


that
 lie
 at
 heart
 of
 effective
 climate


action.
 Today
 he
 will
 talk
 about
 climate


policy
 and
 the
 challenges
 it
 can
 create


for
 energy
 markets.
 Bard
 Hashtra,
 the


floor
 is
 yours.


Thank
 you
 so
 much
 Governor
 Sior.


Um
 it's
 a
 great
 to
 be
 here.
 So
 I
 want
 to


start
 out
 with
 a
 traditional
 way
 of


thinking
 about
 um
 climate
 policies.
 Uh


namely
 that
 we
 typically
 we
 think
 about


it
 as
 a
 free
 rider
 problem
 or
 economists


would
 call
 it
 a
 prisoner
 dilemma
 game.


Meaning
 that
 uh
 if
 you
 have
 a
 home


country,
 you
 can
 have
 the
 choice
 between


continuing
 emitting
 with
 as
 you
 call


business
 as
 usual
 or
 we
 could
 go
 further


and
 cutting
 emissions.
 And
 outside
 there


are
 foreign
 countries
 who
 can
 do
 the


same.


If
 we
 are
 both
 all
 all
 of
 us
 continuing


with
 business
 as
 usual,
 we
 are


relatively
 unhappy
 because
 GDP
 might


decline
 as
 we
 have
 learned.
 But
 not
 only


because
 of
 that
 or
 because
 uh
 even
 if


the
 Amazon
 forest
 burns
 down
 and
 the


Arctic
 ice
 melts,
 GDP
 will
 increase
 but


we
 would
 still
 be
 unhappy.
 So
 GDP
 would


capture
 only
 a
 fraction
 of
 the


unhappiness.


But
 we
 are
 here
 because
 it's
 even
 worse


to
 cut
 emissions
 if
 the
 foreigners


are
 continuing
 with
 business
 as
 usual.


Then
 we
 are
 paying
 a
 cost
 and
 we
 not


getting
 really
 the
 benefit.


We
 would
 be
 better
 off
 if
 you
 all


cooperated
 to
 cut
 emissions.


But


you
 know
 man,
 if
 the
 foreigners
 cut


emissions
 and
 we
 could
 continue
 as


business
 as
 usual,
 that
 would
 rock.


So
 therefore,
 no
 matter
 whether


foreigners
 are
 cutting
 emissions
 or


deciding
 to
 do
 business
 as
 usual,
 our


best
 response
 at
 home
 would
 be
 to


continue
 with
 business
 as
 usual.
 That
 is


why
 this
 is
 a
 unique
 equilibrium
 of
 this


game.


Unless
 you
 think
 about
 ways
 to
 change


the
 game
 to
 make
 it
 possible
 that
 we


have
 an
 agreement
 among
 countries
 where


emissions
 are
 cut.
 And
 I
 can
 trust
 you


that
 have
 thought
 a
 lot
 about
 how
 we
 can


sustain
 equilibria
 here.


And
 in
 a
 couple
 of
 uh
 papers
 I
 have
 with


Francisco
 Lansia
 and
 Allesio,


we
 conclude
 that
 um
 to
 sustain
 an


equilibrium
 where
 low
 emissions,
 it


might
 be
 necessary
 that
 countries
 are


investing
 a
 lot
 maybe
 overinvesting
 in


green
 technologies,
 renewable
 energy
 so


on
 to
 reduce
 the
 temptation
 to
 defect


and
 got
 back
 to
 business
 as
 usual.
 So


that
 temptation
 can
 be
 reduced
 if


countries
 are
 investing
 more
 in


environmentally
 friendly
 technologies


which
 reduces
 the
 benefit
 of
 continuing


to
 rely
 on
 fossil
 fuels.


But
 the
 role
 of
 technology
 also
 implies


that
 the
 prison
 dilemma
 game
 or
 this


free
 rider
 problem
 problem
 game
 is
 not


all.
 Another
 perspective
 is
 that
 we


should
 think
 about
 it
 as
 a
 is
 a
 as
 a


coordination
 game
 where
 we
 will
 have


investments
 in
 green
 capital,


renewably
 energy,
 abatement
 technologies


if
 those
 investors
 anticipate
 that
 there


will
 be
 a
 very
 ambitious
 environmental


policy
 in
 the
 future
 making
 those


investments
 profitable
 and
 more


profitable
 than
 investing
 in
 alternative


traditional
 sectors.


So
 that
 is
 then
 an
 equilibrium
 and
 if


the
 investors
 are
 doing
 that
 it
 will


also
 be
 easier
 for
 policy
 makers
 to


introduce
 ambitious
 polic
 environmental


policies
 because
 they
 have
 support
 from


the
 investors
 uh
 um
 and
 it
 will
 be


possible
 and
 manageable
 for
 industry
 to


deal
 with
 ambitious
 policies.
 So
 that
 is


a
 selfinforcing
 equilibrium.


The
 problem
 is
 that
 we
 start
 here
 with
 a


relatively


much
 capital
 that
 is
 sunk
 in
 traditional


sectors
 which
 are
 relatively


much
 bullying
 on
 fossil
 fuel
 energy
 and


because
 of
 that
 it's
 difficult
 for


policy
 makers
 to
 introduce
 environmental


policies
 and
 ambitious
 policies.


uh
 um
 and
 because
 of
 that
 policies


investments
 are
 uh
 relatively


traditional.


So


um
 so
 we
 might
 then
 be
 in
 what
 we
 call
 a


green
 uh
 catch
 22
 that
 the
 world
 has
 not


been
 able
 and
 that
 is
 part
 of
 the
 reason


why
 the
 world
 has
 not
 been
 able
 to


address
 climate
 change
 is
 because
 we
 are


stuck
 in
 this
 brown
 trap
 where
 the
 firms


will
 not
 invest
 in
 green
 uh
 or
 disinvest


in
 polluting
 sectors
 unless
 there
 is


political
 support
 for
 ambitious
 climate


change
 policies
 making
 the
 switch


profitable
 and
 but
 as
 long
 as
 the


capital
 is
 sunk
 in
 polluting
 industries


and
 voters
 are
 employed
 by
 these


industries
 there
 is
 no
 political
 support


for
 necessary
 reform.


So
 the
 many
 example
 of
 this
 type
 of
 uh


brown
 traps.
 Okay,
 there
 are
 many


examples.
 One
 of
 them
 and
 what
 I
 will


talk
 about
 a
 little
 bit
 now
 is
 the


possibility
 of
 a
 fossil
 fuel
 trap
 which


can
 can
 arise
 because
 renewables
 and


fossil
 fuels
 are
 to
 some
 extent


substitutes


in
 the
 following
 sense.
 Investments
 in


renewables
 will
 pay
 off


if
 and
 only
 if
 the
 production
 of
 energy


from
 fossil
 fuel
 is
 reduced
 because
 only


then
 will
 they
 be
 willingness
 to
 pay
 for


alternative
 technologies
 and
 alternative


energy
 be
 sufficiently
 high.
 The
 problem


is
 that
 fossil
 fuel
 production
 will


continue
 as
 long
 as
 investments
 in


renewables
 have
 not
 taken
 place.


So
 another
 catch
 22


and
 in
 and
 we
 have
 seen
 this
 um
 also


empirically
 in
 a
 recent
 paper
 by
 two


novel
 rates
 and
 two
 other
 quarters
 they


find
 that
 they
 stud
 the
 gas
 boom
 in
 the


US.
 So
 when
 the
 shale
 gas
 boom
 in
 the
 US


started
 that
 coincided
 with
 an


investment
 fall
 in
 green
 uh
 innovation.


So
 patenting
 in
 greenation
 fell
 uh
 and


probably
 partly
 because
 they
 those


investors
 anticipated
 that
 with
 the


shale
 gas
 boom
 it
 will
 be
 difficult
 to


profit


but
 the
 this
 paper
 also
 show


that
 not
 only
 did
 renewables
 fall
 but


also
 coal
 fell.


Coal
 fell
 too.
 So,
 so
 more
 gas
 replaced


coal


and
 that
 leads
 to
 uh
 a
 possible
 dilemma


because
 more
 natural
 gas
 can
 replace


coal
 and
 coal
 has
 a
 larger
 maybe


approximately
 twice
 the
 carbon
 content


of
 natural
 gas.


And
 this
 effect
 seems
 to
 be
 most


important
 in
 the
 short
 term
 because
 in


the
 short
 term
 it's
 difficult
 to
 change


the
 amount
 and
 the
 capacity
 to
 produce


renewable
 energy.
 the
 capacity
 to


produce
 a
 re
 renewable
 energy
 that
 takes


time
 to
 develop
 because
 it's
 an
 up


andcoming
 industry.
 So
 in
 the
 short
 term


more
 gas
 will
 replace
 coal
 but
 when
 gas


when
 more
 gas
 is
 anticipated


when
 investors
 today
 think
 that
 in
 20
 30


years
 from
 now
 there
 will
 be
 more


natural
 gas
 then
 investments
 in
 re


renewables
 can
 fall
 and
 so
 in
 the
 long


term
 gas
 can
 replace
 renewables
 instead


of
 coal.


So
 this
 is
 something
 this
 possibility
 is


something
 we
 study
 in
 a
 paper
 called
 the


gas
 trap


joint
 with
 Katinka
 Holzmark
 and


forthcoming
 in
 one
 of
 the
 top
 journals


in
 economics
 and
 here's
 what
 we
 find


okay
 so
 you
 fix
 everything
 in
 the
 world


like
 fix
 war
 peace
 conflict
 anything


okay
 you
 hold
 that
 constant
 for
 a
 little


bit
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 change
 those
 things


there
 are
 many
 reasons
 for
 why
 what
 we


doing
 what
 we
 are
 now
 and
 now
 I
 change


one
 thing.
 I
 will
 change
 the
 harm
 from


climate
 change.
 Okay.
 Suppose
 that
 for


having
 fixing
 everything
 else
 we
 are


become
 more
 concerned
 with
 climate


change.
 Then
 in
 the
 first
 best
 in
 an


ideal
 world
 if
 you
 maximize
 social


welfare
 what
 what
 you
 would
 uh
 do
 is


that
 you
 would
 increase
 the
 tax
 on
 all


kind
 of
 fossil
 fuel
 coal
 especially
 but


also
 natural
 gas.
 So
 you
 would
 increase


that
 tax
 and
 the
 consequence
 would
 be


that
 uh
 there
 would
 be
 more
 investments


in
 renewables
 and
 emissions
 would
 fall.


That
 would
 that
 would
 be
 in
 an
 ideal


world
 with
 so-called
 green
 taxes
 or
 PO


taxes.
 Uh
 in
 fact
 you
 will
 get
 something


similar
 in
 the
 so-called
 second
 best
 in


the
 second
 best
 there
 suppose
 there
 is


no
 glo
 there
 are
 coal
 producers
 out


there
 which
 are
 not
 facing
 this
 tax.


There
 are
 countries
 who
 are
 not


introducing
 this
 policy.
 Okay.
 So
 even


in
 that
 case
 if
 you
 can
 commit
 now
 to
 a


policy
 50
 years
 from
 now
 you
 would
 still


prefer
 u
 u
 the
 following.
 If
 the
 climate


if
 you
 hold
 everything
 else
 con
 constant


but
 you
 change
 the
 harm
 from
 climate


change
 that
 will
 motivate
 a
 larger
 tax


on
 gas
 and
 it
 will
 motivate
 and
 it
 will


lead
 to
 more
 more
 renewables
 and
 a
 lower


emissions
 but
 emissions
 would
 not
 be


quite
 that
 low
 of
 course
 because
 the
 tax


on
 coal.
 So
 the
 second
 best
 is
 still


larger
 emissions.


So
 that
 is
 if
 you
 can
 commit
 today
 to
 a


policy
 15
 years
 from
 now.
 But
 what
 if


you
 cannot
 commit
 and
 that's
 what
 we


call
 the
 equilibrium.
 If
 you
 cannot


commit
 well
 after
 those
 50
 years
 have


gone,


you
 will
 then
 introd
 do
 exactly
 the


opposite.
 Okay?
 You
 will
 then
 have
 an


incentive
 to
 do
 the
 following.
 Fixing


everything
 else.
 If
 the
 climate
 change


harm
 is
 larger,
 the
 tax
 on
 gas
 will
 be


smaller.
 Consequently,


the
 emissions
 will
 be
 higher.
 Exactly


the
 reverse
 when
 this
 policy
 is


anticipated.


Exactly
 the
 reverse
 of
 what
 you
 are


trying
 to
 achieve.
 So,
 let
 me
 now
 um


talk
 a
 little
 bit
 about
 explanation
 for


this
 and
 and
 and
 this
 holds
 quite


generally.
 So
 I
 will
 just
 use
 a
 very


simple
 stylist
 example
 to
 illustrate
 the


intuition
 for
 how
 this
 can
 this
 can
 be


so
 counterproductive.


And
 to
 do
 that
 we
 start
 out
 with
 the


demand
 curve
 for
 energy.
 Uh
 meaning
 that


the
 lower
 is
 the
 price
 of
 energy
 the


higher
 is
 the
 demand.
 But
 demand
 now
 can


come
 from
 three
 different
 sources.
 Um
 in


the
 short
 term
 you
 have
 a
 fixed
 amount


of
 renewables
 uh
 or
 or
 energy
 coming


from
 windmill
 solar
 renewables
 that's


fixed
 in
 the
 short
 term
 and
 then
 you


decide
 on
 natural
 gas
 which
 is
 uh


something
 you
 can
 influence
 with
 the
 tax


on
 gas
 and
 then
 you
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 uh


rebels
 out
 there
 who
 are
 producing
 coal


and
 those
 they
 are
 producing
 more
 coal


if
 the
 price
 of
 energy
 is
 higher
 and


together
 those
 three
 sources
 will
 add
 up


to
 the
 total
 supply
 to
 meet
 the
 total


demand
 meaning
 that
 there
 will
 be
 an


equilibrium
 price
 and
 equilibrium


quantity
 with
 coal,
 gas
 and
 renewables.


And
 in
 this
 setting,
 suppose
 that
 you


change
 how
 much
 gas
 you
 produce.
 If
 you


change
 and
 increase
 how
 much
 gas
 you


produce,
 you
 will
 do
 the
 following.
 You


will
 shift
 out
 the
 total
 the
 gas
 uh
 uh


um
 uh
 you
 will
 increase
 how
 much
 gas
 you


produce.
 That
 will
 shift
 out
 the
 supply


curve.
 It
 will
 lead
 to
 a
 lower
 price
 of


energy
 because
 you're
 producing
 a
 lot
 of


gas.
 So
 the
 price
 of
 energy
 will
 be


lower
 and
 the
 consequence
 of
 that
 is


that
 the
 coal
 producers
 will
 go
 down.


Coal
 production
 will
 go
 down.
 You're


squeezing
 out
 coal.
 You
 are
 squeezing


out
 coal.
 In
 the
 short
 term,
 the
 stock


of
 renewables
 is
 more
 or
 less
 given
 by


past
 investments.
 So
 more
 gas
 will
 crowd


out
 coal.


Okay.
 Um
 which
 is
 exactly
 why
 uh
 we
 want


to
 uh
 do
 this
 if
 the
 harm
 is
 increasing


isol
 isolated.
 But
 in
 the
 long
 term
 in


the
 long
 term
 even
 the
 stock
 of


renewables
 is
 endogenous.
 Even
 that
 is


determined
 by
 investors.
 And
 here


suppose
 it's
 the
 cost
 of
 windmills
 or


solar
 or
 nuclear
 for
 that
 matter
 is


given
 by
 some
 constant
 K.
 Then
 in
 the


long
 term
 there
 will
 be
 an
 equilibrium


price
 where
 the
 amount
 of
 gas
 coal
 and


renewables
 will
 sum
 up
 to
 the
 total
 uh


supply
 which
 should
 meet
 be
 met
 by
 total


demand.
 So
 that
 is
 what
 will
 happen
 in


the
 long
 term
 when
 investments
 in


renewables
 have
 time
 to


um
 major
 and
 develop.


So
 then
 so
 and
 in
 if
 in
 this
 context
 if


the
 if
 the
 market
 anticipate
 that
 no


it's
 not
 going
 to
 look
 like
 this
 the


marginal
 harm
 for
 some
 reason
 is


isolated
 is
 it
 becomes
 a
 higher
 bigger


cost
 of
 uh
 uh
 climate
 change
 then
 that


can
 if
 that
 motivates
 the
 gas
 production


to
 be
 larger
 then
 it
 will
 look
 like
 this


anticipating
 this
 investments
 in


renewables
 will
 fall


coal
 production
 will
 not
 be
 squeezed
 out


so
 much.
 So
 in
 the
 more
 long
 term
 more


gas
 will
 crowd
 out
 renewables
 and
 not


coal


and
 therefore
 you
 get
 more
 emissions.


So
 so
 so
 that
 is
 why
 we
 call
 it
 the
 gas


trap.
 The
 higher
 so
 so
 remember
 what
 we


did
 we
 fixing
 everything
 else.
 If
 you


look
 at
 a
 small
 change
 in
 one
 isolated


thing
 namely
 the
 effect
 of
 climate


change
 that
 will
 motivate
 if
 you
 cannot


tie
 your
 hands
 if
 you
 are
 temp
 if
 you


cannot
 commit
 that
 will
 motivate
 you
 to


produce
 more
 fossil
 fuel
 that
 will


because
 that
 will
 squeeze
 out
 coal
 but


the
 anticipation
 of
 this
 is
 that


renewables
 will
 fall
 and
 you
 can
 end
 up


with
 more
 emissions.
 That
 is
 what
 we


call
 a
 gas
 drop.
 And
 that
 is
 exactly


what
 the
 opposite
 of
 what
 you
 would
 have


done
 if
 you
 could
 have
 committed.
 If
 you


can
 commit
 now
 to
 a
 policy
 50
 years
 from


now,
 then
 as
 I
 mentioned
 before,
 you
 if


the
 marginal
 harm
 increases
 a
 little


bit,
 you
 would
 like
 to
 reduce
 um
 um
 um


uh
 production
 of
 all
 kind
 of
 fossil
 fuel


to
 leave
 the
 room
 for
 renewables.
 Um
 um


um
 and
 that
 is
 exactly
 what
 the
 opposite


what
 will
 happen
 if
 you
 cannot
 commit.


Um
 but
 so
 if
 you
 cannot
 commit,
 you


might
 look
 for
 ways
 to
 uh
 to
 influence


your
 future
 decision
 and
 and
 that
 leads


to
 the
 possibility
 that
 if
 the
 marginal


harm
 of
 climate
 change
 increases
 and
 you


cannot
 commit
 to
 future
 policies,
 then


there
 can
 be
 a
 role
 for
 regulating


search
 and
 exploration
 because
 that
 can


limit
 long-term
 production
 quantities.


uh
 and
 that
 in
 turn
 will
 strengthen
 the


expectations
 that
 renewables
 will
 pay


off
 and
 be
 profitable


because
 after
 all
 this
 is
 a
 coordination


game.
 We
 are
 um
 it's
 a
 coordination


game.
 Um
 and
 this
 this
 is
 just
 one


example.
 There
 are
 many
 other
 example
 uh


of
 why
 climate
 policies
 um
 and
 and


decisions
 affecting
 technologies
 will


end
 up
 being
 like
 a
 coordination
 game.


So
 more
 gen
 quite
 generally
 it
 will
 be


the
 case
 that
 if
 green
 policies
 and


environmental
 ambitious
 policies
 are


anticipated


then
 investments
 in
 in
 green


technologies
 abatement
 technologies
 uh


renewables
 will
 pay
 off
 and
 when
 those


investments
 have
 taken
 place
 it
 will


also
 be
 easier
 to
 continue
 or
 introduce


in
 the
 first
 place
 the
 environmental


ambitious
 policies.
 So
 that's
 a


self-sustaining
 equilibrium.


The
 problem


is
 that
 we
 start
 here.
 Um,
 we
 start
 here


with
 not
 sufficiently
 ambitious


environmental
 policies,
 not
 sufficiently


global
 policies.
 That's
 on
 the
 on
 the


global
 level
 at
 least.
 And
 that
 is
 uh


partly
 because
 a
 lot
 of
 capital
 is
 sunk


and
 we
 then
 have
 stranded
 assets
 in


relatively
 um
 traditional
 sectors.
 and


those
 investments
 uh
 are
 continuing
 to


take
 place
 there
 because
 the
 policies


are
 not
 sufficiently
 ambitious
 at
 the


global
 level.


So
 the
 solution


um
 dear
 governor
 CEO
 and
 decision
 makers


and
 policy
 makers
 the
 solutions


[Laughter]


the
 solutions
 is
 to
 pay
 attention
 to
 how


you
 your
 important
 decisions
 will
 affect


expectations


because
 expectations
 are
 self-fulfilling


in
 such
 a
 coordination
 game.
 If


investors
 and
 other
 countries
 expect


that
 the
 Paris
 agreement
 will
 fail,
 it


will
 fail.


If
 expectations
 change,
 investments
 will


change.
 If
 investor
 investors
 trust
 that


the
 green
 renewable
 investments,
 they


will
 be
 profitable
 because
 of
 their


ambitious
 environmental
 policies
 or
 and


climate
 policies.


While
 invest
 broad
 investments
 will
 not


have
 the
 same
 support
 then
 green


investments
 will
 accelerate


and
 this
 is
 important
 and
 it's
 quite


general.
 So
 in
 fact
 all
 public
 policies


which
 affect
 the
 profitability
 of
 uh


future
 different
 future
 industries


and
 therefore
 all
 type
 of
 public


investments


they
 can
 be
 interpreted
 as
 signals.
 If


I'm
 one
 not
 one
 of
 those
 investors
 I
 I


will
 learn
 from
 things
 from
 that.
 If
 if


I
 see
 governments,
 if
 I
 see
 big
 decision


makers


um
 make
 investments
 on
 a
 bet
 on
 which


scenario
 they
 think
 will
 be
 likely,
 I


learn
 I
 will
 take
 that
 as
 a
 signal
 if


I'm
 an
 individual
 investors
 and
 I
 will


also
 coordinate
 on
 the
 same
 expectation.


So
 those
 decisions
 will
 reveal
 tensions


and
 beliefs
 and
 they
 will
 affect
 invest


expectations
 and
 investments.


So
 therefore


pay
 attention
 to
 how
 um
 the
 big


decisions
 are
 affecting
 the


expectations.


Thank
 you.


Thank
 you
 for
 your
 very
 important


insights.


Now
 to
 round
 off
 this
 session,
 we
 will


again
 turn
 to
 Norway.
 It
 is
 my
 honor
 to


introduce
 Hild
 de
 Bernlan,
 a
 prominent


Norwegian
 economist
 and
 a
 leading
 voice


of
 macroeconomics,
 energy
 economics,
 and


applied
 econometrics.


Hild
 delan
 is
 a
 professor
 at
 BI


Norwegian
 Business
 School
 where
 she
 also


serves
 as
 the
 provost
 for
 research
 and


academic
 resources.


In
 addition
 to
 her
 academic


achievements,
 Professor
 Bernardan
 has


served
 on
 several
 advisory
 boards
 and


she
 provides
 valuable
 input
 to
 policy


discussions
 both
 here
 in
 Norway
 and


abroad.
 Today
 she
 will
 elaborate
 on
 the


challenges
 of
 the
 energy
 transition
 for


the
 Norwegian
 economy.
 Welcome
 to
 the


stage
 Herna.


[Applause]


Thank
 you
 for
 inviting
 me
 here
 and
 thank


you
 for
 arranging
 this
 wonderful


conference.


So
 talking
 about
 uh
 challenges
 with


regard
 to
 the
 energy
 transition
 for


Norway,
 I
 could
 give
 you
 two
 narratives.


One
 could
 be
 like
 compared
 to
 other
 oil


producing
 countries,
 we
 are
 extremely


well
 equipped.
 We
 have
 the
 sovereign


wealth
 fund
 you
 heard
 about
 this


morning,
 largest
 wealth
 fund
 in
 the


world.
 We
 have
 high
 growth
 rates,
 low


unemployment
 rate
 and
 we
 have
 in
 general


uh
 very
 low
 inequality.


But
 I
 could
 also
 give
 you
 another


narrative.
 A
 narrative
 which
 is
 a
 little


bit
 more
 challenging.
 A
 narrative
 which


is
 related
 to
 the
 fact
 that
 we
 are
 going


to
 face
 a
 double
 challenge
 over


petroleum
 resources
 are
 going
 to
 go


down.
 At
 the
 same
 time
 as
 we
 as


everybody
 else
 has
 to
 adapt
 to
 the


climate
 change
 and
 on
 top
 of
 that
 I'm


going
 to
 also
 talk
 about
 the
 fact
 that


compared
 not
 to
 the
 oil
 producing


countries
 but
 to
 other
 OCD
 countries
 we


have
 put
 ourselves
 in
 a
 situation
 where


we
 are
 world
 champion
 in
 using
 of


resources
 public
 resources
 internally


and
 I
 will
 take
 that
 second
 route
 in


talking
 about
 the
 challenges
 this


narrative
 because
 I
 think
 that's


important.
 important
 to
 talk
 about.
 That


is
 not
 to
 say
 that
 we
 are
 not
 well


equipped
 like
 everybody
 else
 but
 it


means
 that
 we
 have
 to
 take
 more
 pay
 more


attention
 to
 these
 challenges.


All
 right.
 So
 um
 we
 have
 heard
 about
 the


effect
 of
 climate
 change
 uh
 how
 it


affects
 country
 differently
 the


distribution
 of
 countries
 related
 very


much
 to
 location.
 We
 also
 heard
 about


how
 it
 affects
 household
 income
 the


distribution
 related
 to
 income.
 But


climate
 change
 will
 push
 lead
 to
 push


for
 renewables
 and
 it
 will
 mean
 that
 it


will
 change
 exporters
 and
 importers


differently.
 And
 Norway
 is
 an
 energy


exporter
 of
 oil
 and
 gas,
 a
 large
 one,


although
 petroleum
 resources
 have


declined
 recently
 and
 will
 continue
 to


decl
 independent
 of
 this
 climate
 change.


But
 the
 push
 for
 climate
 change
 and


renewable
 will
 speed
 up
 that
 transition.


We
 know
 for
 uh
 energy
 importers,
 we
 know


quite
 a
 lot
 about
 uh
 how
 um
 although


there
 are
 uncertainty
 there
 also,
 but
 we


know
 in
 particular
 that
 uh
 when
 you


become
 less
 uh
 when
 you
 import
 less
 uh


oil
 and
 gas,
 you
 will
 become
 less


dependent
 on
 fossil
 fuels
 and
 of
 course


less
 dependent
 on
 fossil
 fuel
 countries.


For
 energy
 exporters,
 there
 is
 not
 much


evidence
 actually.
 There
 is
 uncertainty


there.
 So
 on
 top
 of
 the
 uncertainty


about
 the
 climate
 change,
 there's
 also


this
 uncertainty
 about
 what
 will
 happen


to
 the
 energy
 exporters
 because
 there's


little
 evidence
 ex
 describing
 exactly


that.


So
 uh
 to
 go
 through
 that
 route
 I
 need
 to


step
 back
 a
 bit
 and
 that
 that
 means
 that


for
 the
 Norwegian
 audience
 they
 will


know
 understand
 what
 I
 talk
 about
 very


well
 but
 for
 the
 international
 audience


this
 will
 be
 something
 I
 think
 is


important
 to
 understand
 where
 we're


coming
 from.


So
 there's
 a
 huge
 literature
 starting
 in


the
 70s
 about
 whether


um
 oil
 and
 gas
 is
 a
 blessing
 or
 curse


starting
 with
 Sax
 and
 Warner
 and
 Cordon


and
 others
 uh
 discussing
 these
 topics.


So
 Norway
 uh
 discovered
 oil
 in
 1969
 at


Echoisk
 and
 you
 see
 Echoisk
 to
 the
 left


there
 and
 the
 discovery
 of
 oil
 has


generated
 a
 huge
 stream
 of
 income
 which


is
 the
 foundation
 for
 the
 oil
 fund


today.


And
 this
 income
 uh
 is
 obviously


something
 we
 will
 be
 challenged
 by
 that


that
 will
 be
 declining
 going
 forward.


But
 there's
 more
 to
 this
 picture
 than


just
 income
 because
 this
 picture
 tells


also
 that
 the
 discovery
 of
 oil
 and
 gas


has
 been
 done
 in
 the
 North
 Sea
 in
 harsh


in
 harsh
 conditions.
 Not
 only
 of
 course


wind
 and
 coldness
 etc.
 But
 drilling
 in


the
 North
 Sea
 offshore
 is
 drilling
 um


many
 many
 meters
 below
 the
 sea
 level


horizontally
 uh
 as
 well
 as
 vertically.


And
 this
 process
 has
 generated
 as
 I
 said


income
 but
 it
 has
 also
 generated


technology
 spillovers
 to
 other
 industry


and
 that
 spillover
 has
 been
 important


for
 Norway
 because
 that
 has
 been
 the


foundation
 also
 for
 a
 lot
 of
 other


industries
 in
 Norway.
 So
 how
 does
 that


square
 with
 the
 fact
 that
 we
 should


expect
 something
 like
 a
 resource
 or


maybe
 Dutch
 disease
 if
 you
 heard
 about


that?
 Well,
 so
 picture
 to
 the
 right
 is


an
 example
 of
 a
 uh
 kind
 of
 very
 stylish


way
 of
 looking
 about
 oil
 exporter.
 It


tells
 you
 that
 if
 you
 so
 on
 the
 vertical


axis
 is
 growth
 rates
 and
 on
 the


horizontal
 axis
 is
 export
 share
 uh
 oil


and
 gas
 in
 your
 export
 share.
 So
 it


tells
 you
 that
 the
 more
 oil
 and
 gas
 you


have
 in
 your
 export
 going
 horizontal,


the
 less
 your
 growth
 rate
 will
 be.
 So


this
 is
 an
 average
 of
 the
 last
 20
 years


done
 by
 USAD.
 So
 an
 adapt
 so
 an
 update


of
 the
 sax
 estimation
 and
 that
 figure
 is


sloping
 downward
 even
 more
 so
 in
 the
 in


the
 early
 days


but
 this
 is
 a
 snapshot
 it's
 a
 snapshot


of
 the
 last
 20
 years
 it
 does
 so
 for
 us


for
 economists
 this
 is
 correlational


causation
 it
 doesn't
 tell
 you
 anything


about
 where
 you're
 coming
 from
 what
 did


we
 do
 the
 30
 years
 before
 that
 where
 how


did
 that
 affect
 the
 economy
 and
 how
 are


the
 cycles
 in
 this
 period


So
 this
 curse
 description
 is
 not


necessarily
 fitting
 for
 all
 countries.


So
 you
 have
 to
 be
 more
 nuanced
 and


that's
 what
 we
 have
 been
 trying
 to
 do
 in


research
 for
 at
 last
 10
 15
 years


together
 with
 other
 colleagues


and
 one
 of
 the
 things
 we
 have
 been


looking
 at
 is
 exactly
 this
 hypothesis
 of


the
 Dutch
 disease.
 So
 curse
 sounds
 very


bad.
 Dutch
 disease
 is
 a
 little
 bit


better.
 You're
 not
 cursed.
 You
 don't


have
 negative
 growth
 rates.
 that
 after
 a


oil
 boom
 you
 experience
 higher


unemployment
 rate
 deficit


uh
 and
 also
 uh
 lower
 growth
 rates
 but
 we


didn't
 see
 that
 in
 Norway
 over
 the
 c


over
 the
 time
 we
 have
 seen
 so
 uh


together
 with
 here
 showing
 from
 one


paper
 together
 with
 lefu


we
 have
 examined
 uh
 by
 building
 models


and
 analyzing
 data
 how
 the
 oil
 boom
 has


affected
 the
 Norwegian
 economy


and
 to
 the
 left
 there
 you
 see
 employment


in
 manufacturing
 as
 a
 share
 of
 total


employment
 and
 you
 see
 Norway
 in
 black


and
 Sweden
 in
 gray
 both
 are
 trending


downwards
 but
 Norway
 is
 trending
 more


downwards
 so
 we
 know
 as
 a
 share
 of
 uh


manufacturing
 as
 a
 share
 of
 employment


has
 fallen
 in
 many
 industrial


industrialized
 countries
 but
 it's
 fallen


more
 in
 Norway
 so
 that's
 a
 sign
 of
 dust


disease
 you
 are
 thinking
 and
 yes
 it
 is
 a


sign
 of
 dust
 disease
 it's
 fallen
 more
 in


Norway
 because
 oil
 has
 crowded
 out
 other


industries
 like
 tech
 industry
 for


instance.


But
 on
 the
 right
 you
 see
 something
 which


contradicted
 the
 disease
 because
 there


you
 see
 that
 productivity
 here
 measured


by
 labor
 productivity
 has
 increased
 more


than
 in
 Sweden.
 So
 both
 in
 total
 Norway


and
 Norway
 mainland
 which
 is
 a
 staple.


So
 despite
 losing
 more
 of
 the


manufacturing
 we
 have
 had
 higher


productivity
 growth
 in
 Norway.
 And
 what


we
 do
 in
 that
 paper
 and
 another
 paper
 is


that
 we
 analyze
 why.
 And
 one
 of
 the


reason
 is
 exactly
 for
 because
 of
 the


harsh
 condition
 in
 the
 North
 Sea.
 It
 has


generated
 productivity
 spillovers
 to


other
 industries
 and
 it
 has
 made
 us


develop
 a
 very
 profitable
 um
 oil
 service


industry
 which
 has
 had
 spillovers
 to


other
 industries
 and
 that
 is
 one
 of
 the


reasons
 for
 this
 higher
 productivity


growth
 in
 this
 period.
 Another
 reason
 is


of
 course
 something
 I
 don't
 show
 here


but
 related
 very
 much
 to
 the
 opening


talk
 today
 namely
 that
 we
 have
 saved
 a


lot
 of
 that
 revenue.
 We
 have
 we
 haven't


inflated
 the
 economy
 by
 using
 a
 lot
 like


other
 oil
 producing
 countries.
 We
 have


saved
 for
 the
 future
 and
 we
 have


gradually
 faced
 that
 money
 into
 the


economy
 and
 that
 in
 that
 phasing
 in
 is


one
 of
 the
 reason
 why
 we
 haven't
 seen


skyrocking
 uh
 wages
 and
 skyrocking
 uh


inflation.
 Another


reason
 which
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 talk
 about


here
 but
 which
 uh
 I'm
 looking
 into
 and


which
 but
 which
 is
 also
 an
 interesting


fact
 that
 is
 that
 during
 this
 period


female
 labor
 participation
 rate


increased
 massively
 in
 Norway
 and
 much


more
 compared
 to
 other
 oil
 producing


countries
 and
 that
 is
 also
 one
 of
 the


reason
 why
 we
 haven't
 seen
 the
 over
 the


heating
 overheating
 of
 the
 Norwegian


economy
 and
 that's
 something
 to
 look
 uh


that's
 something
 we
 know
 narratively
 but


it's
 also
 something
 we
 are
 looking
 into


more
 quantitatively
 which
 is
 interesting


to
 look
 at
 but
 okay
 I'm
 going
 to
 talk


about
 my
 talk
 is
 about
 challenges
 so
 uh


this
 is
 obviously
 about
 the
 narrative


about
 what
 we
 have
 done
 well
 which
 I


think
 is
 important
 to
 keep
 in
 your
 hands


on
 but
 we
 do
 have
 some
 challenges
 and


let
 me
 start
 by
 saying
 that
 despite
 the


fact
 that
 we
 have
 saved
 a
 lot
 we
 have


also
 used
 a
 lot


and
 then
 we
 discussed
 that
 in
 Norway
 the


typical
 argument
 is
 that
 yes
 we
 have


used
 a
 lot
 but
 we
 were
 supposed
 to
 use
 a


lot
 because
 we
 were
 facing
 in
 a
 lot
 over


the


But
 because
 the
 oil
 fund
 has
 grown
 so


much,
 taking
 3%
 out
 of
 the
 fund
 in


spending
 has
 been
 a
 lot
 over
 the
 time.


And
 to
 the
 left,
 you
 see
 the
 non
 fiscal


deficit
 as
 a
 percent
 of
 mainland
 GDP
 in


Norway.
 Today
 all
 more
 than
 30%


is
 fin
 30%
 of
 GDP
 is
 financed
 by
 uh
 is


is
 is
 due
 to
 spending
 coming
 from
 from


um
 from
 the
 oil
 from
 the
 oil
 fund
 sorry


uh
 in
 fact
 uh
 25%
 to
 the
 right
 of
 uh


fiscal
 budget
 expenditure
 is
 coming
 from


uh
 the
 return
 of
 the
 fund


and
 While
 this
 is
 of
 course
 something
 we


will
 plan
 for,
 this
 is
 gives
 us
 also


some
 challenges
 because
 now
 we
 are


facing
 uh
 as
 we
 we
 are
 talking
 about


climate
 change.
 We
 are
 facing
 energy


transition
 and
 we
 are
 facing
 old
 age
 and


the
 minister
 of
 finance
 in
 their
 budget


last
 week
 pointed
 out
 that
 in
 a
 few


years
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 costs
 exceed


revenues
 uh
 in
 the
 government
 sector
 and


that
 means
 that
 maybe
 going
 forward
 the


3%
 from
 the
 fund
 will
 not
 be
 sufficient


to
 finance
 that.
 So
 we
 have
 put


ourselves
 in
 a
 situation
 where
 compared


to
 other
 OCD
 countries
 we
 have
 already


used
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 resources
 the
 we
 are


already
 depending
 a
 lot
 on
 the
 income


from
 the
 fund
 and
 of
 course
 although
 the


fund
 is
 doing
 well
 uh
 it
 is
 an
 source
 of


income
 which
 is
 fluctuating
 in
 the


market
 which
 gives
 for
 another
 uh
 which


gives
 us
 another
 challenge
 in
 case
 that


will
 happen.


Okay.
 So
 we
 have
 saved
 a
 lot
 uh
 and
 uh


Norway
 is
 in
 many
 way
 a
 good
 country
 but


we
 have
 some
 other
 challenges
 which
 has


been
 pointed
 out
 by
 uh
 economists
 in
 a


couple
 of
 articles.
 So
 we
 came
 from
 a


situation
 where
 we
 were
 um
 the
 rich


cousin
 in
 the
 north.
 They
 did
 the


Scandinavian
 comparison
 which
 I
 don't


think
 was
 fair
 because
 we
 were
 just
 the


rich
 cousin
 in
 north.
 We
 are
 much
 more


than
 just
 the
 rich
 curs
 in
 north
 as
 I


pointed
 out
 with
 with
 regard
 to
 uh
 our


industries.
 But
 in
 2015
 oil
 prices
 fell


drastically
 and
 then
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 oil


exporting
 countries
 uh
 were
 facing


higher
 unemployment
 rate,
 lower
 growth


rate
 and
 a
 weakened
 currency.


The
 Norwegian
 Blues,
 that's
 their
 graph,


not
 mine,
 uh,
 put
 us
 in
 the
 same


situation
 as
 Russia
 and
 Venezuela
 and


others,
 which
 were
 really
 having
 a
 blow


to
 their
 economy.
 The
 Norwegian
 economy


didn't
 experience
 such
 a
 recession.
 But


we
 did
 experience
 something
 which
 has


gone
 a
 bit
 unnoticed,
 namely
 that
 growth


rate
 since
 then
 has
 declined
 somewhat


and
 the
 exchange
 rate
 most
 importantly


has
 never
 recovered.


So
 what
 I'm
 going
 to
 uh
 show
 you
 here
 is


uh
 two
 challenges
 which
 I
 think
 they're


there
 and
 which
 uh
 I
 think
 are
 important


to
 address
 going
 forward
 in
 particular


if
 we
 are
 to
 uh
 adapt
 and
 uh
 reduce
 our


dependence
 on
 oil
 to
 build
 other


industry.
 The
 first
 is
 that
 despite


having
 high
 productivity
 levels
 and


higher
 growth
 rates
 in
 the
 80s,
 90s,


early
 20s
 than
 many
 countries,
 growth


rates
 of
 productivity
 now
 are
 declining


in
 Norway
 relative
 to
 other
 top
 OCD


countries.
 So
 we
 see
 that
 the
 last
 10


years
 growth
 rates
 of
 productivity
 have


flattened
 out
 and
 declined
 in
 Norway


which
 is
 uh
 maybe
 not
 a
 concern
 since


you're
 coming
 from
 high
 level
 but
 the


concern
 when
 you
 are
 transitioned
 the


economy
 into
 uh
 out
 of
 fossil
 fuels
 into


renewable
 energy.


Norway
 has
 a
 high
 labor
 supply,
 but
 we


also
 have
 a
 high
 share
 um
 or
 so
 we
 have


a
 high
 labor
 supply,
 but
 it
 has
 been


stagnating
 and
 we
 also
 have
 we
 also
 work


fewer
 hours
 than
 many
 OCD
 countries
 and


most
 importantly
 we
 have
 an
 increase
 in


share
 outside
 the
 labor
 force
 and
 that


share
 uh
 which
 was
 also
 ped
 pointed
 out


by
 the
 minister
 of
 finance
 last
 week
 in


their
 budget
 that
 share
 uh
 has
 a


proportionally
 is
 proportionally
 larger


outside
 the
 labor
 force
 due
 to
 sickness


and
 disability
 than
 other
 Nordic


countries.
 And
 this
 figure
 shows
 the
 um


recipiental
 disability
 benefit
 as
 a


percent
 of
 population
 in
 Norway
 the
 last


10
 15
 years.
 So
 it
 has
 been
 increasing.


So
 why
 do
 I
 focus
 on
 that?


is
 because
 we
 need
 a
 flexible
 labor


force
 going
 forward
 and
 we
 need
 high


growth
 rates
 and
 pro
 a
 productive


economy
 to
 transition
 out
 of
 oil


and
 the
 productivity
 let
 me
 put
 it
 glut


or
 uh
 stagnation
 or
 whatever
 is
 also


affecting
 our
 external
 sectors.
 So
 in


research
 I've
 done
 together
 with
 uh
 and


this
 is
 the
 most
 challenging
 graph
 of
 my


talk.
 uh
 in
 the
 research
 I've
 done


together
 with
 colleagues
 in
 Norris
 Bank,


Leubach
 and
 Nicolum
 Fati,
 we
 have


examined
 exactly
 the
 effect
 of
 the
 oil


boom
 on
 the
 exchange
 rate
 and
 we
 have


done
 it
 now
 by
 building
 a
 theory
 model


will
 take
 which
 take
 into
 account
 the


sovereign
 belt
 fund
 which
 take
 into


account
 the
 different
 industries
 which


take
 into
 account
 the
 spillover
 and


which
 takes
 into
 account
 exactly
 this


transition.
 And
 what
 we
 show
 then
 both


theoretically
 and
 empirically
 is
 that
 we


can
 explain
 the
 depreciation.


Depreciation
 is
 here
 going
 up
 of
 the


real
 exchange
 rate
 the
 last
 10
 15
 years


by
 weakening
 productivity
 differential


and
 also
 uh
 facing
 out
 the
 oil.
 So
 the


graph
 to
 the
 left
 shows
 you
 the
 real


exchange
 rate
 blue
 and
 the
 black
 is
 the


trend
 of
 that
 go
 in
 the
 last
 since
 1980.


And
 to
 the
 right
 what
 you
 see
 there
 if


you
 if
 you
 focus
 on
 the
 thing
 going
 down


you
 see
 that
 and
 going
 down
 means


appreciation


from
 80
 from
 1980
 and
 up
 until
 2010
 the


oil
 contributed
 to
 appreciate
 the
 real


exchange
 rate
 because
 it
 takes
 it
 down


both
 the
 oil
 production
 activities
 below


but
 also
 the
 oil
 price
 typically
 as
 you


would
 expect
 for
 an
 oil
 producer
 but


since
 maybe
 since
 probably
 around
 the


oil
 price
 decline
 in
 2014
 1415
 the
 tides


sorry
 have
 turned
 the
 other
 way.
 So
 uh


lesser
 dependence
 of
 oil
 which
 is
 a
 good


thing
 with
 regard
 to
 climate
 change
 but


it
 has
 worked
 on
 the
 macro
 side
 to


depreciate
 the
 real
 exchange
 rate.
 So
 it


go
 takes
 it
 in
 that
 direction.
 At
 the


same
 time
 the
 big
 yellow
 one
 is
 the
 uh


weakening
 of
 the
 productivity


differential
 relative
 to
 other
 country.


It
 have
 worked
 also
 to
 depreciate
 the


real
 exchange
 rate.
 You
 see
 on
 the
 left


that
 the
 black
 is
 below
 the
 blue
 which


means
 that
 it
 doesn't
 explain


everything.
 Montrop
 poll
 explains


something
 fiscal
 policy
 explains


something
 and
 the
 fact
 that
 is
 below
 the


blue
 tells
 you
 that
 exchange
 rate
 is


weak
 more
 weak
 now
 than
 what
 our
 trend


suggest.
 So
 for
 us
 going
 abroad
 it
 means


that
 maybe
 it
 will
 go
 down
 and
 that
 will


be
 a
 good
 thing
 but
 then
 again
 you
 don't


know
 that.
 So
 um
 wrapping
 up
 um
 we
 have


gone
 from
 being
 uh
 an
 oildriven


exceptional
 country
 to
 what
 I
 would
 call


at
 least
 a
 more
 normal
 country.
 The


Norwegian
 economy
 is
 doing
 well.
 I
 mean


low
 unemployment
 rate
 and
 growth
 rate


are
 okay.
 But
 there
 are
 what
 I
 call
 not


we
 are
 not
 facing
 what
 I
 call
 the
 Dutch


disease
 but
 something
 I
 call
 the
 muted


Dutch
 disease.
 There's
 a
 risk
 of
 the
 of


a
 muted
 dust
 disease.
 We
 have
 used
 a
 lot


of
 fiscal
 concussions
 in
 Norway.
 We
 have


a
 great
 sovereign
 we
 have
 a
 great


welfare
 system
 but
 we
 have
 also


stretched
 amount
 of
 funding
 into
 the


Norwegian
 economy.
 So
 that
 now
 we
 are


vulnerable
 to
 changes
 in
 both
 the
 fund


and
 to
 cost
 exceeding
 revenues
 going


forward
 and
 in
 particular
 the
 physical


cushion
 although
 they
 can
 solve
 a
 lot
 of


things
 they
 can't
 solve
 the
 growth


challenge
 and
 they
 can't
 solve
 the


energy
 transition.
 For
 that
 we
 need


other
 measures.


uh
 but
 I
 think
 that
 I
 want
 to
 end
 on
 an


optimistic
 note.
 So
 I
 think
 that
 ended


end
 of
 the
 transition
 is
 not
 just
 a


matter
 of
 cost
 to
 Norwegian
 economy.


It's
 a
 lot
 of
 opportunity
 as
 well.
 New


industries,
 new
 patents,
 new
 um
 new


firms,
 new
 growth
 rates,
 new
 partners,


new
 new
 discussions,
 etc.


But
 um
 we
 need
 as
 um
 Nicl
 Tang
 said
 this


morning,
 we
 need
 u
 to
 have
 ambitions
 to


achieve
 those
 goals.
 So
 brushing
 our


challenges
 under
 the
 carpet
 is
 not


something
 I
 do.
 Instead,
 put
 them
 up
 and


discuss
 what
 to
 do
 about
 them.
 And
 I


think
 ultimately
 long-term
 prosperity


depends
 on
 productivity,
 skills,
 and


innovation.
 And
 the
 uh
 energy
 transition


and
 the
 climate
 change
 is
 going
 to
 give


you
 all
 of
 these
 opportunities.
 But
 for


that
 we
 need
 to
 take
 care
 about
 what
 we


use
 the
 fund
 for
 uh
 and
 what
 position
 we


put
 ourselves
 in
 and
 in
 particular
 what


kind
 of
 groceries
 are
 we
 going
 to
 have


going
 forward
 and
 in
 particular
 how
 can


we
 adapt
 so
 that
 we
 put
 oursel
 in
 that


position
 and
 let
 me
 end
 on
 this


humoristic
 whatever
 uh
 informal
 photo
 we


are
 still
 exceptional
 man
 way
 but
 we
 are


not
 shielded
 by
 all
 we
 can't
 be
 lazy


going
 forward
 thank


Thank
 you
 so
 much
 uh
 for
 your
 compelling


presentation.


Um
 now
 I
 suspect
 hunger
 is
 starting
 to


set
 in.
 So
 let's
 do
 lunch.
 For
 those
 of


you
 attending
 remotely,
 we
 will
 see
 you


again
 after
 the
 break
 at
 12:50
 sharp.


12:50.


For
 the
 rest
 of
 us,
 lunch
 will
 now
 be


served
 in
 Spal,
 which
 means
 the
 hall
 of


mirrors.
 And
 you
 will
 soon
 see
 why.


We've
 kept
 the
 lunch
 climate
 friendly.


And
 three
 dishes
 are
 available.


Sustainable
 salmon
 and
 two
 vegan


alternatives.


So,
 please
 now
 follow
 our
 security
 staff


that
 will
 usher
 you
 in
 the
 right


direction.
 Bonapati.

Your
 Royal
 Highness
 Madame
 President,


former
 Vice
 President,
 ladies
 and


gentlemen,
 welcome
 back
 to
 this
 third


session
 of
 our
 conference.


For
 this
 session,
 we
 are
 fortunate
 to


have
 European
 Central
 Bank
 President


Madame
 Christine
 Dagad
 and
 former
 US


Vice
 President
 Al
 Gore
 as
 our
 keynote


speakers.
 Their
 keynotes
 will
 be


followed
 by
 a
 conversation
 between
 them


and
 moderated
 by
 Christine
 Halveran,


director
 of
 Cicero.


And
 first,
 Madame
 Lagard,
 as
 president


of
 the
 European
 Central
 Bank
 and
 also


throughout
 your
 tenure
 as
 managing


director
 of
 the
 IMF,
 you
 have
 maintained


a
 strong
 commitment
 to
 bringing
 climate


change
 considerations
 to
 the
 four
 in
 our


profession.
 Madame
 Lagard,


please.


[Applause]


Your
 Royal
 Highness


Vore,


Madame
 Governor
 of
 Olden.
 Sherida,


Madame
 Laminist,


dear
 Mrs.
 Whom,


I'll
 switch
 to
 English.


Rest
 assured.
 So,
 ladies
 and
 gentlemen,


it
 is
 a
 great
 great
 pleasure
 to
 be
 back


at
 Nor's
 Bank.
 I
 was
 here
 almost
 10


years
 ago
 for
 the
 200th
 anniversary
 and


I'm
 delighted
 to
 be
 back
 particularly


for
 the
 first
 conference
 organized
 by


NES
 Bank
 and
 NOS's
 uh
 investment
 fund.


So
 when
 I
 last
 visited


the
 central
 bank
 back
 in
 the
 summer
 of


2016,


the
 world
 and
 Europe
 was
 in
 a
 slightly


different
 place.


Backtrack
 a
 little
 bit.
 Remember
 about


10
 years
 ago,
 the
 Paris
 Agreement,
 the


international
 treaty
 to
 reduce


greenhouse
 gas
 emission
 was
 hardly
 one


year
 old


and
 it
 enjoyed
 strong
 support
 from
 all


major
 powers
 around
 the
 world.


A
 benign
 geopolitical
 environment
 also


blurred
 the
 risks
 of
 Europe's
 growing


energy
 dependencies.
 Nordstream
 2.
 A
 new


gas
 pipeline
 project
 had
 recently
 been


announced,
 promising
 to
 deliver
 plenty


cheap
 Russian
 gas
 to
 the
 continent.


Fast
 forward
 to
 today
 and
 see
 how
 many


differences
 we
 are
 facing
 and
 how
 the


world
 has
 dramatically
 changed
 in


dramatic
 ways.


We
 are
 witnessing
 a
 backlash
 against


green
 initiatives.


The
 war
 in
 Ukraine
 has
 further
 exposed


Europe's
 energy
 dependencies
 as


strategic
 vulnerabilities


driving
 up
 gas
 prices
 after
 the
 cutoff


of
 the
 Russian
 pipeline
 supply.
 And
 who


knows
 what's
 happening
 under
 the
 water


level.


And
 as
 a
 result,
 energy
 prices
 have


risen
 sharply
 since
 gas
 sets
 the


marginal
 price
 in
 the
 EU
 energy
 market


for
 most
 of
 the
 time.


In
 this
 new
 environment,
 many
 countries


face
 an
 increasingly
 difficult
 tradeoff


between
 three
 energy
 goals
 that
 I
 will


call
 my
 energy
 trilmna.


My
 team
 argues
 that
 I
 should
 not
 really


use
 trilmna
 because
 in
 a
 trilmna
 you


can't
 really
 escape
 and
 I'm
 going
 to
 try


to
 show
 you
 that
 we
 can
 escape
 the


trilmna.
 So
 what
 are
 the
 three
 angles
 of


the
 trilmna?


We
 need
 energy
 that
 is
 secure
 because


the
 geopolitical
 reality
 has
 changed


dramatically.


We
 need
 energy
 that
 is
 sustainable


because
 the
 climate
 reality
 has
 not


changed
 or
 some
 would
 argue
 that
 it
 has


changed
 for
 the
 worse.


And
 we
 need
 energy
 that
 is
 affordable


because
 households
 and
 corporates
 need


it.


Ultimately


only
 clean
 energy
 has
 the
 potential
 to


deliver
 on
 all
 three
 goals


of
 my
 trilmna.
 As
 Norway
 actually


demonstrates


the
 share
 of
 renewable
 in
 energy


consumption
 here
 in
 this
 country
 ranks


amongst
 the
 highest
 in
 the
 world.
 While


household
 energy
 prices,
 I
 know
 highly


debated
 on
 the
 subject
 of
 controversy


during
 the
 political
 campaign,
 but


remember
 they
 are
 still
 around
 23
 of
 the


EU
 average.


Norway
 can
 inspire
 the
 European
 Union


and
 demonstrate
 that
 it
 is
 possible
 if


we
 remain
 ambitious
 to
 move
 towards
 that


green
 transition
 that
 would
 address
 the


three
 angles
 of
 the
 trilmna.


Because
 a
 successful
 transition
 to
 a


renewable-based
 system
 comes
 with
 many


benefits.


It
 also
 requires
 a
 massive
 investment


push.
 The
 faster
 policy
 makers
 can


create
 an
 environment
 in
 which
 such


investment
 can
 flourish,
 the
 easier
 and


less
 costly
 the
 transition
 will
 be.
 Now


I'm
 going
 to
 ask
 for
 your
 indulgence


because
 I
 will
 quote
 Ulav


Hoger


who
 wrote


Yeah,
 forgive
 me.
 I'll
 try.


Ah,
 thank
 you.
 One
 person
 understood


what
 I
 said.


Thank
 you,
 Madame
 Minister.


So
 for
 those
 of
 you
 who
 have
 not


qualified
 yet
 in
 Norwegian,
 what
 it


means
 is
 badly
 pronounced
 by
 me,
 this
 is


your
 road
 and
 it
 is
 impossible
 to
 turn


back.


So
 today
 what
 I
 will
 do
 with
 you
 is


explore
 from
 a
 central
 banker's
 point
 of


view
 how
 Europe's
 road
 to
 renewable
 can


deliver
 powerful
 benefits
 if
 we
 unlock


the
 right
 conditions.
 So
 I
 will
 look
 in


turn
 at
 the
 landscape
 as
 we
 have
 it
 at


the
 moment,
 what
 the
 promises
 and
 the


challenges
 are
 and
 what
 the
 financing


needs
 are
 and
 how
 they
 can
 be
 addressed.


I'll
 try
 to
 gallop
 through
 my
 remarks


because
 I
 know
 that
 time
 is
 pressing
 and


my
 friend
 colleague
 much
 admired
 vice


president
 Al
 Gore
 needs
 to
 take
 the


floor
 for
 longer
 than
 me.


So
 before
 horrible
 Russia's
 invasion
 of


Ukraine,
 Europe's
 de
 facto
 prioritized


two
 elements
 of
 the
 trilmna,


sustainability
 and
 affordability.


We
 didn't
 really
 think
 very
 much
 about


security,
 not
 in
 the
 terms
 that
 we're


thinking
 about
 it
 now.
 So
 as
 part
 of
 its


fit
 for
 55
 targets,
 the
 EU
 aimed
 to


raise
 the
 share
 of
 renewables
 in
 its


energy
 consumption
 to
 as
 much
 as
 45%
 in


2030.
 At
 the
 same
 time,
 almost
 half
 of


the
 gas
 imports
 came
 from
 Russia.


The
 combination
 kept
 energy
 cost


contained,
 facilitating
 as
 a
 result


Europe
 competitiveness.


Energy
 remained
 relatively
 cheap
 for


energy
 intensive
 industries
 and
 those


periods
 of
 intermittency,
 you
 know,
 when


renewable
 output
 was
 low
 and
 gas
 served


as
 a
 backup
 did
 not
 lead
 to
 significant


price
 volatility.


But
 we
 ultimately
 paid
 the
 price
 for


neglecting
 the
 third
 goal,
 which
 is


energy
 security.
 When
 the
 geopolitical


context
 changed,
 the
 consequences
 for


our
 economy
 were
 severe.
 Consequences


that
 we
 as
 central
 bankers
 had
 to
 face


and
 combat.


First,
 we
 saw
 a
 surge
 of
 inflation.


Energy
 inflation
 in
 the
 Euro
 area
 surged


to
 37
 surged
 to
 37%
 in
 22
 pushing


headline
 inflation
 for
 a
 record
 of
 8.4%


that
 year.
 So
 in
 response
 what
 all


central
 banks
 had
 to
 do
 was
 to


significantly
 respond
 by
 implementing


the
 fastest
 monetary
 tightening
 in
 the


history
 of
 the
 ECB
 in
 order
 to
 bring


inflation
 back
 under
 control.
 And
 I'm


pleased
 to
 say
 that
 we
 have
 managed
 to


do
 that
 and
 it
 is
 now
 under
 control
 at


our
 medium-term
 target
 and
 it
 will
 stay


there.


Now,
 surging
 energy
 prices
 led
 to
 a


second
 consequence.
 They
 have
 reduced


Europe's
 competitiveness.


Although
 the
 acute
 phase
 of
 the
 energy


shock
 has
 passed,
 the
 new
 geopolitical


reality
 has
 left
 a
 lasting
 imprint
 on


Europe's
 energy
 cost,
 weakening
 its


position
 relative
 to
 other
 regions
 of


the
 world.
 Electricity
 prices
 in
 the
 EU


remain
 about
 two
 and
 a
 half
 times
 higher


than
 in
 the
 United
 States
 and
 gas
 prices


almost
 four
 times
 higher
 than
 in
 the


United
 States.
 This
 gap
 is
 is
 shaping


how
 firms
 invest,
 how
 firms
 innovate,


and
 even
 where
 they
 choose
 to
 locate


their
 operations.
 Our
 research
 at
 the


ECB
 shows
 that
 European
 firms


significantly
 reduce
 their
 capital
 and


research
 and
 development
 expenditure
 in


response
 to
 energy
 shocks.
 Unlike
 their


US
 counterparts,


there
 are
 growing
 concerns
 that
 higher


energy
 prices
 may
 also
 be
 contributing


to
 the
 disindustrialization


as
 European
 firm
 struggles
 struggle


against
 foreign
 competition


and
 higher
 energy
 prices
 make
 it
 harder


for
 Europe
 to
 full
 to
 fully
 embrace
 the


new
 technologies
 that
 will
 drive
 future


productivity
 and
 by
 that
 I
 mean


artificial
 intelligence.


So
 it
 is
 essential
 to
 bring
 energy
 cost


down
 if
 we
 are
 to
 safeguard
 Europe's


industrial
 competitiveness,
 its
 high


level
 of
 research
 and
 development
 and


leverage
 artificial
 intelligence.


And
 I'm
 confident
 that
 we
 can,
 but
 we


cannot
 do
 so
 by
 trading
 off
 other
 goals.


We
 must
 ensure
 that
 our
 energy
 sources


are
 secure,


that
 our
 energy
 is
 sustainable,
 and
 that


it
 is
 affordable.
 the
 triilimar
 that
 I


told
 you
 about.


The
 only
 viable
 path
 for
 Europe
 to


achieve
 these
 objectives
 is
 to
 rely
 more


on
 locally
 clean
 energy.
 This
 path
 could


help
 meet
 the
 three
 goals
 of
 the


trilmna.


First,
 renewables
 alongside
 other
 clean


technologies
 for
 producing
 electricity


are
 central
 to
 any
 credible
 plan
 to


reduce
 the
 impact
 of
 climate
 change.


Second,
 renewables
 offer
 level
 of
 energy


independence
 that
 given
 our
 lack
 of


natural
 resources,
 Europe
 would
 never


reach
 with
 imported
 fossil
 fuel.
 And


third,
 as
 a
 marginal
 as
 the
 marginal


cost
 of
 renewable
 electricity
 is
 close


to
 zero,
 a
 system
 based
 largely
 on


renewables
 should
 ultimately
 bring
 down


energy
 prices.


But
 we
 all
 know
 that
 there
 is
 some


skepticism
 about
 all
 that
 and
 skepticism


as
 to
 whether
 such
 price
 reductions
 are


really
 possible
 in
 Europe
 over
 the
 short


to
 medium
 term.


And
 the
 key
 issue
 is
 that
 building
 and


operating
 a
 renewables-based
 system


involves
 significant
 additional
 expenses


that
 are
 known
 as
 the
 system
 costs
 which


are
 based
 on
 the
 on
 which
 are
 passed


onto
 the
 energy
 bills.
 So
 what
 are
 these


costs?
 Those
 system
 costs
 they
 come
 from


different
 sources.
 Some
 of
 those
 costs


are
 unavoidable
 unavoidable,
 but
 others


can
 be
 minimized
 if
 we
 are
 truly


ambitious
 with
 the
 transition.
 The


unavoidable
 costs
 include
 massive


investment
 in
 new
 generation
 capacity


and
 modernized
 grid.
 The
 European


Commission
 estimates
 that
 these
 will


require
 an
 annual
 investment
 of
 nearly


150
 billion
 euros.
 And
 that
 number
 may


even
 rise
 if
 restrictions
 on
 critical


raw
 materials
 increase
 input
 cost
 or


delay
 projects.


But
 that's
 not
 the
 only
 cost.
 And
 there


are
 other
 costs
 that
 can
 be
 minimized.


For
 instance,
 the
 costs
 related
 to
 the


inherent
 intermittency
 of
 renewables.


Intermittency
 leads
 to
 higher
 price


volatility
 which
 ultimately
 feeds
 into


higher
 average
 bills
 which
 contributes


to
 inflation
 which
 is
 a
 cause
 for


concern
 for
 a
 central
 banker.
 We
 saw


this
 in
 November
 last
 year
 when
 low
 wind


output
 across
 much
 of
 Europe
 especially


in
 Germany
 prompted
 a
 surge
 in
 gas
 fired


generation
 to
 meet
 demand.
 Electricity


prices
 jumped
 in
 several
 countries
 and


the
 effects
 were
 felt
 across
 Europe


including
 in
 uh
 some
 parts
 of
 Norway.


There
 are
 also
 costs
 associated
 with


curtailment
 when
 renewable
 output
 is


deliberately
 reduced
 to
 keep
 the
 system


balanced
 which
 often
 results
 in
 payment


to
 providers.


The
 European
 Commission
 estimates
 that


by
 2040
 we
 could
 lose
 up
 to
 10
 times


more
 renewable
 energy
 generation
 than
 we


lose
 today
 owing
 to
 grid
 constraints.


But
 this
 cost
 should
 not
 hold
 us
 back


from
 staying
 the
 course.
 And
 there
 are


three
 reasons
 why
 I'm
 optimistic
 that


Europe
 can
 overcome
 these
 challenges.


First,


while
 we
 cannot
 eliminate
 the
 cost


associated
 with
 intermittency,


we
 cannot
 control
 the
 weather.
 We
 can


substantially
 reduce
 them
 if
 we
 push


through
 with
 the
 investment
 in


generation
 capacity,
 grids
 and
 storage.


I
 was
 at
 the
 IMF
 last
 week,
 annual


meetings.
 I
 asked
 the
 head
 of
 European


department,
 if
 you
 had
 to
 make
 one


change,
 the
 first
 one
 that
 you
 would


make,
 what
 is
 it?
 Invest
 in
 grids.


Instant
 response.


One
 of
 our
 studies
 estimates
 that
 if


European
 countries
 meet
 their
 solar
 and


wind
 targets,
 electricity
 prices
 could


fall
 by
 more
 than
 a
 quarter
 by
 2030
 and


become
 less
 volatile
 owing
 to
 a
 weaker


link
 between
 electricity
 and
 gas
 prices.


Curtailment
 costs
 that
 I
 have
 just


mentioned
 would
 also
 fall
 as
 research


finds
 that
 each
 euro
 invested
 in


upgrading
 the
 electricity
 grid


translates
 into
 over€2


saved
 in
 systems
 costs.


Second,
 infrastructure
 investment
 could


be
 particularly
 effective
 in
 Europe


owing
 to
 what?
 To
 our
 geographic


diversity.


Southern
 Europe
 performs
 strongly
 in


solar
 power
 while
 northern
 and
 Atlantic


coastal
 regions
 excel
 in
 wind
 energy.


You
 have
 the
 second
 largest
 coastal


treasure
 in
 Norway
 and
 wind
 energy
 seems


particularly
 propitious
 to
 that.
 I
 know


it's
 controversial
 as
 well.
 It's


controversial
 in
 my
 country
 too.


But
 deeper
 energy
 market
 integration,


for
 example,
 through
 more
 crossber


interconnectors
 would
 let
 countries


share
 surplus
 electricity,
 smooth


fluctuations
 from
 interminent


intermittent
 sources
 and
 use
 generation


and
 grid
 capacity
 more
 efficiently.


Research
 underlines
 the
 benefits.
 Deeper


crossber
 integration
 is
 found
 to
 cut


overall
 systems
 cost
 by
 around
 9%
 which


is
 the
 equivalent
 of
 26
 billion
 annually


and
 it
 reduces
 electricity
 prices
 more


than
 isolated
 national
 approaches.
 So
 a


collective
 approach
 and
 the


interconnection
 into
 a
 grid
 system
 that


is
 more
 efficient
 is
 part
 of
 the
 answer.


Third
 element,
 the
 technology
 is
 moving


in
 our
 favor.
 Not
 only
 are
 renewable


solutions
 becoming
 much
 cheaper,
 but
 the


ability
 to
 store
 renewable
 energy


through
 periods
 of
 intermittency
 is
 also


improving
 fast.
 The
 International
 Energy


Agency
 finds
 that
 the
 cost
 of
 clean


technologies
 has
 fallen
 more
 than
 half


over
 the
 past
 decade
 and
 that
 battery


pack
 costs
 are
 now
 roughly
 a
 tenth
 of


what
 they
 were
 15
 years
 ago.


So
 while
 there
 are
 costs
 that
 we
 have
 to


reckon
 with,
 Europe
 is
 also
 well


positioned
 to
 overcome
 some
 of
 them.
 And


if
 we
 manage
 to
 quickly
 unlock
 the


investment
 needed
 to
 build
 a
 world-class


renewable
 infrastructures,
 Euro
 Europe


can
 keep
 those
 other
 cost
 while


maximizing
 the
 benefits
 of
 renewables.


So
 what
 is
 missing


as
 usual?
 Money.


How
 can
 we
 unlock
 the
 investment?


It's
 not
 that
 liquidity
 are
 short.
 It's


not
 that
 investment


are
 not
 directed
 to
 projects.


But
 I
 think
 that
 we
 policy
 makers
 and


I'm
 talking
 here
 about
 both
 fiscal


authorities
 and
 monetary
 authorities.
 We


must
 provide
 two
 things.
 First,
 the


right
 environment
 for
 financing.


If
 we
 factor
 in
 decarbonization,


industry,
 transport
 and
 energy
 supply,


the
 financing
 needs
 for
 the
 green


transition
 are
 massive,


the
 private
 sector
 will
 have
 to
 account


for
 at
 least
 twothirds
 of
 this


investment.


But
 even
 though
 Europe
 has
 ample


savings,


current
 financing
 arrangements
 are
 not


channeling
 supply
 towards
 demand.


Nearly
 four
 in
 10
 European
 firms
 see
 the


lack
 of
 investor
 willingness
 to
 finance


green
 investment
 as
 a
 very
 significant


obstacle.


So
 the
 missing
 link
 in
 our
 view
 is
 a


proper
 functioning
 capital
 market.


Debt
 and
 more
 importantly
 equity


financing
 currently
 rank
 lowest
 among


the
 funding
 sources
 that
 firms
 expect
 to


use
 for
 green
 investment.


Deepening
 and
 integrating
 EU
 capital


markets
 is
 critical
 to
 support
 the


large-scale
 investments
 that
 we
 need.


The
 good
 news
 from
 where
 I
 sit
 and
 what


I
 can
 observe
 is
 that
 there
 is
 political


momentum
 behind
 the
 capital
 market
 union


and
 it
 has
 never
 been
 greater.
 Now
 the


skeptics
 will
 say,
 "Hi,
 you've
 been


talking
 about
 it
 for
 10
 years."
 Well,
 I


can
 tell
 you
 for
 having
 witnessed
 this


for
 10
 years,
 it
 has
 never
 been
 so
 high.


It
 has
 never
 been
 so


decisive
 in
 terms
 of
 we
 need
 to
 do
 it


now.


Those
 of
 you
 who
 follow
 Chancellor
 Mertz


will
 have
 seen
 his
 comment
 from
 last


week.


One
 single
 market
 for
 capital
 union.
 He


said
 one
 single
 stock
 market
 even
 and


one
 single
 super
 supervision
 authority.


Second
 policy
 makers
 need
 to
 create
 a


predictable
 environment
 for
 investment.


Investment
 will
 not
 step
 forward
 if
 the


green
 transition
 is
 clouded
 by


uncertainty
 especially
 if
 there
 are
 also


growing
 push
 back


against
 green
 initiatives
 in
 other
 parts


of
 the
 world.
 So
 we
 must
 reduce


uncertainty
 where
 it
 is
 possible.
 So


creating
 the
 right
 environment
 begins


with
 well
 three
 elements
 again


credibility,


speed
 and
 confidence.


Following
 through
 on
 existing
 green


targets
 and
 maintaining
 a
 stable
 carbon


price
 very
 important
 for
 the


credibility.
 Wavering
 on
 those


commitments
 would
 risk
 chilling


investment
 just
 when
 we
 need
 it
 the


most.


Credibility
 must
 be
 matched
 by
 speed.


Across
 Europe,
 investment
 investors
 face


slow
 and
 fragmented
 permitting


procedures
 that
 delay
 progress.


In
 some
 member
 states
 in
 Europe,


completing
 the
 permitting
 process
 can


take
 up
 to
 five
 years
 for
 utility
 scale


solar
 photovoltaic
 projects
 and
 up
 to


nine
 years
 for
 onshore
 wind.
 We
 must


shorten
 these
 timelines
 if
 the
 EU
 is
 to


meet
 its
 green
 goals.


Finally,
 policy
 makers
 must
 build


confidence
 in
 future
 electricity
 demand.


For
 instance,
 in
 Europe,
 electricity


still
 faces
 higher
 taxes
 than
 gas,


discouraging
 electrification.


And
 while
 this
 gap
 will
 narrow
 as
 carbon


pricing
 is
 extended
 to
 heating
 fuels,


governments
 can
 already
 act
 by
 lowering


electricity
 taxes


and
 moving
 it
 to
 other
 energy
 sources.


Central
 banks
 can
 also
 contribute
 to


this
 confidence
 because
 obviously
 for


investors
 in
 green
 technology,
 in
 green


projects,
 in
 transition
 measures,
 the


predictability
 of
 price
 stability
 is


vital.


much
 more
 so
 in
 that
 sector
 of


investment
 than
 in
 others


to
 deliver
 on
 those
 policy
 makers
 have


to
 be
 courageous


and
 I
 hope
 this
 will
 not
 be
 in
 short


supply
 because
 we
 need
 a
 lot
 of
 it
 so


let
 me
 conclude
 Europe's
 recent
 energy


crisis
 has
 revealed
 a
 hard
 truth
 our


dependence
 on
 imported
 fossil
 fuels
 is


no
 longer
 sustainable
 an
 accelerating


climate
 crisis
 makes
 this
 lesson
 even


clearer.


But
 we're
 not
 a
 prisoner
 of
 the
 dilemma


of
 the
 trilmna.
 We
 have
 the
 agency
 to


shape
 our
 future
 here.
 Renewables
 offer


the
 clearest
 path
 to
 minimize
 the


trade-off
 between
 energy
 policy
 goals
 of


security,
 sustainability,
 and


affordability.
 And
 pushing
 ahead
 with


renewable
 is
 also
 strongly
 supported
 by


citizens.


Listen
 to
 that
 number.
 Nearly
 nine
 in
 10


Europeans
 want
 the
 EU
 to
 expand


renewable
 energy.


Some
 of
 the
 cost
 associated
 with
 the


transition,
 such
 as
 the
 required


investment,
 will
 be
 unavoidable.
 But
 if


we
 create
 the
 ideal
 conditions
 in
 which


that
 investment
 can
 flourish,
 we
 can


ensure
 that
 the
 transition
 remains


cost-effective.


Our
 regreted
 anthropologist
 Jane


Goodall,
 who
 sadly
 passed
 away
 this


month,
 reminded
 us


She
 said
 what
 you
 do
 makes
 a
 difference


and
 you
 have
 to
 decide
 what
 difference


you
 want
 to
 make.
 So
 Europe
 must
 now


decide
 either
 we
 remain
 with
 that


unsustainable
 and
 expensive
 static
 quo


or
 we
 create
 an
 environment
 that
 can


unlock
 the
 investment
 needed
 for


sustainable,
 secure
 and
 affordable


energy.
 I
 hope
 we
 have
 that
 courage
 and


that
 determination.
 Thank
 you.


Thank
 you
 so
 much,
 Madame
 President,
 for


an
 outstanding
 speech.
 The
 future
 of


European
 energy
 is
 green
 and
 renewable


and
 perhaps
 helped
 a
 little
 bit
 along


the
 way
 uh
 by
 us
 uh
 up
 here.
 And
 I'm
 not


talking
 about
 Norwegian
 gas,
 which


everyone
 knows,
 but
 about
 the


investments
 that
 we
 recently
 did
 in


European
 grid
 structure.


Now,
 I
 would
 like
 to
 welcome
 former
 Vice


President
 Al
 Gore
 to
 the
 stage.
 Mr.
 Gore


has
 worked
 to
 raise
 awareness
 about


climate
 issues
 for
 many,
 many
 years,
 for


which
 he
 was
 awarded
 the
 Nobel
 Peace


Prize
 in
 2007.


And
 as
 co-founder
 and
 chairman
 of


Generation
 Investment
 Management,
 you


continue
 to
 be
 at
 the
 vanguard
 of


efforts
 to
 inform
 the
 world
 about
 the


dangers
 posed
 by
 climate
 change.
 So
 we


are
 delighted
 to
 have
 you
 at
 our


conference
 today.
 Please
 welcome
 to
 the


floor.


Thank
 you.
 Thank
 you.


Thank
 you
 very
 much.
 um
 your
 royal


highness
 crown
 prince
 Hulkon.
 Thank
 you


very
 much.
 I
 look
 forward
 to
 meeting


with
 you
 later.
 And
 thank
 you,
 by
 the


way,
 for
 your
 own
 personal
 commitment
 on


the
 climate
 issue.
 It's
 quite
 important


to
 Eda
 Waldenbotch,
 the
 governor
 and


chair
 of
 Nores
 Bank.
 Nikolai
 Tangen,


thank
 you
 for
 inviting
 me,
 Nikolai.
 I
 am


honored
 to
 be
 here.
 Especially,
 it
 is
 an


honor
 to
 share
 the
 stage
 with
 Christine


Lagard.
 That
 was
 a
 brilliant
 speech


really
 and
 truly
 it
 was
 out
 outstanding


and
 um
 Sher
 Christine
 we
 have
 become


very
 very
 close
 friends
 over
 the
 years


and
 it's
 an
 honor
 to
 be
 here
 with
 you


and
 Kristen
 Halverson
 thank
 you
 very


much
 look
 forward
 to
 the
 conversation


after
 these
 remarks.
 It's
 a
 great


pleasure
 to
 be
 back
 here
 in
 Oslo.
 I've


been
 here
 for
 three
 days
 and
 one
 of
 the


first
 questions
 I've
 received
 uh
 from


friends
 that
 I
 meet
 here
 is
 about
 Donald


Trump.
 I
 don't
 intend
 to
 talk
 about


Donald
 Trump
 today,
 but
 I
 met
 with
 a


friend
 who
 is
 a
 Norwegian
 businessman


who
 does
 business
 in
 the
 United
 States,


and
 I
 asked
 him
 how
 he
 felt
 about


Trump's
 policies
 and
 decisions.
 And
 he


said,
 "I
 feel
 fine."
 And
 there
 was


something
 about
 the
 way
 he
 said
 it
 that


reminded
 me
 of
 a
 story
 that
 I
 heard


actually
 40
 years
 ago.
 I
 come
 from


Nashville,
 Tennessee.
 the
 home
 of


country
 music
 and
 the
 Grand
 Old
 Opry.


And
 back
 in
 those
 days,
 they
 had
 a


comedian
 named
 Cousin
 Mini
 Pearl
 who


wore
 a
 calico
 dress
 and
 a
 straw
 hat
 with


the
 price
 tag
 still
 hanging
 from
 the


hat.
 And
 she
 she
 had
 homespun
 rural


humor.
 And
 she
 told
 a
 story.
 I
 was


driving
 back
 to
 my
 farm
 after
 a
 day
 of


town
 hall
 meetings
 as
 a
 young


congressman.


and
 she
 told
 about
 a
 farmer
 who
 was


involved
 in
 an
 accident
 and
 he
 sued
 the


other
 driver
 for
 damages.
 And
 when
 the


other
 driver's
 lawyer
 had
 the
 chance
 to


cross-examine
 this
 farmer,
 he
 said,


"Now,
 isn't
 it
 true
 that
 immediately


after
 this
 accident,
 you
 said,
 "I
 feel


fine."
 And
 the
 farmer
 said,
 "Well,
 it's


not
 that
 simple.
 You
 see,
 I
 was
 driving


my
 cow
 to
 town
 in
 the
 back
 of
 my
 truck,


and
 this
 fell
 came
 driving
 across
 the


center
 of
 the
 highway,
 and
 the
 lawyer


said,
 "I
 object,
 your
 honor.
 We
 don't


want
 to
 hear
 a
 long
 involved
 story.
 Just


answer
 the
 question,
 yes
 or
 no.
 Did
 you


or
 did
 you
 not
 say
 immediately
 after
 the


accident,
 I
 feel
 fine."


Farmer
 said,
 "Well,
 I
 was
 leading
 up
 to


that.
 You
 see,
 I
 was
 driving
 my
 cow
 to


town
 in
 the
 back
 of
 my
 truck
 and
 this


fella
 came
 driving
 across
 the
 center


line
 and
 ran
 right
 smack
 dab
 into
 my


truck
 and
 knocked
 it
 over
 and
 threw
 me


out
 and
 threw
 the
 cow
 out.
 I
 was
 on
 one


side
 and
 the
 cow
 was
 on
 the
 other
 and


the
 policeman
 came
 up
 and
 took
 one
 look


at
 that
 cow
 and
 said,
 "She
 is


suffering."
 Pulled
 out
 his
 gun
 and
 shot


her
 right
 between
 the
 eyes.


Came
 around
 to
 my
 side
 of
 the
 truck
 and


said,
 "How
 do
 you
 feel?"
 And
 uh


so


there
 was
 something
 about
 the


businessman's
 comment
 that
 reminded
 me


of
 that


story.


Well,
 there's
 no
 doubt
 that
 we're
 at
 a
 a


critical
 moment
 in
 the
 global


sustainability
 transition
 and
 it's


always
 faced
 significant
 headwinds.
 But


as
 uh
 uh
 President
 Lagarde
 has
 very


eloquently
 said,
 those
 headwinds
 have


become
 stronger
 and
 everybody
 knows
 it.


Uh
 at
 at
 my
 investment
 firm,
 Generation


Investment
 Manager,
 we
 do
 an
 annual


sustainability
 trends
 report.
 This
 is


the
 ninth
 year.
 We
 couldn't
 find
 any


place
 where
 it
 was
 all
 put
 together
 and


so
 we've
 tried
 to
 do
 it
 each
 year.
 A
 and


our
 our
 key
 findings
 uh
 this
 year
 are


that
 um
 there
 is
 some
 pause
 but
 there's


also
 reason
 for
 uh
 some
 good
 feelings.


You
 know
 10
 years
 ago
 the
 projections


were
 that
 we
 would
 um
 reach
 a
 3.6°
 C


increase
 in
 temperatures.
 That
 has
 now


been
 cut
 down
 to
 2.7.
 So
 we've
 shaved


off
 nearly
 1%
 but
 it's
 not
 nearly


enough.
 And
 since
 2001
 we
 have
 more
 or


less
 stalled
 out
 at
 that
 level.
 The


estimated
 temperature
 rise
 under
 current


national
 policies
 has
 not
 moved
 in
 four


years.
 And
 we
 all
 know
 the
 reasons.


There
 is
 a
 huge
 political
 push
 back
 that


has
 made
 it
 harder
 and
 harder
 for


countries
 to
 adopt
 new
 policies
 and


improve
 their
 climate
 uh
 ambition.


You
 know,
 uh,
 last
 week
 the
 Swedish


Nobel
 Committee
 award
 I
 by
 the
 way
 much


prefer
 the
 Norwegian
 Nobel
 Committee.


Uh,
 but
 the
 Swedish
 committee
 awarded


its
 economics
 prize
 this
 year
 to
 three


distinguished
 economists.
 Half
 to
 Joel


Moer
 and
 half
 to
 two
 of
 his
 colleagues.


And
 I
 think
 it's
 worth
 reflecting


because
 on
 what
 they
 are
 honored
 for


finding
 because
 it's
 one
 of
 the
 more


consequential
 awards
 uh
 in
 the
 last


several
 decades
 in
 my
 opinion.
 Mocher


who
 has
 had
 a
 narrative
 throughine
 for


decades
 makes
 the
 point
 that
 innovation


is
 the
 real
 key
 uh
 to
 economic
 uh


prosperity
 and
 growth.
 But
 his
 two


colleagues
 have
 pointed
 out
 that
 one
 of


the
 factors
 that
 stifles
 innovation
 is


when
 powerful
 incumbent
 industries
 that


have
 a
 reason
 to
 fear
 the
 changes
 that


come
 with
 innovation
 might
 have
 gathered


too
 much
 political
 power
 uh
 and
 as
 a


result
 are
 able
 to
 stop
 the
 introduction


of
 innovations.


And
 the
 fossil
 fuel
 industry
 is


significantly
 more
 efficient
 at


capturing
 politicians
 than
 capturing


emissions.
 Uh
 and
 as
 a
 result,
 they
 have


used
 the
 accumulated
 political
 power
 to


push
 back
 and
 to
 blunt
 the
 progress
 that


the
 world


needs
 very
 seriously.
 We
 are
 continuing


to
 put
 175
 million
 tons
 of
 man-made


global
 warming
 pollution
 into
 the


troposphere
 every
 day.
 And
 it


accumulates
 to
 the
 point
 where
 it


presently


traps
 as
 much
 extra
 heat
 each
 day
 as


would
 be
 released
 by
 750,000


first
 generation
 atomic
 bombs
 exploding


on
 the
 earth's
 surface
 every
 24
 hours.


Uh
 this
 is
 causing
 a
 massive
 disruption


of
 the
 water
 cycle.
 it
 is
 creating
 uh


massive
 consequences
 that
 are
 getting


worse
 by
 the
 day.
 And
 as
 we
 seek
 to


restart
 the
 progress
 that
 stalled
 out
 um


in
 2021,


we
 also
 confront
 a
 wave
 of
 right-wing


populism
 that
 has
 at
 best
 complicated


politics
 around
 the
 world.
 And
 we
 have


seen
 a
 tumultuous
 few
 years
 with
 the


sadistic
 invasion
 of
 Ukraine
 by
 Russia,


with
 the
 interruption
 of
 gas
 supplies,


as
 President
 Lagarde
 has
 eloquently


described,
 the
 pandemic,
 which
 we
 want


to
 forget
 quickly,
 but
 really
 royal


politics
 in
 quite
 a
 significant
 number


of
 ways.
 And
 lest
 we
 forget,
 we
 are


still
 coping
 with
 the
 hyper


globalization
 that
 followed
 China's


admission
 to
 the
 WTO
 with
 the


centrifugal
 redistribution
 of
 many


higher
 wage
 jobs
 to
 low-wage
 venues


around
 the
 world
 and
 an
 increase
 in


hyper
 inequality
 that
 has
 caused
 a
 lot


of
 dissatisfaction
 that
 infects
 the


politics
 of
 every
 nation.


So
 that
 lack
 of
 progress
 is
 why
 this


year
 is
 so
 critical.
 And
 in
 less
 than
 a


month,
 the
 nations
 of
 the
 world
 will


meet
 in
 Brazil
 for
 COP
 30,
 the
 annual


UNled
 international
 climate


negotiations.
 And
 10
 years
 ago
 in
 Paris,


195
 countries
 agreed
 to
 get
 to
 net
 zero


by
 2050.
 Only
 one
 nation
 has
 withdrawn.


I'm
 embarrassed
 to
 remind
 you
 that
 it's


my
 nation.
 But
 I
 also
 want
 to
 note
 a


significant
 mathematical
 equation
 that


some
 people
 seem
 to
 forget
 episodically.


195
 minus
 one
 does
 not
 equal
 zero.
 Other


nations
 are
 stepping
 up
 and
 filling
 the


gap.
 uh
 and
 the
 European
 European
 Union


is
 playing
 a
 leadership
 role
 and
 no


nation
 is
 providing
 as
 much
 leadership


truly
 as
 Norway
 is
 providing.
 Uh
 and


unfortunately
 uh
 the
 election
 of


President
 Trump
 has
 complicated
 this


quite
 uh
 significantly.


But
 of
 course
 and
 his
 actions
 are


influencing
 some
 other
 nations
 which


have
 slowed
 down
 their
 own
 progress.
 But


no
 other
 nation
 has
 withdrawn.
 We
 are


seeing
 new
 national
 plans
 come
 out.
 So


far
 they
 are
 much
 weaker
 than
 they
 need


to
 be.
 And
 the
 weakness
 of
 these
 plans


is
 worrisome
 but
 not
 entirely
 surprising


because
 if
 the
 largest
 emitter
 of
 global


warming
 pollution
 in
 history
 uh
 is
 not


participating
 in
 solving
 this
 collective


problem,
 then
 that
 can
 damage
 the


motivation
 of
 other
 countries
 uh
 to


tackle
 it
 themselves.
 But
 Norway
 is
 one


of
 the
 nations
 poised
 to
 usher
 in
 a


reversal
 of
 what
 I
 believe
 is
 destined


to
 be
 a
 short-lived
 trend
 of


backsliding.
 In
 submitting
 a
 new
 climate


plan
 ahead
 of
 COP
 30,
 Norway
 has


indicated
 that
 action
 is
 still
 on
 the


agenda.
 And
 of
 course,
 as
 always,
 the


devil
 is
 in
 the
 details.
 But
 I
 want
 to


applaud
 Norway's
 robust
 and
 ongoing


commitment
 to
 helping
 developing
 nations


adapt
 to
 the
 changes
 that
 can
 no
 longer


be
 avoided.
 In
 fact,
 Norway's
 track


record
 of
 overseas
 development


assistance
 uh
 and
 other
 aid
 is
 truly


remarkable.
 You've
 routinely
 committed


more
 than
 1%
 of
 your
 national
 income
 to


these
 purposes.
 No
 other
 country
 I'm


aware
 of
 can
 match
 that
 record.
 My
 own


country
 is
 closer
 to
 a
 quarter
 of
 a


percentage
 point.
 And
 that's
 before
 the


current
 administration
 started
 slashing


foreign
 aid.
 And
 Norway
 has
 committed
 to


doubling
 its
 climate
 finance
 by
 2026


compared
 with
 the
 2020
 figure
 and
 has


already
 achieved
 this
 goal
 for
 the
 past


two
 years.
 Norway
 has
 also
 played
 a


stalwart
 role
 in
 saving
 helping
 to
 save


the
 world's
 tropical
 forests


contributing
 the
 equivalent
 of
 many


billions
 of
 US
 dollars
 to
 that
 cause.
 It


is
 important
 to
 recognize,
 however,
 that


government-to-government
 aid,
 as


essential
 as
 it
 is,
 uh,
 pales
 in


comparison
 to
 the
 needed
 access
 to


private
 capital
 in
 order
 to
 finance
 the


energy
 transition.


One
 of
 the
 most
 hopeful
 and
 optimistic


trends
 of
 the
 last
 few
 years,
 last
 year


for
 example,
 if
 you
 look
 at
 all
 of
 the


new
 electricity
 generation
 installed


worldwide
 everywhere
 in
 the
 world,
 many


are
 surprised
 to
 hear
 that
 the


percentage
 represented
 by
 renewable


energy
 was
 93%.


And
 the
 International
 Energy
 Agency
 has


projected
 that
 in
 the
 years
 ahead,
 it's


going
 to
 exceed
 95%


renewable
 energy.


But
 where
 did
 the
 money
 come
 from
 to


install
 that
 93%
 renewable
 energy?
 85%


of
 the
 money
 came
 from
 private
 capital,


only
 15%
 from
 government
 support.


However,
 there
 is
 an
 unequal


malistribution


of
 access
 to
 capital.
 There
 is
 what
 the


economists
 call
 a
 home
 bias.
 And
 there


is
 also
 a
 reluctance
 on
 the
 part
 of


investors
 and
 lenders
 to
 commit
 to


capital
 in
 uh
 infusions
 into
 developing


countries
 where
 there
 is
 a
 noticeable


risk
 of
 currency
 valuation
 on
 a
 sudden


basis
 which
 might
 cause
 them
 to
 lose


their
 money.
 Of
 course,
 they're
 going
 to


be
 concerned.
 uh
 access
 to
 courts
 for


the
 enforcement
 of
 contracts,
 continuity


of
 government,
 continuity
 of
 government


u
 corruption
 in
 some
 areas.
 All
 of
 these


factors
 have
 raised
 the
 interest
 rates


for
 developing
 countries
 two
 to
 three


times
 higher
 than
 what
 Norway
 or
 the


United
 States
 would
 pay.
 Uh
 and
 as
 a


result,
 they
 have
 been
 deprived
 of


access
 to
 capital.
 Take
 Africa
 for


example.
 Africa
 has
 60%
 of
 the
 prime


solar
 energy
 potential
 of
 the
 entire


world.
 But
 Africa
 has
 fewer
 solar
 panels


installed
 than
 the
 single
 US
 state
 of


Florida.
 That
 is
 a
 disgraceful


commentary
 on
 the
 current
 system
 for
 the


allocation
 of
 capital
 around
 the
 world.


Developing


countries
 as
 a
 whole
 are
 getting
 a
 tiny


share
 of
 the
 capital
 necessary
 to


finance
 the
 energy
 transition
 and
 the


larger
 sustainability
 transition.
 They


are
 getting
 43%
 of
 the
 new
 investment
 in


fossil
 fuel
 development,
 virtually
 all


of
 it
 for
 exporting
 fossil
 fuel


resources
 from
 developing
 countries
 to


the
 wealthy
 countries.
 My
 friends
 in
 the


activist
 community
 in
 developing


countries
 call
 it
 fossil
 fuel


colonialism.


And
 of
 course,
 the
 resource
 curse
 that


countries
 like
 Nigeria
 have
 experienced


is
 to
 be
 avoided,
 especially
 now
 that
 we


have
 a
 superior
 source
 of
 energy
 in


renewable
 energy,
 both
 solar
 uh
 and


wind.
 and
 the
 cost
 of
 solar
 and
 wind
 uh


continue
 to
 go
 down
 uh
 very
 very
 uh


impressively.


Now
 this
 nation
 has
 been
 as
 I've
 said
 a


very
 impressive
 leader
 in
 all
 of
 these


matters
 and
 Norway's
 power
 sector
 is


already
 one
 of
 the
 cleanest
 in
 the


world.
 98%
 of
 Norway's
 electricity


capacity
 is
 carbonf
 free
 and
 of
 course


you
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 hydro
 power
 but
 you've


made
 the
 right
 choices
 a
 and
 we
 are


seeing
 an
 inflection
 point
 as
 the
 cost


of
 solar
 in
 particular
 reaches


unprecedented
 low
 levels
 take
 Pakistan


for
 example
 they
 are
 installing
 cheap


Chinese
 solar
 panels
 at
 a
 record
 rate
 in


some
 areas
 of
 Pakistan
 it
 is
 now
 not


uncommon
 for
 a
 bride's
 dowy
 to
 be
 three


panels
 and
 an
 inverter.
 Uh
 and
 that's
 a


true
 story
 and
 we
 are
 seeing
 this
 take


off
 in
 so
 many
 uh
 countries.
 Uh
 imports


of
 solar
 panels
 are
 rising
 very
 quickly


not
 only
 in
 the
 developing
 countries
 of


Africa
 uh
 but
 in
 Southeast
 Asia
 and


elsewhere
 in
 the
 world.
 And
 when
 solar


panels
 are
 coupled
 with
 batteries,
 then


the
 transformation
 really
 begins
 to
 take


hold.
 In
 my
 nation,
 the
 California
 grid


is
 getting
 20%
 of
 its
 power
 in
 the
 early


evening
 from
 batteries
 charged
 with


sunshine
 earlier
 in
 the
 day.
 I
 flew
 here


from
 Australia
 and
 South
 Australia
 gets


30%
 of
 its
 power
 from
 batteries
 in
 the


early
 evening.
 Their
 goal
 is
 to
 reach


100%.
 And
 the
 experts
 believe
 they


definitely
 will
 reach
 that
 goal.
 So
 the


second
 largest
 market
 for
 fossil
 fuels


after
 electricity
 generation
 is


transportation.
 Uh
 and
 worldwide
 the


sales
 volume
 of
 electric
 cars
 is
 up
 more


than
 30%
 this
 year.
 Uh
 will
 likely
 be
 a


quarter
 of
 all
 cars
 sold
 worldwide
 uh
 in


2025.


And
 Norway
 once
 again
 is
 the
 global


leader.
 Cars
 with
 plugs
 have
 been
 nor


more
 than
 90%
 of
 the
 market
 for
 years


already.
 And
 the
 figures
 for
 the
 month


of
 September
 just
 came
 in.
 98.3%


of
 all
 new
 car
 sales
 in
 Norway
 are


electric.
 So
 I
 think
 you
 can
 check
 that


box.
 Norway,
 thank
 you
 very
 much
 for


your
 leadership.
 Your
 national
 fleet
 is


already
 one-third
 electric
 on
 its
 way


toward
 100%.


And
 the
 rest
 of
 us
 can
 look
 around


Norway
 right
 now
 and
 begin
 to
 see
 the


start
 of
 a
 post
 oil
 future.
 But
 there
 is


a
 huge
 geopolitical
 challenge
 associated


with
 both
 the
 solar
 boom,
 the
 battery


boom,
 uh,
 and
 the
 electric


transportation
 boom.
 China
 has
 made


decisions
 that
 have
 allowed
 it
 to


dominate
 the
 market
 in
 all
 of
 these


sustainability
 focused
 industries
 uh
 in


the
 future.
 During
 the
 month
 of
 May
 this


year,
 China
 installed
 as
 much
 new
 solar


electric
 capacity
 every
 day
 as
 would


have
 been
 provided
 by
 opening
 three
 1


gawatt
 nuclear
 plants
 every
 day,
 30
 days


in
 a
 row.
 It's
 difficult
 to
 imagine
 any


other
 country
 accomplishing
 that
 and
 in


every
 one
 of
 the
 related
 fields
 they


have
 made
 an
 in
 a
 decision
 to
 move


aggressively
 to
 dominate
 those


industries.
 So
 we
 must
 respond
 to
 that


challenge.
 China
 seems
 to
 think
 that


they
 really
 will
 make
 the
 21st
 century
 a


Chinese
 century
 and
 provide
 leadership


for
 the
 entire
 world
 perhaps
 in
 the


geopolitical
 sphere
 as
 well.
 I
 don't


think
 they
 can.
 I
 don't
 think
 the
 world


will
 follow
 China
 because
 the
 world
 does


not
 generally
 speaking
 agree
 with
 the


values
 of
 China.
 We
 value
 freedom
 even


though
 it
 seems
 at
 times
 to
 be
 under


assault.
 But
 uh
 let
 me
 also
 made
 make


the
 point
 that
 suspicion
 of
 Chinese


motives
 might
 well
 be
 warranted
 on
 many


fronts
 including
 the
 security
 risks
 that


they
 pose
 to
 NATO
 countries
 and
 European


countries
 more
 generally.
 The
 Chinese


economy
 is
 itself
 a
 long
 way
 from
 clean.


But
 we
 have
 to
 recognize
 that
 what
 they


have
 accomplished
 with
 the
 energy


transition.
 Uh
 Norway
 uh
 is
 inspiring


countries
 around
 the
 world.
 Uh
 we
 have


to
 respond
 and
 ma
 to
 and
 manage
 China's


dominance
 of
 these
 technologies.
 And
 yet


we
 also
 need
 to
 recognize
 that
 since


Paris,
 the
 direction
 of
 travel
 for
 the


world
 economy
 has
 been
 clear.
 Companies


that
 want
 to
 continue
 to
 compete
 for


global
 markets
 will
 have
 to
 make


sustainability
 central
 to
 their
 business


operations.
 The
 United
 States
 uh
 is
 not


participating
 in
 the
 way
 that
 it
 should.


But
 I
 do
 believe
 that
 change
 is
 coming


in
 my
 country
 uh
 as
 well.
 So
 despite
 the


political
 difficulties
 of
 the
 moment,
 we


cannot
 let
 the
 ambition
 for
 a
 better


world
 wither
 away
 on
 our
 watch.
 So,
 let


me
 close
 by
 citing
 Norway's
 celebrated


playwright
 Henrik
 Ipsson.
 And
 I
 am
 not


going
 to
 be
 brave
 enough


as
 as
 Christine
 was
 to
 even
 attempt
 to


say
 it
 in
 Norwegian.
 Oh
 jeez,
 Christine.


At
 a
 time
 when
 we've
 seen
 institutions


of
 all
 kinds,
 but
 particularly
 financial


institutions,
 back
 away
 from
 their


earlier
 climate
 commitments,
 I'm


reminded
 of
 Ipsson's
 The
 Master
 Builder


and
 the
 quote
 castles
 in
 the
 air.
 They


are
 so
 easy
 to
 take
 refuge
 in
 and
 so


easy
 to
 build,
 too.
 But
 I'd
 like
 to


remind
 us
 of
 another
 passage
 which
 to
 me


demonstrates
 our
 collective
 task
 from


Mandon.
 He
 wrote,
 "A
 thousand
 words


can't
 make
 the
 mark.
 A
 single
 deed
 will


leave."
 So,
 the
 time
 has
 come
 for
 all
 of


us
 to
 summon
 our
 strength
 and
 ignore
 our


critics,
 uh,
 turn
 our
 words
 into
 deeds


that
 will
 collectively
 safeguard
 the


future
 of
 human
 civilization.
 We
 have


everything
 we
 need.
 The
 International


Energy
 Agency
 tells
 us
 the
 technologies


are
 there
 for
 65%


of
 the
 way
 to
 reducing
 to
 net
 zero.


Proven
 business
 models
 are
 already


known.
 We
 have
 clear
 line
 of
 sight
 to


the
 other
 35%.


Every
 morallybased
 challenge
 that


humanity
 has
 faced
 has
 gone
 through


periods
 when
 the
 advocates
 felt
 despair.


the
 abolition
 of
 slavery,
 women's


suffrage,
 ending
 apartheid
 in
 South


Africa,
 it
 seemed
 at
 times
 impossible.


As
 the
 late
 man
 Nelson
 Mandela
 once


said,
 "It
 always
 seems
 impossible
 until


it's
 done."
 And
 when
 the
 underbrush
 of


argumentation
 is
 cleared
 away
 and
 the


central
 issue
 is
 revealed
 to
 be
 a
 choice


between
 right
 and
 wrong,
 then
 at
 a
 very


deep
 level,
 the
 outcome
 becomes


forordained.


The
 only
 thing
 some
 people
 think
 we
 have


in
 short
 supply
 is
 political
 will.
 But


please
 always
 remember
 that
 political


will
 is
 itself
 a
 renewable
 resource.


Thank
 you.


Thank
 you.
 I'm
 going
 to
 stay
 here
 and


then


[Applause]


Thank
 you
 very
 much.
 Thank
 you
 very


much.
 You
 have
 given
 us
 a
 lot
 to
 think


about
 um
 both
 about
 the
 challenges
 in


the
 world
 but
 also
 about
 the
 hopes
 uh


the
 technologies
 moving
 forward
 and


perhaps
 I
 will
 remember
 the
 most
 the


will
 and
 the
 determination
 to
 get
 ahead.


That
 is
 what's
 going
 to
 change
 make


change.
 So
 now
 you
 are
 already
 taking


the
 stage.
 Uh
 and
 to
 moderate
 this
 uh


conversation
 I
 have
 the
 pleasure
 to


introduce
 Kristen
 Halverin
 as
 director


of
 uh
 CISO
 uh
 the
 climate
 resource


center
 here
 uh
 in
 Oslo
 and
 Kristen
 has


also
 as
 many
 of
 you
 will
 know
 served
 as


Norway's
 minister
 of
 finance.
 So
 welcome


to
 you
 Kristen
 and
 I
 just
 leave
 the
 word


to
 you.


>> Thank
 you
 so
 much.
 Thank
 you
 so
 much
 and


thank
 you
 to
 Madame
 Lagor
 and


Madame
 Lag
 and
 Mr.
 Gore.
 Yeah.
 So,
 that


was
 a
 mistake
 on
 the
 first
 U
 sentence.


H
 I
 I've
 been
 really
 looking
 forward
 to


this,
 but
 I
 didn't
 know
 that
 you
 were


going
 to
 quote
 Ipsson
 and
 Olavo.
 That


was
 really
 impressive
 to
 the
 audience


and
 we
 know
 that
 you
 are
 well
 prepared.


And
 I
 have
 a
 long
 list
 of
 questions,
 but


I
 think
 I'll
 try
 to
 just
 boil
 it
 down
 to


one
 main
 question
 because
 you've
 both
 um


told
 us
 what
 is
 needed
 and
 we
 know
 what


is
 needed
 and
 we
 know
 that
 we
 are
 going


in
 the
 right
 direction
 both
 in
 Europe


not
 that
 much
 in
 US
 but
 it
 is
 limited


how
 much
 damage
 Trump
 can
 do.


>> But
 we
 need
 to
 speed
 up.
 So
 what
 should


we
 do
 to
 speed
 up?
 Madame
 Lallet,
 first


>> allow
 me
 to
 look
 at
 it
 from
 my
 my


limited
 angle
 which
 is
 that
 of
 a
 of
 a


central
 banker
 and
 one
 concerned
 about


the
 movement
 of
 capital
 in
 the
 in
 the
 in


the
 European
 Union
 which
 was
 one
 of
 the


four
 freedom
 of
 circulation
 that
 was


agreed
 between
 all
 the
 European


partners.
 We
 have
 to
 make
 sure
 that


private
 sector
 money
 I
 mean
 Al
 was
 very


eloquent
 in
 saying
 what
 is
 it
 90%
 of
 85%


of
 the
 necessary
 investment
 was
 financed


by
 the
 private
 sector.
 Private
 sector


has
 to
 feel
 confident
 and
 encouraged
 in


investing
 in
 those
 elements
 of
 the


transition
 and
 they're
 not
 just
 you
 know


narrowmindedly
 defined.
 There's
 a
 whole


range
 of
 sectors
 that
 have
 to
 benefit


from
 the
 transition.
 So
 policy
 makers


have
 to
 facilitate
 that
 accelerate
 it
 as


much
 as
 possible.
 I
 think
 that
 has
 sort


of
 cherry
 on
 the
 cakes
 which
 would
 not


be
 irrelevant
 is
 making
 sure
 that
 there


is
 the
 right
 taxation
 in
 the
 place
 where


you
 want
 to
 encourage
 or
 discourage.
 So


I
 referred
 in
 my
 speech
 to
 you
 know


taxing
 alternative
 sources
 rather
 than


electricity
 sources.
 I
 would
 say
 that


encouraging
 equity
 investment
 rather


than
 debt
 would
 also
 be
 necessary
 in


order
 to
 you
 know
 have
 stable
 and


longerterm
 investment
 which
 is
 needed
 in


in
 the
 green
 uh
 sector.
 So
 on
 in
 from
 my


corner
 I
 think
 accelerating
 speeding
 up


simplifying
 access
 to
 from
 private


capital
 to
 a
 market
 where
 green


investment
 are
 encouraged
 by
 uh
 the


fiscal
 side
 would
 be
 would
 be
 first


priority
 together
 with
 you
 know
 in
 terms


of
 where
 the
 money
 is
 invested.
 I
 would


repeat
 grids,
 grids,
 grids
 in
 order
 to


address
 the
 cost
 that
 can
 be
 reduced.


>> Let
 let
 me
 uh
 endorse
 uh
 uh
 President


Lagard's
 comment
 about
 the
 priority
 that


should
 be
 assigned
 to
 improving
 the


grids.
 Um
 this
 is
 true
 in
 almost
 every


country.
 When
 the
 millennium
 turned
 uh
 a


few
 years
 ago,
 the
 National
 Academy
 of


Engineering
 in
 the
 United
 States


conducted
 a
 survey
 to
 identify
 the


number
 one
 engineering
 achievement
 of


the
 20th
 century.
 And
 the
 answer
 was


America's
 electricity
 grid.
 But
 only
 a


few
 years
 later,
 it
 became
 apparent
 that


the
 key
 part
 of
 that
 phrase
 was
 in
 the


20th
 century
 because
 it's
 no
 longer
 a


one-way
 transmission.
 It
 is
 a
 a
 two-way


and
 multi-way
 transition
 with
 grid


storage
 uh
 widely
 distributed
 throughout


the
 grid.
 Requires
 a
 lot
 of
 software.
 It


requires
 a
 lot
 of
 innovation.


I
 think
 this
 is
 going
 on
 in
 in
 the


United
 States
 in
 spite
 of
 Trump.
 There's


a
 boom
 in
 renewable
 energy
 investment


right
 now
 in
 the
 United
 States.
 Some
 of


it
 is
 driven
 by
 the
 prospective
 uh


retirement
 of
 certain
 incentives
 at
 the


end
 of
 the
 year,
 but
 it's
 mainly
 driven


by
 the
 economic
 superiority
 of
 these


sources.
 And
 may
 I
 remind
 you
 that
 when


Donald
 Trump
 was
 president
 for
 four


years,
 the
 first
 time
 around,
 what


happened
 during
 those
 four
 years?
 Um,


solar
 energy
 doubled,
 electric
 car
 sales


doubled,
 clean
 energy
 investment


tripled,
 coal
 use
 declined
 by
 more
 than


20%.
 Why?
 Because
 the
 economic
 realities


are
 favoring
 this
 energy
 transition.
 If


I
 could
 give
 you
 a
 visual
 metaphor
 that


to
 me
 describes
 what's
 going
 on
 in
 the


world
 and
 in
 the
 US,
 there's
 a
 big
 wheel


turning
 in
 the
 right
 direction
 and


little
 wheels
 within
 it
 turning
 in
 the


opposite
 direction.
 But
 even
 those


little
 wheels
 are
 being
 moved
 inexraably


toward
 where
 we're
 going.
 We're
 not


moving
 fast
 enough.
 We
 have
 to


accelerate.
 How
 do
 we
 do
 it?


In
 order
 to
 solve
 the
 climate
 crisis,
 we


have
 to
 pay
 attention
 to
 the
 democracy


crisis.
 Christine
 mentioned
 that
 nine


out
 of
 10
 Europeans
 are
 in
 favor
 of


ramping
 up
 investments
 in
 renewable


energy.
 I
 don't
 think
 the
 percentage
 is


quite
 that
 high
 in
 the
 US,
 but
 it's


close
 to
 that
 in
 the
 US.
 Uh
 a
 and
 yet


the
 political
 power
 and
 the
 legacy


political
 and
 economic
 networks
 of
 the


fossil
 fuel
 industry
 have
 been
 used
 very


skillfully
 to
 slow
 this
 transition
 down.


Uh
 and
 at
 the
 I
 mentioned
 the
 big


changes
 with
 the
 pandemic
 and
 and
 and


with
 the
 China
 WTO
 the
 invasion
 of


Ukraine
 and
 all
 of
 that.
 There's
 another


transition
 that's
 we've
 been
 wrestling


with
 and
 that
 is
 a
 radical
 transition
 in


the
 information
 ecosystem
 within
 which


we
 make
 collective
 decisions.
 Norway
 and


the
 United
 States
 formed
 our


institutions
 during
 the
 era
 of
 the


printing
 press
 and
 we
 cycled
 through


broadcasting
 which
 is
 totalitarian


friendly
 to
 the
 internet
 and
 now
 social


media
 with
 an
 overlay
 of
 AI
 coming


rapidly
 and
 as
 a
 result
 the
 the
 norms


and
 practices
 of
 representative


democracy
 have
 been
 turned
 upside
 down


and
 they're
 not
 working
 as
 well
 as
 they


should.
 I
 do
 believe
 that
 change
 is


coming
 and
 I
 believe
 in
 the
 elections


one
 year
 from
 next
 month
 we
 will
 see


almost
 certainly
 we
 will
 see
 a
 dramatic


change
 in
 the
 direction
 of
 the
 Congress


in
 the
 United
 States.


>> Yes,
 let's
 hope
 so.
 I
 dare
 to
 say.
 Uh


Madame,
 uh


>> can
 you
 allow
 me
 to
 make
 a
 suggestion


here?


>> Absolutely.
 because
 I
 I
 don't
 know
 how


many
 of
 you
 in
 this
 room
 have
 seen
 a


film
 called
 The
 Inconvenient
 Truth.


>> Raise
 hands.


>> Okay.


Point
 made.
 At
 times
 when
 films
 were


actually
 very
 powerful,


>> one
 person
 sitting
 next
 to
 me
 was
 the


agent
 for
 change.
 And
 I
 don't
 know
 what


it
 was
 for
 you.
 For
 me,
 it
 was
 a


dramatic
 understanding
 of
 what
 was
 going


to
 happen.
 And
 I
 would
 suggest
 that
 with


that
 same
 person
 sitting
 next
 to
 me,
 we


should
 encourage
 him
 and
 maybe
 fund
 him.


There's
 a
 bit
 of
 money
 around
 here
 to


produce
 on
 the
 media
 of
 the
 future


something
 that
 could
 be
 called
 I
 don't


know
 the
 inconvenient
 comfort
 zone
 that


we
 are
 in
 and
 or
 something
 like
 that
 in


order
 to
 encourage
 as
 many
 young
 people


because
 we're
 all
 a
 little
 bit
 over
 the


edge
 of
 the
 20s
 uh
 in
 this
 room
 but


encourage
 them
 to
 appreciate
 what
 is


needed
 how
 much
 money
 will
 be
 required


and
 how
 they
 should
 prepare
 for
 that.


>> Wouldn't
 you
 agree?
 Yes.
 Yeah.


Well,
 is
 that
 okay?


>> As
 I
 often
 say,
 if
 it
 hadn't
 been
 for


me,
 we
 might
 have
 a
 big
 problem
 right


now.


>> Yes.


>> But
 I'm
 not
 done
 yet.


>> You're
 not
 done
 yet.
 But
 should
 we
 move


back
 to
 to
 the
 European
 country?
 No.
 No,


please.
 Uh
 and
 uh
 because
 um
 climate


initiatives
 are
 competing
 with
 many


other
 uh
 important
 tasks.
 For
 instance,


we
 have
 to
 increase
 our
 defense
 budget.


We
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 other
 challenges.
 Uh


how
 should
 we
 how
 should
 we
 try
 to
 to


combine
 climate
 initiatives
 with
 all
 the


other
 tasks
 that
 we
 have
 to
 address?


>> I
 hope
 it
 was
 clear
 in
 my
 in
 my
 remarks


that
 we
 have
 to
 act
 together
 and
 the


togetherness
 for
 me
 is
 Europe
 and
 the


European
 friends
 around
 us.


And
 I
 think
 that
 when
 there
 is
 a
 threat


as
 obvious,
 as
 imminent,
 and
 as


longlasting
 as
 climate
 change,
 it
 really


warrants
 a
 joint
 approach.


So
 fiscal
 space
 is
 limited
 for
 some


countries
 as
 we
 know.
 Other
 countries


have
 a
 larger
 balance
 sheets
 and
 are
 are


putting
 the
 balance
 sheet
 uh
 in
 the


equation.
 But
 it's
 really
 one
 of
 those


areas.
 The
 two
 or
 three
 that
 I
 think
 my


perspective
 are
 unquestionable.
 Defense


is
 one,
 climate
 change
 is
 the
 other
 one


that
 warrant
 joint
 commitment,
 joint


initiative,
 joint
 funding
 in
 order
 to


respond
 to
 the
 urgency
 of
 the
 matter.


And
 as
 Gore
 was
 saying
 earlier
 on,
 85%


is
 private
 sector,
 15%
 was
 the
 incentive


or
 the
 environment
 within
 which
 policy


makers
 could
 make
 a
 difference.
 So
 we're


not
 talking
 about
 the
 entire
 financing


needs
 being
 supported
 by
 governments


because
 number
 one,
 they
 cannot
 do
 it.


Number
 two,
 private
 sector
 must
 play
 its


part
 as
 well
 and
 will
 bring
 a
 level
 of


discipline
 and
 scrutiny
 to
 the
 projects


which
 is
 which
 are
 which
 are
 needed.
 So


that
 would
 be
 my
 response
 to
 you.
 It's
 a


joint
 effort
 massively
 from
 the
 private


sector
 in
 a
 smaller
 proportion
 by
 the


public
 sector
 but
 one
 where
 joint
 effort


is
 completely
 warranted
 and
 necessary.


But
 we
 will
 be
 dependent
 on
 a
 lot
 of


import
 from
 China
 and
 we
 try
 to
 be
 more


independent
 of
 Russia.
 So
 are
 we
 just


swapping
 the
 the
 dependence
 of
 Russia


with
 dependence
 on
 China?


>> Look,
 if
 there
 is
 one
 lesson
 that
 we


learned
 in
 the
 last
 few
 years
 is
 to
 be


more
 s
 more
 security,
 sustainability,


affordability,
 all
 of
 that
 applies
 as


well
 to
 the
 uh
 the
 supply
 chain
 and
 the


sourcing
 of
 the
 components.
 It's
 obvious


at
 the
 moment
 that
 about
 95%
 of
 the


solar
 uh
 generation
 um
 various


components
 including
 rare
 earth
 by
 the


way
 that
 are
 needed
 for
 for
 some
 of
 that


are
 in
 the
 hands
 of
 China.
 But
 we
 have


to
 respond
 to
 that
 and
 there
 is
 a


strategy
 that
 has
 been
 developed
 by
 the


European
 Commission
 which
 addresses


precisely
 the
 issue
 of
 rare
 earth
 in


order
 to
 reach
 certain
 targets
 of


independence.
 is
 going
 to
 take
 a
 while


uh
 just
 as
 it
 will
 in
 relation
 to


defense
 but
 we
 we
 have
 to
 to
 take
 that


path
 and
 to
 and
 to
 travel
 that
 journey.


>> Let
 me
 offer
 two
 pathways
 to
 consider.


Uh
 you
 ran
 the
 IMF
 brilliantly
 Christine


uh
 and
 you
 study
 started
 then
 and


Cristina
 Georgva
 has
 recently
 released
 a


new
 version
 of
 the
 study.
 What
 would


happen
 if
 governments
 eliminated
 the


subsidies
 for
 fossil
 fuels?
 Many
 people


are
 surprised
 to
 dig
 down
 into
 the


realities
 and
 realize
 that
 taxpayers


around
 the
 world
 are
 forced
 to
 subsidize


the
 destruction
 of
 humanity's
 future.


It's
 literally
 insane.
 The
 IMF
 study


shows
 that
 if
 we
 eliminated
 subsidies


for
 fossil
 fuel,
 governments
 around
 the


world
 would
 have
 an
 extra
 4.4
 trillion


dollars
 to
 spend.
 that
 happens
 to
 be


just
 about
 exactly
 the
 amount
 that
 the


IEA
 says
 is
 needed
 to
 finance
 the
 energy


transition.
 So
 when
 people
 say
 where's


the
 money
 going
 to
 come
 from?
 Well,
 if


we
 stop
 spending
 it
 subsidizing
 the


destruction
 of
 our
 future
 and
 used
 it


for
 good
 results
 instead,
 we'd
 be
 done


where
 the
 money
 I
 is
 concerned.
 a
 second


pathway
 forward
 if
 I
 could.
 President


Lula,
 who
 is
 hosting,
 of
 course,
 COP
 30


next
 month,
 uh
 has
 recently
 ventured


this
 proposal
 for
 a
 an
 alliance
 of


countries
 that
 support
 the
 carbon
 border


adjustment
 mechanisms,
 the
 C-bams,
 if


China
 and
 the
 European
 Union,
 including


Norway,
 Singapore,
 Australia,
 all


combined
 with
 a
 border
 adjustment
 to


reflect
 the
 carbon
 content,
 then
 that


might
 even
 match
 uh
 President
 Trump's


fondness
 for
 tariffs
 uh
 such
 as
 it
 is
 uh


and
 we
 could
 finally
 in
 in
 that
 indirect


way
 put
 a
 price
 on
 carbon.


>> Thank
 you
 so
 much.
 They
 tell
 me
 we
 have


to
 stop.
 I
 can
 see
 that
 the
 audience
 is


more
 optimistic
 now
 than
 when
 we
 met


this
 morning
 and
 that
 is
 because
 of
 you.


You
 are
 very
 experienced
 people.
 you


have
 been
 working
 on
 this
 for
 decades


and
 uh
 we
 knew
 it
 wouldn't
 be
 easy
 to
 uh


you
 know
 form
 that
 such
 a
 big


transformation
 but
 we
 just
 have
 to


>> carry
 on


>> carry
 on.


>> Can
 I
 make
 one
 more
 comment?
 I
 I
 know


that
 you're
 in
 Norway
 you're
 much
 more


punctual
 than
 we
 are
 in
 the
 United


States.
 I
 know
 you're
 getting
 the


signal.
 Yeah,


>> I
 had
 a
 I
 had
 a
 teacher
 when
 I
 was
 young


who
 said
 frequently
 that
 we
 all
 face
 the


same
 choice
 in
 life
 over
 and
 over
 again.


And
 it's
 a
 choice
 between
 the
 hard
 right


and
 the
 easy
 wrong.
 We
 have
 now
 reached


a
 point
 in
 the
 evolution
 of
 human


society
 where
 we
 face
 that
 choice


between
 the
 hard
 right
 and
 the
 easy


wrong.
 People
 say
 we
 face
 a
 poly
 crisis.


We
 have
 a
 poly
 solution.
 We
 need
 to
 make


the
 hard
 right
 decision
 to
 vastly


accelerate
 the
 transition
 away
 from


fossil
 fuels
 and
 build
 confidence
 that


we
 can
 control
 our
 own
 destiny.
 I
 want


young
 people
 to
 have
 the
 same


hopefulness
 in
 looking
 at
 the
 future


that
 I
 had
 when
 I
 was
 young.
 How
 dare
 we


not
 give
 that
 to
 them
 when
 we
 know
 that


we
 can.
 We
 have
 the
 ability
 to
 do
 it.


Norway
 has
 been
 leading
 the
 way
 in
 the


right
 making
 the
 right
 decisions.
 We
 can


choose
 the
 hard
 right
 and
 save
 our


future.


>> Thank
 you
 so
 much.


Thank
 you
 so
 much.


>> It
 only
 remains
 for
 me
 to
 thank
 you
 so


much
 to
 thank
 you
 so
 much
 for
 taking
 the


time
 to
 come
 here.
 It's
 been
 an
 honor
 to


have
 you
 on
 stage.
 Thank
 you
 very
 much.


[Applause]


>> There
 is
 now
 going
 to
 be
 there's
 now


going
 to
 be
 another
 break
 with
 coffee


and
 some
 other
 refreshments
 over
 here


and
 we
 will
 reconvene
 at
 2:30.


[Music]


[Music]


Welcome
 back.
 I
 hope
 you
 had
 a
 nice


coffee
 break
 and
 that
 you
 enjoyed
 your


ice
 cream.
 As
 we
 have
 heard
 today,
 a


changing
 climate
 will
 affect
 the
 economy


in
 many
 ways.


This
 involves
 risks
 that
 investors
 need


to
 understand.
 But
 risks
 also
 imply


opportunities.
 And
 in
 this
 session,
 we


will
 further
 explore
 how
 to
 approach


these
 risks
 and
 how
 investors
 are


integrating
 these
 factors
 into
 their


investment
 decisions.


We
 are
 honored
 to
 host
 Professor
 Tim


Lenton
 as
 our
 first
 speaker.
 He's
 a


pioneering
 researcher
 and
 his
 work


identifying
 climate
 tipping
 points
 has


informed
 the
 setting
 of
 the
 1.5
 degree


climate
 target.
 As
 director
 of
 the


global
 systems
 institute
 and
 lead
 author


of
 the
 global
 tipping
 point
 report,


Professor
 Lenton
 brings
 crucial
 insights


on
 both
 the
 risks
 we
 face
 and
 the


opportunities
 that
 can
 accelerate
 our


transition
 to
 net
 zero.
 Please
 give
 a


warm
 welcome
 to
 Tim.


Thank
 you
 Carolene.
 Thanks
 to
 the


governor,
 the
 deputy
 governor
 and
 all
 of


the
 team
 who've
 been
 looking
 after
 me


for
 the
 invite.
 It's
 great
 to
 be
 here.


Yeah,
 I've
 been
 asked
 to
 talk
 about
 the


risks
 and
 opportunities
 of
 both
 the


negative
 and
 the
 positive
 tipping


points.
 So
 the
 bad
 tipping
 points
 in
 the


climate
 and
 what
 I
 call
 the
 positive


tipping
 points
 in
 the
 energy
 transition.


But
 if
 you're
 not
 sure
 what
 a
 tipping


point
 is,
 maybe
 I
 could
 invite
 you
 to


lean
 back
 on
 your
 chair
 and
 remind


yourself,
 right?
 Because
 we
 all
 know,
 we


all
 know
 that
 you
 can
 get
 to
 a
 certain


balance
 point
 where
 a
 small
 nudge
 one


way
 or
 the
 other,
 it
 might
 take
 you
 back


into
 one
 stable
 state,
 um,
 the


preferable
 one
 for
 you
 and
 the
 chair,


but
 a
 tiny
 nudge
 in
 the
 other
 direction


could
 send
 you
 in
 a
 self-propelling


transition
 into
 a
 very
 different
 stable


state
 of
 the
 system,
 you
 and
 the
 chair.


Well,
 this
 could
 be,
 as
 we'll
 see,
 uh,


Greenland
 ice
 sheet,
 no
 Greenland
 ice


sheet,
 or
 it
 could
 be
 economy
 powered
 by


fossil
 fuels
 or
 economy
 powered
 by


renewables.
 These
 are
 different
 stable


states
 of
 a
 system.
 Now,
 it's
 a
 bit
 more


subtle
 in
 the
 complex
 systems
 of
 the


climate
 and
 the
 economy.
 And
 what
 I'm


doing
 in
 this
 little
 movie
 is
 uh
 we
 see


the
 system
 the
 ball
 rolling
 around
 in


the
 valley
 in
 the
 left
 hand
 stable
 state


but
 the
 system's
 being
 forced
 in
 a
 way


that
 that
 initial
 state
 with
 the


incumbents
 is
 getting
 less
 stable
 over


time.
 So
 some
 damping
 feedbacks
 that


maintain
 the
 status
 quo
 are
 getting


weaker
 and
 some
 amplifying
 feedbacks


within
 this
 system
 are
 getting
 stronger


until
 when
 it
 reaches
 the
 tipping
 point


they're
 strong
 enough
 to
 support
 a


self-propelling
 change.
 and
 I
 could
 stop


forcing
 the
 system.
 The
 change
 would


continue.
 It's
 self-propelling.
 It's


supported
 by
 internal
 amplifiers.
 It's


abrupt.
 It's
 hard
 to
 reverse.
 The
 actual


time
 scale
 of
 transition
 is
 going
 to


depend
 on
 the
 system
 in
 question.
 Some


systems
 are
 very
 fast
 by
 human
 time


scales,
 like
 tipping
 monsoons.
 Some
 are


very
 slow,
 like
 tipping
 ice
 sheets.
 But


nevertheless,
 you
 can
 get
 into
 an


irreversible
 transition.


Yeah.
 So,
 let's
 start
 with
 the
 bad
 news.


the
 tipping
 points,
 some
 of
 the
 tipping


points
 in
 the
 climate
 system.
 A
 little


summary
 here
 from
 several
 years
 ago
 now,


where
 in
 the
 black
 with
 the
 white


writing,
 you
 see
 a
 little
 short
 summary


of
 some
 of
 what
 I
 called
 the
 tipping


elements
 in
 the
 climate
 system
 and
 some


of
 the
 evidence
 that
 change
 was


accelerating
 in
 a
 in
 the
 wrong


direction,
 in
 a
 bad
 direction
 in
 these


systems.
 And
 they
 mark
 the
 kind
 of


targets
 on
 the
 map.
 But
 you
 also
 see
 the


arrows
 connecting
 these
 key
 parts
 of
 the


climate
 system.
 And
 they're
 they're
 to


convey
 the
 knowledge
 that
 we
 had
 even


then
 that
 there
 are
 causal
 interactions


in
 the
 climate.
 And
 tipping
 one
 thing


unfortunately


tends
 to
 make
 tipping
 another
 more


likely
 in
 the
 climate
 system.
 There's
 a


few
 cases
 where
 it
 would
 go
 the
 other


way
 around,
 but
 overwhelmingly
 I'm
 I'm


afraid
 tipping
 one
 thing
 would
 make


tipping
 another
 more
 likely.
 And
 I
 won't


try
 to
 walk
 you
 through
 all
 the
 science


of
 what
 I
 sketched
 there,
 but
 hopefully


you're
 already
 aware
 that
 the
 Arctic
 is


warming
 at
 an
 extraordinary
 rate,
 four


times
 faster
 than
 the
 planetary
 average,


largely
 because
 we're
 what's
 a
 very


reflective
 white
 surface
 of
 sea
 ice
 is


being
 replaced
 by
 a
 very
 dark
 ocean


surface
 that
 absorbs
 a
 lot
 more


sunlight.
 That
 warming
 Arctic
 is,
 of


course,
 a
 key
 reason
 why
 the
 Greenland


ice
 sheets
 melting
 at
 an
 accelerating


rate
 and
 pouring
 fresh
 water
 into
 the


North
 Atlantic.
 That
 warmer
 Arctic
 means


more
 rain
 and
 snowfall
 actually
 another


source
 of
 fresh
 water.
 And
 all
 that


addition
 of
 fresh
 water
 into
 the
 North


Atlantic
 is
 interfering
 with
 the
 thing


in
 the
 middle
 here
 which
 is
 just
 called


Atlantic
 circulation.
 And
 later
 on
 I'll


talk
 about
 it
 as
 the
 Atlantic
 meridional


overturning
 circulation
 or
 AOK.
 But
 but


you'll
 see
 why
 you
 want
 to
 care
 about


that
 because
 that
 is
 a
 crucial
 connector


of
 the
 climate
 system.
 And
 it
 currently


moves
 an
 enormous
 amount
 of
 heat
 from


the
 southern
 hemisphere
 to
 the
 norm


northern
 hemisphere
 particularly
 to


northwest
 Europe.
 And
 in
 so
 doing
 it


sets
 the
 position
 of
 the
 monsoons
 or
 the


around
 the
 tropics.
 Losing
 that


circulation
 would
 severely
 disrupt


monsoons
 in
 West
 Africa
 and
 India
 uh
 and


and
 in
 North
 and
 South
 America
 for


example.
 And
 losing
 this
 circulation


would
 leave
 heat
 behind
 in
 the
 southern


ocean
 which
 would
 be
 the
 threat
 add
 to


the
 threat
 of
 tipping
 the
 loss
 of
 major


ice
 sheets
 there.
 I
 won't
 give
 you
 all


the
 details
 of
 the
 impacts
 of
 each
 of


these
 tipping
 elements,
 but
 if
 I
 was
 to


just
 focus
 on
 the
 Greenland
 and
 West


Antarctic
 ice
 sheets,
 between
 them,
 they


contain
 enough
 ice
 to
 raise
 the
 world's


sea
 levels
 by
 more
 than
 10
 meters.
 And


as
 you'll
 see,
 we
 find
 it
 hard
 to
 rule


out
 that
 they
 couldn't
 be
 past
 a
 tipping


point
 already.


Okay,
 so
 this
 is
 what
 our
 summary
 of
 20


25
 years
 of
 intergovernmental
 panel
 on


climate
 change
 reports
 has
 to
 say
 about


where
 does
 tipping
 where
 does
 crossing


these
 major
 tipping
 points
 become
 more


likely.
 Well,
 it
 sort
 of
 goes
 from


yellow
 to
 red
 where
 it
 becomes
 as
 likely


as
 not.
 So
 we
 used
 to
 think
 these
 were


high
 impact,
 you
 might
 say
 low


likelihood
 events
 because
 we
 thought
 it


would
 take
 four
 or
 five
 degrees
 of


global
 warming
 centigrade
 to
 cross
 major


tipping
 points
 in
 the
 climate.
 Uh


unfortunately
 over
 time
 as
 we
 look


harder
 as
 we
 learn
 more
 that
 that


temperature
 level
 comes
 down
 so
 that
 now


we've
 been
 agreeing
 for
 over
 five
 years


that
 we're
 already
 in
 the
 danger
 zone
 uh


effectively
 where
 these
 are
 no
 longer


high
 impact
 low
 likelihood
 events
 we're


talking
 about
 they're
 starting
 to
 become


high
 impact
 well
 as
 likely
 as
 not
 events


shall
 we
 say
 and
 meanwhile
 we've
 been


pushing
 the
 temperature
 up.
 So
 any
 risk


manager
 should
 look
 at
 this
 information


with
 great
 alarm
 um
 and
 be
 moved
 to
 act


because
 crucially
 the
 the
 threats
 I'm


talking
 about
 here
 as
 I
 tried
 to
 convey


with
 the
 chair
 once
 they're
 underway


they're
 very
 difficult
 to
 reser
 reverse


and
 carry
 major
 damages
 as
 we'll
 see.
 So


just
 last
 week
 we
 launched
 our
 global


tipping
 points
 report
 2025
 and
 we're


saying
 to
 the
 world
 for
 the
 first
 time


we've
 crossed
 a
 climate
 tipping
 point.


This
 is
 the
 one
 for
 widespread
 dieback


of
 coral
 reefs
 in
 the
 tropics
 in
 warm


warm
 waters.


Why
 should
 I
 care?
 You
 might
 be


thinking.
 Apart
 from
 this
 is
 a
 beautiful


biodiverse
 ecosystem
 but
 it
 does
 support


the
 livelihoods
 of
 an
 estimated
 more


than
 500
 million
 people,
 many
 rich


fisheries
 and
 of
 course
 coral
 reefs


provide
 really
 important
 coastal


protection
 in
 a
 world
 of
 rising
 sea


levels
 and
 storm
 surges
 to
 all
 of
 the


real
 estate
 behind
 the
 reefs
 around
 many


coastlines
 of
 the
 tropics.
 So
 this
 is
 a


big
 deal
 for
 humans
 as
 well
 as
 the
 fact


that
 this
 is
 a
 quarter
 of
 marine
 species


hosted
 on
 the
 world's
 coral
 reefs.


So,
 here's
 a
 little
 summary
 from
 last


week's
 report
 of
 some
 of
 the
 tipping


points
 and
 the
 and
 their
 sort
 of


uncertain
 where
 is
 the
 tipping
 point
 in


temperature.
 We're
 never
 quite
 sure,
 but


we
 know
 the
 risk
 goes
 up
 with
 the


temperature.
 I
 just
 talked
 about
 the


reefs
 already
 now
 we
 think
 committed
 to


a
 widespread
 loss
 because
 after
 all
 in


the
 last
 two
 years
 when
 global


temperatures
 have
 been
 we
 hope


temporarily
 at
 1.5
 degrees
 C
 uh
 we've


seen
 more
 than
 80%
 of
 the
 reefs


suffering
 severe
 bleaching
 events


dieback
 with
 marine
 heat
 waves.
 But


there's
 a
 few
 other
 things
 on
 here.
 I've


mentioned
 that
 the
 ice
 sheet
 on
 West


Antarctica
 and
 on
 Greenland,
 we
 can't


rule
 out
 that
 both
 are
 actually
 close
 to


or
 possibly
 past
 a
 tipping
 point.


making
 a
 commitment
 to
 a
 very
 large


magnitude
 of
 long-term
 sea
 level
 rise.


We
 also
 know
 now
 that
 the
 Amazon


rainforest
 could
 be
 at
 risk
 both
 from


the
 combined
 effects
 of
 global
 warming


and
 of
 people
 continuing
 to
 deforest
 it


at
 a
 lower
 level
 of
 warming
 than
 we


thought
 before.
 Essentially,
 when
 we
 get


into
 the
 1
 and
 a
 half
 to
 two
 degrees


range
 and
 we're
 all
 going
 to
 sail
 past


1.5
 degrees
 centigrade
 of
 global
 warming


in
 the
 next
 five
 or
 so
 years,
 best


estimate
 in
 2030.
 So,
 we're
 heading
 into


a
 danger
 zone
 of
 these
 tipping
 more
 of


these
 tipping
 points
 becoming
 more


likely.
 I
 just
 want
 to
 talk
 briefly


about
 a
 couple
 of
 coupled
 tipping
 points


in
 the
 Atlantic
 Ocean
 circulation


which
 is
 kind
 of
 the
 Atlantic
 bit
 of


this.
 Right.
 So
 here's
 a
 little
 movie
 of


the
 great
 sort
 of
 thermma
 halaline


circulation
 of
 the
 ocean
 and
 we
 want
 to


concentrate
 on
 these
 are
 the
 surface


currents
 heading
 northwards
 the
 Gulf


Stream
 as
 we
 call
 it
 giving
 us
 a


relatively
 equable
 climate
 over
 here
 in


Oslo
 especially
 in
 the
 UK
 there's
 two


places
 where
 deep
 water
 forms
 up
 in
 the


North
 Atlantic
 either
 side
 of
 Greenland


so
 waters
 are
 heading
 north
 in
 the


Atlantic
 in
 the
 Gulfream


heat
 is
 being
 lost
 to
 the
 atmosphere
 as


they
 head
 North


fresh
 water
 is
 being
 evaporated
 to
 the


atmosphere
 as
 they
 get
 go
 north.
 The


waters
 are
 therefore
 getting
 colder
 and


they're
 getting
 saltier
 which
 means


they're
 getting
 denser
 either
 side
 of


Greenland.
 They
 get
 dense
 enough
 to
 we


call
 it
 deep
 convect
 to
 sink
 from
 the


top
 of
 the
 ocean
 to
 thousands
 of
 meters


down
 and
 to
 drive
 this
 great
 overturning


circulation
 which
 then
 has
 this
 blue


cold
 flow
 thousands
 of
 meters
 down


coming
 back
 south
 down
 the
 Atlantic.
 We


know
 that
 this
 thing
 can
 be
 tipped
 off.


It's
 switched
 on
 and
 off
 25
 times
 during


the
 last
 ice
 age
 and
 the
 end
 of
 the
 last


ice
 age.
 Why?
 What
 happens?
 We
 So,
 we


know
 there's
 an
 alternative
 stable
 state


just
 like
 the
 chair.
 What
 happens
 if
 we


tip
 the
 collapse
 of
 the
 Atlantic


overturning
 circulation?
 Well,
 it


happens
 in
 some
 of
 the
 state-of-the-art


climate
 models
 at
 2°
 C
 of
 global


warming.
 It
 actually
 happens
 at
 less


than
 two
 degrees
 C
 in
 some
 of
 the


models.
 Here's
 an
 example
 of
 a


highresolution
 climate
 model.
 There's


quite
 a
 lot
 going
 on
 on
 the
 slide,
 but


um
 it's
 highlighting
 what's
 happening
 to


the
 winters
 over
 much
 of
 Europe
 because


what
 the
 the
 take-home
 message
 here
 is


although
 the
 summers
 remain
 beset
 by


heat
 waves
 worse
 than
 today,
 suddenly


the
 seasonality
 of
 our
 climate
 in


northwest
 Europe
 changes
 radically.
 And


the
 winters,
 well,
 let's
 start
 on
 the


right.
 What
 happens
 is
 we
 lose
 this


major
 transport
 of
 heat.
 So
 in
 the


winters,
 the
 se
 the
 Arctic
 sea
 ice
 makes


a
 stunning
 recovery.
 uh
 by
 December
 it's


down
 to
 here.
 By
 January
 it's
 uh
 cover


it's
 covering
 the
 seas
 where
 we
 are
 in


Oslo.
 By
 February
 it's
 almost
 reached


the
 tempames
 and
 is
 covering
 most
 of
 the


North
 Sea.
 That's
 why
 the
 decadal


climate
 extremes
 in
 this
 after
 this


tipping
 point
 include
 temperatures
 well


where
 are
 we
 about
 -40°
 C
 is
 the
 decadal


extreme
 in
 Oslo
 in
 this
 climate
 in
 the


winter.
 In
 Edinburgh,
 it's
 minus30


degrees
 C
 and
 5
 and
 a
 half
 months
 of
 the


year
 are
 frozen
 solid.
 In
 Edinburgh,
 in


London,
 it's
 what
 is
 it?
 Minus
 20


degrees
 C,
 but
 three
 months
 of
 the
 year


are
 frozen.
 I
 don't
 know
 about
 Norway.
 I


mean,
 you're
 used
 to
 snow,
 but
 in
 the


UK,
 this
 will
 be
 an
 absolute


infrastructure
 catastrophe.
 Uh
 we
 we're


hopeless
 when
 it
 snows.
 So,
 that's
 a
 big


impact
 on
 Northwest
 Europe
 after
 this


tipping
 point.
 This
 is
 a
 crude
 estimate


of
 what
 it
 does
 to
 the
 global
 viable


area
 for
 growing
 two
 major
 staple
 crops.


Purple
 means
 loss
 of
 viable
 area.
 Dark


purple
 means
 almost
 complete
 loss.
 Uh


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 widespread


um
 drying
 and
 this
 winter
 cooling
 that


severely
 impairs
 um
 the
 potential
 to


grow
 these
 crops
 reducing
 the
 global


viable
 area
 by
 more
 than
 a
 half
 in
 by


our
 estimation.
 So
 in
 simple
 terms,
 a


food
 security
 crisis
 underllay
 by
 a


water
 security
 crisis.


So
 that
 was
 the
 bad
 news.
 That
 should


give
 you
 enough
 to
 ponder
 to
 make
 you


think
 we
 really
 should
 be
 doing


everything
 in
 our
 power
 to
 try
 and
 avoid


that
 risk.
 And
 are
 we
 doing
 in


everything
 in
 our
 power
 to
 decarbonize


the
 economy
 and
 get
 to
 zero
 emissions?


Obviously,
 we
 aren't.
 How
 much
 faster
 do


we
 need
 to
 be
 going
 in
 decarboning


decarbonizing
 the
 economy
 do
 you
 think


to
 have
 a
 reasonable
 odds
 of
 limiting


warming
 now
 below
 2°
 C?
 Well,
 my
 friend


Simon
 Sharp
 wrote
 a
 book
 about
 it.
 He


said
 we
 need
 to
 go
 five
 times
 faster.


Unfortunately,
 I've
 had
 to
 redo
 the


calculations
 because
 we
 haven't
 been


going
 five
 times
 faster
 since
 he
 wrote


the
 book
 and
 now
 we
 need
 to
 be
 going


probably
 seven
 times
 faster.
 We
 need
 a


spectacular
 acceleration
 of
 the
 action


that
 is
 happening
 in
 decarbonizing
 the


economy.
 But
 we're
 looking
 at
 needing
 to


go
 an
 order
 of
 magnitude
 faster.
 Which


is
 why
 I
 spent
 a
 couple
 of
 years
 trying


to
 convince
 myself
 and
 write
 a
 book
 here


on
 positive
 tipping
 points
 about
 the


evidence
 that
 in
 some
 sectors
 and
 in


some
 markets
 we
 have
 seen
 a
 spectacular


positive
 tipping
 points
 to
 clean


technology
 and
 also
 some
 changes
 in


behavior
 that
 we
 need.
 So
 let's
 just


quickly
 land
 the
 idea
 here.
 It's
 the


same
 concept.
 There
 are
 alternative


stable
 states
 of
 the
 economy.
 There's


the
 fossilfueled
 economy
 propped
 up
 by


lots
 of
 damping
 feedbacks.
 Vice


President
 Gore
 mentioned
 those,
 the


subsidies
 for
 example.
 There's
 an


alternative
 state
 of
 the
 economy
 powered


by
 renewable
 energy,
 battery
 storage,


all
 the
 rest
 of
 it.
 That
 that
 that's
 for


many
 of
 us
 will
 be
 a
 more
 profitable
 as


well
 as
 a
 much
 cleaner
 and
 healthier
 one


to
 live
 in.
 There's
 a
 barrier
 between


them.
 But
 there's
 some
 evidence
 that


actions
 can
 affect
 the
 balance
 of


feedbacks
 in
 the
 system
 and
 have
 done
 as


we'll
 see
 for
 key
 markets
 and
 sectors
 in


a
 way
 that
 needs
 to
 happen.
 We
 need
 the


kind
 of
 actions
 that
 are
 going
 to


destabilize
 the
 current
 state
 of
 the


system
 and
 propel
 the
 change
 into
 the


alternative
 state
 is
 a
 simple
 argument.


So
 can
 I
 convince
 you
 that
 we
 could


change
 really
 fast
 in
 key
 technologies?


Let's
 start
 with
 a
 historical
 example.


This
 is
 Fifth
 Avenue
 um
 in
 Manhattan,


New
 York.
 Uh
 Easter
 Day
 Parade
 in
 the


year
 1900.
 And
 your
 job
 is
 to
 spot
 as


everybody
 parades
 on
 the
 street
 uh
 and


drives
 around
 also
 in
 the
 road.
 Everyone


in
 the
 road
 is
 uh
 parading
 around
 in


their
 horsedrawn
 carriage
 by
 by
 one


person
 in
 an
 early
 automobile.
 Can
 you


see
 them
 in
 the
 photograph?


Yes.
 Well
 done.
 Well
 done.
 There
 they


are.
 Let's
 fast
 forward
 13
 years
 to


another
 photograph
 of
 Easter
 Day
 Parade


in
 New
 York
 City
 uh
 in
 1913.
 And
 you


have
 to
 spot
 the
 one
 person
 left
 in
 a


horsedrawn
 carriage.
 Everybody
 else
 is


in
 an
 early
 automobile.
 Can
 you
 see


them?
 Same
 place
 on
 the
 street.
 Aha.
 Now


there's
 a
 tipping
 point
 in
 personal


mobility
 that
 unfolded
 pretty
 quick.
 Um


in
 tipping
 points,
 it's
 all
 about


amplifying
 feedback.
 So
 what
 were
 the


amplifiers
 here?
 Well,
 there
 was
 a
 bit


of a
 fashion
 craze
 going
 on.
 You
 know,


when
 some
 people
 got
 a
 car,
 other
 people


thought,
 "Oh,
 I
 want
 one
 of
 those."
 And


we
 just
 we
 have
 a
 habit
 and
 researchers


call
 it
 social
 contagion.
 But
 we
 have a


habit
 just
 for
 simply
 imitating
 each


other's
 uptake
 decisions
 sometimes.
 And


that
 can
 that
 can
 snowball.
 But
 of


course,
 there
 are
 really
 powerful


amplifiers
 in
 technology
 innovation.
 The


more
 early
 cars
 that
 got
 built,
 the


better
 they
 got
 and
 the
 cheaper
 they


got.
 Um
 the
 Model
 T
 being
 the
 famous


example
 when
 it
 first
 comes
 on
 the


market
 in
 the
 mid1900s
 costs
 about
 $900


and
 something
 dollars
 for
 the
 standard


model
 with
 within
 less
 than
 a
 decade
 the


price
 had
 fallen
 to
 less
 than
 $300.
 And


this
 is
 because
 of
 economies
 of
 scale.


The
 famous
 model
 Henry
 Ford's
 famous


production
 line
 the
 more
 cars
 you
 built


um
 the
 cheaper
 the
 unit
 cost.
 But
 also


that
 as
 a
 rule
 with
 technology
 the
 more


we
 make
 it
 the
 better
 we
 get
 at
 making


it.
 and
 the
 more
 attractive
 the
 product


becomes.
 With
 the
 early
 um
 gasoline


cars,
 uh
 that
 was
 clearly
 the
 case.
 But


there's
 also
 a
 thing
 I'd
 call
 technology


reinforcement.
 We
 tend
 to
 in
 innovation,


we
 tend
 to
 put
 technologies
 together
 to


make
 when
 a
 new
 technology
 arises,
 put


it
 together
 with
 other
 technologies,


make
 it
 more
 useful.
 For
 early
 gasoline


cars,
 the
 crucial
 thing
 was
 arguably
 the


electric
 starter
 motor
 which
 took
 away


the
 pain
 of
 cranks
 starting
 them.
 But


also,
 of
 course,
 gas
 stations
 and
 roads


got
 built.
 So
 a
 lot
 of
 complimentary


technology.
 Well,
 that
 was
 history.
 Now,


as
 you've
 seen
 here,
 you
 are
 leading
 the


world
 in
 the
 tipping
 point
 we
 need
 in


this
 sector
 from
 internal
 combustion


engine
 vehicles
 to
 electric
 vehicles.


Norway
 can
 be
 rightly
 proud
 of
 having


led
 the
 world
 in
 a
 very
 abrupt


transition
 in
 the
 market
 from
 one
 to
 the


other.
 And
 as
 an
 aside,
 yes,
 some


crucial
 policy
 support
 um
 enabled
 this.


But
 that
 policy
 support
 in
 camea
 in
 turn


came
 from
 social
 activists.
 And
 I
 think


you
 you
 the
 audience
 should
 know
 this


story.
 So
 I
 won't
 tell
 it
 to
 you
 because


I'll
 use
 up
 all
 my
 time.
 that
 members
 of


the
 pop
 band
 ahaar
 and
 their
 architect


friend
 Harold
 Rossik
 for
 example
 um


they
 in
 pictured
 here
 in
 1989
 uh


publicized
 a
 set
 of
 I
 think
 it
 was
 nine


policy
 demands
 that
 they
 wanted
 the


Norwegian
 government
 to
 adopt
 to


incentivize
 the
 transition
 to
 EVs.
 It


was
 a
 decade
 long
 battle
 to
 get
 those


adopted
 but
 it's
 it's
 a
 key
 part
 of
 the


reason
 for
 Norway
 tipping
 first.


However,
 we
 need
 to
 be
 thinking
 about


the
 global
 picture
 here
 and
 we
 got
 to


remind
 ourselves
 again
 of
 amplifying


feedbacks
 because
 whilst
 it
 took
 the


policy
 support
 to
 tip
 the
 Norwegian


market
 in
 a
 global
 sense,
 the
 more


electric
 vehicles
 that
 uh
 get
 adopted


and
 there
 they
 are,
 that's
 the
 total


fleet
 worldwide
 growing
 exponentially


with
 a
 doubling
 time
 of
 a
 year
 and
 a


half.
 um
 the
 better
 and
 the
 cheaper
 they


get
 because
 all
 the
 dotted
 lines
 in
 the


left
 axis
 is
 the
 price
 of
 the
 batteries


plummeting
 and
 it's
 continued
 to
 plummet


down
 here
 20
 or
 30%
 decline
 in
 price


just
 last
 year
 and
 the
 range
 you
 can
 get


out
 of
 a
 given
 m
 mass
 of
 battery
 has


gone
 up
 a
 factor
 of
 roughly
 three
 in


this
 time
 phenomenal
 so
 those
 are


crucial
 amplifiers
 it
 means


you
 know
 we
 don't
 we're
 not
 going
 to


need
 at
 some
 point
 the
 supportive


policies
 that
 we
 needed
 initially
 here


in
 Norway
 and
 in
 other
 markets
 to
 get
 to


the
 point
 where
 this
 is
 just
 the
 most


it's
 ob
 it's
 the
 obvious
 choice
 for
 the


consumer.
 It's
 both
 the
 cheapest
 and
 the


best
 technology
 and
 then
 as
 it
 as
 it


snowballs
 what
 that
 means
 is
 batteries


are
 getting
 cheaper
 and
 cheaper
 all
 the


time
 and
 that
 has
 some
 other
 collateral


benefits.
 So
 first
 you
 tip
 the
 global


car
 market
 but
 then
 you
 tip
 the
 other


part
 of
 road
 transport
 which
 together


make
 up
 like
 14%
 of
 greenhouse
 gas


emissions
 which
 is
 electrifying
 trucking


goods
 transport
 passes
 its
 own
 tipping


point.
 And
 then
 of
 course
 uh
 when
 you


calculate
 the
 fact
 that
 the
 market
 is


already
 tipping
 to
 EVs
 as
 we've
 done
 you


find
 that
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 stranded
 oil


asset
 already
 out
 there
 that's


mispriced.
 And
 we
 can
 debate
 in
 the


coffee
 break
 or
 whatever
 how
 how
 many


trillions
 of
 dollars
 worth
 of
 asset
 is


already
 stranded.
 But
 uh
 but
 with
 the


tipping
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 oil
 that


companies
 thought
 they
 were
 going
 to
 be


able
 to
 sell
 in
 the
 future
 which
 there


won't
 be
 demand
 for.
 But
 the
 a
 really


important
 connection
 to
 my
 final
 point


is
 around
 the
 connection
 to
 the
 positive


tipping
 point
 for
 renewable
 energy


because
 cheap
 batteries
 as
 vice


president
 Gore
 told
 us
 are
 a
 key
 part
 of


balancing
 renewable
 electricity
 supply


and
 demand
 and
 they're
 coming
 flooding


in
 from
 the
 transition
 in
 the
 power


sector.
 So
 I
 just
 wanted
 to
 show
 you


that
 tipping
 points
 can
 happen
 in
 the


power
 sector.
 And
 this
 is
 my
 parochial


example
 from
 the
 UK,
 how
 we've
 turned


away
 from
 40%
 coal
 powered
 uh


electricity
 in
 2012
 to
 zero
 today
 and
 it


fell
 off
 a
 cliff
 thanks,
 by
 the
 way,
 to


a
 very
 modest
 price
 on
 carbon,
 a
 floor


price
 that
 was
 stepped
 up
 over
 time,
 but


was
 at
 a
 very
 low
 level
 that
 made
 coal


burning
 unprofitable.
 And
 contrary
 to


what
 you
 heard
 this
 morning,
 gas
 did
 not


in
 the
 long
 run
 replace
 coal
 burning
 in


the
 UK.
 The
 40%
 of
 power
 we
 got
 from


coal
 that
 was
 temporarily
 for
 a
 stock


grat
 replaced
 with
 gas
 is
 now
 thoroughly


replaced
 by
 renewables
 because
 the


offshore
 wind
 is
 just
 getting
 cheaper


and
 cheaper
 and
 cheaper
 the
 more
 we


deploy
 it.
 And
 so
 we're
 happy
 we're


energy
 secure
 or
 more
 than
 we
 were.
 But


of
 course
 in
 the
 glo
 and
 this
 is


irreversible
 now
 in
 the
 UK.
 It's
 led
 to


utility
 companies
 re
 realize
 they're


sitting
 on
 a
 an
 asset
 they're
 not
 using


and
 it's
 expensive
 just
 to
 keep
 it


there.
 So
 they
 destroy
 the
 coal
 burning


power
 stations.
 But
 in
 the
 global


picture,
 we
 obviously
 want
 to
 think


about
 these
 fantastic
 amplifiers.
 The


more
 solar
 panels
 we
 make,
 the
 cheaper


as
 well
 as
 the
 better
 they
 get.
 And
 then


this
 is
 the
 famous
 curve
 for
 solar


panels,
 the
 learning
 curve.
 They
 come


down
 in
 price
 a
 quarter
 for
 every


doubling
 of
 installed
 capacity.
 And
 the


installed
 capacity
 is
 doubling
 about


every
 two
 years
 at
 the
 moment.
 So
 this


is
 a
 phenomenal
 amplifier
 in
 the
 system.


Our
 modeling
 suggests
 that
 it's
 now


we're
 now
 in
 an
 inevitable
 or
 tipping
 to


solar
 p
 becoming
 the
 dominant
 source
 of


electricity
 by
 midcentury.
 We
 pro
 we
 can


all
 agree
 we
 need
 still
 need
 to
 go


faster.
 Um
 but
 yeah
 the
 calculations


from
 the
 team
 at
 exter


23
 solar
 or
 wind
 was
 the
 cheapest
 source


of
 power
 factoring
 the
 price
 of
 battery


storage
 in
 much
 of
 the
 world.
 They're


both
 getting
 cheaper,
 but
 solar's


getting
 cheaper
 faster,
 which
 is
 why


it's
 set
 to
 dominate.
 So,
 there's
 one


more
 thing
 to
 say.
 There's
 a
 good
 news


story.
 I
 told
 you
 about
 bad
 tipping


cascades
 in
 the
 climate,
 but
 there's
 a


good
 news
 story
 that
 positive
 tipping


points
 in
 different
 sectors
 of
 the


economy
 can
 start
 to
 reinforce
 one


another.
 So
 I
 told
 you
 that
 those


batteries
 that
 are
 coming
 overwhelmingly


out
 of
 the
 car
 sector
 um
 are
 really


helpful
 in
 supporting
 the
 transition
 to


renewables
 depressing
 the
 price
 of


electricity
 storage.
 But
 obviously
 as


renewable
 electricity
 gets
 cheaper
 that


incentivize
 even
 more
 driving
 around
 in


an
 electric
 vehicle
 it's
 even
 cheaper
 to


move
 around
 than
 it
 was.
 Same
 for


electrifying
 uh
 trucks
 and
 for


residential
 heating.
 So
 without
 going


into
 all
 the
 details
 we
 model
 this
 stuff


out.
 We
 model
 uh
 in
 71
 world
 regions
 um


with
 the
 best
 data
 we
 can
 to
 calibrate


the
 model.
 Um
 what
 would
 what
 would


happen
 to
 the
 power
 sector,
 heating,
 uh


cars
 and
 trucks
 under
 the
 current


policies
 heading
 out
 to
 2050?
 Well,
 the


power
 sector
 is
 tipping
 anyway.
 Um
 but


I'm
 afraid
 trucking
 certainly
 isn't.


Cars
 is
 um
 and
 are
 we
 getting
 heat


pumps?
 We
 can
 look
 at
 the
 effects
 of


carbon
 pricing
 at
 200
 euros
 per
 ton
 of


CO2
 from
 2025
 onwards.
 It
 does
 something


but
 not
 a
 great
 deal.
 Uh
 the
 simple


take-home
 message
 from
 looking
 at


different
 policy
 options
 is
 in
 in
 our


work,
 the
 way
 to
 stimulate
 the


innovation
 that
 activates
 the
 amplifying


feedbacks
 of
 learning
 by
 doing
 and
 in


economies
 of
 scale
 is
 for
 leaders,


policy
 makers
 to
 have
 the
 courage
 to


mandate
 the
 phasing
 out
 of
 the
 fossil


fuel
 technologies
 and
 the
 phasing
 in
 of


the
 clean
 technologies.
 So
 ban
 the
 sale


of
 petrol
 and
 diesel
 cars
 in
 your


market,
 banning
 gas
 boilers
 at
 some


point
 in
 the
 future,
 banning
 diesel


trucks
 and
 so
 on.
 that
 is
 overwhelmingly


the
 most
 powerful
 policy
 lever
 to


activate
 the
 feedbacks
 that
 can


positively
 tip
 the
 system.
 So
 to


summarize,
 I
 tried
 to
 tell
 you
 that
 we


sadly
 we've
 already
 crossed
 an
 important


climate
 tipping
 point
 and
 every
 fraction


of
 a
 degree
 of
 warming
 and
 every
 year


over
 one
 and
 a
 half
 degrees
 of
 warming


is
 going
 to
 increase
 the
 risk
 of


crossing
 more
 of
 those.
 I've
 tried
 to


show
 you
 that
 uh
 the
 big
 bad
 one,
 the


amo
 collapse
 could
 happen
 below
 two


degrees
 C
 of
 warming.
 it
 gets
 more


likely
 the
 more
 it
 gets
 warmer.
 And
 I've


been
 polite
 in
 saying
 it
 would
 make


Northwest
 Europe
 less
 habitable.
 I
 was


tempted
 to
 say
 uninhabitable.
 It
 was
 and


could
 cause
 global
 food
 insecurity.
 So


that's
 the
 kind
 of
 risk
 we
 have
 to
 do


everything
 in
 our
 power
 to
 avoid.
 But


unfortunately,
 we
 can't
 change
 we
 can't


get
 out
 of
 trouble
 by
 changing


incrementally.
 The
 numbers
 just
 do
 not


stack
 up.
 The
 only
 way
 now
 to
 meet
 the


Paris
 agreement
 to
 limit
 warming,


whatever
 you
 mean
 by
 well
 below
 two


degrees
 C,
 is
 to
 activate
 some
 positive


tipping
 points
 that
 accelerate
 the


change
 we
 need.
 But
 I
 tried
 to
 show
 you


that
 already
 that's
 happening
 in
 some


key
 markets
 and
 sectors
 and
 we
 know


something
 about
 the
 policies,
 the


actions
 that
 can
 be
 most
 effective
 in


bringing
 those
 tipping
 points
 forward.


Thank
 you
 very
 much.


Thank
 you.
 Thank
 you
 so
 much.
 It
 was


very
 interesting
 to
 hear
 your


presentation.


Our
 next
 speaker
 is
 Professor
 Laura


Starks.
 She
 is
 professor
 of
 finance
 at


the
 University
 of
 Texas
 and
 one
 of
 the


world's
 leading
 authorities
 on


sustainable
 finance
 and
 ESG
 investing.


Professor
 Starks
 has
 had
 a
 long
 and


distinguished
 collaboration
 with


Norusbank
 Investment
 Management.
 For


more
 than
 a
 decade,
 she
 has
 contributed


to
 the
 fund's
 responsible
 investment


strategy.
 She
 will
 talk
 about
 the
 role


climate
 information
 has
 in
 investment


decisions.


>> Thank
 you.
 Thank
 you
 very
 much.
 This
 has


been
 just
 a
 fascinating
 day
 and
 we've


learned
 so
 much
 about
 climate
 change
 and


policy
 and
 I
 want
 to
 talk
 about


um
 the
 the
 how
 climate
 information
 is


used
 in
 investment
 decisions
 and
 and
 and


what
 we
 know
 about
 this
 from
 academic


research.


So
 before
 talking
 about
 that,
 I
 think
 we


have
 to
 think
 about
 the
 motivations


because
 the
 motivations
 for


incorporating
 climate
 information


vary
 across
 investors
 in
 fact
 can
 vary


quite
 a
 bit
 and
 um
 and
 we
 have
 evidence


on
 this
 from
 both
 surveys
 as
 well
 as
 um


uh
 what
 investors
 have
 done.
 So
 their


actions


um
 so
 the
 motivations
 depend
 on
 the


perspective
 of
 the
 investor.
 So
 it
 can


be
 a
 values
 perspective,
 it
 can
 be
 a


value
 perspective


and
 and
 when
 we
 when
 we
 think
 about
 the


values
 perspective
 that
 has
 to
 do
 with


non-puniary,
 non-financial,
 it's
 it's


people's
 it's
 it's
 what
 they
 value.
 And


so
 if
 we
 think
 about
 the
 um
 the
 actually


the
 council
 on
 ethics
 is
 an
 example
 of


this
 where
 decisions
 are
 being
 made


based
 on
 values.


The
 value
 perspective
 is
 what
 we
 think


about
 with
 investors.
 What
 they
 make


their
 decisions
 based
 on
 is
 looking
 at


the
 financial
 information
 thinking
 about


how
 this
 the
 risk
 and
 return


opportunities
 that
 come
 from
 using
 the


climate
 information.
 So
 we
 have
 these


two
 differences
 and
 I
 think


I
 think
 this
 is
 understood
 in
 Norway.
 I


think
 there
 are
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 in
 my


country
 that
 do
 not
 understand
 these


differences.
 Um
 but
 it's
 it's
 important


when
 we're
 looking
 at
 how
 they're
 how


these
 decisions
 are
 being
 made.
 So
 I


want
 to
 use
 a
 survey
 of
 um
 large


institutional
 investors
 to
 point
 out


some
 of
 the
 differences
 in
 their


motivations.
 So
 we
 surveyed
 um
 439
 large


institutional
 investors
 around
 the
 world


asking
 them
 why
 they
 incorporated


climate
 risk
 information
 into
 their


investment
 decisions.
 And
 this
 shows
 the


top
 um
 six,
 seven
 of
 these.
 Uh
 and
 and


actually
 we
 had
 expected
 that
 we
 would


find
 one
 that
 would
 would
 be
 more
 than


the
 others,
 but
 they
 could
 choose
 more


than
 one.
 But
 even
 with
 that,
 we
 found


quite
 a
 bit
 of
 variety
 in
 what
 they


chose.
 And
 we
 can
 separate
 these
 into


values
 versus
 value
 perspectives.


So
 if
 we
 think
 about
 the
 value


perspective,
 it's
 um
 uh
 you
 know
 what


are
 what
 are
 the
 uh
 return


opportunities?
 It's
 it's
 beneficial
 to


investment
 return.
 Um
 it
 reduces
 overall


portfolio
 risk.
 It
 reduces
 tail
 risk.


These
 are
 clearly
 financial
 value


motivations.


On
 the
 other
 hand,
 there
 are
 values


motivations
 where
 they're
 looking
 at
 um


is
 you
 know
 what
 are
 the
 asset
 owner's


preferences?
 Is
 it
 a
 moral
 ethical


obligation?
 Um
 and
 so
 those
 two,
 you


know,
 would
 be
 would
 be
 um
 the
 value
 and


then
 there
 are
 two
 that
 I
 think
 are
 a


blend.
 It's
 it's
 it's
 both
 values
 and


value
 that
 protects
 our
 reputation
 and


it's
 a
 legal
 obligation
 fiduciary
 duty.


So
 when
 we
 think
 about
 the
 motivations,


we
 need
 to
 think
 about
 this
 variety
 of


motivations
 across
 institutional


investors.


We
 also
 can
 see
 evidence
 from
 investor


actions.
 In
 other
 words,
 you
 know,
 what


what
 are
 the
 portfolios
 that
 they're


holding?
 Um
 and
 and
 again,
 we
 can
 see


the
 motivations
 from
 these
 and
 then
 how


do
 they
 change
 their
 portfolio.
 So
 I'm


going
 to
 give
 you
 a
 couple
 of
 examples


just
 to
 just
 to
 show
 this.


uh
 one
 is
 some
 research
 that
 I've
 done


that
 we
 wanted
 to
 test
 the
 hypothesis


that
 long-term
 institutional
 investors


should
 be
 the
 ones
 most
 interested
 in


the
 environmental,
 social
 and
 governance


policies
 of
 their
 uh
 invest
 investy


firms.
 And
 so
 again,
 the
 the
 fund
 is
 um


a
 real
 example
 of
 this
 long-term


investor
 that
 is
 is
 looking
 at
 the
 ESNG


uh
 aspects
 of
 their
 portfolios.
 So
 what


this
 graph
 shows
 is
 um
 along
 here,
 this


is
 measuring
 the
 average
 portfolio
 ESG


score.
 So
 taking
 all
 of
 the
 firms
 that


are
 in
 their
 portfolio
 and
 measuring
 the


ESG
 score
 and
 then


uh
 and
 then
 we
 used
 their
 portfolios
 to


determine
 well
 what
 were
 their
 horizons?


How
 long
 were
 they
 holding
 the
 the


firms?
 And
 as
 you
 can
 see,
 it
 was
 really


clear
 that
 it's
 those
 with
 the
 long-term


horizon
 that
 that
 are
 are
 um
 holding
 the


high
 ESG
 firms
 and
 you
 know
 the
 E
 one
 of


the
 big
 things
 in
 there
 is
 climate


change
 and
 then
 um
 and
 then
 the


shortterm
 horizon
 and
 it
 you
 know
 it
 was


very
 monotonic
 um
 in
 terms
 of
 how
 this


how
 this
 came
 out.
 So
 that's
 some


evidence
 of
 how
 uh
 information
 is
 being


used
 by
 the
 investors.
 Another
 one
 is


more
 directly
 related
 and
 this
 comes


from
 the
 bond
 market.
 So
 what
 happened


when
 the
 Paris
 agreement
 was
 signed?


The
 the
 regulatory
 risk
 would
 be


expected
 to
 go
 up
 because


um
 the
 the
 firms
 that
 that
 were
 most


exposed
 to
 climate
 change
 exposure
 are


going
 to
 are
 going
 to
 have
 face
 more


regulations
 in
 order
 for
 countries
 to
 be


able
 to
 meet
 what
 they
 promised
 they


would
 do.
 So
 we
 looked
 at
 price
 changes


uh
 for
 those
 bonds
 and
 we
 also
 looked
 at


at
 the
 credit
 rating
 analyst
 changes
 in


uh
 credit
 ratings
 and
 we
 found
 that
 and


and
 here
 I'm
 showing
 we
 did
 very


sophisticated
 analysis.
 This
 one
 I
 think


it
 just
 shows
 through
 so
 clearly.
 So
 we


So
 if
 you
 look
 um
 this
 has
 the
 largest


carbon
 emission
 industries


uh
 and
 and
 what
 their
 credit
 ratings


look
 like
 before
 and
 after
 uh
 the
 Paris


agreement


uh
 and
 I'm
 I'm
 sorry
 this
 is
 their


spreads
 what
 their
 yield
 spreads
 on
 the


bonds
 look
 like
 what
 return
 was
 being


required
 um
 and
 and
 so
 like
 electric
 gas


and
 sanitary
 petrol
 petroleum
 and
 coal


oil
 gas
 extraction
 and
 so
 forth.
 Uh
 and


the
 blue
 is
 the
 average
 spread
 before


the
 Paris
 agreement.
 The
 red
 is
 the


average
 spare
 spread
 after
 the
 Paris


agreement.
 And
 if
 we
 look
 at
 a
 couple
 of


industries,
 the
 oil
 and
 gas
 extraction,


not
 surprisingly,


it
 it
 the
 the
 yield
 spread
 went
 up.
 In


other
 words,
 people
 had
 to
 be
 uh


compensated.
 The
 bond
 investors
 needed


to
 be
 compensated
 for
 the
 greater
 risk


that
 they
 were
 taking
 on.
 And
 then
 if
 we


look
 at
 um
 the
 metal
 mining
 industry,


you
 can
 see
 that
 before
 the
 um
 the
 Paris


agreement
 uh
 uh
 it
 was
 it
 was
 uh
 the


spreads
 were
 lower
 than
 after.
 Again,


more
 risk
 was
 being
 taken
 on.


This
 is
 looking
 at
 the
 credit
 ratings


and
 looking
 what
 happened
 at
 the
 credit


rating.
 So
 this
 is
 taking
 it
 on
 a


monthly
 basis


using
 other
 um
 other
 firms
 as
 control.


And
 so
 this
 blue
 line
 shows
 what


happened
 to
 the
 credit
 ratings
 where


this
 red
 line
 in
 the
 middle
 is
 the
 uh


the
 month
 of
 the
 of
 the
 Paris
 agreement.


And
 as
 you
 can
 see
 there
 there
 was


basically
 no
 difference
 before
 the
 Paris


agreement
 in
 terms
 of


um
 the
 the
 um
 the
 credit
 ratings
 and


then
 after
 the
 Paris
 agreement
 there
 was


a
 big
 drop
 in
 credit
 ratings
 for
 those


firms
 that
 were
 most
 exposed
 to
 carbon


emissions.
 And
 we
 used
 a
 number
 of


different
 uh
 we
 used
 carbon
 intensity,


those
 that
 had
 the
 top
 carbon
 intensity,


those
 that
 had
 the
 top
 absolute
 carbon


emissions,
 and
 those
 that
 had
 below
 uh


median
 environmental
 score.
 And
 all
 of


the
 pictures
 look
 the
 same.


Okay.
 So
 if
 we
 if
 we
 one
 of
 the
 things


that
 we
 ask
 in
 the
 survey
 is
 what
 what


approaches
 do
 you
 use
 to
 incorporate


climate
 risk
 information
 into
 your


investment
 decision
 making
 and
 the
 top


one
 was
 analyzing
 the
 carbon
 footprint


of
 portfolio
 firms.
 38%
 did
 that
 and


then
 out
 of
 out
 of
 the
 total


29%


use
 that
 information
 to
 reduce
 the


carbon
 footprint
 of
 their
 portfolio


firm.
 So
 they're
 using
 um
 carbon


emissions
 data
 to
 understand
 the
 the


risk
 that
 these
 firms
 are
 facing
 because


of
 um
 the
 carbon
 emissions
 and
 also
 the


values
 investors
 are
 going
 to
 be
 using


this
 in
 order
 to
 understand
 the
 impact


that
 these
 firms
 are
 having
 on
 the


environment.


Uh
 and
 then
 another
 one
 was
 uh
 uh
 Tim


was
 talking
 about
 the
 the
 stranded
 asset


risk.
 Well,
 they
 analyzed
 their
 stranded


35%
 analyze
 their
 stranded
 asset
 risk


and


um
 23%


took
 efforts
 to
 reduce
 that
 stranded


asset
 risk.


Uh
 we
 also
 found
 they
 had
 they
 had


others
 you
 know
 just
 diversifying
 their


portfolio
 or
 or
 using
 ESG
 integration


which
 would
 which
 would
 take
 into


account
 um
 the
 environmental
 part
 of
 it.


Um
 and
 and
 but
 one
 of
 the
 things
 that


was
 somewhat
 striking
 about
 this
 was


devestment
 that
 not
 many
 were
 using


devestment
 as
 a
 tool
 for
 um
 for


incorporating
 climate
 risk.


Okay.
 So,
 I
 want
 to
 talk
 about
 climate


risk
 disclosure
 because
 in
 order
 to
 get


the
 information
 that's
 needed
 on
 the
 the


the
 climate
 information
 about
 a
 company,


there
 needs
 to
 be
 adequate
 disclosure.


So,
 if
 you
 think
 about
 the
 disclosure,


you
 know,
 the
 financial
 market


efficiency
 depends
 on
 having
 enough


information.
 And
 not
 only
 does
 there


need
 to
 be
 enough
 information,
 but
 it


needs
 to
 be
 high
 quality
 information


um
 and
 and
 for
 us
 to
 to
 be
 able
 to
 to


incorporate
 that
 information
 and
 for
 the


the
 market
 to
 correctly
 price
 um
 the
 the


carbon
 risk
 and
 then
 it's
 also
 being
 uh


in
 a
 central
 bank.
 We
 need
 sound


disclosure
 on
 climate
 risk
 which
 is
 as
 I


would
 argue
 is
 essential
 for
 regulatory


efforts
 to
 protect
 um
 financial


stability.
 So
 so
 so
 there's
 a
 need
 for


this
 climate
 risk
 disclosure


uh
 which
 is
 varies
 around
 the
 world
 and


how
 much
 there
 there
 needs
 to
 be.
 Um
 so


we
 asked
 the
 investors


what
 they
 thought
 about
 the
 need
 for


climate
 risk
 disclosure
 compared
 to


regular
 financial
 reporting.
 Um
 so
 this


is
 so
 so
 we
 ask
 how
 important
 do
 you


think
 climate
 risk
 disclosure
 is


compared
 to
 reporting
 on
 financial


information?


51%
 said
 it
 was
 equal.
 18%
 said
 it
 was


more
 important
 and
 10%
 said
 it
 was
 much


more
 important.


Uh
 so
 79%
 believed
 that
 it
 was
 at
 least


as
 important
 as
 financial
 reporting.
 Now


I
 do
 have
 to
 caution
 you
 that
 our
 our


survey
 people
 were
 more
 likely
 to


respond
 to
 this
 survey
 if
 they
 were


interested
 in
 climate
 risk.
 So
 we
 do


have
 a
 little
 bias
 in
 this
 survey.
 But
 I


would
 also
 argue
 that
 these
 are
 the


investors
 who
 are
 going
 to
 be


incorporating
 climate
 risk
 the
 most.
 So


they're
 the
 ones
 we
 wanted
 to
 understand


the
 most.


Okay.
 So
 if
 you
 think
 about
 mandatory


climate
 risk
 disclosure
 there
 there
 can


be
 two
 goals
 again
 we
 have
 we
 can
 have


we
 can
 have
 mixed
 um
 goals
 from
 the


investors
 who
 want
 this.
 The
 first
 goal


is
 often
 called
 single
 materiality
 and


it's
 you
 know
 it's
 to
 get
 the


information
 in
 order
 to
 understand
 how


climate
 risk
 is
 affecting
 the
 firm
 and


its
 risk.
 Um
 so
 this
 I
 would
 argue
 is
 a


value
 perspective.


The
 second
 goal
 which
 is
 can
 be
 called


double
 materiality
 is
 not
 only
 how
 does


it
 affect
 the
 firm
 and
 its
 risk
 but
 how


is
 this
 impacting
 um
 the
 firm's
 actions


are
 affecting
 society
 and
 the


environment.
 So,
 you
 know,
 this
 I
 would


argue
 includes
 the
 values
 perspective.


Um,
 so,
 so
 these
 are
 these
 are
 two


important
 goals
 for
 having
 mandatory


climate
 risk
 disclosure.


But
 there
 are
 challenges
 in
 this
 climate


risk
 information
 and
 people
 don't
 always


think
 about
 these
 challenges.
 The
 first


one
 is
 what
 do
 you
 use
 if
 you're
 trying


to
 compare
 firms
 in
 terms
 of
 their


emissions?


Um
 do
 you
 use
 uh
 an
 environmental
 score?


Do
 you
 use
 um
 absolute
 carbon
 emissions?


Do
 you
 use
 carbon
 intensity?
 And
 one


thing
 that's
 very
 important
 about
 this


is
 there's
 a
 debate
 in
 the
 academic


finance
 literature
 over
 which
 is
 the


appropriate
 thing
 to
 use
 because
 if
 you


think
 about
 the
 absolute
 carbon


emissions


that's
 well
 how
 far
 do
 you
 have
 to
 go
 to


to
 to
 get
 to
 net
 zero.
 So
 it
 tells
 you


something
 about
 about
 the
 risk.
 Whereas


if
 you
 use
 carbon
 intensity,
 then
 your


your
 um
 uh
 you've
 got
 either
 sales
 or
 um


assets
 underneath.
 So
 so
 you
 may
 be


lowering
 how
 much
 this
 company
 is
 doing


because
 you're
 not
 looking
 at
 their


absolute
 emissions.


There's
 also
 availability
 and
 biases
 in


the
 data.
 Um
 bec
 based
 on
 these
 we
 have


um
 the
 voluntary
 disclosure.
 you're
 so


for
 example
 with
 um
 CDP
 you're
 going
 to


have
 fewer
 firms
 and
 as
 I'm
 going
 to


show
 you
 some
 potential
 selection
 bias


if
 um
 there's
 other
 sources
 for


estimation
 estimated
 emissions
 but
 then


the
 problem
 with
 that
 is
 well
 what's


being
 used
 to
 estimate
 the
 emissions
 and


if
 we
 have
 this
 bias
 from
 the
 voluntary


disclosure
 then
 what
 kind
 of
 bias
 do
 we


have
 in
 the
 estimation
 proced
 procedure.


So
 it's
 an
 important
 question
 that
 needs


to
 be
 considered.
 If
 we
 had
 mandatory


climate
 risk
 disclosure
 then
 we
 would


not
 have
 this
 issue.
 Um
 and
 so
 let
 me


give
 you
 an
 example.
 This
 is
 um
 from
 um


the
 CDP
 and
 you
 can
 see
 the
 the
 pink


here
 is
 um
 uh
 climate,
 the
 blue
 is


water,
 the
 green
 is
 forest
 and
 then


they've
 just
 started
 uh
 getting
 the
 let


me
 get
 this
 biodiversity
 and
 um
 and


plastics.
 And
 so
 you
 can
 see
 let's
 just


take
 the
 climate
 one.
 there
 has
 been


this
 increase
 over
 time
 um
 this
 on
 a


worldwide
 basis
 but
 it's
 obvious
 there


are
 a
 lot
 of
 firms
 that
 have
 not
 been


reporting
 and
 so
 we
 are
 missing
 those


firms
 and
 which
 firms
 are
 the
 ones
 that


are
 less
 likely
 to
 report
 they're
 going


to
 be
 the
 ones
 that
 we
 probably
 really


want
 to
 know
 their
 information


um
 and
 and
 to
 give
 you
 another
 example


of
 This


uh
 this
 is
 from
 the
 CDP's
 uh
 website
 and


it
 shows
 um
 this
 is
 the
 most
 recent
 data


on
 their
 carbon
 emissions
 coverage
 and


it
 shows


you
 know
 for
 the
 for
 the
 Footsie
 Euro


first
 300
 91%
 of
 the
 firms
 are
 reporting


to
 CDP
 S&P
 500
 it's
 still
 just
 86%.


Um
 if
 we
 look
 at
 the
 world
 index
 from


MSCI
 it's
 only
 61%.


If
 we
 look
 at
 Australia
 it's
 27%.


And
 then
 if
 we
 look
 at
 at
 Shanghai
 it's


18%.


So
 we're
 missing
 the
 reporting
 from
 a


number
 of
 firms.
 Um,


it's
 also
 if
 the
 EPA
 in
 the
 US
 uh
 tells


firms
 they
 don't
 have
 to
 report
 their


emissions
 anymore
 to
 the
 EPA,
 we're


going
 to
 have
 even
 less
 information


which
 makes
 it
 more
 difficult
 for


investors.


Okay.
 So,
 so
 one
 other
 thing
 that


investors
 do
 is
 engagement.


um
 they
 the
 investors
 are
 are
 um
 using


the
 climate
 information
 to
 engage
 with


the
 firms
 to
 try
 to
 to
 get
 the
 firms
 to


be
 more
 responsible
 when
 it
 comes
 to


climate
 change.
 Um
 and
 it
 it's
 one
 thing


that
 the
 fund
 does
 and
 has
 for
 many


years.
 So,
 so
 we
 ask
 well
 what
 are
 you


doing
 in
 terms
 of
 engagement
 and
 um
 and


we
 found
 that
 43%


are
 holding
 discussions
 with
 management


uh
 about
 the
 financial
 implications
 of


of
 climate
 risk.
 32%
 are
 proposing


specific
 actions
 to
 management
 on


climate
 risk
 issues.
 Um
 and
 then
 30%


um
 vote
 against
 management


on
 on
 proposals
 at
 the
 annual
 meeting.


Um
 and
 30%
 also
 were
 submitting


shareholder
 proposals
 on
 climate
 risk


issues.
 And
 then
 uh
 30%
 were
 questioning


management
 on
 a
 conference
 call
 about


climate
 risk
 issues.
 And
 there's


evidence
 that
 those
 questions
 uh
 were


really
 ramping
 up
 over
 time
 uh
 showing


the
 the
 interest
 in
 that.
 Um
 we
 found


that
 only
 16%
 did
 nothing.


So
 84%


of
 the
 um
 investors
 that
 we
 surveyed
 are


engaging
 the
 firms
 in
 various
 ways
 to


try
 to
 get
 more
 climate
 information
 and


to
 get
 them
 to
 be
 more
 responsible.
 when


it
 came
 to
 climate


uh
 we
 also
 found
 that
 it
 can
 make
 a


difference
 when
 it
 becomes
 mandatory
 to


release
 the
 information.
 So
 when
 the
 um


French
 article
 173
 was
 passed
 in
 2015


um
 went
 into
 effect
 in
 2016.


It's
 really
 an
 interesting
 article


because
 what
 it
 said
 was


or
 law
 what
 it
 said
 was
 that
 the
 um
 the


institutional
 investors
 had
 to
 report
 on


on
 the
 climate
 risk
 of
 their
 portfolios.


There
 was
 no
 law
 about
 the
 firms
 doing


this
 only
 the
 investors
 but
 the


investors
 would
 have
 to
 get
 the


information
 from
 the
 firms
 in
 order
 to


be
 able
 to
 report
 correctly.
 Um
 and
 so


what
 we
 found
 was
 the
 climate
 risk


disclosure
 of
 firms
 that
 were
 held
 more


by
 French
 institutions


um
 uh
 went
 up
 significantly.
 They


disclose
 much
 more.
 So
 so
 there
 is
 this


again
 this
 is
 shows
 that
 there
 can
 be
 an


indirect
 effect
 from
 um


uh
 from
 uh
 um
 mandatory
 climate
 change.


Okay.
 So
 another
 thing
 about
 engagement


is
 does
 it
 work?
 So
 we
 looked
 at
 the


engagement
 of
 one
 big
 um
 uh
 company
 and


um
 investor
 and
 and
 whether
 they
 were


successful
 and
 we
 looked
 at
 the
 downside


risk
 of
 whether
 they
 were
 successful.
 Um


and
 um
 what
 we
 found
 was


that
 their
 engagements
 that
 had
 to
 do


with
 sustainability
 and
 particularly


climate
 change
 uh
 reduced
 the
 downside


risk
 which
 we
 measured
 in
 various
 ways


and
 the
 risk
 reduction
 effects
 were


stronger
 for
 the
 more
 successful


engagements
 and
 they
 were
 also
 stronger


uh
 when
 when
 it
 was
 environmental


particularly
 climate
 change.


Okay.
 So
 overall
 the
 um
 uh
 in
 terms
 of


what
 we
 know
 about
 about
 climate
 risk


information,
 investors
 care
 about


climate
 risk.
 They
 um
 they
 use
 and
 value


climate
 risk
 information.
 Um
 their


motivations
 for
 doing
 so
 varies
 between


the
 value
 and
 values
 perspective
 and
 I


think
 that's
 an
 important
 thing
 to
 keep


in
 mind.
 Um
 they
 employ
 a
 number
 of


different
 approaches
 um
 in
 their
 use
 of


the
 climate
 risk
 information.


We
 still
 have
 challenges
 that
 exist
 with


the
 lack
 of
 information
 and
 investor


engagement
 on
 climate
 risk
 has
 been


successful.
 So,
 thank
 you
 very
 much.


Thank
 you
 so
 much
 for
 your
 very


informative
 insights.


We
 are
 now
 close
 to
 the
 end
 of
 this


conference
 and
 the
 final
 speaker
 will


enlighten
 us
 on
 the
 risk
 and
 return
 of


climate
 investments.
 It
 is
 my
 privilege


to
 introduce
 Professor
 Harrison
 Hong


from
 Columbia
 University.
 His
 honors


include
 the
 Fiser
 Black
 Prize
 awarded
 to


the
 most
 outstanding
 American
 finance


economist
 under
 the
 age
 of
 40.
 His


contributions
 have
 been
 fundamental
 to


behavioral
 finance
 and
 stock
 market


efficiency
 and
 have
 shaped
 how
 we


understand
 financial
 markets.
 Professors


Hong's
 collaboration
 with
 Nisbank


Investment
 Management
 and
 his
 pioneering


work
 in
 climate
 finance
 stretch
 back


nearly
 a
 decade.
 Please
 give
 a
 warm


welcome
 to
 Harrison
 Hong.


>> Great.
 Thanks
 so
 much.
 Uh
 thanks
 so
 much


for
 having
 me.
 Um
 so
 I'm
 going
 to
 uh


wrap
 up
 and
 uh
 I
 think
 I
 was
 given
 the


uh
 the
 mandate
 of
 uh
 just
 you
 know
 say


something
 about
 everybody's
 talk


basically
 and
 just
 wrap
 up
 so
 we
 can
 all


leave.
 Uh
 so
 uh
 I'm
 going
 to
 l
 luckily


luckily
 I
 and
 this
 was
 like
 purely
 by


coincidence.
 I'm
 going
 to
 pick
 up
 on


Christine
 Lagard's
 speech
 which
 I


thought
 was
 really
 amazing
 and
 I
 think


it
 really
 kind
 of
 highlights
 uh
 really


just
 so
 perfectly
 uh
 of
 the
 key
 issues


we
 we
 face
 you
 know
 in
 Europe
 I
 think
 in


the
 US
 and
 globally
 uh
 regarding
 kind
 of


the
 types
 of
 climate
 investments
 that
 um


that
 that
 that
 we
 have
 to
 kind
 of
 think


about
 making
 and
 and
 and
 how
 should
 we


think
 about
 making
 these
 investments.
 Um


all
 right
 so
 let
 me
 just
 start
 with
 so


you
 know
 I
 think
 the
 conventional
 wisdom


uh
 at
 least
 sort
 of
 as
 as
 as
 as
 sort
 of


um
 a
 more
 novice
 climate
 economics
 uh


finance
 researcher
 is
 that
 look
 you
 know


concerns
 about
 global
 warming
 uh
 about


climate
 disasters
 is
 going
 to
 kind
 of


push
 societies
 uh
 toward
 embracing


renewables.
 Okay,
 moving
 away
 from


fossil
 fuels
 and
 and
 going
 to
 uh
 kind
 of


wind
 and
 solar.
 uh
 this
 you
 know
 is


primarily
 going
 to
 happen
 uh
 at
 least


you
 know
 historically
 through


governments
 you
 know
 fiscalizing
 and


subsidizing
 uh
 this
 transition.
 So
 like


I
 think
 for
 instance
 in
 in in
 Europe
 you


know
 feed
 and
 tariffs
 particularly
 in


Germany
 have
 been
 a
 huge
 tool
 towards


getting
 the
 German
 economy
 to
 to
 to


embrace
 renewables.
 Uh
 in
 the
 US
 uh
 it's


been
 more
 like
 renewable
 portfolio


standards
 especially
 in
 liberal
 states


in
 the
 US
 that
 really
 powered
 uh
 uh
 the


transition.
 So
 that
 if
 you
 look
 at
 the


power
 sector,
 you
 know,
 the
 news
 is
 not


sort
 of
 horrible,
 right?
 I
 mean,
 even
 in


the
 United
 States,
 absent
 like
 a
 sort
 of


this
 antipathy
 towards
 climate
 concerns,


you
 know,
 we're
 still
 getting
 about


close
 to
 now
 almost
 maybe
 30
 40%
 of
 the


power
 in
 the
 US
 is
 is
 is
 renewable


power.
 And
 you
 know,
 I
 think
 kind
 of
 the


second
 layer
 of
 the
 story
 is
 that
 I


think,
 you
 know,
 people
 recognize
 that


this
 is
 probably
 kind
 of
 not
 enough.
 And


so
 we're
 going
 to
 lean
 on
 other
 stuff.


So,
 so
 in
 the
 medium
 term
 before
 we
 get


all
 these
 amazing
 uh
 carbon
 sucking


machines
 from
 Bill
 Gates,
 uh
 we're
 going


to
 have
 to
 lean
 on
 mother
 nature
 to


provide
 some
 solutions,
 right?
 This
 is


sort
 of
 NBS,
 these
 naturebased


solutions.
 And
 you
 know,
 that's
 going
 to


fill
 in
 some
 of
 the
 gap.
 And
 I
 think
 a


lot
 of
 that
 is
 driving
 you
 know
 this


this
 uh
 a
 lot
 of
 uh
 practical
 research


on
 how
 do
 we
 measure
 the
 capture
 of
 uh


the
 sequestration
 of
 carbon
 uh
 by
 by


restoring
 uh
 ecosystems
 and
 also
 uh
 the


extent
 to
 which
 uh
 um
 we
 can
 kind
 of


develop
 voluntary
 credit
 uh
 carbon


markets
 to
 kind
 of
 facilitate


essentially
 uh
 uh
 this
 this this
 type
 of


solution.
 and
 and and
 you
 know
 kind
 of


in
 the
 background
 uh
 there's
 some
 sense


that
 we're
 going
 to
 need
 adaptation
 uh


right
 uh
 and
 I
 think
 as
 Saul
 mentioned


earlier
 you
 know
 we
 don't
 see
 a
 lot
 of


evidence
 of
 of
 kind
 of
 adaptation
 yet


but
 but
 we
 know
 that
 this
 stuff
 exists


right
 so
 you
 know
 ultimately
 you
 know


we're
 going
 to
 need
 some
 seaw
 walls
 if


the
 sea
 levels
 keep
 rising
 uh
 maybe
 we


put
 some
 you
 know
 houses
 on
 stilts
 uh


you
 know
 obviously
 we
 can
 come
 up
 with


more
 ways
 of
 doing
 uh
 air
 conditioning


etc
 etc
 okay
 but
 but
 typically


adaptation
 is
 not
 I
 think
 front
 and


center
 relative
 to
 mitigation,
 you
 know,


because
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 private


incentives
 to
 adapt,
 right?
 You
 know,
 so


you
 don't
 think
 about
 it
 in
 kind
 of
 this


this
 this
 kind
 of
 real
 uh
 it's
 not
 front


and
 center
 in
 climate
 economics
 because


there's
 just
 a
 lot
 of
 incentives
 at
 a


private
 level
 to
 do
 some
 adaptation.


Okay.
 Uh
 so,
 so
 let
 me
 show
 you
 this


picture
 uh
 kind
 of
 you
 know
 this
 this


morning
 I
 I
 had
 to
 submit
 new
 slides


because
 after
 I
 saw
 these
 other
 people's


slides,
 I
 felt
 very
 jealous
 that
 I
 did


not
 have
 enough
 figures.
 So
 I
 quickly
 I


quickly
 got
 chachi
 to
 kind
 of
 make
 a


figure
 for
 me
 which
 probably
 caused
 a


huge
 amount
 of
 global
 warming
 with
 the


amount
 of
 energy
 that
 is
 spent
 uh
 to
 do


it
 in
 15
 minutes.
 Uh
 but
 so
 so
 here


here's
 kind
 of
 what
 I
 want
 to
 kind
 of


talk
 about
 which
 is
 you
 know
 all
 of
 this


kind
 of
 conventional
 wisdom
 translates


into
 a
 notion
 of
 a
 green
 investment


thesis
 right
 that
 we're
 going
 to
 go
 from


owning
 a
 bunch
 of
 smoke
 stacks.
 So


remember
 all
 of
 this
 assets
 are
 owned
 by


us
 meaning
 like
 society
 and
 you
 know
 in


aggregate
 some
 smoke
 stacks
 you
 know
 we


own
 a
 bunch
 of
 these
 uh
 uh
 um
 you
 know


uh
 oil
 drilling
 rigs
 you
 know
 and
 we've


got
 a
 bunch
 of
 gu
 you
 know
 car
 guzzlers


and
 and
 and
 we
 have
 very
 you
 know
 uh
 uh


lots
 of
 you
 know
 cement
 uh


infrastructure
 okay
 so
 so
 that's
 a


portfolio
 and
 I
 put
 some
 kind
 of
 tick


ticker
 symbols
 you
 know
 this
 represents


uh
 the
 assets
 that
 society
 has
 owned
 and


that's
 been
 kind
 of
 the
 thing
 of
 this


generated
 so
 much
 uh
 uh
 wealth
 for
 us


right
 during
 the
 indust
 you
 know


following
 the
 industrial
 revolution
 now


with
 kind
 of
 the
 climate
 crisis
 you
 know


we're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 sort
 of
 start


converting
 right
 so
 we're
 going
 to
 not


we're
 not
 going
 to
 have
 the
 smoke
 stacks


we're
 going
 to
 now
 just
 own
 a
 bunch
 of


these
 windmills
 right
 you
 know
 we're


going to
 have
 windmills
 everywhere
 uh


typically
 kind
 of
 off
 the
 coast
 but
 uh


in
 the
 US
 for
 instance
 you
 know
 you


should
 put
 a
 lot
 of
 windmills
 in
 Malibu


but
 of
 course
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 who
 live


in
 Malibu
 don't
 want
 windmills
 in
 Malibu


because
 they
 pay
 millions
 of
 dollars
 uh


for
 their
 homes
 so
 that
 a
 bunch
 of


windmills
 can
 be
 like
 blocking
 their


sides
 of
 the
 ocean,
 right?
 Uh
 so
 we
 have


to
 have
 this
 transition
 into
 sort
 of


owning
 and
 developing
 all
 of
 these
 other


assets.
 Uh
 because
 the
 assets
 might
 also


be
 for
 instance
 of
 course
 we've
 done
 a


much
 better
 job
 with
 owning
 we
 now
 have


more
 uh
 uh
 electric
 vehicles
 and
 that


would
 be
 some
 set
 of
 investments
 and


also
 uh
 we're
 doing
 a
 lot
 more
 with
 like


you
 know
 forest
 and
 reforestation
 etc.


Okay.
 So
 somewhere
 along
 the
 way
 we
 kind


of
 have
 to
 ask
 ourselves
 what
 is
 the


optimal


portfolio
 from
 the
 point
 of
 view
 of


society
 of
 all
 of
 these
 assets.
 Now
 I'm


a
 finance
 economist.
 And
 so
 as
 finance


economists
 everything
 basically
 you
 know


no
 matter
 how
 what
 I
 look
 at
 always


comes
 back
 to
 my
 finance
 economist


training
 which
 is
 of
 course
 risk
 right


when
 we
 own
 these
 assets
 right
 um


you
 know
 it's
 great
 all
 and
 well
 all


these
 issues
 about
 climate
 that's
 what


you
 know
 governments
 are
 supposed
 to


kind
 of
 help
 us
 deal
 with
 but
 from
 the


point
 of
 view
 of
 households
 and
 what's


our
 preference
 for
 the
 allocation
 of


assets
 typically
 what
 you
 want
 is
 you


want
 some
 diversification
 Right?
 You


don't
 want
 to
 be
 too
 loaded
 on
 one
 set


of
 assets
 because
 who
 knows,
 right?


There's
 always
 some
 types
 of
 risk
 that


might
 kind
 of
 happen.
 Okay?
 And
 and
 I


want
 you
 to
 think
 a
 little
 bit
 about


that
 because
 ultimately
 uh
 uh
 uh
 the


problem
 that
 Christine
 Lagard
 talked


about
 was
 was
 res,
 you
 know,
 she
 framed


it
 as,
 you
 know,
 impediments,


right,
 to
 owning
 like
 a
 100%
 of
 our
 our


portfolio
 being
 green
 assets.
 like
 why


aren't
 investors
 embracing
 more
 charging


a
 lower
 cost
 of
 capital
 to
 embrace
 these


kind
 of
 green
 assets?
 What's
 what's


causing
 this?
 And
 I
 think
 she
 kind
 of


mentioned
 appropriately
 uh
 there
 might


be
 kind
 of
 like
 a
 lack
 of
 capital
 market


integration
 might
 in
 Europe
 might
 be


causing
 it.
 But
 the
 other
 explanation
 is


just
 just
 risk,


right?
 uh
 you
 know,
 maybe
 we're
 not


meant
 to
 go
 to
 100%
 green
 assets
 is


because
 even
 with
 the
 externalities
 and


all
 this
 other
 stuff
 just
 from
 a


portfolio
 diversification
 perspective,


maybe
 we're
 50/50,
 right?
 Maybe
 these


economies
 are
 going
 to
 just
 basically


our
 economy
 is
 going
 to
 have
 to
 have
 a


mix
 of
 these
 different
 assets.
 So
 that


is
 to
 say,
 you
 know,
 when
 we
 were
 all


brown
 economy,
 you
 know,
 going
 into
 some


initial
 green
 was
 actually
 you
 didn't


even
 really
 need
 to
 have
 the
 government


deal
 with
 that.
 You
 want
 to
 have
 some


diversification
 anyways,
 right,
 as
 an


investor.
 But
 as
 we
 get
 to
 sort
 of
 more


5050
 uh
 or
 whatever
 6040
 you
 know
 these


issues
 of
 portfolio
 diversification
 of


how
 much
 of
 our
 risk
 budget
 we
 want
 to


allocate
 to
 green
 assets
 becomes
 much


more
 critical
 and
 that's
 what
 I'm
 going


to
 touch
 on
 okay
 is
 to
 try
 to
 think


about
 uh
 these
 issues
 from
 a
 kind
 of
 a


real
 portfolio
 allocation
 lens
 a


portfolio
 lens
 and
 thinking
 about
 uh


diversification


okay
 so
 let
 me
 kind
 of
 talk
 about
 the


first
 set
 in
 features
 so
 why
 has
 the


transition
 been
 so
 so
 successful
 of


course
 the
 cost
 of
 renewables
 have


dropped
 a
 lot.
 You
 know,
 this
 is
 kind
 of


the
 China
 thing.
 This
 is
 kind
 of
 a
 bunch


of
 different
 things,
 but
 but
 essentially


this
 is
 a
 plot
 of
 uh
 the
 cost
 of
 brown


capacity,
 wind
 capacity,
 and
 solar


capacity.
 So,
 solar
 is
 in
 green,
 wind
 is


in
 uh
 uh
 blue,
 and
 brown
 is
 um
 uh
 at
 the


bottom
 in
 black.
 And
 you
 know you
 can


see
 like
 in
 2012
 right
 uh
 capacity
 for


Brown
 you
 know
 we're
 talking
 about
 you


know
 uh
 twice
 as
 expensive
 uh
 in
 in
 in


terms
 of
 uh
 solar
 and
 you
 know
 for
 for


wind
 I
 think
 uh
 it
 was
 just
 you
 know
 it


was
 crazy
 it
 was
 like
 kind
 of
 five
 times


more
 expensive
 three
 times
 more


expensive
 but
 of
 course
 for
 a
 variety
 of


different
 reasons
 you
 know
 uh


technological
 progress
 uh
 we've


basically
 kind
 of
 come
 down
 a
 lot
 so
 so


now
 first
 of
 all
 I'll
 call
 this
 is
 like


the
 sillion
 first
 moment
 effects
 right


that
 you
 know
 from
 a
 first
 moment


perspective,
 these
 assets
 are
 are
 kind


of
 pretty
 close
 to
 each
 other,
 right?


But
 I
 think
 what
 hasn't
 been
 discussed


as
 much
 uh
 is
 really
 kind
 of
 these


second
 moment
 effects.
 And
 I
 think


Christine
 nailed
 it
 on
 the
 head.
 You


know,
 she
 spent
 an
 enormous
 amount
 of


time
 talking
 about
 second
 moment


effects,
 right?
 You
 know,
 I
 mean
 like


like
 was
 amazing.
 I
 was
 like
 shocked


actually
 like
 when
 I
 heard
 the
 speech.
 I


was
 like
 wow,
 right?
 uh
 because
 I
 I


think
 this
 is
 exactly
 kind
 of
 a
 front


and
 center
 the
 transparent
 issues
 that


we
 need
 to
 kind
 of
 confront
 which
 is
 the


second
 moment
 effects
 which
 I
 think
 has


been
 mostly
 like
 neglected
 uh but


hopefully
 with
 Christine's
 speech
 is


going
 to
 be
 more
 front
 and
 center
 which


is
 that
 you
 know
 and
 this
 was
 kind
 of
 a


headline
 uh
 uh
 in
 Germany
 right
 uh
 there


was
 this
 kind
 of
 historic
 lack
 of
 wind


and
 you
 know
 their
 economy
 was
 a
 lot
 of


was
 kind
 of
 built
 on
 this
 wind
 power


done
 by
 these
 feeding
 tariffs
 for
 like


almost
 like
 a
 couple
 of
 decades


So
 during
 this
 episode
 where
 year
 on


year
 there
 was
 this
 massive
 drop
 in
 in


in
 in
 wind
 in
 in
 Germany
 um
 a


substantial
 fraction
 of
 their
 renewable


companies
 kind
 of
 basically
 teetered
 on


a
 bankruptcy.
 Okay.
 um
 right
 not


surprisingly
 because
 you
 know
 that's


that's
 kind
 of
 this
 intermittency
 risk


basically
 uh
 uh
 kind
 of
 manifests
 and
 I


think
 that
 investors
 actually
 have


recognize
 this
 more
 so
 than
 I
 think
 kind


of
 climate
 researchers
 and
 more
 so
 than


probably
 even
 I
 think
 uh
 climate
 policy


makers.
 Okay.
 Um
 so
 I'm
 going to
 take


this
 portfolio
 diversification
 lens
 but


I'm
 going
 to
 ask
 kind
 of
 a
 broader


question.
 I'm
 going
 to
 ask
 look
 you
 know


for
 these
 different
 types
 of
 assets
 like


renewables,
 nature-based
 solutions
 and


adaptation
 capital
 right
 I'm
 going
 to


focus
 on
 second
 moments
 right
 what
 do
 we


think
 are
 the
 risk
 characteristics
 of


these
 different
 types
 of
 capital
 right


on
 the
 basic
 idea
 that
 societyy's
 going


to
 want
 some
 portfolio
 diversification


and
 the
 more
 risky
 it
 is
 the
 less
 you're


going
 to
 want
 to
 tilt
 towards
 it
 or
 the


other
 way
 of
 saying
 is
 government
 has
 to


do
 more
 to
 fiscalize


right
 uh
 to
 incentivize
 then
 society
 to


kind
 of
 adopt
 these
 assets
 okay
 so
 the


kind
 of
 the
 higher
 the
 risk,
 the
 more


the
 government
 has
 to
 kind
 of
 step
 in


and
 and
 give
 lots
 of
 kind
 of
 incentives


which
 typically
 means
 some
 fiscalization


of
 these
 costs.
 Okay.
 Um
 and
 it's
 I'm


not
 going
 to
 kind
 of
 attribute
 the
 work


because
 you
 know
 I
 kind
 of
 did
 this
 talk


just
 kind
 of
 for
 this
 for
 this
 kind
 of


thing
 but
 but
 this
 is
 kind
 of
 drawing


from
 from
 different
 work
 I'm
 doing
 with


different
 uh
 authors
 on
 on
 kind
 of
 sort


of
 related
 issues.
 Um
 so
 let
 me
 talk


about
 naturebased
 solutions.
 So
 you
 know


uh
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 interest
 for


instance
 in
 naturebased
 solutions
 but


again
 I
 would
 say
 that
 and
 and
 and


there's
 been
 kind
 of
 lots
 of


developments
 in
 terms
 of
 trying
 to
 like


improve
 the
 efficiency
 of
 these


sequestration
 methods
 but
 again
 let's


talk
 about
 the
 second
 moments
 right
 so


for
 naturebased
 solutions
 you
 know
 think


about
 the
 asset
 class
 right
 that
 would


basically
 mean
 forest
 is
 is
 one
 big
 part


of
 the
 naturebased
 solutions
 compared
 to


let's
 say
 farmland
 compared
 to
 let's
 say


infrastructure
 right
 infrastructure


would
 be
 more
 along
 the
 lines
 of
 what


one
 would
 think
 would
 be
 adaptation


capital.
 Now,
 if
 you
 look
 at
 the
 first


moments,
 you
 know,
 the
 returns
 to
 forest


have
 not
 been
 great,
 right?
 It's
 been


kind
 of
 7
 to
 9%
 historically.
 Uh,
 when


you
 think
 about
 kind
 of
 these
 these


these
 these
 for
 forest
 assets,
 you
 know,


farmlands
 10
 to
 11%,
 infrastructure
 is
 8


to
 10%.
 But,
 you
 know,
 I
 think
 first


moments
 are
 always
 very
 deceptive.
 So,


I'm
 not
 going
 to
 pay
 too
 much
 attention.


As
 economists,
 as
 finance
 economists,


what
 we
 know
 we
 can
 measure
 very
 well
 is


volatility.


We
 know
 we
 can
 measure
 volatility
 very,


very
 well.
 Okay.
 And
 what
 you
 see
 with


forest
 is
 that
 uh
 uh
 the
 volatility
 of


forest
 assets
 are
 historically


substantially
 higher.
 So
 that
 is
 to
 say,


you
 know,
 if
 we
 think
 that
 we're


suddenly
 going
 to
 have
 all
 these


voluntary
 carbon
 markets
 and
 then
 people


are
 going
 to
 turn
 forest
 into
 these
 like


carbon
 credits,
 one
 big
 issue
 will
 be


that
 10
 to
 12%
 ball
 compared
 to
 let's


say
 infrastructure
 which
 is
 only
 7
 to


9%.


Right?
 Okay.
 And
 so
 what's
 causing
 a
 lot


of
 the
 10
 to
 10
 fall
 of
 course
 is
 that


you
 know
 forests
 are
 very
 susceptible
 to


fires
 right
 you
 know
 you
 can
 kind
 of


have
 a
 forest
 to
 try
 to
 do
 all
 of
 this


uh
 hh
 sequestration
 but
 then
 what
 if
 you


get
 kind
 of
 this
 fire
 and
 then
 the
 whole


thing
 burns
 down
 okay
 so
 not
 so
 simple


right
 so
 these
 types
 of
 risk
 investing


in
 mother
 nature
 that
 is
 to
 say
 also
 has


its
 own
 risk


okay
 uh
 and
 and
 that's
 something
 we


should
 kind
 of
 factor
 in
 when
 thinking


about,
 you
 know,
 the
 the
 the
 kind
 of
 the


optimal
 social
 allocation
 in
 terms
 of
 uh


what
 we
 would
 want
 to
 address
 the
 the


these
 these
 climate
 issues.
 And
 so
 if


you
 kind
 of
 think
 about
 an
 economy,
 uh


the
 way
 to
 think
 about
 it
 is,
 you
 know,


there's
 like
 two
 different
 types
 of


capital.
 You've
 got
 your
 brown
 capital,


you've
 got
 your
 green
 capital.
 And


critically,
 uh
 in
 this
 kind
 of
 this
 is
 a


kind
 of
 a
 a
 mockup
 of
 a
 a
 typical


integrated
 specimen
 model
 that
 Nord
 won,


uh
 his
 Nobel
 Prize
 for.
 And
 and
 of


course
 there's
 a
 there's
 a
 sort
 of
 a


connection
 between
 you
 know
 climate
 and


the
 nature
 of
 the
 different
 types
 of


capital
 and
 then
 in
 terms
 of
 the
 economy


being
 output
 but
 ultimately
 it's
 also


what
 the
 investors
 really
 want
 to
 own


right
 what's
 their
 risk
 preferences
 and


how
 does
 that
 basically
 get
 respected
 in


terms
 of
 the
 allocation
 of
 green
 and
 and


and
 and
 brown
 capital
 and
 and
 I
 think


kind
 of
 the
 point
 is
 that
 you
 know
 in


these
 models
 even
 if
 you
 had
 equal


productivity
 of
 with
 fossil
 fuels


meaning
 with
 brown
 capital
 and
 green


capital.
 Uh
 and
 if
 green
 capital
 itself


had
 less
 climate
 disasters
 because
 uh


it's
 is
 is
 more
 friendly.
 You
 know,
 you


could
 still
 have
 the
 case
 that
 you
 could


have
 significant
 impediments
 or


headwinds
 toward
 a
 100%
 green
 economy


purely
 because
 of
 diversification.


Yeah,
 it's
 very
 expensive
 to
 get
 the


investor
 to
 go
 the
 last
 mile.
 If
 the


person's
 already
 owning
 30%
 green
 assets


in
 his
 portfolio,
 making
 that
 investor


go
 to
 50%
 60%
 is
 very
 expensive.


And
 I
 would
 argue
 that
 that's
 some
 of


the
 headwinds
 that
 I
 think
 Christine


Lagard,
 I
 think,
 instinctively
 kind
 of


understands.


Yeah.
 And
 I
 think
 that's
 why
 she's


calling
 for,
 you
 know,
 better
 quote


unquote
 integration
 of
 these
 markets,


which
 is
 exactly
 that.


Are
 there
 things
 that
 are
 keeping
 us


from
 kind
 of
 sharing
 or
 spreading
 these


types
 of
 risk
 in
 terms
 of
 like
 uh


diversifying
 away
 these
 risk?
 So,
 so
 I


view
 the
 issue
 of
 uh
 diversification
 uh


uh
 as
 kind
 of
 probably
 really
 kind
 the


critical
 one
 at
 this
 point
 in
 terms
 of


the
 the
 the
 green
 energy
 transition
 and


in
 terms
 of
 just
 generally
 the


transition
 towards
 uh
 uh
 the
 various


types
 of
 investments
 that
 we
 think
 we're


going
 to
 need
 uh
 to
 address
 the
 uh
 uh


climate
 crisis.
 So,
 I'm
 going
 to
 show


you
 some
 some
 numbers
 that
 I've
 kind
 of


calculated
 myself
 uh
 that
 that
 kind
 of


gives
 you
 some
 causal
 evidence
 that
 this


volatility
 channel
 is
 pretty
 important


uh
 and
 that
 is
 pretty
 important
 for


investors.


Okay.


So
 this
 is
 a
 a
 kind
 of
 a


uh
 you
 know
 two
 charts
 on
 the
 left
 uh


the
 dotted
 line
 kind
 of
 indicates
 uh


from
 the
 US
 the
 implementation
 of


renewable
 portfolio
 standards.
 So,
 so


the
 way
 that
 the
 US
 uh
 converted
 its


power
 sector
 to
 be
 green
 is
 to
 mandate


that
 investorowned
 companies,
 right?


Produce
 electricity
 with
 a
 certain


fraction
 of
 it
 has
 to
 be
 produced
 with


uh
 uh
 uh
 renewable
 energy.
 Okay?
 So,


typically
 a
 number
 would
 be
 like
 30%
 or


something
 like
 that.
 Now,
 what's


interesting
 about
 this
 causal
 experiment


is
 that
 in
 a
 number
 of
 US
 states,
 they


exempted
 the
 municipal
 producers.


Okay?


So
 we
 can
 use
 the
 implementation
 of
 this


renewable
 portfolio
 standard
 to


understand
 what
 happens
 to
 the
 risk


profile
 of
 power
 companies
 that
 were


forced
 to
 own
 a
 bunch
 of
 renewable


assets.


Okay?
 And
 we
 have
 two
 sets
 of
 states.
 So


one
 set
 of
 states
 gave
 municipal


exemptions.
 So
 we
 can
 kind
 of
 look
 at


the
 differences
 in
 terms
 of
 here
 in
 this


case
 I
 showed
 you
 what
 happens
 to
 the


volatility
 of
 electricity
 prices.
 Right?


So
 we
 all
 know
 electricity
 prices
 go
 up.


Now
 that's
 not
 so
 much
 of
 an
 issue
 in


the
 US
 from
 the
 investors
 perspective


because
 um
 the
 higher
 cost
 of


electricity
 prices
 are
 just
 passed
 on
 to


consumers.


Okay.
 Here
 what
 I'm
 talking
 about
 is
 the


second
 moment
 which
 is
 when
 you're


forcing
 these
 companies
 now
 to
 suddenly


produce
 their
 power
 with
 20%
 30%
 using


renewables.
 What
 you
 see
 is
 that
 the


volatility
 of
 electricity
 prices
 goes


up.


Okay.
 So
 that
 is
 these
 green
 assets
 are


generating
 cash
 flows
 that
 are
 more


volatile,
 right?
 Because
 that
 their


product
 is
 basically
 more
 volatile.


Okay?
 And
 and
 so
 in
 these
 in
 these
 in


these
 uh
 uh
 states
 that
 that
 implemented


this
 this
 renewable
 portfolio
 standard,


you
 know,
 you
 see
 this
 increase
 in


electricity
 price
 volatility
 and
 there's


no
 differences
 of
 course
 without


exemptions.
 In
 the
 states
 without


exemptions,
 you
 don't
 see
 any
 you
 don't


see
 any
 effect
 because
 everyone
 had
 to


produce
 uh
 uh
 uh
 you
 know
 there
 was
 no


exemptions
 that
 were
 granted
 and
 and
 so


this
 is
 some
 causal
 evidence
 that
 says


that
 you
 know
 uh


which
 we
 attribute
 to
 intermittency
 risk


but
 also
 could
 be
 kind
 of
 other
 types
 of


risk
 in
 studenting
 like
 you
 know


regulatory
 risk,
 political
 risk
 in
 other


when
 you're
 embracing
 when
 you're
 forced


to
 kind
 of
 own
 these
 assets
 you're
 going


to
 have
 this
 kind
 of
 more
 volatile
 cash


flow
 and
 then
 the
 credit
 markets.
 So


when
 these
 firms
 then
 go
 and
 try
 to


raise
 debt
 to
 make
 these
 investments


into
 this
 these
 green
 assets
 uh
 they


basically
 face
 like
 a
 higher
 cost
 of


capital.
 So
 they're
 charged
 uh
 by


capital
 markets
 uh
 a
 2%
 uh
 extra
 uh
 uh


credit
 spread
 which
 is
 a
 very
 big
 number


if
 you
 kind
 of
 imply
 it
 out.
 It


basically
 means
 that
 investors


view
 renewables
 as
 something
 on
 the


order
 of
 1.5
 times
 more
 volatile
 than


fossil
 fuels.


Okay?
 So
 that
 1.5
 times
 essentially
 is


kind
 of a
 number
 I
 want
 you
 to
 keep
 in


your
 head.
 That's
 kind
 of the
 drag
 or


the
 impediment
 essentially
 toward
 going


into
 kind
 of
 a
 corner
 solution
 visav
 uh


uh
 green
 investments.
 Right?
 In
 other


words,
 when
 you
 listen
 to
 kind
 of
 policy


makers
 and
 which
 I
 understand
 there's
 a


sort
 of
 amount
 of
 like
 evangelism
 that's


kind
 of
 important,
 you
 know,
 there's
 a


sense
 into
 we
 want
 to
 get
 to
 100%


renewables,


right?
 All
 the
 fossil
 fuel
 assets
 are


going to
 get
 stranded
 and
 we're
 going
 to


be
 at
 100%
 renewables.


But
 if
 you
 take
 a
 and
 perhaps
 a
 dismal


view,
 if
 you
 take
 a
 finance
 economist


view,
 a
 portfolio
 lens,
 right,


there's
 all
 kinds
 of
 risk
 in
 assets,


right?
 you're
 always
 going
 to
 want
 some


interior
 solution
 in
 terms
 of
 a


diversification.
 Now,
 the
 question
 is


kind
 of
 where
 you
 land
 in
 the
 interior.


I
 mean,
 is
 it
 like
 8020?
 Is
 it a
 5050,


you
 know,
 etc.
 Uh
 but
 but
 I
 think
 it's
 a


more
 productive
 lens
 to
 think
 about
 uh


uh
 uh
 uh
 the
 these
 these
 issues.
 At


least
 one
 lens
 has
 not
 been
 I
 think
 kind


of
 adapted
 as
 much
 adopted
 as
 much
 uh
 in


terms
 of
 uh
 really
 I
 think
 you
 know


research
 or
 also
 kind
 of
 in
 terms
 of


policym.


Uh
 so
 that's
 going
 to
 lead
 me
 to
 the


last
 point.
 Right.
 So
 the
 last
 five


minutes
 I'll
 talk
 about
 this
 which
 is


that
 I
 think
 much
 underd
 discussed
 is
 is


then
 of
 course
 you
 know
 adaptation


capital
 right
 uh
 but
 as
 I
 think
 our


first
 the
 very
 first
 talk
 uh
 um


in
 the
 very
 morning
 right
 uh
 uh


mentioned
 on
 kind
 of
 the
 nature
 of


extreme
 weather
 or
 disaster
 risk
 is
 that


you
 know
 no
 matter
 kind
 of
 what's


happening
 in
 the
 decarbonization
 space


we
 are
 going
 to
 be
 basically
 confronted


with
 more
 extreme
 weather
 over
 of
 the


next
 century,


right?
 Okay.
 So,
 of
 course,
 you
 know,


that's
 going
 to
 lead
 to
 some
 discussions


of
 adaptation
 capital.
 So,
 as
 Saul


mentioned,
 you
 know,
 you're
 not
 seeing


much
 of
 this
 at least
 historically.
 But


the
 question
 is
 like
 prospectively,


right?
 Um
 given
 that
 infrastructure
 is


only
 a
 7
 to
 9%
 ball
 annual,


we
 should
 also
 discuss
 not
 only


renewables
 brown,
 but
 really
 adaptation


capital
 as
 the
 third
 source
 of
 capital


allocation,
 right?
 In
 other
 words,
 like


how
 much
 adaptation
 capital
 do
 we
 want


to
 own
 in
 our
 portfolio?


Okay.
 Uh
 and
 I'll
 kind
 of
 show
 you
 some


numbers
 that
 I
 think
 that
 um
 at least


kind
 of
 going
 forward,
 right?
 I'm
 going


to
 give
 you
 kind
 of
 an
 argument
 why


going
 forward
 uh
 the
 returns
 of


adaptation
 capital
 actually
 can
 be
 kind


of
 quite
 high,
 especially
 kind
 of
 in


this
 uh
 a
 kind
 of
 uncertain
 climate
 risk


environment.
 Okay,
 which
 is
 if
 you
 think


about
 adaptation
 capital
 really
 it's


kind
 of
 insurance,
 right?
 uh
 kind
 of
 the


way
 to
 think
 about
 adaptation
 capital
 is


that
 look
 you
 know
 I'm
 building
 my
 house


on
 stilts
 not
 because
 I
 love
 stilts
 but


basically
 it's
 it's
 kind
 of
 a
 hedge


against
 you
 know
 bad
 draws
 of
 nature


right
 you
 know
 I'm
 building
 a
 seaw
 wall


you
 know
 off
 of
 Venice
 not
 because
 I


particularly
 love
 a
 seaw
 wall
 but
 it's


there
 simply
 against
 like
 high
 tide


right
 these
 are
 hedge
 assets
 right
 in


the
 economy
 and
 the
 question
 is
 how
 much


of
 these
 hedge
 assets
 do
 we
 want
 to
 own


uh
 globally
 okay
 and
 and
 of
 course
 now


historically


Right.
 We've
 always
 had


extreme
 weather
 and
 and
 of
 course,
 you


know,
 we
 are
 at
 kind
 of
 a
 point
 where
 we


have
 adapted
 to
 a
 certain


extreme
 weather
 profile.
 Okay.


But
 as
 we
 kind
 of
 go
 into
 the
 next


hundred
 years,
 right,
 uh
 reality
 is


going
 to
 set
 in
 because
 you
 know,
 like


for
 instance,
 I
 live
 in
 New
 York.
 Uh
 and


I
 most
 of you
 guys
 have
 been
 to
 New


York.
 you
 know
 that
 place
 is
 not
 really


meant
 for
 like
 rain
 and
 global
 warming


you
 know
 like
 it's
 like
 really
 really


bad
 you
 know
 summers
 are
 really
 really


bad
 winters
 are
 really
 really
 lots
 of


rain
 you
 know
 basically
 subways
 don't


walk
 don't
 don't
 work
 you
 know


everything
 basically
 stops
 just
 because


of
 like
 two
 days
 of
 rain
 right
 and
 you


know
 you
 know
 in
 the
 horror
 stories
 even


in
 uh
 the
 New
 York
 Post
 you'll
 see
 you


know
 people
 can
 just
 die
 you
 know


basically
 the
 the
 right
 of
 passage
 in


New
 York
 is
 you
 get
 to
 live
 in
 the


basement
 right
 but
 you
 know
 living
 in


the
 basement
 may
 not
 really
 be
 a


feasible
 strategy
 anymore
 if
 you're


going
 to
 get
 these
 flash
 floods.
 Okay,


so
 this
 adaptation
 capital


um
 I
 would
 argue
 kind
 of
 over
 a
 long


horizon,


right,
 u


is
 probably
 going
 to
 have
 pretty
 high


returns
 if
 the
 climate
 science
 is
 right.


Okay.
 And
 so
 marry
 that
 with
 the
 fact


that
 infrastructure
 spending
 typically


uh
 has
 a
 pretty
 low
 vault,


right?


um
 you
 know
 uh
 that
 would
 basically


predict
 that
 kind
 of
 in
 some
 longer
 run


adaptation
 capital


may
 be
 a
 pretty
 significant
 portion
 also


of
 our
 overall
 uh
 global
 portfolio


allocation.
 Okay.
 Um
 so
 I'm
 just
 going


to
 leave
 it
 there.
 Uh
 but
 but
 but
 you


know
 thanks
 for
 organizing
 the


conference.
 It
 was
 really
 amazing
 and


and
 I
 learned
 a
 lot.


Excellent
 presentation.
 Thank
 you
 so


much.


What
 a
 great
 day
 it
 has
 been.
 Do
 you


agree?


>> It's
 now
 time
 to
 wrap
 up.
 Please
 welcome


Norisbank
 Investment
 Management's
 Chief


Governance
 and
 Compliance
 Officer
 Karina


Smith
 for
 concluding
 remarks.


Thank
 you,
 Karolina.
 And
 I
 agree,
 what


an
 extraordinary
 day
 this
 has
 been.
 Uh


Harrison,
 I
 think
 you
 said
 you
 had
 been


asked
 to
 do
 a
 wrap-up,
 but
 uh
 so
 am
 I.


So
 now
 I'm
 wondering
 if
 I
 need
 to
 use


your
 wrap-up
 in
 my
 wrap-up,
 but
 uh


anyway,
 um
 I'll
 go
 back
 to
 this
 morning


and
 remind
 you
 of
 what
 Nikolai
 showed


us.
 the
 two
 sculpture
 of
 the
 capilline


wolf.


The
 famous
 one
 from
 Rome,
 the
 original


uh
 a
 symbol
 of
 nurture
 and
 survival,


mother
 earth.
 And
 then
 the
 lesser
 known


outside
 of
 Oslo,
 a
 warning
 of
 what
 can


happen
 if
 we
 take
 more
 than
 nature
 can


give.


And
 we
 are
 living
 that
 warning.


The
 choices
 we
 make
 now,


hard
 rights
 or
 easy
 wrongs
 as
 we
 heard


today,
 will
 shape
 our
 world
 for
 decades


and
 beyond.


So,
 I
 recently
 became
 a
 grandmother.


Um,
 and
 when
 my
 granddaughter
 turns
 25,


it
 will
 be
 2050,


the
 year
 we
 aim
 to
 achieve
 net
 zero.


What
 world
 will
 she
 inherit?


How
 will
 climate
 change
 affect
 the


global
 economy
 and
 her
 future?


We
 heard
 from
 uh
 the
 governor,
 our


governor
 this
 morning
 that
 climate


change
 affect
 everything,
 all
 our
 core


missions
 at
 Nordisbank.


For
 the
 central
 bank,
 it
 impacts


financial
 stability
 and
 inflation.


And
 for
 us
 in
 the
 fund,
 it's
 a


systematic
 financial
 risk
 that's
 already


affecting
 the
 markets.


So
 we
 are
 a
 fund
 for
 current
 and
 future


generations.


A
 sustainable
 fund
 is
 this
 depend
 on
 a


sustainable
 economy
 but
 also
 a
 living


planet


and
 the
 three
 are
 inseparable


and
 the
 conference
 today
 have
 made
 that


evident.


So,
 what
 are
 my
 key
 takeaways
 from


today's
 speakers?


Well,
 one,
 the
 science
 is
 clear.


Last
 year
 was
 the
 warmest
 year
 on
 record


and
 the
 physical
 impacts
 of
 climate


change
 are
 intensifying.


Then
 two,
 the
 economics
 are
 concerning.


Global
 GDP
 per
 capita
 has
 already
 fallen


significantly
 due
 to
 climate
 impacts.


Then
 three,


the
 path
 forward
 is
 complex.


The
 transition
 to
 net
 zero
 is
 neither


simple,


linear
 nor
 uniform.


And
 this
 means
 operating
 in
 an


environment
 of
 extreme
 uncertainty.


Then
 four,


change
 can
 happen
 faster
 than
 we
 think.


Tipping
 points,
 both
 negative
 but
 also


positive,
 shows
 that
 the
 um


transformation
 can
 accelerate
 rapidly.


And
 then
 five,
 markets
 are
 already


responding.


The
 transition
 to
 net
 zero
 represents


one
 of
 the
 largest
 capital
 reallocation


in
 history.


The
 big
 wheel
 is
 turning
 and
 the


transformation
 is
 happening.


So
 the
 conversation
 between
 President


Lagard
 and
 former
 Vice
 President
 Gore


drew
 these
 threads
 together
 and
 they


also
 reminded
 us
 of
 the
 urgency.


10
 years
 have
 passed
 since
 Paris.
 We
 are


now
 in
 the
 decisive
 decade
 for
 achieving


an
 orderly
 transition.


Now
 how
 is
 this
 connected
 with
 the
 work


we
 do
 at
 the
 farm?


So
 we
 have
 worked
 with
 climate
 risk
 for


nearly
 two
 decades.
 Our
 current
 climate


action
 plan
 which
 concludes
 this
 year


set
 the
 bold
 ambition
 for
 our
 portfolio


companies
 to
 reach
 net
 zero
 emissions
 at


the
 latest
 by
 2050.


And
 it's
 great
 to
 see
 the
 companies
 have


made
 progress.


Climate
 targets
 now
 cover
 around
 three


quarters
 of
 our
 portfolio
 emissions
 and


that's
 up
 from
 just
 over
 half
 in
 2022.


And
 also
 our
 portfolio
 emissions
 are


slowly
 reducing.


But
 as
 today
 has
 shown
 no
 single


institution
 can
 meet
 this
 challenge


alone.


Climate
 change
 transcend
 boundaries


between
 science,
 economics,
 policy
 and


finance,
 and
 so
 must
 our
 response.


We
 need
 coordinated
 action.


And
 we
 will
 do
 our
 part
 as
 a
 long-term


investor.
 We
 will
 continue
 to
 support


the
 transition
 to
 net
 zero.


And
 tomorrow,
 another
 big
 day.
 We
 launch


our
 new
 2030
 climate
 action
 plan.


Nikolai
 said
 he
 wouldn't
 give
 any


spoilers,
 but
 at
 least
 I
 could
 say
 this.


The
 plan
 reflects
 20
 years
 of
 learning


and
 the
 research
 and
 the
 insight
 we
 have


heard
 today.


We
 are
 translating
 the
 science,
 the


economic
 analysis
 and
 the
 investment


evidence
 into
 action
 for
 managing
 one
 of


the
 world's
 largest
 portfolios.


So
 if
 you
 want
 more
 excitement,
 we


invite
 you
 to
 join
 us
 tomorrow
 to
 learn


more.


So
 when
 I
 think
 about
 my
 granddaughter's


future,
 I
 am
 reminded
 of
 why
 we
 do
 this


work.


The
 challenges
 are
 immense,
 but
 so
 are


the
 opportunities.


Thank
 you.


With
 that,
 thank
 you
 so
 much
 for
 joining


us
 today,
 both
 here
 at
 the
 bank
 and


remotely.
