With
 one
 of
 the
 best
 track
 records
 in


private
 equity,


Bravo
 manages
 179
 billion
 in
 assets,


Bravo
 has
 grown
 at
 a
 blistering
 pace.


Last
 year,
 the
 firm
 returned
 over
 $13


billion
 to
 investors.
 In
 2019,
 Orlando


became
 the
 first
 Puerto
 Rico
 born


billionaire.
 Private
 equity
 firms,
 the


good
 ones,
 definitely
 beat
 the
 public


markets.
 We
 are
 in
 the
 business
 of


turning
 great
 innovators


into
 great
 businesses.


Ladies
 and
 gentlemen,
 please
 welcome


Toma
 Bravo's
 Orlando
 Bravo.


[Music]


[Applause]


[Music]


See
 you.
 Thanks
 for
 coming.
 How
 are
 you,


David?
 Good
 to
 see
 you.
 For
 those
 that


don't
 know,
 let
 me
 just
 do
 a
 a
 couple
 of


data
 points
 and
 then
 we'll
 just
 jump


into
 the
 story
 because
 Orlando
 has
 an
 in


Wait,
 are
 we
 are
 we
 seriously
 going
 to


ignore
 whatever
 virtue
 signaling
 JL
 is


doing
 over
 here?
 What


what's
 this
 uh
 virtue
 signal
 you
 got


going?


What
 are
 you
 doing
 right
 now?


Well,
 this
 isn't
 virtue.
 This
 is
 um
 my


bestie
 Tulsi
 gave
 me
 an
 official
 scarf


from
 her
 office


for
 my
 wife
 and
 I
 stole
 it
 from
 my
 wife.


So,
 I'm
 wearing
 it.
 And


I
 know
 you
 probably
 didn't
 see
 it


yesterday,
 but
 Jason
 was
 run
 over
 by
 the


director
 of
 national
 intelligence,
 Tulsy


Gabbard,
 yesterday.
 He
 was
 so
 tilted.


She
 was
 walking
 through
 the
 Russia
 hoax.


He
 was
 so
 tilted
 he
 had
 his
 phone


googling
 and
 grocking
 trying
 to
 get
 and


and
 all
 he
 could
 come
 up
 with
 is
 this.


And
 literally
 in
 this
 tone,
 what
 about


Paul
 Maniffort?
 And
 nobody
 knew
 what


that
 meant.
 Nobody
 knows
 who
 he
 is,


including
 her.


Okay,
 so
 your
 mother
 why
 you
 got
 to
 beat


up
 on
 Jason
 so
 much
 you
 should
 be
 a


nicer
 to
 him
 he
 is
 your
 bestie
 sorry


continue
 Orlando
 has
 an
 incredibly


inspiring
 story
 but
 let
 me
 just
 set
 the


backdrop
 of
 what
 uh
 Toma
 Bravo
 is
 to


Bravo
 started
 in
 2008
 so
 what
 is
 that
 17


years
 now
 and
 now
 has
 just
 a
 little


under
 200
 billion
 which
 is
 incredible


but
 here
 are
 the
 two
 stats
 that
 stunned


me
 in
 June
 you
 raised
 $34.4
 4
 billion
 in


basically
 like
 a
 set
 of
 fund
 vehicles


which
 is
 I
 want
 to
 understand
 how
 that


is
 even
 possible
 and
 then
 you
 basically


have
 owned
 now
 or
 500
 companies
 and
 many


of
 the
 big
 software
 companies
 that
 you


know
 we
 probably
 interact
 with
 and
 have


to
 deal
 with.
 But
 before
 we
 get
 into
 all


those
 details,
 I
 think
 what's
 inspiring


is
 you
 are
 a
 child
 of
 Puerto
 Rico,
 a


small
 town
 in
 Puerto
 Rico,
 and
 I've


texted
 you
 this
 before,
 but
 I
 just


wanted
 you
 to
 tell
 everybody,
 how
 does
 a


guy,
 and
 I'm
 not
 I'm
 saying
 this
 in
 a


nice
 way,
 from
 literally
 the
 middle
 of


nowhere,


get
 here?
 How
 does
 that
 happen?


Your
 parents,
 your
 family,
 like
 how
 does


that
 happen?


Well,
 by
 the
 way,
 thanks
 so
 much
 for


having
 me.
 And
 I'm
 not
 sure
 how
 we're


supposed
 to
 talk
 about
 serious
 stuff
 and


private
 equity
 when
 when
 when
 we
 have


this,
 but


you
 persevere.


I
 I
 got
 this.
 Look,
 um
 that
 touches
 my


heart
 that
 you
 asked
 that
 question


because
 when
 Hurricane
 Maria
 hit
 Puerto


Rico,


kind
 of
 everything
 stopped
 for
 me


because
 my
 best
 friends
 are
 there,
 my


family's
 there,
 um
 cousins,
 my
 my
 whole


upbringing.


I
 got
 there
 on
 a
 plane
 the
 day
 after.


And
 where
 were
 you
 at
 the
 time?
 I
 was
 in


San
 Francisco.


Okay.


And
 we
 had
 gotten
 a
 message
 from
 Puerto


Rico
 saying
 there's
 some
 shelters,


particularly
 one
 that
 was
 really
 close


to
 my
 hometown
 of
 my
 that
 had
 only
 two


days
 supply
 of
 food
 and
 water.
 And
 there


were
 all
 these
 kids
 and
 everything
 else.


And
 the
 government
 of
 Puerto
 Rico,
 they


had
 they
 had
 trouble
 serving
 these


towns.
 So
 we
 said,
 "We'll
 go
 from
 San


Francisco
 and
 bring
 you
 a
 bunch
 of
 food


and
 water
 and
 we'll
 we'll
 be
 there


tomorrow."
 And
 they
 actually
 showed
 up.


When
 I
 landed,
 three
 of
 my
 friends
 that


I
 hadn't
 seen
 in
 a
 while,
 my
 best
 high


school
 friends,
 one
 of
 them
 asked
 me,


"Oh,
 now
 you're
 doing
 all
 this
 business


stuff.
 How
 did
 that
 happen?"
 And
 I
 said,


"Well,
 the
 odds
 are
 one
 of
 us
 had
 to
 get


lucky
 out
 of
 out
 of
 everybody
 here,
 one


I
 mean
 that
 there's
 there's
 some
 odds
 to


that."


But
 was
 that
 something
 like
 your
 parents


gave
 you
 where
 they're
 like,
 "You
 have


to
 go,
 you
 have
 to
 do
 something
 or


Yes.
 Now,
 at
 every
 turn,
 I
 tell
 you


this,
 how
 exactly
 I
 got
 here.
 I've
 never


created
 anything
 new,
 but
 I
 always
 had


my
 mom
 who
 was
 a
 Cuban
 immigrant.
 And


for
 her,
 just
 me
 staying
 there,
 it


didn't
 feel
 right
 to
 her.
 She
 was


always,
 you
 know,
 she
 would
 put
 me
 in


positions
 where
 I
 would
 always
 have
 to


be
 traveling
 to
 San
 Juan
 to
 play
 tennis,


the
 sport
 of
 tennis
 individual.
 Then
 if


I
 did
 well,
 I
 remember
 I
 played
 my
 first


tournament
 when
 I
 was
 10
 years
 old
 in


Karacas,
 Venezuela.
 And
 I
 saw
 wealth


back
 then,
 Karakas,
 Venezuela
 in
 1982


was
 quite
 a
 place
 and
 you
 played
 in
 this


fancy
 club
 and
 then
 you
 if
 I
 do
 really


well,
 I
 get
 to
 play
 in
 Florida.
 So
 she


was
 always
 always
 kind
 of
 giving
 me
 a


road
 map
 for
 that.
 I
 was
 lucky
 that
 I


wasn't
 that
 good
 to
 go
 pro.
 So
 I
 went
 so


so
 that
 I
 went
 into
 business.
 But
 then


the
 same
 thing
 at
 at
 work,
 you
 know,
 I


had
 the
 two
 best
 mentors
 and
 the
 only


thing
 I
 give
 myself
 credit
 for
 is
 at
 a


young
 age
 I
 really
 listened.
 I
 had


discipline
 and
 I
 would
 kind
 of
 kind
 of


take
 it
 all
 in.


You
 were
 also
 the
 beneficiary
 of
 an


incredible
 mentor.
 And
 there's
 these


great
 stories.
 Yesterday
 we
 heard,
 you


know,
 Vlad
 tried
 to
 get
 a
 job
 at
 Climate


Corp.
 Couldn't
 started
 Robin
 Hood.
 You


know,
 famously,
 um,
 my
 HR
 lead
 at


Facebook
 introduced
 me
 to
 her
 then


boyfriend
 Ben
 Sberman.
 We
 interviewed


Ben.
 We
 ended
 up
 not
 hiring
 him.
 He


immediately
 started
 Pinterest.
 And
 when


you
 graduated
 from
 Stanford,
 you
 only


got
 one
 job
 offer
 from
 like
 a


threeperson
 firm
 basically.
 Do
 you
 want


to
 tell
 us
 about
 that
 story?


Yeah,
 I
 would
 you
 know
 at
 1997


there
 was
 not
 not
 much
 private
 equity


and
 the
 venture
 business
 you
 didn't
 hire


a
 lot
 of
 people.
 It
 was
 also
 it
 was
 also


small.
 Now
 I
 I
 want
 to
 add
 this
 to
 the


story.
 I
 had
 I
 got
 one
 interview
 with


one
 of
 the
 largest
 private
 equity
 firms


at
 the
 time
 and
 the
 head
 of
 the
 firm


spent
 time
 with
 me.
 Very
 very
 nice
 guy.


But
 you
 know
 what
 he
 said
 and
 this
 is


1997.


There's
 not
 much
 opportunity
 in
 our


industry
 anymore
 and
 the
 industry
 is


taken.


Now
 our
 firm
 is
 multiples
 bigger


than
 they
 are.
 And
 the
 same
 thing
 will


happen
 in
 the
 future
 for
 the
 few
 of
 you


that
 may
 be
 interested
 in
 private


equity.
 you'll
 come
 by
 and
 create
 a
 firm


and
 it
 the
 American
 spirit
 and


entrepreneurialism
 and
 being
 at
 the


right
 place
 at
 the
 right
 time
 because
 we


started
 doing
 software
 and
 it's
 hard
 not


to
 do
 well
 if
 you
 started
 doing
 software


back
 then
 and
 had
 all
 this
 uh
 this
 wind


behind
 your
 back.
 So,
 I
 didn't
 I


couldn't
 get
 a
 job.
 There
 weren't
 many.


And
 then
 Carl
 Toma
 hired
 me.
 And
 at
 the


end
 of
 the
 process,
 this
 is
 interesting.


There
 were
 a
 few
 private
 equity
 firms


that
 kind
 of
 opened
 up
 a
 position
 for
 me


to
 do
 Latin
 American
 private
 equity.
 And


I'm
 like,
 "No,
 I've
 I've
 spent
 too
 much


time
 in
 the
 south.
 The
 money's
 in
 the


north.
 I
 I
 you
 know,
 I
 want
 to
 do
 US


buyout
 tech.
 That's
 what
 I
 wanted
 to


do."
 And
 Carl
 was
 great.
 He
 said,
 "If


you
 want
 to
 do
 tech,
 that's
 not


something
 we
 do,
 but
 you
 know,
 start


looking
 at
 it
 and
 and
 we'll
 we'll
 help


you."


And
 so,
 so
 just
 tell
 us
 about
 how
 the


decisions
 you've
 made
 now
 to
 build
 this


business.
 How
 many
 people
 do
 you
 have?


How
 do
 you
 run
 200
 billion
 effectively?


How
 do
 you
 raise
 34
 how
 do
 you
 what
 do


you
 tell
 people
 to
 raise
 34
 billion?
 I


don't
 I
 don't
 even
 I
 don't
 even


comprehend
 that.


I
 think
 you
 do.
 Come
 on.


You
 guys
 have
 done
 pretty
 well.
 I


appreciate
 that.
 But
 but
 it's
 uh
 okay.


So
 we
 have
 we
 are
 very
 very
 focused
 on


keeping
 the
 team
 very
 small.
 So
 we
 have


about
 230
 people
 at
 at
 Toma
 Bravo
 within


the
 organization.


Um
 the
 the
 reason
 is
 you
 if
 if
 you
 have


too
 big
 of
 a
 team,
 you
 become
 internally


focused
 and
 start
 dreaming
 about


conversations
 internally.
 And
 as
 I


always
 say,
 the
 deal's
 not
 in
 the


office,
 the
 company's
 not
 in
 the
 office,


and
 the
 buyer
 of
 your
 company's
 not
 in


the
 office.
 So,
 you
 always
 have
 to
 be


outward
 facing.
 The
 second
 thing
 is
 I


got
 the
 benefit,
 and
 so
 did
 my
 senior


partners
 of
 incredible
 mentorship.
 I
 can


tell
 you
 so
 many
 stories
 about
 Carl
 Toma


spending
 time
 with
 me
 in
 1998
 on
 the


deal
 we
 were
 going
 to
 lose.
 And
 I
 would


be
 like,
 why
 did
 you
 spend
 all
 that
 time


with
 the
 CEO
 and
 me
 on
 his
 kitchen


table?
 He
 wanted
 to
 teach
 me
 how
 to


sell.
 He
 wanted
 to
 teach
 me
 how
 to
 do
 a


deal.
 and
 and
 that
 was
 just
 incredible.


So
 if
 we
 have
 too
 many
 of
 those,
 we


can't
 we
 can't
 touch
 the
 next
 generation


leadership.
 So
 that
 is
 that
 is
 part
 of


our
 philosophy.
 Now
 how
 do
 we
 raise
 that


money?
 Look,
 our
 first
 deal,
 it's
 always


been
 one
 step
 at
 a
 time.
 Our
 first
 deal


was
 50
 million.
 The
 second
 deal
 was
 100


million
 enterprise
 value.
 The
 third
 was


data
 at
 250
 million.
 We
 didn't
 buy
 a


company
 in
 Silicon
 Valley
 till
 2010.
 Uh


that
 was
 Sonic
 Wall
 that
 we
 paid
 550


million
 in
 take
 private.
 That
 was
 our


first
 foray
 into
 real
 cyber
 um
 in
 in


higher
 growth
 uh
 businesses.
 So
 one


little
 step
 at
 a
 time.
 There
 was
 a
 time


that
 we
 couldn't
 raise
 a
 billion
 dollars


but
 now
 we
 have
 enough
 of
 a
 following


that
 you
 know
 people
 people


what
 is
 the
 role
 of
 private
 equity
 in


the
 US
 economy
 do
 you
 think
 what
 is
 the


role
 that
 it
 should
 play?
 I
 think
 it's
 a


great
 change
 agent.


It's
 it's
 a
 business
 in
 a
 way
 similar
 to


venture
 where
 what
 matters
 is
 the


returns
 that
 you
 put
 up
 and
 you
 have


incredible
 alignment
 with
 the
 sources
 of


capital.
 They
 give
 you
 the
 money
 and
 if


you
 make
 the
 return,
 you
 can
 stay
 in


business.
 And
 if
 they
 give
 you
 the
 money


and
 you
 don't
 make
 the
 return,
 no matter


how
 big
 we
 may
 be,
 we
 slowly
 lose
 that


and
 and
 we're
 out
 of
 business.
 And
 and


that
 that
 alignment
 is
 so
 important


because
 you're
 such
 a
 big
 change
 agent


to
 companies.
 These
 software
 companies


are
 not
 meant
 to
 be
 owned
 by
 the
 same


group
 for
 30
 or
 40
 years.
 Management


gets
 tired.
 It's
 exhausting
 to
 run.
 It's


exhausting
 to
 be
 a
 CRO.
 And
 the
 more


they
 trade
 hands.
 You
 have
 somebody
 with


maybe
 a
 new
 idea,
 maybe
 a
 perspective,


and
 maybe
 a
 perspective
 that
 was
 right


for
 the
 company
 at
 that
 time.
 And
 that


buyer
 like
 private
 equity
 can
 assume
 be


super
 entrepreneurial
 and
 try
 to
 do


something
 special.
 So
 Orlando
 though
 the


the
 just
 building
 on
 that
 it
 clearly
 has


alignment
 with
 the
 investors
 but
 maybe


you
 could
 talk
 a
 little
 bit
 about
 the


broader
 alignment
 with
 society
 jobs
 the


reputation
 of
 PE
 sometimes
 is
 a
 bit
 too


cutthroat
 and
 if
 you
 hear
 oh
 a
 PE
 a
 firm


bought
 my
 favorite
 brand
 or
 our
 firm
 got


bought
 by
 you
 know
 our
 startup
 got


bought
 by
 a
 P
 firm
 it's
 like
 okay


they're
 going
 to
 cut
 half
 the
 people
 and


there's
 going to
 be
 layoffs
 or
 maybe


this
 brand
 is
 going
 to
 get
 saddled
 with


debt
 and
 absolutely
 gutted
 for
 parts.
 So


what's
 fair
 or
 unfair
 about
 that
 sort
 of


PR
 crisis?
 Maybe
 there
 is
 with
 PR
 with


with
 PE.


That
 is
 100%
 fair
 in
 the
 80s,
 90s,
 and


maybe
 early
 2000s.


Private
 equity
 has
 nothing
 to
 do
 with


that.
 Now
 about
 50%
 of
 the
 private


equity
 deal
 volume
 is
 in
 technology.
 We


we
 do
 that.
 We're
 we
 we're
 very
 narrow.


We
 only
 do
 software.
 If
 you
 look
 at
 any


software
 deal
 we've
 done
 in
 the
 last
 12


13
 years
 after
 SAS
 became
 irreversible


in
 '05


you're
 paying
 7
 to8
 times
 revenue
 and


the
 financing
 on
 7
 to8
 times
 revenue
 is


maybe
 two
 turns
 of
 revenue
 so
 you're


putting
 in
 five
 to
 six
 turns
 of
 equity


in
 the
 company
 30%
 debt
 70%
 equity
 if


you're
 not
 building
 and
 growing
 that


business
 especially
 if
 it's
 big
 nobody's


going
 to
 buy
 it
 from
 you
 it
 used
 to
 be


that
 for
 those
 old
 school
 deals
 if
 you


look
 at
 the
 return
 twothirds
 of
 the


return
 will
 come
 today
 from
 the
 cash


flow
 of
 the
 business
 from
 your
 yield
 and


a
 little
 bit
 in
 the
 terminal
 value.
 It's


flipped
 about
 2/3
 or
 more
 is
 terminal


value
 appreciation
 and
 you
 make
 very


little.
 So
 you're
 a
 growth
 investor
 on


your
 yield.
 We
 really
 are
 we
 had
 to


transfer
 to
 that
 because
 look
 the
 the


lucky
 thing
 we
 had
 was
 after
 I


personally
 made
 a
 lot
 of
 mistakes
 97
 to


the
 internet
 bubble
 bursting.
 Carl
 Toma


was
 going
 to
 fire
 me
 and
 this
 is
 also


true.
 He
 he
 talked
 about
 it
 in
 his
 70th


birthday
 and
 and
 he
 gave
 me
 another


chance
 and
 I
 said,
 "Okay,
 I'm
 not
 good


at
 what
 we
 were
 doing
 then.
 I'm
 gonna
 go


for
 existing
 management,


really
 established
 companies
 and


software."
 In
 2000,
 you
 could
 buy


recurring
 revenue
 and
 software
 cheaper


than
 in
 all
 the
 other
 categories
 that


private
 equity
 liked.
 Think
 about
 radio,


uh,
 cable,
 whatever.
 Rec
 outdoor


advertising,
 anything.
 So,
 the


partnership
 said,
 "Sure,
 let's
 try
 it.


Let's
 try
 with
 something
 small.
 At
 that


time,
 you
 could
 buy
 cheap.
 But
 what


happened
 is
 in
 2010


after
 the
 financial
 crisis,
 most
 of
 our


competitors
 that
 were
 doing
 those
 deals


and
 it
 was
 heavily
 competitive
 then
 for


these
 smaller
 transactions,
 they
 left


the
 business
 because
 now
 software
 became


super
 expensive.


So
 there's
 a
 but
 we
 said
 chamat
 but
 then


we
 said
 oh
 instead
 of
 complaining
 that


we
 cannot
 do
 what
 we
 were
 doing
 before


because
 everything
 changes.
 Now
 we
 have


the
 wherewithal
 to
 buy
 the
 best
 and
 the


number
 one.
 So
 let's
 go
 for
 the
 number


one
 player
 that
 can
 grow.


So
 you
 started
 doing
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 SAS


deals
 in
 2010.
 When
 you
 sit
 there
 with


your
 partners
 in
 2025,


is
 there
 a
 risk
 of
 SAS


being
 cannibalized
 from
 within
 by
 AI
 or


you
 know
 how
 it
 can
 just
 be
 rebuilt
 in


different
 ways?
 How
 do
 you
 underwrite
 it


today
 which
 is
 different
 from
 how
 you


may
 would
 have
 underwritten
 it
 in
 2010?


Our
 investors
 don't
 love
 to
 hear
 this


because
 for
 right
 our
 investors


especially
 the
 large
 institutions
 that's


kind
 of
 our
 market
 that
 those
 are
 our


our
 our
 people
 that
 have
 backed
 us
 for
 a


long
 time
 besides
 good
 returns
 they
 need


consistency


and
 predictability
 they
 would
 rather


have
 us
 do
 what
 we
 were
 doing
 in
 2002
 in


these
 deals
 and
 why
 why
 can't
 you
 just


keep
 doing
 the
 same
 thing
 and
 it
 all


changes
 one
 is
 there
 is
 a
 big
 risk
 of
 AI


in
 this
 business
 I
 mean
 in
 a
 big
 big
 way


there's
 so
 many
 verticals
 that
 are
 going


to
 get
 disrupted
 there's
 so
 many
 areas


that
 are
 very
 confusing
 and
 you
 don't


want
 to
 touch
 so
 it
 limits
 the
 space


significantly
 even
 if
 you
 believe
 what


we
 believe
 which
 is
 in
 the
 enterprise


it's
 going
 to
 take
 a
 while
 because
 we


always
 say
 technology
 is
 evolutionary


not
 revolutionary
 because
 our
 customers


are
 buying
 this
 stuff
 for
 cost
 they
 want


the
 ROI
 and
 you
 need
 to
 see
 the
 plan
 and


everything
 else
 but
 one
 is
 there's
 a
 big


disruption
 and
 that's
 and
 other
 all


these
 areas
 we
 don't
 get
 into.
 Um,
 and


we
 have
 to
 keep
 learning
 um
 and
 and


updating
 ourselves.
 That's
 that's
 a
 lot


of
 of
 work
 that
 the
 young
 people
 in
 the


firm
 as
 well
 will
 have
 to
 do.
 But
 we


have
 another
 equally
 big
 or
 even
 bigger


challenge
 which
 is
 if
 you
 look
 at
 our


trajectory,
 it's
 not
 like
 one
 day
 we


woke
 up
 and
 said,
 "Oh,
 we
 can
 do
 a
 $10


billion
 deal."
 No,
 we
 we
 started
 50
 that


trajectory
 in
 2010.
 We
 did
 three
 billion


dollar
 deals
 in
 a
 row.
 Um
 we
 bought
 blue


code
 we
 took
 it
 private.
 DelTech
 we
 took


private
 we
 bought
 digital
 insight
 from


into
 it.
 When
 those
 worked
 then
 we
 did
 a


$2
 and
 half
 billion
 dollar
 deal
 that


became
 Dinatrace
 that
 was
 compare.
 Then


when
 that
 worked
 we
 did
 a
 $5
 half


billion
 dollar
 deal
 which
 Dina
 was
 here


yesterday.
 That
 was
 the
 business
 that
 we


sold
 to
 NASDAQ
 and
 that
 worked.
 But
 now


we're
 doing
 $10
 billion
 deals.
 We
 have


to
 sell
 those
 for
 25
 to
 make
 money.


Wow.
 our
 our
 alternative
 here,
 what
 we


have
 to
 underwrite
 is
 an
 IPO
 at
 a
 big


discount
 to
 the
 comps
 when
 we
 paid
 a
 30%


premium
 to
 the
 comps
 to
 buy
 that
 company


in
 the
 first
 place.
 So,
 we
 kind
 of
 start


50%
 in
 the
 hole.
 Well,


to
 do
 that.
 So,
 you
 have
 to
 Anyway,


I
 wanted
 to
 ask
 you
 this
 question


because
 I
 I
 asked
 a
 friend
 of
 mine
 about


you
 and
 he
 was
 competing
 with
 you
 to
 get


the
 Boeing
 business
 and
 you
 you
 bought


the
 Boeing
 avionics
 business
 recently


for
 10.5
 billion,
 which
 I
 think
 all
 of


us
 care
 about
 because
 hopefully
 it'll


improve
 flight
 safety
 and
 all
 of
 that


other
 stuff,
 but
 we
 can
 talk
 about
 that


in
 one
 second.
 But
 he
 said
 Orlando's


incredibly
 difficult
 to
 compete
 with


because
 they're
 so
 he's
 so
 ready
 to
 buy


the
 thing
 he
 wants
 to
 buy
 and
 he
 doesn't


really,
 you
 know,
 nickel
 and
 dime
 at
 the


edges.
 It's
 like,
 let's
 find
 a
 fair


price
 and
 we'll
 just
 transact
 and
 it


makes
 it
 very
 hard
 for
 everybody
 else
 to


compete
 with.
 When
 you
 get
 that


conviction,
 are
 you
 just
 willing
 to
 just


basically
 put
 that
 much
 money
 on
 the


line
 and
 say,
 "We're
 going
 to
 figure


this
 out."


We
 are.


That's
 sort
 of
 Warren
 Buffett's


mentality,
 isn't
 it?
 That
 he
 he
 already


knows
 all
 the
 companies.
 is
 he
 knows


which
 ones
 he
 wants
 to
 buy
 and
 when
 they


come
 up
 that
 he
 doesn't
 nickel
 and
 dime


he
 just
 quickly
 works
 out
 a
 deal.
 Is


that
 something
 is
 that
 a
 mentality
 that


you
 have?


100%.
 It
 all
 it
 all
 fits
 together
 with


having
 a
 small
 team.
 We
 also
 have
 a


small
 portfolio.
 So
 in
 every
 fund
 we'll


buy
 10
 to
 12
 companies.


We
 we
 strive
 for
 the
 two
 core


competencies
 that
 we
 try
 to
 have.
 One
 is


buy
 the
 best
 and
 operate
 the
 best
 and


just
 focus
 on
 that
 in
 a
 3
 to
 four
 year


time
 frame
 for
 our
 funds
 for
 investing


our
 funds.
 We
 cannot
 say
 with
 a
 straight


face
 that
 there
 are
 30
 of
 the
 greatest


companies
 that
 were
 available
 to
 be


bought
 at
 that
 time.


Right?


So,
 so
 that's
 why
 and
 two
 we
 cannot
 say


with
 a
 straight
 face
 that
 we
 can
 try
 to


influence
 management
 with
 everything
 we


learned
 from
 an
 incredible
 mentor
 if
 we


had
 a
 portfolio
 of
 30.
 That's
 as
 much
 as


as
 we
 can
 handle.
 So,
 we
 have
 to
 go
 for


it.
 Now,
 I
 do
 want
 to
 add
 that
 what
 I


love
 about
 the
 private
 equity
 business,


one
 of
 the
 items
 is
 that
 those
 deals


because
 the
 decisions
 that
 you
 make
 with


your
 partners
 an
 hour
 before
 the
 bid
 is


is
 really
 really
 important.
 It's
 really


telling.


Well,
 can
 you
 take
 us
 behind
 the
 TikTok


of
 this
 Boeing
 asset?
 It's
 I
 think
 it's


like
 a
 it
 touches
 all
 of
 us
 even
 if
 most


of
 us
 don't
 understand
 that
 it
 even


existed
 actually.
 Well,
 it
 it
 basically


runs
 maybe
 you
 cannot
 fly
 an
 airplane,


right,
 without
 Jeepposin
 and
 and
 its


system.
 And
 the
 way
 the
 deal
 started,


uh,
 we
 called
 the
 the
 CEO
 of
 Boeing,


actually
 sent
 him
 an
 email
 saying,
 "Hey,


we
 could
 buy
 this
 division
 and
 we're


paying
 these
 these
 good
 prices."
 So,


there
 was
 some
 interest.
 The
 process


started
 and
 there
 were
 about
 15
 private


equity
 groups,
 all
 excellent
 groups


involved
 in
 the
 deal.


But,
 why
 would
 Boeing
 want
 to
 sell
 its


avionics
 business?
 I
 guess
 maybe
 start


with
 that
 like


Yeah,
 it
 seems
 pretty
 core.
 It's
 a
 good


business
 and
 I
 I
 I'm
 happy
 that
 they


decided
 that.


So,
 you're
 saying
 that
 was
 a
 bad


decision
 to
 sell
 a
 cockpit?


We'll
 take
 it.


Fair
 enough.
 Um
 I
 I
 wanted
 to
 ask
 you
 a


question
 about


Can
 we
 get
 the
 answer
 to
 that
 though?


What
 what
 what
 is
 the
 strategic
 rational


for
 Boeing
 to
 want
 to
 sell
 its
 avionics


business?
 Is
 the
 idea
 that
 other
 plane


manufacturers
 can
 then
 use
 that
 avionic


system?
 I'll
 give
 my
 answer
 and
 maybe


you
 can.


I
 think
 Boeing
 is
 in
 this
 incredibly


difficult
 position
 where
 there's
 a
 lot


of
 diffuse
 things
 that
 were
 happening


inside
 of
 the
 business


and
 they
 had
 to
 make
 a
 real


rationalization.
 What
 are
 the
 few
 things


we
 can
 be
 good
 at?
 So,
 you
 know,
 one
 of


our
 friends,
 Brian
 Utko,
 was
 put
 in


charge
 of
 new
 plane
 development.
 I
 think


you
 know,
 you
 can
 guess
 what's
 going
 to


happen
 there.
 That's
 a
 clear
 strategic


bet.
 You
 know,
 getting
 the
 737
 or
 this


the
 max
 program
 back
 online.
 That
 was
 a


clear
 bet.
 But
 when
 you
 do
 that,
 you


have
 all
 kinds
 of
 debt
 and
 stuff
 that


you
 just
 need
 to
 clean
 out.
 And


sometimes
 you
 have
 to
 sell.
 And
 by
 the


way,
 you
 are
 right.
 Your
 instincts
 are


right
 because
 my
 friends
 who
 called
 me


basically
 said
 this
 is
 the
 gem
 asset


inside
 of
 Boeing.
 I
 mean,
 he's
 being


very
 gracious
 by
 not
 you.
 So
 yeah,
 but


Jeepson
 is
 the
 thing
 that
 everybody


uses.
 United,
 Delta,
 everybody
 needs


this
 information
 to
 fly
 accurately.
 And


it
 was
 Boeing's
 business
 and
 now
 it's


Orlando's
 business.


Okay.
 So


what's
 our
 phone's
 business?
 I
 wish
 it


was
 like


it's
 your
 Orlando.
 We
 um
 we
 don't
 buy


stuff.
 We're
 generally
 year
 zero,
 year


one,
 two
 investors
 who
 help
 build


things,
 but
 Sax
 and
 I
 got
 to
 watch
 our


friend
 Elon
 buy
 Twitter
 and
 um
 that
 was


quite
 eye
 opening.
 It
 was
 also
 the
 first


thing
 that
 I
 think
 he
 ever
 bought
 in
 in


you
 know
 a
 major
 way
 like
 that.
 What
 is


the
 playbook
 for
 coming
 into
 one
 of


these
 technology
 companies
 and
 you
 have


like
 you
 said
 tired
 management
 maybe
 the


people
 who
 are
 still
 saying
 at
 this


company
 are
 the
 ones
 who
 couldn't
 find


other
 work
 or
 maybe
 weren't
 as


ambitious.
 What's
 it
 like
 day
 zero,
 day


one,
 day
 two
 when
 you
 get
 in
 there?


What's
 the
 playbook?
 What's
 you
 know


one,
 two,
 three,
 we
 got
 to
 do
 these


things
 in
 the
 first
 30
 days.


It's
 almost
 always
 the
 same.
 We
 we
 try


to
 buy
 companies
 and
 Jefferson
 is
 a
 a


tweener
 in
 that
 because
 their
 margins


were
 about
 25%.
 But
 we
 feel
 that


business
 can
 be
 running
 like
 a
 Denza


that
 we
 sold
 to
 NASDAQ
 for
 50%
 plus


running
 it
 like
 a
 software
 company
 and


making
 the
 right
 investments.


The
 the
 playbook
 is
 this.
 You
 meet
 with


a
 company
 uh
 usually
 a
 public
 company


that
 trades
 for
 a
 revenue
 multiple


because
 they're
 not
 that
 profitable.


And
 our
 our
 mentality
 is
 we
 try
 to
 turn


what
 we
 call
 a
 good
 innovator
 into
 a


good
 business.
 We
 have
 all
 these


meetings
 with
 management
 and
 after
 we


listen
 a
 lot
 to
 them,
 we
 come
 back
 to


them
 and
 we
 have
 we
 put
 together
 a
 plan


with
 them
 to
 cut
 cost.
 So
 there
 is
 that


element
 because
 you
 have
 to
 get
 in
 the


game
 with
 a
 certain
 level
 of
 fundamental


earnings
 to
 be
 able
 to
 afford
 the
 deal.


You
 you
 you
 basically
 are
 what
 we're


trying
 to
 do
 is
 turn
 a
 revenue
 multiple


day
 one,
 say
 we
 buy
 it
 for
 six
 or
 seven


times
 to
 an
 ebida
 multiple
 in
 day
 four.


If
 that
 company
 grew
 20%
 and
 you
 achieve


a
 50%
 margin,
 you've
 done
 that.
 And
 then


you
 say,
 "What
 are
 the
 comps?
 What
 is


this
 thing
 worth?
 Is
 it
 a
 20p
 a
 25p?"
 A


20p
 is
 about
 15
 times
 ebida.
 You
 could


double
 your
 asset
 value
 without
 the


benefit
 of
 that
 30%
 leverage
 which
 you


pay
 down
 a
 bit
 and
 that's
 how
 you
 create


your
 return.
 So
 you
 you
 talk
 we
 talk
 to


management
 very
 openly
 during
 the


process
 even
 before
 we
 won
 the
 deal
 even


if
 they're
 not
 going
 to
 like
 us
 etc.
 and


we
 say,
 "Hey,
 can
 we
 put
 together
 a
 plan


where
 you
 can
 make
 the
 right
 investment


decisions,
 but
 can
 you
 cut
 15%
 of
 the


cost
 of
 the
 company
 at
 closing?"
 The


deal
 in
 private
 equity,
 talk
 about
 the


change
 agent.
 If
 you
 don't
 do
 that
 at


closing
 in
 private
 equity,
 why
 are
 you


going
 to
 shock
 the
 employees
 afterwards?


Your
 2,
 three,
 four,
 the
 deal,
 since


everybody's
 thinking
 there's
 a
 new
 owner


that's
 going
 to
 provide
 change,
 gives


you
 the
 opportunity
 for
 immediate


change.
 Now,
 as
 my
 mentor
 Marcel
 Bernard


used
 to
 say,
 he
 was
 the
 greatest


operator
 I've
 ever
 met.
 35
 years
 at


Motorola
 running
 different
 divisions
 and


that
 was
 an
 exceptional
 school
 of


management.
 No
 matter
 how
 profitable
 you


are,
 you
 can
 always
 cut
 10%.
 No
 matter


how
 unprofitable
 you
 are,
 it's
 difficult


to
 cut
 more
 than
 20%.
 Because
 you
 have


to
 change
 the
 way
 people
 make
 decisions,


the
 way
 management
 interacts,
 etc.


How
 do
 you
 evaluate
 the
 talent
 stack?


That
 was
 something
 that
 actually
 David


was
 exceptional
 at
 during
 the
 Twitter


acquisition.
 And
 we
 sat
 there
 in
 a
 room


and
 he
 said,
 "Well,
 who's
 exceptional
 at


their
 job?"
 And
 then
 Elon
 said,
 "And


who's
 absolutely
 critical
 for
 this


business?"
 And
 I
 just
 walked
 up
 to
 the


whiteboard
 and
 I
 drew
 four
 quadrants,


exceptional,
 essential.
 And
 then
 there


was
 this
 sort
 of
 exceptional
 but
 not


essential.
 And
 we
 we
 we
 then
 had
 a


clear
 Elon
 proved
 that
 you
 could
 cut
 85%


of
 Twitter
 and
 it
 would
 still
 work
 just


fine.


And
 all
 the
 journalists
 were
 like,


"Twitter's
 going
 to
 go
 down
 any
 day


now."
 And
 then
 they
 were
 like
 every
 day


they
 would
 write
 the
 same
 story.
 Twitter


went
 down
 and
 be
 like,
 "Oh
 no,
 you
 lost


your
 internet
 connection
 on
 your
 phone


and
 they'd
 be
 like,"No,
 it's
 it's
 not


coming
 up."
 And
 it's
 like,
 "Yeah,
 yeah,


reut
 the
 P
 Wi-Fi
 password
 in."
 And
 it


never
 went
 down.
 It
 it
 was
 pretty
 crazy.


But
 how
 do
 you
 assess
 talent
 when
 you're


coming
 into
 one
 of
 these
 legacy


businesses,
 you
 know,
 10
 years,
 20
 years


into
 the
 business?


History
 tells
 you
 a
 lot
 of
 that.
 So
 you


you're
 trying
 to
 identify


not
 everybody's
 good
 at
 everything
 and


it
 starts
 with
 a
 leader.
 If
 the
 leader


is
 good,
 everything
 is
 good.
 If
 the


leader
 is
 not
 good,
 nothing
 is
 good.
 You


you
 don't
 want
 to
 work
 around
 them
 to


deal
 with
 sales
 and
 product
 and
 stuff


because
 the
 nothing
 is
 going
 on.
 Now


what
 does
 a
 good
 leader
 mean,
 right?


There's
 so
 many
 judgments
 that
 come
 in.


Are
 they
 is
 a
 company
 hitting
 bookings?


Is
 it
 missing?
 Are
 they
 good
 at
 customer


service?
 What's
 their
 retention?
 How
 do


they
 make
 decisions?
 What
 we
 look
 for


overall
 because
 nobody's
 perfect
 is
 to


back
 what
 they're
 look
 what
 they're
 good


at.
 We
 love
 to
 do
 add-on
 acquisitions


for
 our
 company.
 So
 the
 reason
 we
 like


to
 take
 out
 the
 cost
 once
 is
 the
 rest
 is


about
 bookings
 growth
 and
 add-ons.
 We


don't
 want
 to
 revisit
 margin
 too
 much.


We
 want
 profitable
 growth
 going
 forward.


Let's
 be
 done
 with
 that
 and
 then
 let's


go
 forward.
 The
 leader
 can
 stand
 up
 in


front
 of
 the
 entire
 employee
 base
 and


said
 we
 needed
 to
 do
 this.
 This
 deal


probably
 gave
 us
 the
 courage
 to
 do
 what


we
 need
 to
 do.
 Let's
 go.
 Let's
 go
 build


the
 business.
 So,
 but
 we
 we
 look
 at
 a


leader
 and
 we
 say
 if
 they're


open-minded,


if
 they
 care
 about
 numbers
 and
 if
 they


have
 the
 following
 of
 their
 employees


and
 customers
 and
 really
 know
 the


business,
 that
 is
 something
 that
 we


really,
 really,
 really
 try
 to
 work
 with.


With
 all
 the
 changes
 we
 make,
 we've
 been


pretty
 contrarian
 in
 the
 industry


because
 we
 first
 try
 to
 make
 them
 with


the
 existing
 people.
 And
 sometimes,
 you


know,
 we
 make
 a
 mistake
 on
 that
 and
 they


change
 their
 mind,
 but
 we
 we
 try
 to
 do


that.


Before
 you
 do
 a
 deal,
 what's
 the
 secret


to
 figuring
 out
 how
 good
 the
 asset
 is?


Do
 you
 go
 talk
 to
 customers,
 backdoor


references?
 Do
 you
 go
 find
 the
 employees


who
 quit
 and
 started
 companies
 and


interview
 them?
 Like,
 there's
 got
 to
 be


some
 tricks
 to
 assess
 a
 company
 before


you
 even
 let
 them
 know
 you're
 interested


in
 them.
 What
 are
 those
 tricks?


All
 of
 that.
 All
 of
 that.
 Now,
 we've


usually
 owned
 a
 competitor
 or
 a
 partner


to
 the
 company
 as
 well


and
 and
 we've
 usually
 known
 him
 for
 a


long
 time.
 Like
 we
 recently
 announced


that
 we
 were
 doing
 the
 Day
 Force
 deal


for
 12
 billion.
 My
 partner
 Holden
 Spade


met
 with
 the
 CEO
 of
 Day
 Force
 in
 2008


and
 we've
 tracked
 that
 company
 for
 so


long
 watching
 it
 when
 does
 it
 miss
 when


does
 it
 hit
 its
 numbers
 and
 everything


else.
 It's
 um


you
 get
 you
 also
 once
 you
 sign
 them
 up


uh
 or
 are
 in
 a
 process
 where
 the


company's
 giving
 you
 all
 their
 raw
 data,


you
 have
 so
 much
 information
 to
 make


those
 choices.
 Like
 for example,
 a


company
 cannot
 say
 that
 it
 has
 really


really
 good
 product
 if
 its
 gross
 margins


on
 support
 are
 very
 low.


And
 we
 can
 bring
 technology
 people
 to


assess
 that
 and
 we
 have
 that
 on
 our
 team


and
 they
 look
 at
 the
 architecture
 and


the
 the
 talent
 and
 everything
 else.
 But


then
 you
 go
 how
 come
 your
 support
 calls


are
 so
 high?


It's
 a
 bad
 product.
 It


yeah
 it
 it it
 all
 fits
 together.
 If
 you


have
 great
 retention,


great
 margins
 on
 support.
 It's
 like
 for


example
 take
 support.
 Many
 people
 look


to
 offshore
 support
 and
 now
 maybe
 AI


would
 would
 get
 on
 on
 that
 and
 there's


no
 need
 for
 that.
 What
 we
 say
 is


eliminate
 the
 reason
 for
 the
 call
 alto


together


because
 there's
 nothing
 you
 can
 do
 in


product.
 So
 we're
 evaluating
 all
 that.


We
 love
 it.
 We
 geek
 out
 over
 it.


There's
 a
 handful
 of
 PE
 firms
 obviously


that
 are
 now
 lynch
 pins
 of
 the
 capital


markets.
 Blackstone,
 Apollo,
 KKR,


Carlile,
 they're
 public,
 they
 are


multistrat.
 They're
 huge
 pillars.
 And
 I


mean,
 you've
 built
 an
 incredible


business.
 You
 have
 the
 credibility
 to
 do


it.
 Is
 there
 an
 impetus
 to
 do
 it?
 Is


there
 an
 impetus
 to
 kind
 of
 grow
 beyond


that
 technology
 focus?
 And
 if
 not,
 how


do
 you
 stay
 in
 your
 knitting?
 Because


it,
 you
 know,
 how
 do
 you
 do
 that?
 How


where
 does
 the
 discipline
 come
 from?


Look,
 I
 I
 think
 um


we
 are
 very
 pure
 to
 our
 investor
 base


and
 our
 colleagues,
 the
 two
 of
 them
 at


the
 same
 time.
 What
 I
 say
 matters
 to


them
 is
 the
 return.


So
 what
 matters
 for
 us
 to
 grow
 the


business
 is
 get
 the
 money,
 get
 the
 deal,


improve
 the
 deal.
 Going
 public
 does
 not


help
 any
 of
 those
 things
 for
 us.
 That


that's
 that's
 number
 one.
 Two
 is
 we're


really
 I'm
 just
 so
 grateful.
 I
 I
 really


really
 am
 for
 my
 mentors.
 I
 mean,
 Carl


Toma
 gave
 me
 and
 my
 partners
 the


company,


right?


And
 he
 mentored
 us.
 So,
 we
 want
 to
 do


the
 same
 thing
 for
 the
 next
 generation.


And
 we
 actually
 feel
 we'll
 make
 more


money
 by
 investing
 behind
 the
 next


generation
 when
 that
 time
 comes
 than
 by


going
 public
 and
 having
 a
 great
 day
 and


a
 great
 multiple
 and
 and
 then
 what?
 So,


so
 far
 we're
 just
 going
 to
 we're
 just


going
 to
 stay
 where
 we
 are.


As
 we
 wrap,
 I
 I
 just
 want
 to
 ask
 you
 a


question
 about
 Puerto
 Rico
 again,
 where


we
 started.
 You're
 the
 first
 Puerto


Rican
 billionaire.
 I
 understand
 it's
 um


it's
 just
 a
 number
 obviously,
 but
 should


Puerto
 Rico
 become
 the
 51st
 state?
 You


know,
 we
 we
 have
 Trump
 talking
 about


Greenland,
 whatever.
 Um
 you
 know,
 we


have
 these
 ambitions.
 The
 people
 of


Puerto
 Rico
 seem
 to
 want
 to
 have
 a


deeper
 relationship
 with
 America.
 It


seems
 profoundly
 unfair
 that
 they're
 in


this,
 you
 know,
 sort
 of
 middle
 state.


Yeah.
 It's
 such
 a
 divided
 place.
 The


turnouts
 in
 elections
 in
 Puerto
 Rico


when
 I
 was
 a
 kid
 used
 to
 be
 like
 90%.


It's
 a
 whole
 festival
 in
 the
 island
 when


elections
 happen
 between
 the
 party
 that


wants
 the
 status
 quo
 and
 the
 party
 that


wants
 statehood.
 Now,
 the
 party
 that


wants
 statehood
 has
 grown
 quite
 a
 bit


and
 some
 of
 the
 tax
 incentives
 of
 being


um
 kind
 of
 in
 this
 Commonwealth
 status


have
 gone
 away.
 I'm
 going
 to
 say


something
 I've
 never
 said
 before
 and
 I
 I


do
 believe
 it'll
 be
 better
 for
 Puerto


Rico
 to
 be
 a
 state
 if
 the
 US
 would
 allow


that.


I'm
 for
 it.
 I'm
 here
 for
 it.
 Ladies
 and


gentlemen,
 Orlando
 Bravo.


Thanks,
 man.


Wow.
 Thank
 you.
 Incredible,
 huh?
 I'll


talk
 to
 you
 soon.


Great
 job.
 Thank
 you.
 Amazing.
