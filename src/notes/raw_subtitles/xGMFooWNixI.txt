There
 are
 certain
 trillion
 dollar
 ideas


that
 the
 private
 sector
 just
 won't
 do


because
 it
 doesn't
 pencil
 or
 because
 of


whatever
 market
 failure
 is
 there.
 That's


where
 you
 need
 government.
 First
 of
 all,


the
 the
 debt
 path
 [music]
 we're
 on
 is


not
 sustainable.
 That
 I
 think
 identity


has
 become
 too
 central
 to
 how
 my
 party


thinks.
 My
 big
 worry
 is
 that
 if
 we're


[music]
 already
 at
 a
 level
 of


concentration
 of
 wealth
 and
 power
 that


no
 republic
 has
 ever
 survived.
 Is
 this


going
 to
 be
 a
 development
 that
 [music]


just
 makes
 wealth
 and
 power
 even
 more


concentrated
 in
 even
 fewer
 hands?


>> All right,
 besties.
 I
 think
 that
 was


another
 epic
 discussion.
 People
 love
 the


interviews.
 I
 could
 hear
 him
 talk
 for


hours.
 Absolutely.
 We
 crushed
 your


questions
 in
 a
 minute.


>> We
 are
 giving
 people
 ground
 truth
 data


to
 underwrite
 your
 own
 opinion.
 What
 do


you
 guys
 think?
 That
 was
 fun.
 [music]


That
 was
 great.


>> All
 right,
 everybody.
 Welcome
 back
 to


the
 All-In
 podcast
 interview
 series.


Last
 week,
 we
 had
 Joe
 Mansion
 on.
 This


week,
 Pete
 Buddha
 Jesus
 here.
 Everybody


knows
 Mayor
 Pete,
 born
 in
 Southbend,


Harvard,
 road
 scholar,
 uh,
 McKenzie,
 US


Navy,
 and,
 uh,
 of
 course,
 ran
 for


president
 and
 was
 the
 transportation


secretary
 under
 Biden.
 Welcome
 to
 the


program,
 Pete
 Booty
 Judge.
 How
 are
 you?


>> Good.
 Thanks
 for
 having
 me.


>> Pleasure.
 Uh,
 meet
 Shamath
 Poly
 Hapatia,


a
 former
 Democrat
 who
 rewrite
 his


support
 of
 your
 party
 and
 now
 is
 uh
 a


Republican
 and
 really
 the
 spirit
 of
 this


program
 is
 to
 just
 have
 a
 candid


discussion.
 We
 like
 to
 get
 into
 the


details
 and
 so
 I
 thought
 I
 wanted
 to


start
 with
 your
 perception
 of


entrepreneurs,
 technologists,
 etc.
 I
 was


watching
 a
 clip
 of
 you
 on
 um
 Bill
 Maher


and
 you
 said,
 "Hey,
 you
 know,
 these


these
 libertarian,
 science-based
 folks


in
 Silicon
 Valley,
 they
 made
 a
 very


practical
 decision.
 These
 are
 rich
 men


who
 have
 decided
 to
 back
 the
 Republican


party
 that
 tends
 to
 do
 good
 things
 for


rich
 men.
 And
 these
 rich
 men
 include
 Tim


Cook,
 uh
 Mark
 Zuckerberg,
 Elon
 Musk.


These
 are
 people
 who
 have
 been
 part
 of


the
 Democratic
 party
 for
 a
 very
 long


time.
 huge
 donors
 to
 the
 Democratic


party
 and
 they
 all
 made
 this
 sort
 of


flip.
 Do
 you
 think
 it
 was
 just


pragmatically
 based
 upon
 the
 desire
 to


have
 less
 regulations,
 a
 better
 business


environment
 to
 personally
 make
 more


money
 or
 do
 you
 think
 there
 were
 other


things
 at
 work
 with
 the
 loss
 in
 2024?


>> Well,
 I
 don't
 think
 you
 can
 reduce
 it
 to


any
 one
 thing,
 but
 I
 certainly
 think


that's
 part
 of
 the
 story.
 Uh
 look
 uh
 uh


it's
 no
 secret
 that
 Republican
 policies


tend
 to
 favor
 people
 who
 are
 wealthier.


Uh
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 who
 drifted
 away


from
 the
 Democratic
 party,
 at least
 the


ones
 who
 are
 getting
 a
 lot
 of
 attention.


Like
 how
 could
 these
 business
 figures,


investors,
 billionaires
 have
 gotten
 away


from
 from
 Democrats
 and
 gone
 to


Republicans
 might
 be
 kind
 of
 a
 you
 know


dog
 bites
 man
 story.
 like
 not
 something


that's
 wildly
 complicated.
 If
 you
 look


at
 the
 fact
 that,
 you
 know,
 Democrats


have
 been
 extremely
 concerned
 about


wealth
 and
 income
 inequality
 and
 you
 got


a
 lot
 of
 very
 very
 wealthy
 people.
 I


don't
 think
 it
 was
 just
 that.
 I
 mean,
 I


think
 uh
 there
 are
 a
 lot
 of
 things
 that


that
 kind
 of
 combined
 at
 once.
 But,
 you


know,
 for
 a
 lot
 of
 my
 friends
 who
 are


scratching
 their
 heads
 saying,
 "Wait
 a


minute,
 these
 are
 folks
 who
 are
 from
 the


tech
 and
 science
 world.
 How
 could
 they


back
 a
 president
 or
 administration


that's
 been
 deleting
 references
 to


science
 and
 kind
 of
 censoring
 science
 at


least
 anytime
 that
 climate
 is
 concerned?


A
 lot
 of
 these
 guys
 are
 libertarian.
 How


could
 they
 be
 on
 board
 with
 the
 uh
 you


know
 the
 administration
 that
 is
 uh


sending
 troops
 into
 streets
 and
 has
 uh


uh
 really
 led
 a
 crackdown
 on
 freedom.


That's
 kind
 of
 something
 out
 of
 the


fever
 dreams
 of
 my
 conservative
 and


libertarian
 friends
 back
 when
 we
 were,


you
 know,
 arguing
 about
 politics
 over


beers
 that
 I
 never
 thought
 I
 would
 see


happen.
 uh
 these
 folks,
 some
 of these


folks
 are
 gay
 and
 how
 can
 they
 be


backing
 an
 administration
 that's,
 you


know,
 really
 uh
 assaulted
 uh
 LGBT


rights?
 And
 you
 know,
 if
 you
 just
 go


down
 the
 list,
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 things


that
 are
 counterintuitive


uh
 about
 some
 of
 these
 Silicon
 Valley


leaders
 who
 flipped
 in
 many
 cases


flipped
 from
 being
 very
 very
 active


Democrats
 uh
 to
 backing
 Trump.
 And
 you


know,
 maybe
 there's
 an
 intuitive
 answer


to
 that
 counterintuitive
 thing,
 which
 is


that
 many
 of
 them
 feel
 their
 short-term


business
 interests
 or
 personal
 financial


interests
 are
 better
 served
 by


Republicans.
 I
 get
 that.
 I
 would
 I
 would


counter,
 as
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 in


Silicon
 Valley
 who
 are
 still
 Democrats


would,
 that
 look,
 a
 healthy
 business


environment,
 you
 know,
 you
 don't
 want
 to


be
 overregulated,
 but
 you
 also
 want
 to


make
 sure
 you're
 an
 environment
 with


rule
 of
 law.
 You
 want
 to
 be
 in
 a
 place


where
 it's
 safe
 to
 say
 scientific
 truths


out
 loud.
 you
 want
 to
 be
 in
 a
 place


where
 somebody
 can't
 impose
 their


interpretation
 of
 their
 religion
 on


other
 people.
 I,
 you
 know,
 I
 have
 a


whole
 counter
 to
 that.
 Uh,
 but,
 you


know,
 I
 think
 that's
 the
 kind
 of
 swirl


that
 we
 got
 into.
 Uh,
 definitely
 just
 in


those
 short
 years
 between
 2020
 and
 24.


>> Do
 you
 think
 that
 there
 was
 censorship


under
 the
 Biden
 administration
 for


things
 like
 scientific
 truth?
 Let's
 just


focus
 on
 COVID
 for
 a
 second
 and
 the
 back


doors
 that
 it
 seemed
 that
 the
 Biden


administration
 had
 to
 places
 like


Facebook
 and
 places
 like
 Twitter
 to
 just


suppress
 scientific
 thought
 and
 debate


as
 you
 just
 talked
 about.


>> So,
 this
 is
 an
 amazing
 example
 of
 some


of
 the
 false
 equivalencies
 that
 I've


seen
 thrown
 around
 out
 there.
 So
 yeah,
 I


I
 would
 acknowledge
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of


folks
 would
 say
 that
 uh
 you
 know
 it
 came


really
 close
 to
 the
 stove
 some
 of
 the


times
 when
 the
 administration
 was
 trying


to
 make
 sure
 that
 you
 know
 bad


information
 or
 misinformation
 wasn't


being
 pushed
 uh
 into
 the
 kind
 of
 public


health
 conversation
 and
 was
 engaging


social
 media
 companies
 that
 were
 trying


to
 you
 know
 be
 responsible
 and
 do
 the


right
 thing
 and
 and
 there
 might
 be


moments
 that
 that
 you
 know
 they
 got
 that


wrong
 or
 went
 too
 far.
 But
 right
 now,


we're
 in
 a
 moment,
 right,
 where
 the


president
 of
 the
 United
 States
 doesn't


like
 being
 criticized
 by
 a
 comedian
 and


has
 the
 head
 of
 the
 FCC,
 which
 regulates


corporations
 that
 are
 trying
 to
 buy
 TV


networks,
 go
 out
 and
 threaten
 them
 and


say,
 you
 know,
 you're
 we
 can
 do
 this
 the


easy
 way
 or
 the
 hard
 way.
 I
 mean,
 that


is
 a
 whole
 different
 level
 of


censorship.
 Not
 to
 mention
 just
 the
 way


they've
 gone
 through
 like
 every


government
 website,
 right,
 and
 deleted


anything
 that
 could
 accidentally
 be
 a


reference
 to
 climate
 change.
 So,
 you


know,
 I'm
 worried
 about
 the
 false


equivalencies
 here.
 You
 could
 definitely


say
 there
 were
 moments
 under
 the
 last


administration
 or
 any
 administration


where
 we
 could
 argue
 that
 that
 having


fidelity
 to
 to
 free
 speech,
 you
 know,


you
 should
 have
 done
 this
 way
 instead
 of


that
 way
 or
 these
 edge
 cases
 should
 have


been
 different.
 But
 but
 I
 am
 nervous


that
 anybody
 would
 equate
 a
 president


trying
 to
 direct
 the
 destruction
 not


only
 of
 journalists
 but
 of
 comedians


that
 he
 doesn't
 like
 with
 public
 health


authorities
 in
 a
 public
 health
 emergency


that
 killed
 a
 million
 Americans
 doing


their
 best
 to
 try
 to
 make
 sure
 that


people
 got
 good
 public
 health


information.
 Let's
 talk
 a
 little
 bit


about
 where
 the
 rubber
 meets
 the
 road,


which
 is
 tax
 policy.
 And
 I
 think
 a
 lot


of
 what
 we've
 seen
 in
 this
 back
 and


forth
 to
 add
 to
 why
 the
 Democrats
 lost


all
 of
 these
 amazing
 entrepreneurs
 and


capitalists
 who
 build
 these
 amazing


companies
 that
 create
 all
 the
 jobs
 in


the
 tax
 base
 for
 this
 country.


Two
 tax
 proposals
 recently,
 New
 York


City
 with
 Mandami
 and
 I
 don't
 know
 if


you've
 come
 out
 and
 publicly
 supported


him
 yet,
 but
 he's
 proposing
 54%
 tax
 for


the
 top
 earners
 there.
 Here
 in


California,
 we
 uh
 have
 the
 floating
 of
 a


bill
 to
 charge
 a
 wealth
 tax
 of
 5%
 on


billionaires.
 At
 a
 recent
 Mandami


rally,
 they
 were
 chanting
 tax
 the
 rich.


And
 Elizabeth
 Warren,
 Bernie
 Sanders,


who
 I
 think
 are
 far
 left
 of
 you,
 and
 you


can
 correct
 me
 if
 I'm
 wrong,
 are
 saying,


"Hey,
 ban
 the
 billionaires."
 And
 we
 have


this
 sort
 of
 movement
 that
 being
 a


billionaire
 is
 in
 some
 way
 immoral
 or


unethical.
 So,
 let's
 start
 with
 some


brass
 tax
 here.
 Would
 you
 support,
 and


obviously
 you're
 going
 to
 run
 for


president
 again
 in
 2028,
 and
 you're
 one


of
 the
 lead
 candidates.
 Would
 you
 ever


support
 a
 wealth
 tax?


>> In
 principle,
 maybe.
 Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 you


rightly
 said,
 you
 know,
 folks
 like


Bernie
 uh
 are
 to
 my
 left.
 I
 don't
 know


the
 details
 of
 the
 state
 and
 local


proposals
 you
 just
 mentioned,
 but
 those


sound
 on
 their
 face
 like
 they're
 further


than
 I
 would
 go.
 Uh
 but
 look,
 in


reality,
 we
 tax
 across
 a
 variety
 of


things,
 right?
 There's
 income
 tax,


there's
 payroll
 tax,
 there's
 property


tax.
 Wealth
 tax
 would
 be
 kind
 of
 along


the
 lines
 of
 a
 property
 tax.
 And
 the


thought,
 of
 course,
 is
 that
 you've
 got
 a


lot
 of
 folks
 who
 become
 incredibly


wealthy.
 And
 importantly,
 the
 way


taxation
 works
 now,
 less
 and
 less
 of
 the


way
 the
 wealthiest
 people
 accumulate


their
 income
 is
 actually
 booked
 as


income,
 right?
 And
 this
 is
 why
 you
 have


these
 stories
 of,
 you
 know,


multi-billion
 dollar
 corporations
 or


multi-billion
 billion
 dollar
 individuals


somehow
 paying
 an
 effective
 tax
 rate


that's
 lower
 than
 a
 teacher
 or
 a


firefighter.
 And
 I
 think
 most
 people
 get


that
 that's
 wrong.
 So
 I
 guess
 my
 overall


take
 is,
 you
 know,
 everything
 has
 a


balance,
 everything
 has
 limits,
 but
 if


if
 you're
 asking
 me
 the
 question,
 are


the
 wealthiest
 people
 in
 America
 right


now
 paying
 too
 much
 tax
 or
 too
 little


tax?
 I
 would
 say
 the
 wealthiest
 are


paying
 too
 little
 tax.
 and
 whether
 you


adjust
 that
 through
 income
 tax,
 whether


you
 adjust
 that
 through,
 you
 know,


something
 like
 a
 wealth
 tax.
 And
 there's


a
 lot
 of
 ways
 to
 do
 it.
 Uh
 I
 think


what's
 important
 is
 that
 it's
 fair,
 that


it
 makes
 sense,
 and
 and
 that
 you
 do
 it


in
 a
 way
 that
 that
 can
 make
 sure
 that


the
 people
 who
 are
 spectacularly


rewarded
 by
 our
 system
 are
 contributing


to
 it
 without
 being
 so
 extreme
 that
 that


uh
 you
 know,
 you're
 you're
 you're


crushing
 wealth
 creation.


>> What
 is
 the
 responsibility
 of
 the
 US


government
 in
 your
 eyes
 with
 the
 tax


receipts
 that
 they
 get?
 How
 do
 we


understand
 that
 money
 is
 being
 spent


appropriately
 and
 well


versus
 pet
 projects
 or
 pork
 barrel


spending
 or
 frankly
 just
 waste
 and


grift.
 Where
 is
 that
 line?
 And
 give
 us


some
 examples
 of
 how
 you
 would
 make
 sure


that
 as
 tax
 receipts
 went
 up,


accountability
 went
 up
 with
 it.
 Yeah,
 I


think
 that's
 that's
 super
 important
 and


and
 people's
 willingness
 to
 pay
 taxes


depends
 on
 some
 level
 on
 their,
 you


know,
 sense
 that
 they're
 getting
 good


value
 for
 their
 money.
 So,
 I
 I
 cut
 my


teeth
 as
 a
 mayor.
 We
 didn't
 we
 couldn't


uh,
 you
 know,
 print
 more
 dollars
 if
 we


wanted
 to.
 As
 the
 city
 of
 South
 Bend,
 we


had
 a
 cash
 budget,
 had
 to
 balance
 it


every
 year.
 If
 we
 took
 on
 debt,
 we


really
 had
 to
 think
 hard
 about
 how
 we


were
 going
 to
 pay
 on
 that
 debt.
 We
 made


sure
 that
 any
 time
 we're
 asking
 people


to
 be
 paying
 revenue
 into
 the
 city,
 they


know
 what
 they're
 getting
 for
 that.


Whether
 it's
 police
 service
 or
 parks
 or


trash
 pickup,
 I
 don't
 think
 that's
 the


worst
 metaphor
 to
 think
 about
 how
 things


should
 work
 at
 the
 national
 level,
 too,


right?
 We
 we
 should
 believe
 that
 we're


getting
 good
 services,
 good


infrastructure.
 That
 was
 obviously
 what


what
 I
 worked
 on
 when
 I
 was
 uh
 at
 the


federal
 level
 as
 as
 Secretary
 of


Transportation.
 We
 should
 get
 good


national
 defense
 and
 all
 the
 other


things
 that
 we,
 you
 know,
 as
 a
 country


are
 How
 do
 you
 how
 do
 you
 make
 sure
 that


it's
 not
 wasted?
 Like
 I'll
 give
 you
 an


example.
 You
 had
 billions
 and
 billions


of
 dollars
 allocated
 to
 you
 from
 the


infrastructure
 and
 jobs
 act
 to
 deploy


charging
 infrastructure,
 right?
 And
 as


of
 this
 year,
 there's
 only
 a
 few
 hundred


of
 these
 charging
 stations.
 It's
 been


pretty
 much
 an
 abject
 failure.


>> Uh
 that's
 not
 true.
 And
 and
 I'm
 really


glad
 you
 raised
 that
 because
 it's


actually
 one
 of
 the
 biggest
 red
 herrings


we
 had
 to
 deal
 with.
 So
 this
 is
 a


program
 to
 get
 EV
 chargers
 deployed
 by


2030.
 The
 thought
 was,
 you
 know,
 by


2030,
 we
 think
 about
 half
 of
 the
 sales


or
 we
 were
 hoping
 about
 half
 the
 sales


of
 cars
 in
 the
 country
 would
 be
 EVs.


Now,
 in
 order
 to
 have
 that
 work
 well,


we're
 going
 to
 need
 more
 chargers.
 The


market
 does
 a
 good
 job
 of
 delivering


chargers
 in
 a
 lot
 of
 places,
 but
 there


were
 other
 places
 where
 we
 found
 it
 was


lower
 income
 or
 it
 was
 more
 rural.
 It


was
 more
 spread
 out
 and
 it
 just
 wasn't


going
 to
 pencil
 for
 the
 private
 sector


to
 do
 to
 do
 it,
 right?
 So,
 uh
 we
 had
 a


fund
 uh
 called
 NEVI.
 uh
 I
 can't
 even


remember
 what
 the
 acronym
 was,
 but
 the


point
 was
 it
 was
 like
 you
 said
 about
 $7


billion
 uh
 to
 buy
 down
 the
 difference
 to


uh
 subsidize
 or
 just
 outright
 build


those
 chargers
 in
 places
 where
 they
 were


needed.
 And
 we
 made
 a
 couple
 of
 choices


uh
 that
 we
 knew
 would
 mean
 that
 it
 would


take
 longer,
 but
 we
 were
 okay
 with
 that.


One
 of
 them
 was
 to
 have
 it
 led
 by
 the


states.
 So
 instead
 of
 sitting
 there
 in


Washington
 saying
 where
 all
 the
 chargers


ought
 to
 be
 built,
 we
 send
 the
 funding


to
 the
 states.
 We
 let
 them
 set
 up
 their


own
 program.
 And
 importantly,
 we
 let


them
 set
 up
 their
 own
 programs


differently.
 So,
 you
 know,
 we
 were
 going


to
 dictate
 what
 the
 optimal
 subsidy
 was


in
 Wyoming
 compared
 to
 West
 Virginia
 or


whether
 you
 even
 do
 it
 through
 a
 subsidy


or
 whether
 it's
 owned
 and
 operated
 by


the
 state.
 We
 took
 we
 took
 a
 step
 back


on
 that,
 let
 the
 states
 innovate,
 even


if
 that
 means
 it's
 going
 to
 take
 a
 while


for
 them
 to
 polish
 the
 program,
 knowing


that
 that
 meant
 most
 of
 the
 chargers


would
 go
 in
 in
 2026,
 2027,
 but
 well


ahead
 of
 2030.
 Now,
 the
 second
 thing,


this
 is
 really
 important,
 too.
 We
 made
 a


conscious
 decision
 to
 insist
 that
 the


Chargers
 be
 made
 in
 America.
 Now,
 when


you
 do
 that,
 you're
 deciding
 that
 it's


going
 to
 take
 longer.
 I'll
 just
 admit


that
 because
 just
 buy
 them
 off
 the
 shelf


from
 China
 would
 be
 dramatically


quicker.
 We
 thought
 that
 was
 worth
 it


because
 we
 thought
 it
 was
 important
 to


have
 a
 US-based
 industry
 with,
 you
 know,


American
 workers,
 ideally
 union


electrical
 workers,
 uh,
 making
 and


installing
 these
 chargers.
 Again,
 we


knew
 that
 if
 if
 the
 goal
 was
 to
 get
 them


all
 done
 by
 like
 2023
 or
 2024,
 we


wouldn't
 have
 had
 the
 luxury
 of
 doing


that.
 But
 since
 we
 thought
 most
 of
 the


charges
 would
 be
 needed
 by
 well,
 by


2030,
 we
 were
 okay
 with
 that.
 Now,
 here


comes
 Washington
 politics,
 right?
 And


somebody
 gets
 a
 hold
 of
 the
 numbers.


They
 see
 it's
 a
 seven
 or
 eight
 billion


dollar
 program
 and
 then
 falsely
 try
 to


make
 it
 look
 like
 we
 spent
 the
 seven
 or


eight
 billion
 dollars
 already
 on
 the


handful
 of
 chargers
 that
 that
 they


already
 managed
 to
 build
 first
 even


though
 we
 never
 thought
 most
 of
 the


charges
 would
 be
 built
 even
 during
 our


first
 term.
 And
 that's
 where
 the


Washington
 game
 comes
 in,
 right?
 Take


something
 that
 I
 mean
 the
 jury
 is
 still


out,
 right?
 The
 program's
 not
 done.


We'll
 see
 how
 the
 Trump
 administration


does
 in
 completing
 the
 program.
 But,
 you


know,
 you
 can't
 really
 say
 whether
 it


was
 a
 success
 or
 a
 failure
 until
 the


program's
 been
 run.
 But
 they
 move
 the


goalpost.
 And
 I'm
 not
 challenging
 you


that
 like
 there's
 waste
 that
 there's
 uh


bad
 things
 that
 happen
 in
 and
 and and


government
 spending
 that
 I
 don't
 like.


But


>> what's
 your
 what's
 your
 best
 guess
 in


general?
 For
 every
 dollar
 that
 gets


given
 to
 the
 United
 States
 government
 by


US
 taxpayers,
 what
 actually
 lands
 in


productive
 programs
 that
 benefit


Americans
 versus
 what
 gets
 leaked
 away?


What's
 your
 best
 guess?
 Is
 it
 50
 cents


of
 every
 dollar,
 10
 cents
 of
 every


dollar,
 a
 penny,
 90
 cents?
 Like
 what
 is


your
 best
 guess?
 you've
 been
 in
 the


bowels
 of
 these
 organizations.


>> So
 my
 experience
 in
 transportation
 is


that
 most
 of
 it
 goes
 to
 very
 good
 use.
 I


mean
 if
 you
 just
 break
 it
 down
 uh
 it


goes
 to
 things
 that
 keep
 the
 aviation


sector
 operating
 safely.
 It
 goes
 to


things
 like
 highways,
 roads
 and
 bridges.


That
 was
 the
 biggest
 slug
 of
 funding


that
 we
 had
 in
 the
 infrastructure


package.
 uh
 and
 when
 you
 know
 the


general
 or
 the
 government
 accountability


office
 or
 or
 the
 inspector
 general
 by


the
 way
 institutions
 that
 Trump
 is


demolishing
 right
 now
 but
 the


organizations
 that
 do
 the
 auditing
 and


really
 dig
 in
 on
 a
 bipartisan
 basis
 um


often
 in
 terms
 of
 outright
 fraud
 you


know
 they're
 going
 to
 come
 in
 a
 number


that's
 well
 below
 1%
 but
 but
 but
 you


know
 I've
 also
 seen
 my
 own
 sense
 as


effective


>> no
 effectively
 this
 is
 this
 comes
 to
 the


other
 part
 I
 was
 going to
 say
 I
 mean
 I


think
 about
 my
 time
 in
 the
 military
 for


example


>> you
 know
 there
 was
 a
 building.
 I
 think


it
 was
 Leatherneck.
 Maybe
 it
 was


Kandahar,
 but
 I
 think
 it
 was


Leatherneck.
 When
 I
 traveled
 out
 there,


there
 was
 a
 building
 that
 had
 taken


years
 to
 go
 up.
 I
 think
 it
 was
 like
 $30


million.
 And
 just
 before
 they
 were
 about


to
 activate
 it,
 uh,
 they
 tore
 it
 back


down.
 I
 mean,
 it's
 just
 a
 complete


boondoggle.
 And
 and
 we
 see
 stuff
 like


that
 happening
 for
 sure.
 We
 see
 cost


escalations
 on
 a
 lot
 of
 projects.
 So,


it's
 not,
 you
 know,
 it's
 not
 the
 same
 as


fraud.
 I
 mean
 that's
 the
 like
 under
 1%


but
 it's
 still
 a
 huge
 waste
 if
 you
 have


a
 project
 cost
 1%
 or
 10%
 or
 sometimes


100%
 more
 than
 it
 should
 right
 I
 mean
 by


definition
 every
 penny
 it
 takes
 to
 build


something
 more
 than
 what
 it
 was
 actually


required
 is
 wasted
 and
 I
 do
 think


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 that
 I
 think
 government


gets
 in
 its
 own
 way
 with
 procedure


>> just
 explain
 to
 us
 as
 a
 secretary
 how


much
 control
 do
 you
 have
 in
 stopping


that
 waste
 So
 if
 you
 see
 it,
 so
 I'll


give
 you
 a
 specific
 example.
 In
 2023,


there
 was
 some
 pretty
 incredible
 outages


in
 the
 FAA.
 We've
 all
 now
 learned
 that


we
 have
 an
 incredibly
 brittle
 air
 safety


infrastructure
 that
 needs
 to
 be


upgraded.
 You
 saw
 that
 in
 23
 there
 was


outages
 all
 the
 time.
 What
 do
 you
 do
 to


stop
 that?
 And
 when
 you
 see
 the
 waste,


how
 do
 you
 stop
 it?


>> You
 know,
 that
 was
 an
 example
 where
 we


needed
 to
 invest,
 right?
 So,
 it's
 that


tough
 situation
 and
 needing
 to
 swallow


hard
 and
 go
 before
 Congress
 and
 the


taxpayer
 and
 say,
 "Look,
 we
 need
 more


funding
 for
 this."
 But
 that's
 what
 we


did.
 And
 by
 the
 way,
 this
 is
 one
 of
 the


rare
 areas
 where
 I
 agree
 with
 my


successor
 who's
 done
 pretty
 much
 the


same
 thing
 uh
 to
 make
 sure
 we
 got
 the


funding
 to
 upgrade
 the
 technology.
 Now,


this
 is
 one
 of
 the
 few
 audiences
 might


be
 nerdy
 enough
 that
 that
 I
 can
 geek
 out


a
 little
 bit
 and
 talk
 about
 the
 big


upgrade
 to
 the
 communications
 backbone


that
 that
 we
 were
 doing.
 It
 was
 to
 go


from
 TDM
 to
 IP
 from
 from
 copper
 to
 fiber


and
 to
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of people
 would
 be


astonished
 to
 know
 that
 you
 know


something
 as
 important
 and
 theoretically


modern
 as
 our
 aviation
 system
 uh
 is


working
 on
 TDM.
 Uh
 so
 that
 obviously
 had


to
 be
 upgraded.
 We
 launched
 a
 contract.


Verizon
 is
 the
 contractor.
 You
 know,


obviously
 a
 multi-year
 multi-billion


dollar
 IT
 contract
 when
 you
 have
 to


have,
 you
 know,
 not
 even
 59s
 but
 like


billion
 to
 one
 uh
 chance
 of
 anything


going
 wrong
 24
 by7
 by
 365.
 You
 know,


it's
 challenging
 and
 it
 takes
 a
 while.


But,
 you
 know,
 that's
 one
 of
 the
 reasons


why
 we
 felt
 a
 lot
 of
 urgency
 on
 that


particular
 issue.
 But
 again,
 there's
 two


ways
 of
 looking
 at
 this,
 right?
 Both
 of


which
 are
 true.
 One
 thing
 is
 to
 look
 at


the
 system
 and
 say
 how
 can
 the
 system


not
 be
 more
 modern
 like
 we
 need
 to
 make


better
 use
 of
 the
 dollars
 that
 go
 into


the
 system
 to
 have
 more
 up-to-date


communications
 infrastructure
 to
 have
 uh


more
 controllers
 uh
 who
 are
 both
 well


equipped
 and
 well-rested
 and
 FA's
 got
 to


do
 better
 on
 that.
 The
 other
 way
 to
 look


at
 it
 is
 consider
 the
 civilizational


achievement
 that
 is
 aviation
 safety
 in


this
 country.
 So
 it's
 easy
 to
 grumble


and
 I
 grumble
 and
 more
 than
 grumble.
 I


mean,
 I
 got
 pretty
 upset
 with
 a
 lot
 of


things
 about
 how
 aviation
 works
 as
 a


passenger,
 which
 is
 why
 we
 pushed


airlines
 so
 hard
 on
 on
 passenger


protections.
 But,
 you
 know,
 just
 in
 the


four
 years
 I
 was
 secretary,
 we
 had
 about


4
 billion
 passenger
 implants.
 So,
 4


billion
 times
 somebody
 got
 on
 an


airplane,
 right?
 Um,
 and
 zero
 commercial


airline
 crash
 fatalities
 out
 of
 that
 4


billion.
 In
 other
 words,
 what
 this
 kind


of
 clunky,
 imperfect
 federal
 government


has
 achieved
 is
 a
 standard
 of
 safety
 on


afford
 a
 form
 of
 transportation
 that


involves
 being
 propelled
 through
 the
 air


almost
 at
 the
 speed
 of
 sound
 by


flammable
 liquids
 miles
 above
 the


ground.
 And
 you
 know,
 frankly,
 you
 and
 I


are
 one
 of
 us
 is
 more
 likely,
 not
 to
 be


flip
 about
 it,
 but
 one
 of
 us
 is
 more


likely
 to
 randomly
 die
 of
 natural
 causes


during
 this
 taping
 than
 to
 be
 involved


in
 a
 commercial
 airline
 fatality.


>> Let's
 hope
 it's
 Jason.


>> Wow.
 [laughter]


Well,
 I
 was
 about
 to
 say,
 I
 mean,
 it
 is


like
 in
 some
 places
 in
 our
 some
 places


in
 our
 infrastructure,
 we're
 incredibly


blessed.
 And
 I'm
 wondering
 as,
 you
 know,


now
 you're
 in
 your
 40s,
 you've
 seen
 a


lot
 of
 the
 world,
 whether
 it's
 your


military
 service
 or
 or,
 you
 know,
 just


being
 a
 mayor
 of
 a
 small
 town
 and
 then,


uh,
 obviously
 working
 in
 a
 cabinet


position.
 How
 has
 your
 view
 of
 free


market
 dynamic
 solving
 problems
 versus


the
 government
 solving
 problems
 evolved


if
 at
 all?
 Because
 when
 we
 talk
 about


these
 problems,
 you
 look
 at
 what's


happening
 with
 space.
 We
 now
 can
 get
 to


space
 for,
 you
 know,
 5%
 of
 the
 cost
 than


we
 used
 to.
 Thanks
 to
 Elon
 Musk
 and


SpaceX,
 we
 have
 superchargers
 and


chargers
 everywhere
 thanks
 to
 Tesla
 and


a
 number
 of
 other


folks
 putting
 them
 out
 there,
 Charge


Point,
 etc.
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 putting


fiber
 into
 rural
 areas,
 which
 the
 FTC


was
 trying
 to
 do,
 they
 were
 going
 to


spend5
 to
 $25,000
 per
 home.
 And
 now
 we


have
 Starlink
 and
 their
 competitors.


Again,
 back
 to
 Elon,
 which
 your
 party


decided


under
 Biden,
 you
 wouldn't
 even
 invite


the
 guy
 to
 the
 EV
 summit.
 So,


>> well,
 let
 me
 talk
 about
 that,
 but
 we'll


I
 want
 to
 park
 that
 to
 the
 side
 because


we
 should
 probably
 talk
 about
 what


happened
 there.
 But
 let's
 forget
 that


cuz
 I
 want
 to
 I
 want
 to
 mention
 that


>> because
 when
 you
 when
 you
 know
 I
 I'm
 a


I'm
 a
 moderate
 but
 voted
 Democrat
 about


65%
 of
 the
 time
 and
 Republican
 a
 third


of
 the
 time.
 When
 I
 look
 at
 it,
 I
 just


can't
 understand
 how
 the
 Democratic


party
 hates
 us
 so
 much.
 Hates


entrepreneurs
 and
 that's
 how
 they
 feel.


But
 that's
 how
 that's
 how
 Silicon
 Valley


feels.
 We'll
 talk
 about
 whether
 you
 want


to
 deny
 it
 or
 not.
 But
 it
 feels
 like


>> hate
 entre
 like
 I
 don't
 think
 most


Democrats
 do.
 I
 I
 but
 I
 I
 know
 what
 you


mean
 about
 the
 vibes
 and
 we
 should
 get


to
 the
 piece
 about
 about
 Elon


particularly
 but
 but
 but
 on
 the
 piece


you're
 on
 the
 substance
 of
 the
 question


you're
 raising.
 Yeah.
 I
 think
 it's


really
 important
 to
 think
 of
 this
 as


>> not
 like
 should
 it
 be
 government
 or


should
 it
 be
 the
 private
 sector
 but
 like


which
 parts
 should
 government
 do
 and


which
 parts
 should
 the
 private
 sector


do.
 So
 to
 me
 like
 the
 classic
 example
 is


just
 the
 smartphone
 right.
 Um,
 I
 cannot


imagine
 that
 a
 smartphone
 designed
 by


the
 federal
 government
 would
 be
 a
 pretty


thing
 or
 that
 an
 app
 designed
 by
 a


matter
 of
 fact
 having
 been
 in
 the


military
 and
 and
 dealt
 with
 I
 guess
 you


could
 call
 them
 apps
 like
 some
 of
 the


kind
 of
 uh
 software
 that
 that
 that
 you


have
 to
 deal
 with
 even
 if
 it's
 done
 by


contractors.
 It's
 kind
 of
 done
 in
 a
 way


that
 you
 can
 tell
 was
 designed
 by
 the


government
 and
 and
 and
 it's
 not
 pretty.


Um,
 on
 the
 other
 hand,
 you
 know,
 when


you
 talk
 about
 capital
 allocation,
 the


federal
 government
 literally
 invented


the
 internet,
 right?
 So,
 there's
 things


there's
 certain
 trillion
 dollar
 ideas


that
 the
 private
 sector
 just
 won't
 do


cuz
 it
 doesn't
 pencil
 or
 because
 of


whatever
 market
 failure
 is
 there.
 That's


where
 you
 need
 government.
 That's
 things


like
 basic
 research.
 That's
 things
 like


filling
 in
 gaps
 that
 especially
 on


network
 effects
 like
 you
 know
 broadband,


EV
 charging
 networks,
 that
 sort
 of
 thing


where
 the
 bulk
 of
 it
 can
 be
 done
 quite


well
 by
 the
 private
 sector,
 but
 there


are
 pieces
 that
 just
 don't
 click
 unless


you
 have
 unless
 you
 have
 federal


involvement.
 And
 that's
 the
 attitude
 we


tried
 to
 take
 on
 things
 like
 EVs.
 Like
 I


never
 thought
 that
 we
 were
 going
 to,
 you


know,
 create
 a
 government
 EV
 or
 that
 you


even
 needed
 the
 government
 to
 make
 sure


that
 a
 transition
 to
 electric
 happened.


But
 we
 did
 believe
 that
 for
 it
 to
 be


made
 in
 America,
 for
 it
 to
 happen
 as


quickly
 as
 we
 wanted,
 and
 for
 it
 to


reach
 people
 who
 maybe
 couldn't
 afford


those
 those
 initial
 buyin
 costs
 who
 we


really
 wanted
 to
 help
 out,
 you
 know,


that's
 where
 there's
 a
 role
 for
 policy.


That's
 where
 there's
 a
 role
 for
 funding.


>> What
 I
 get
 confused
 though,
 Pete,
 is


like
 on
 the
 one
 hand,
 you're
 saying
 the


government
 should
 set
 up
 these
 clear


moonshot
 objectives
 that
 advance
 America


>> for
 itself
 and
 relative
 to
 other


countries.
 But
 then
 the
 other
 side
 is


that
 if
 you
 do
 too
 well
 achieving
 those


objectives,
 we
 want
 to
 go
 and
 take
 a


bunch
 of
 that
 away
 from
 you.
 How
 do
 you


reconcile
 that?
 And
 how
 do
 you
 think
 it


impacts
 the
 the
 motivations
 of
 young
 men


and
 women
 who
 want
 to
 learn
 and
 excel


and
 put
 themselves
 at
 risk
 but
 also
 want


to
 believe
 that
 if
 they
 put
 themselves


at
 risk
 and
 then
 they
 are
 rewarded
 that


they've
 earned
 those
 rewards.


>> Look,
 uh
 I
 love
 people
 being


entrepreneurial,
 creating
 something
 and


doing
 well
 by
 it.
 I
 mean
 that's
 but
 to
 a


certain
 basic
 idea
 only
 to
 a
 certain


level
 like
 beyond
 a
 certain
 point
 of


>> entrepreneurship
 if
 you
 create
 a


monopoly.
 Yeah.
 If
 you
 create
 a
 monopoly


I
 might
 not
 like
 it.
 If
 you
 hurt
 other


people
 I
 might
 not
 like
 it.
 If
 you


concentrate
 power
 into
 your
 hands
 to
 an


extreme
 extent
 I
 might
 not
 like
 it


because
 that's
 just
 that's
 just
 not


American.
 But
 in
 general
 if
 we're


talking
 about
 taxation
 I
 just
 want
 to


make
 sure
 people
 who
 are
 really
 well
 off


do
 their
 part
 to
 pay
 into
 a
 system
 that


has
 helped
 them
 to
 thrive.
 uh
 because
 uh


you
 know
 that's
 what
 it
 takes
 for
 the


next
 generation
 to
 do
 well
 and
 that's


what
 it
 took
 for
 all
 of
 us
 to
 do
 well.
 I


mean


>> let's
 just
 assume
 you're
 president.
 You


get
 trillions
 of
 dollars
 of
 receipts.


>> Mhm.


>> I'm
 going
 to
 guess
 the
 party
 line
 that


you
 have
 to
 take
 as
 Doge
 was
 bad.
 Okay,


fine.
 What
 is
 the
 version
 of
 Doge
 that


you
 would
 implement
 so
 that


>> Great
 question.


>> We
 could
 figure
 out
 what
 percentage
 of


that
 dollar
 that
 we're
 giving
 you
 is


wasted
 and
 stop
 it.


>> Yeah.
 So,
 I
 would
 love
 in
 theory
 a


department
 of
 government
 efficiency
 that


was
 actually
 about
 government


efficiency.
 I
 think
 that
 would
 make
 tons


of
 sense.
 Uh,
 it's
 what
 I
 tried
 to
 do


again
 when
 I
 was
 mayor.
 We
 took
 apart


the
 small
 government
 that
 I
 was
 in


charge
 of
 about
 a
 $300
 million
 operation


and
 put
 it
 back
 together
 and
 found
 that


it
 could
 be
 radically
 more
 efficient
 in


many
 ways.
 And
 we
 need
 to
 do
 that
 at
 the


federal
 level.
 We
 need
 to


>> How
 much
 money
 did
 you
 take
 out
 from


that
 300?


>> Uh,
 we
 we
 used
 it
 better.
 I
 would
 put
 it


that
 way.
 So,
 uh,
 you
 know,
 we
 didn't
 I


mean,
 there
 were
 areas
 where
 we
 were


able
 to
 kind
 of
 have,
 uh,
 uh,
 have
 a


certain,
 uh,
 budget
 line
 item
 shrink,


but
 in
 a
 city
 where
 the
 average
 per


capita
 income
 was
 18
 or
 $19,000
 per


person
 when
 I
 came
 in,
 uh,
 we
 weren't


handing
 that
 over
 in
 tax
 breaks
 to


wealthy
 residents.
 We
 were
 putting
 it
 to


other
 use
 on
 uh,
 on
 public
 safety
 uh,


and
 fundamentals
 like
 that.
 But
 look,


again,
 I
 agree
 that
 the
 doge
 we
 could


have
 could
 do
 a
 lot
 of
 really
 good
 work.


It
 could
 find
 duplicative
 regulations.


it
 could
 find
 cases
 where
 we
 could
 move


from
 inputbased
 to
 outputbased


uh
 evaluation
 of
 our
 programs.
 In
 other


words,
 instead
 of
 saying
 like
 this
 is
 a


meaningful
 program
 because
 how
 many


billions
 went
 into
 it,
 uh
 figure
 out
 how


much
 value
 came
 out
 of
 it.
 But
 the
 Doge


we
 got
 was
 one
 that
 couldn't
 even
 count


that
 put
 uh
 information
 sometimes
 that


was
 wrong
 by
 three
 orders
 of
 magnitude


on
 its
 own
 website
 then
 erased
 its
 own


information
 because
 they
 didn't
 believe


in
 the
 transparency.
 The
 doge
 we
 got


sent
 an
 email
 to
 every
 air
 traffic


controller
 in
 the
 country
 during
 an
 air


traffic
 controller
 shortage
 and


suggested
 they
 quit
 being
 an
 air
 traffic


controller
 and
 get
 something
 quote
 more


productive
 to
 do
 in
 the
 private
 sector


only
 later
 on
 to
 be
 told
 actually
 uh


that
 was
 a
 mistake.
 The
 Doge
 we
 got


apparently
 wasn't
 supposed
 to
 send
 that


information
 all
 the
 air
 traffic


controllers.
 Whoops.
 the
 Doge
 we
 got


fired
 people
 in
 charge
 of
 making
 sure


our
 nuclear
 weapons
 were
 safe
 and
 in


charge
 of
 making
 sure
 that
 bird
 flu


didn't
 spread
 and
 then
 whoops
 you
 know


tried
 to
 hire
 them
 back
 in
 a
 race.
 So


yeah,
 there's
 a
 huge
 difference
 between


the
 doge
 we
 got
 and
 the
 doge
 we
 could


have
 had.
 But
 if
 you're
 talking
 about
 in


principle
 should
 we
 unleash
 like
 really


smart
 talented
 people
 with
 an
 outside
 in


perspective
 and
 a
 free
 hand
 to
 evaluate


what
 is
 working
 and
 where
 we're
 not


getting
 value
 for
 our
 money
 in


government.
 like
 you
 and
 I
 would
 be
 on


in
 violent
 agreement
 that
 that's
 a
 good


idea
 and
 there's
 no
 better
 place
 to
 find


some
 of
 those
 opportunities
 than
 the


things
 that
 the
 federal
 government
 does


because
 it
 just
 does
 or
 because
 there


was
 a
 good
 reason
 once
 upon
 a
 time
 but


that
 reason
 has
 expired
 or
 maybe
 the


reason
 was
 not
 good
 to
 begin
 with.


>> Can
 we
 go
 to
 debt
 maybe
 um
 as
 part
 of


this?
 I
 don't
 know
 where
 you
 were
 going


to
 go
 chas
 but
 I
 think
 maybe


>> I
 wanted
 to
 I
 wanted
 to
 go
 to
 the
 inner


workings
 of
 the
 Democratic
 party
 but
 go


ahead
 to
 debt
 and
 then
 we
 can
 go


>> yeah
 and
 then
 that's
 a
 good
 segue.
 I
 was


just
 going
 to
 point
 out,
 you
 know,
 we've


we've
 added
 about
 $2
 trillion
 in
 debt


over
 the
 last
 uh
 well,
 nine
 years
 now


under
 Trump,
 one
 uh
 45
 46
 Biden
 and
 now


again
 with
 Trump,
 we
 just
 hit
 38


trillion.
 So,
 it
 seems
 like
 we're
 adding


2
 trillion
 a
 year.
 What's
 your
 take
 on


the
 sustainability
 of
 this?


>> First
 of
 all,
 the
 the
 debt
 path
 we're
 on


is
 not
 sustainable.
 And
 that's
 one
 area


where
 you're
 right,
 neither
 party
 has


covered
 themselves
 in
 glory.
 And
 it's
 an


area
 where
 I
 would
 part
 with
 some
 in
 my


own
 party.
 I
 think
 for
 too
 long
 you've


heard
 the
 message
 from


Democrats
 is
 basically
 debt
 doesn't


matter
 like
 or
 there's
 no
 such
 thing.


>> And
 there
 was
 a
 moment
 when
 this
 felt
 a


little
 more
 credible.
 Some
 of
 the


evidence
 at
 as
 of
 a
 few
 years
 ago
 uh
 put


a
 lot
 of
 wind
 in
 the
 sales
 of
 what
 was


called
 modern
 monetary
 theory.
 Uh
 I


think
 a
 lot
 of
 that
 looks
 different
 now.


>> It
 looks
 different.
 And
 then
 you
 had
 the


And
 then
 you
 had
 the
 Republicans,
 right,


who
 say
 that
 debt
 matters
 but
 then
 uh


act
 the
 exact
 opposite.
 Now,
 look,
 as
 as


a
 good
 Democrat,
 I
 could
 point
 out
 that


I
 would
 argue
 there's
 a
 difference
 in


terms
 of
 what
 history
 empirically
 has


shown
 us
 in
 terms
 of
 the
 return
 on


investment
 you
 get
 when
 you
 raise
 debt


to
 fix
 roads
 and
 bridges
 and
 other


productive
 infrastructure
 versus
 if
 you


blow
 up
 the
 debt
 in
 order
 to
 give


massive
 tax
 breaks
 to
 the
 wealthiest


people
 in
 the
 country.
 because
 that
 has


just
 never
 generated
 the
 growth
 that
 you


know
 I
 mean
 the
 laugher
 curve
 has


collapsed
 empirically
 and
 it
 just


doesn't
 work
 that
 way
 right
 so
 I
 could


quibble
 over
 if
 you're
 going
 to
 do
 debt


what's
 the
 best
 thing
 to
 do
 with
 it
 and


I
 would
 argue
 the
 best
 thing
 to
 do
 with


it
 is
 education
 healthcare
 investing
 it


make
 sure
 kids
 don't
 get
 lead
 poisoned


investing
 it
 in
 ports
 and
 roads
 and
 not


investing
 it
 in
 uh
 uh
 you
 know
 in
 tax


cuts
 for
 extremely
 wealthy
 people
 who


who
 didn't
 need
 them
 and
 in
 some
 cases


weren't
 really
 asking
 for
 it
 and
 were


perfectly
 productive
 in
 fact
 history


would
 say
 more
 productive
 at
 times
 in


history
 when
 they
 were
 paying
 more
 taxes


in
 the
 US.
 But
 leaving
 that
 partisan


fight
 aside,
 I
 do
 want
 to
 come
 back
 and


agree
 with
 you
 again
 that
 that
 where
 we


are
 right
 now
 is
 not
 sustainable.
 That


contrary
 to
 what
 some
 on
 the
 left
 would


say,
 there
 is
 such
 a
 thing
 as
 the
 debt.


It
 does
 matter
 and
 we
 need
 to
 make
 sure


that
 what
 we're
 doing
 going
 forward
 is


more
 consistent
 with
 with
 some
 basic


fiscal
 responsibility.


>> What
 is
 the
 fiscal
 responsibility?
 I


mean,
 I
 hear
 all
 these,
 you
 know,


political
 speak
 over
 and
 over
 again
 from


you
 guys,
 but
 I
 never
 hear
 anybody
 say,


"You
 know
 what?
 We
 got
 to
 tighten
 our


belts,
 folks.
 We're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 cut


unemployment.
 We
 have
 to
 cut
 these
 uh


and
 we're
 going to
 have
 to
 raise
 taxes


here.
 We
 have
 to
 make
 cuts
 here."
 I


don't
 ever
 hear
 any
 of
 you
 come
 up
 with


like
 a
 plan
 that
 actually
 would
 pass


mustard
 with
 any
 of
 us
 in
 the
 business


community
 who
 have
 to
 run
 companies
 and


make
 sure
 they're
 solvent.
 This
 does
 not


seem
 like
 you
 have
 a
 plan
 or
 anybody


else
 has
 a
 plan.
 And
 it's
 is
 it
 because


it's
 so
 unpopular
 that
 you
 can't
 just


say,
 "Hey,
 it's
 there's
 going
 to
 be
 some


austerity
 here
 and
 it's
 going to
 be


painful
 and
 there's
 going
 to
 be
 more


taxes
 and
 that's
 going
 to
 be
 painful
 and


then
 you
 don't
 get
 elected."


>> Is
 that
 the
 issue?


>> I
 literally
 did
 put
 out
 a
 plan
 which
 I


balanced
 every
 single
 spending
 back
 when


I
 was
 running
 for
 president
 in
 2020,


which
 feels
 like
 another
 lifetime.
 Every


single
 thing
 that
 I
 proposed
 spending


on,
 uh,
 I
 also
 proposed
 to
 pay
 for
 and


explained
 what
 would
 have
 to
 happen


tax-wise
 in
 order
 to
 do
 it.
 And
 again,


that's
 just
 those
 are
 the
 habits
 that
 I


built
 as
 a
 mayor
 who
 had
 to
 do
 my
 budget


in
 cash.
 So,
 look,
 it's
 not
 like
 it's
 a


completely
 unsolvable
 problem.
 There
 are


measures
 that
 we
 got
 to
 take
 to
 reduce


things
 like
 the
 cost
 of
 providing


healthcare,
 which
 is
 one
 of
 the
 biggest


uh
 uh
 sources
 of
 pressure
 on
 uh


Medicare,
 Medicaid,
 you
 name
 it.
 Not


just
 getting
 people
 insured,
 but
 the


actual
 underlying
 cost.
 Same
 with


pharmaceuticals.
 And
 then
 there
 are


things
 you
 got
 to
 do
 on
 the
 revenue


side.
 Like
 I'm
 I'm
 sorry,
 but
 like
 we


can't
 just
 slash
 a
 trillion
 bucks
 from


from
 what
 the
 wealthiest
 people
 are


paying
 again
 and
 again
 and
 then
 call


this
 a
 sustainable
 budget.


>> The
 trillion
 dollars
 of
 cuts.
 What
 is


that
 specifically
 that's
 being
 cut?


>> Oh,
 you
 mean
 the
 on
 the
 on
 the
 tax
 side?


>> Yeah.


>> Well,
 start
 with
 OBBA,
 right?
 Uh
 and


then
 TCGAA,
 too.
 Like
 we
 know
 that
 the


vast
 majority
 of
 the
 benefits
 of
 those


tax
 cuts
 went
 to
 the
 wealthiest.
 Uh,
 we


could
 say
 the
 same
 about
 the
 broader


pattern
 of
 cutting
 taxes
 going
 back
 to
 I


mean
 I
 guess
 if
 you
 look
 back
 over
 the


50
 years.
 I
 mean
 why
 do
 you
 think
 that


the
 American
 entrepreneurial
 class
 was


more
 productive
 in
 terms
 of
 annual


productivity
 growth
 back
 when
 taxes
 were


higher?


>> How
 do
 you
 measure
 that?


>> Well,
 I
 don't
 know.
 Productivity
 growth


and
 income
 taxes.
 I
 mean
 those
 are
 two


pretty
 simple
 measures
 you
 could
 use.


>> And
 as
 I'm
 sure
 you
 know


>> which
 era


>> well
 look
 at
 the
 70s
 and
 80s,
 right?


60s7s
 80s.
 look
 at
 GDP
 growth,


productivity
 growth,
 and
 tax
 rates.
 I


I'm
 sure
 you're
 aware
 that
 those
 growth


rates
 were
 higher
 and
 the
 tax
 rates
 were


higher,
 too.
 I'm
 not
 saying
 there's
 no


correlation
 where
 like
 if
 you
 overt
 tax,


you'll
 eventually
 get
 less
 productivity,


but
 you
 know,
 if
 you
 look


[clears throat]
 at
 where
 we
 are
 in
 the


spectrum
 between
 too
 far
 this
 way
 and


too
 far
 that
 way,


>> it's
 not
 like
 we're
 doing
 this
 in
 a


vacto
 data.
 But
 I
 just
 want
 to
 make


sure.
 You
 think
 the
 BBB
 was
 a
 giveaway


to
 rich
 folks?
 Like
 no
 taxes
 on
 tips,


extending
 the
 Trump
 tax
 cuts
 that


disproportionately
 affected


middle-income
 folks.
 Those
 are
 those
 are


giveaways
 to
 rich
 people.


>> Do
 I
 think
 the
 majority
 of
 the
 OBBA
 tax


cuts
 went
 to
 rich
 people?
 Yes.


>> And
 how
 do
 you
 define
 majority?
 Like


dollar
 tonnage
 of
 depreciation
 or
 actual


dollars
 in
 pockets
 of
 humans?


>> I
 mean,
 either
 way
 you
 look
 at
 it,


right?


It's
 important
 how
 you
 look
 at
 it


because
 it's


>> actually
 if
 you're
 low
 income
 uh
 dollars


in
 your
 pockets
 is
 going
 down
 when
 you


account
 for
 what
 they've
 done
 with
 the


subsidies.
 I
 mean
 remember
 this
 is
 I


don't
 care
 how
 subsidies
 which
 subsidies


>> can
 you
 name
 me
 a
 measure
 can
 you
 name
 a


measure
 by
 which


>> I'm
 ask
 I'm
 asking
 you
 I'm
 asking
 the


politician
 I
 don't
 know


>> yeah
 I
 don't
 have
 a
 line
 item
 breakdown


in
 front
 of
 me
 what
 I'm
 telling
 you
 is


that
 it
 is
 not
 terribly
 contested
 like


if
 anybody
 listening
 to
 this
 podcast


feels
 like
 opening
 up
 a
 window
 and


looking
 it
 up
 for
 themselves
 uh
 just
 to


figure
 out
 which
 one
 of
 us
 is
 right
 it's


not
 terribly
 contested
 that
 the
 majority


of
 the
 benefit
 of
 TCGA
 and
 OB
 OBBA
 went


to
 wealthy
 people
 and
 it's
 definitely


not
 contested
 or
 I
 would
 say
 generally


not
 contested
 that
 OBBA
 represents
 one


of
 the
 largest
 transfers
 of
 wealth
 from


lower
 income
 people
 to
 upper
 income


people
 in
 global
 history.


>> How
 do
 you
 measure
 that?


>> You
 can
 measure
 it
 in
 terms
 of
 wealth


before
 and
 after.
 You
 can
 measure
 it
 in


terms
 of
 the
 incidence
 of
 the
 different


forms
 of
 taxation.
 You
 can
 measure
 it
 in


a
 total
 package
 that
 accounts
 for


subsidy
 as
 well
 as
 as
 benefit.
 I
 mean


any
 number
 of
 ways.
 But
 again,
 if
 you


measure
 it
 a
 different
 way,
 I'd
 love
 to


hear
 it
 because
 I
 don't
 I
 don't
 regard


this
 as
 something
 that's
 deeply


contested,
 but
 it
 sounds
 like
 you
 have
 a


measurement
 in
 mind
 that's
 different,


and
 I'd
 love
 to
 run
 with
 it
 and
 look
 it


up
 so
 I
 can
 see
 where
 you're
 coming


from.


>> And
 we
 definitely
 cut
 corporate
 taxes


and
 personal
 taxes
 because
 of
 TCJ.
 Yeah.


Right.
 I
 mean,
 that
 was


>> And
 to
 be
 clear
 again,
 because
 the
 LER


curve
 turns
 out
 to
 be
 we
 did


not
 just
 grow
 our
 way
 out
 of
 the


deficits
 that
 created.
 Right.


>> Let
 me
 ask
 you
 a
 question
 about
 the


inner
 workings
 of
 the
 Democratic
 party.


I'm
 sure
 you've
 been
 asked
 this
 a


hundred
 times,
 so
 sorry
 for
 us
 being
 the


101st,
 but
 in
 Kla
 Harris's
 memoir,
 she


points
 in
 part
 to
 your
 identity
 as
 a


reason
 why
 you
 weren't
 considered
 as
 her


running
 mate.
 Can
 you
 explain
 to
 us
 the


role
 of
 identity
 in
 Democratic
 politics?


Both
 perhaps
 you
 on
 the
 way
 in
 when
 you


were
 nominated
 for
 secretary
 and
 then


maybe
 on
 the
 way
 out
 when
 you
 were
 not


considered
 as
 a
 credible
 VP
 candidate.


Let's
 just
 say
 I
 would
 love
 for
 identity


to
 play
 a
 less
 central
 role
 uh
 in
 the


politics
 of
 our
 country
 and
 and
 the


politics
 of
 my
 party
 and
 and
 not
 just


because
 I
 might
 have
 been
 passed
 over


for
 uh
 for
 an
 opportunity,
 but
 just


because
 I
 think
 it
 is
 it
 has
 really


dominated
 so
 many
 people's
 thinking
 in
 a


way
 that
 makes
 it
 harder
 for
 us
 to
 build


a
 message
 across
 identities.
 I
 mean,


don't
 get
 me
 wrong,
 I
 I
 don't
 think
 it
 I


don't
 think
 it
 makes
 sense
 to
 pretend


that
 identity
 doesn't
 matter.
 I
 don't


think
 it
 makes
 sense
 to
 pretend
 to
 be


colorblind.
 I
 also
 don't
 think
 it
 makes


sense
 to
 allow
 that
 to
 explain


everything,
 which
 is
 one
 of
 the
 habits


that's
 formed,
 I
 think
 definitely
 on
 my


party's
 far
 left,
 that
 that
 made
 it


harder
 for
 us
 to
 get
 through,
 especially


when
 you
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 whose


interests
 are
 shared.
 I'm
 thinking
 about


the
 economic
 interest
 of
 poor
 people
 and


low-wealth
 people
 in
 this
 country,
 for


example,
 who
 are
 black,
 white,
 and
 of
 of


every
 ethnicity
 and
 identity
 and
 gender,


of
 course,
 who
 maybe
 didn't
 hear
 a


unifying
 message
 that
 was
 speaking
 to


them
 as
 a
 group
 because
 it
 felt
 like
 my


party
 was
 it
 was
 like
 a
 salad
 bar,
 like


here's
 something
 for
 your
 group
 and


here's
 something
 for
 another
 group
 and


here's
 something
 for
 another
 group
 and


it
 didn't
 add
 up
 into
 a
 story.
 Now,
 I


would
 argue
 that
 Trump
 practices
 a
 kind


of
 identity
 politics,
 too.
 a
 sort
 of
 a


white
 identity
 politics
 that
 uh
 makes


people
 feel
 like
 they
 are
 encircled
 by


the
 other
 that
 that
 that
 immigrants
 are


sort
 of
 an
 invasion.
 I
 mean,
 we
 can
 go


down
 that
 road
 and
 I
 often
 have,
 but
 uh


the
 more
 straightforward
 way
 to
 answer


your
 question
 about
 my
 party
 is
 that
 I


think
 identity
 has
 become
 too
 central
 to


how
 my
 party
 thinks.


>> How
 have
 they
 reacted?
 You
 know,
 you
 you


took
 a
 pretty
 firm
 line
 on
 Israel
 Gaza.


You
 took
 a
 pretty
 firm
 line
 on


transgender
 folks
 in
 sports.
 tell
 us


about
 the
 dynamics
 of
 taking
 those


positions
 inside
 the
 Democratic
 party.


>> Famously,
 our
 party
 has
 a
 lot
 of


different
 voices
 within
 it.
 And
 so,
 you


know,
 some
 folks
 uh
 if
 you
 are
 not


saying
 the
 leftmost
 thing,
 uh
 they're


just
 done
 with
 you.
 But
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of


others
 believe
 in
 the
 idea
 of
 politics


as
 as
 building
 a
 coalition
 and
 and


pulling
 people
 into
 a
 bigger
 picture.


and
 and
 I'm
 going
 to
 say
 some
 things


that
 uh
 you
 know
 won't
 be
 in
 conformity


with
 what
 every
 activist
 group
 in
 my


party
 wants
 to
 hear.
 That's
 okay.
 That's


that's
 part
 of
 it.


>> How
 do
 you
 navigate
 the
 the
 necessary


extremism
 maybe
 that's
 required
 then
 to


get
 out
 of
 a
 primary
 process?


>> Well,
 this
 is
 the
 classic
 issue
 with


going
 from
 primaries
 to
 generals,
 right?


you
 you
 are
 pressured
 to
 say
 one
 thing


to
 appeal
 to
 the
 base
 in
 your
 party
 and


then
 you
 wind
 up
 if
 if
 you're
 not


careful
 saying
 things
 that
 make
 it
 hard


for
 you
 to
 have
 credibility
 in
 a
 general


election
 when
 you're
 trying
 to
 uh
 paint


a
 picture
 that
 the
 broadest
 number
 of


people
 possible
 can
 can
 see
 themselves


in.
 That's
 nothing
 new.
 But
 one
 thing


that
 has
 happened
 more
 and
 more
 and
 more


is
 that
 that's
 happening
 in
 more
 and


more
 races.
 So
 the
 presidency
 is
 always


a
 little
 bit
 like
 this,
 but
 the


presidency
 is
 also
 the
 one
 that
 gets


painted
 in
 the
 broadest
 strokes
 because


it's
 it's
 a
 campaign
 for
 the
 whole


country
 and
 it's
 all
 the
 different


jostling
 around
 all
 the
 issues
 and
 all


the
 groups
 all
 boiled
 down
 into
 two


people
 running
 for
 one
 office.
 But
 where


I
 think
 this
 actually
 hurts
 us
 the
 most


is
 in
 Congress.
 So
 we
 got
 435
 seats
 in


the
 House.
 Last
 time
 I
 checked,
 less


than
 one
 out
 of
 10
 of
 them
 is
 considered


to
 be
 seriously
 competitive
 at
 best.


like
 less
 than
 40
 are
 actually


competitive,
 which
 means
 in
 nine
 out
 of


10
 races,
 the
 primary
 is
 pretty
 much
 it.


So,
 you
 never
 even
 have
 to
 bother


thinking
 about
 whether
 some
 stance
 you


took
 in
 the
 primary
 is
 going
 to
 make
 it


harder
 for
 you
 to
 work
 across
 the
 aisle


or
 or
 harder
 to
 win
 people
 over
 or
 bring


them
 together
 in
 the
 general
 because


these
 districts
 are
 so
 gerrymandered,


right,
 that
 uh
 that
 all
 you
 have
 to


worry
 about
 is
 your
 right
 flank
 if


you're
 a
 Republican
 uh
 or
 your
 left


flank
 if
 you're
 a
 Democrat.
 That's
 where


I
 think
 it
 hurts
 us
 the
 most.
 the


Democratic
 Party.
 Really
 two
 parties


right
 now.
 The
 classic
 Democratic
 Party,


I'll
 call
 it
 the
 Clinton
 Obama
 party,


you
 know,
 hey,
 [clears throat]
 we're


socially
 liberal,
 but
 we're
 not
 like


absolutely
 crazy
 and
 insane.
 We
 we
 don't


necessarily
 uh
 need
 to
 advocate
 to
 have


trans
 kids
 get
 surgeries
 and
 uh
 when


they're
 12
 years
 old
 and
 14
 years
 old


and
 all
 the
 stuff
 that's
 now
 become,
 you


know,
 illegal
 in
 most
 modern
 countries.


Is
 it
 two
 parties
 now?
 is
 I'm
 watching


Manny
 and
 like
 that
 group
 go,
 "Hey,
 ban


the
 billionaires,
 more
 taxes
 and


socialism,
 and
 here's
 all
 the
 handouts.


We're
 going
 for
 it."
 And
 then
 there's


guys
 like
 you
 and
 you
 know
 the
 I
 would


say
 the
 the
 more
 Clinton
 era,
 Obama
 era


kind
 of
 moderate
 Democrats
 now
 is
 is


kind
 of
 how
 I'd
 frame
 it.
 And
 then
 can


those
 two
 ever
 coexist
 in
 the
 same


party?


>> I
 think
 both
 parties
 have
 their


contradictions
 and
 that's
 definitely


true
 for
 my
 party.
 Uh,
 I
 mean
 the
 way
 I


view
 it
 is
 one
 of the
 biggest
 problems


we
 have
 as
 a
 society
 is
 this
 level
 of


inequality
 we've
 hit
 that
 like


historically
 there's
 no
 evidence
 that


any
 republic
 can
 reach
 this
 level
 of


equality
 to
 hold
 on
 to
 it
 and
 continue


to
 be
 a
 republic.
 And
 so
 the
 question
 is


what
 do
 you
 do
 about
 it?
 And
 you've
 got


obviously
 a
 socialist
 left
 that
 says
 the


answer
 is
 socialism.
 Uh
 you've
 got
 uh


Republicans
 who
 tend
 to
 say
 this
 is
 not


a
 problem
 at
 all.
 And
 then
 you
 got
 where


I
 think
 of
 as
 the
 center
 or
 at
 least


what
 I
 would
 like
 to
 be
 the
 center
 of
 my


party,
 which
 is
 saying,
 "Yeah,
 we've
 got


to
 do
 things.
 We
 got
 to
 lean
 in.
 We
 got


to
 use
 uh
 the
 tools
 of
 the
 state,
 not
 in


a
 socialist
 way,
 but
 uh
 in
 a
 way
 to
 try


to
 have
 things
 be
 more
 balanced
 in
 this


country."
 Um
 is
 there
 a
 contest
 between


kind
 of the
 center
 left
 and
 the
 far
 left


or
 however
 you
 want
 to
 characterize
 it?


Sure.
 But
 then,
 you
 know,
 I
 mean,


today's
 Republican
 party
 is
 a
 coalition


of
 normal
 Chamber
 of
 Commerce
 business


Republicans,
 more
 of
 the
 kind
 of
 tech


Republicans
 who
 to
 me
 are
 more


libertarian,
 even
 though
 it
 puzzles
 me


that
 they're
 for
 uh
 such
 uh
 dramatic


government
 control
 over
 society
 right


now
 and
 Trump.
 But
 whatever.
 My
 point
 is


you
 have
 you
 have
 normal
 business


Republicans,
 you
 have
 technibertarians,


you've
 got
 economic
 populists,
 right,


who's
 who
 who
 are
 in
 many
 ways
 to
 the


left
 of
 even
 even
 left
 of
 center
 in
 some


weird
 ways
 on
 on
 trade
 and
 some
 uh


issues
 like
 that.
 And
 then
 you
 got
 white


nationalists,
 right?
 And
 I
 don't
 know


that
 they
 can
 coexist
 for
 long
 if


they're
 not
 held
 together
 by
 the
 awe
 of


or
 fear
 of,
 you
 know,
 the
 personality
 of


Donald
 Trump.
 Uh
 and
 you
 know
 people


keep
 imagining
 maybe
 what
 if
 we
 had
 a


third
 party
 and
 you
 know
 I
 look
 at
 other


countries
 that
 have
 it's
 not
 it's
 not


unusual
 in
 a
 lot
 of
 other
 modern


countries
 to
 have
 four
 five
 six
 seven


parties.
 In
 some
 ways
 it
 feels
 on
 its


face
 like
 that
 would
 make
 more
 sense
 in


the
 US
 but
 I
 I
 think
 the
 reality
 in


practice
 is
 anytime
 somebody
 tries
 to
 go


off
 and
 start
 a
 third
 party
 it
 just
 it


just
 winds
 up
 screwing
 it
 up
 for
 one
 of


the
 other
 two
 and
 we're
 right
 back
 where


it
 started.
 Pete,
 do
 you
 think
 that


Donald
 Trump
 made
 the
 right
 decision
 to


close
 the
 border?
 And
 if
 not,
 why
 not?


>> I
 think
 that
 he
 is
 right
 to
 draw


attention
 to
 the
 problem
 of
 the
 border


and
 that
 it
 is
 uh
 it
 is
 important
 to


have
 a
 secure
 border.
 I
 don't
 believe
 it


was
 true
 that
 it
 was
 exactly
 open


before.
 Uh
 I
 think
 it
 is
 functionally


closed
 now,
 but
 I
 I
 would
 agree
 that
 the


last
 administration
 uh
 didn't
 do
 enough


and
 didn't
 do
 enough
 early
 enough.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.


>> And
 why
 do
 you
 think
 Biden
 looked
 the


other
 way?


>> What
 was
 the
 strategy?
 Was
 there
 a


strategy?


>> Yeah,
 I
 think
 what
 happened
 was
 he
 was


really
 looking
 to
 Congress
 to
 do
 it.
 He


came
 out
 of
 Congress.
 He
 was
 a
 creature


of
 Congress
 and
 thought,
 you
 know,


Congress
 can
 forge
 a
 bipartisan
 since,


you
 know,
 there's
 actually
 a
 bipartisan


agreement
 among
 the
 American
 people
 on


what
 to
 do,
 right?
 Which
 is
 what
 most


people
 believe,
 what
 I
 believe,
 which
 is


let's
 make
 it
 harder
 to
 come
 in


illegally
 and
 easier
 to
 come
 in
 legally


and
 and
 to
 get
 legal
 if
 you're
 not.
 I


mean,
 that's
 where
 most
 people
 are
 most


country.


>> Yeah.
 And
 that's
 where
 most
 of
 the
 space


for
 compromise
 has
 been
 on
 the
 hill.
 And


yet,
 you
 know,
 I
 think
 it
 was
 the
 '8s


last
 time
 we
 had
 an
 actual
 bill
 to
 fix


it.
 So,
 I
 think
 he,
 and
 this
 is


speculating,
 I
 I
 never
 really,
 you
 know,


was
 in
 the
 middle
 of
 the
 immigration


side
 of
 things,
 but
 I
 think
 he
 felt
 like


the
 way
 to
 do
 this
 was
 to
 get
 things


done
 in
 Congress,
 he
 he
 felt
 that,
 you


know,
 he'd
 managed
 to
 get
 the


infrastructure
 bill
 done,
 IRA.
 Um
 but


what's
 interesting
 is
 when
 he
 finally


gave
 up
 on
 Congress
 uh
 when
 it
 was
 clear


that
 we
 just
 weren't
 going
 to
 get
 very


far
 and
 meanwhile
 you
 had
 had
 that
 that


exe
 set
 of
 executive
 orders
 that
 came


late
 in
 the
 term
 that
 had
 a
 major
 effect


on
 the
 number
 of
 illegal
 crossings.
 So


you
 got
 to
 ask
 yourself
 if
 that


executive
 order
 that
 happened
 toward
 the


end
 if
 that
 had
 been
 done
 in
 year
 1,


year
 two,
 would
 we
 be
 in
 a
 different


place?
 Now
 of
 course
 we're
 on
 the
 other


extreme.
 I
 mean,
 we
 got
 we
 got
 citizens


who
 just
 have
 an
 accent
 or
 look
 brown


getting
 picked
 up
 sometimes
 getting


detained
 without
 access
 to
 a
 lawyer
 for


a
 frighteningly
 long
 amount
 of
 time.
 And


that's
 citizens,
 let
 alone
 other
 people


who,
 you
 know,
 maybe
 they
 shouldn't
 be


here,
 but
 they
 also
 shouldn't
 be


brutalized,
 right?
 And
 I
 think
 one


reason
 you
 see
 the
 pendulum
 swinging
 on


on
 this
 is
 is
 we're
 seeing
 just
 how


extreme
 it's
 gotten
 at
 a
 time
 when
 again


I
 think
 the
 only
 way
 forward
 really
 is
 a


kind
 of
 a
 grand
 bargain
 where
 we
 bring


together
 the
 the
 the
 the
 people
 who


believe
 in
 these
 simple
 realities
 that


we've
 got
 an
 economy
 and
 a
 society
 that


exerts
 a
 pull
 that
 actually
 needs
 more


people
 like
 for
 our
 demographics
 and
 our


economy
 to
 work
 then
 there
 is
 room
 in


the
 kind
 of
 legal
 pipeline
 to
 come
 in.


Just
 to
 clean
 this
 up,
 Pete,
 like
 if
 you


if
 it
 were
 up
 to
 you,
 would
 you
 reopen


the
 border
 or
 would
 you
 maintain
 the


Donald
 Trump
 position
 right
 now
 of
 okay,


now
 it's
 closed,
 now
 let's
 figure
 out


this
 grand
 bargain,
 as
 you
 say,
 keep


>> more
 precise
 by
 what
 we
 mean.
 I
 mean,
 if


you
 mean
 like
 having
 it
 be
 difficult,
 at


least
 as
 difficult
 as
 it
 is
 now,
 to


cross
 illegally.
 I
 think
 that's
 it's
 a


good
 thing
 for
 it
 to
 be
 difficult
 to


cross
 illegally.
 Um,
 but
 again,
 I
 think


calling
 it
 open
 then
 or
 closed
 now,


you're
 talking
 about
 a
 lot
 of
 different


overlapping
 things.
 Obviously,
 there
 are


a
 lot
 of
 things
 about
 Trump's


immigration
 policy
 I
 think
 are
 wrong,


destructive,
 possibly
 illegal,
 too.
 I


mean,
 if
 everybody
 has
 consensus
 that


the
 border
 should
 be
 closed
 and
 it


should
 be
 orderly
 and
 legal,
 uh,
 you


know,
 great.
 It's
 80%
 of
 the
 country.


Um,
 and
 then
 the
 majority
 of
 the
 country


doesn't
 like
 what
 we're
 seeing
 with
 ICE


agents
 without
 badges
 wearing
 masks.


That's
 the
 majority
 of
 the
 country
 is


uncomfortable
 with
 this.
 A
 large


percentage
 of
 the
 moderates
 who
 voted


for
 Trump,
 at least
 this
 is
 what
 the


surveys
 are
 saying,
 people
 are
 not


comfortable
 with
 this.
 So,
 I'm
 curious


about
 what
 you
 think
 the
 motivation
 is,


and
 you
 can
 go
 into
 conspiracy
 corner
 if


you
 want.
 It's
 allowed
 here
 on
 this


program.
 We
 can
 speculate,
 but
 the


conspiracy
 corner
 for
 Biden
 was
 he


wanted
 to
 let
 a
 lot
 more
 people
 in
 in


order
 to
 build
 the
 Democratic
 base
 in


order
 to
 get
 voters.
 Okay,
 that's
 one


theory.
 Now,
 the
 theory
 here
 is
 Trump
 is


doing
 these
 violent
 deportations,


tackling
 people,
 spending
 a
 lot
 of
 money


while
 doing
 it.
 Um,
 why
 why
 is
 Trump


doing
 it
 this
 way?
 Why
 does
 Pete
 think


he's
 doing
 it
 this
 way?
 I


>> I
 I
 think
 he
 thrives
 on
 a
 politics
 of


fear.
 I
 think
 chaos
 is
 good
 for
 him.
 I


think
 he
 thrives
 on
 chaos.
 Uh
 I
 think


when
 you
 see
 images
 of
 uh
 people
 getting


beaten
 up
 or
 you
 know
 what
 what
 he
 used


to
 call
 American
 carnage
 like
 anything


that
 validates
 that
 basically
 the
 worse


it
 it's
 a
 weird
 thing
 but
 the
 worse
 it


feels
 to
 be
 in
 this
 country
 the
 better


off
 Donald
 Trump
 is
 whether
 he's
 running


for
 president
 or
 whether
 he
 is
 president


and
 sending
 troops
 marching
 into
 the


streets.
 Can
 I
 just
 say
 as
 the
 only


immigrant
 right
 now
 on
 this
 podcast
 who


immigrated
 here
 legally,
 I
 feel
 much


safer
 and
 better
 under
 a
 Donald
 Trump


presidency
 than
 I
 ever
 did
 under
 a
 Biden


presidency.
 Just
 want
 you
 to
 hear
 from


my
 mouth
 for
 what
 that's
 worth.


>> Do
 you
 feel
 safer
 about
 the
 fact
 that
 a


Latino
 doctor
 crossing
 the
 street
 in


Washington
 DC
 uh
 is
 getting
 hassled
 or


harassed
 because
 they're
 brown?


>> I
 don't
 think
 that
 I've
 heard
 that.
 Now,


>> okay.
 So,
 you're
 not
 aware
 of
 any
 case


in
 which
 a
 US
 citizen
 who
 is
 like
 but


you're
 No,
 but
 but
 I
 will
 tell
 you,
 for


example,
 after
 911,


>> you
 wait.
 You're
 on
 a
 podcast
 commenting


about
 immigration.
 You
 have
 some
 level


of
 awareness.


>> Let
 me
 let
 me
 tell
 you
 after
 9/11,
 for


example,
 for
 years,
 I
 had
 SSS
 on
 my


boarding
 passes


>> and
 I
 was
 pulled
 over
 constantly
 and


people
 probably
 thought
 that
 I
 was
 a


Muslim
 hijacker.


>> So,
 I
 know
 what
 it
 feels
 like
 to
 be


harassed.
 And
 what
 I'm
 telling
 you


categorically
 is
 I
 feel
 safer
 in
 this


presidency
 than
 I
 have
 ever
 felt.
 And


I'm
 just
 letting
 you
 know
 that.
 This
 is


just
 my
 lived
 experience.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 I
 think


>> I'm
 glad
 you
 feel
 safer.
 I'm
 worried


about
 how
 most
 Americans
 feel.


>> Well,
 I
 mean,
 I
 think
 we're
 all
 aware


that
 people
 are
 being
 picked
 up
 and


they're
 being
 racially
 profiled
 and


their
 Fourth
 Amendment
 rights
 are
 being


suspended
 here.
 And


>> let
 me
 put
 it
 a
 different
 way.
 Has
 it


crossed
 your
 mind
 that
 if
 right
 now
 they


started
 by
 going
 for
 people
 who
 are


illegal
 and
 then
 they've
 started


roughing
 up
 people
 who
 are
 citizens
 but


who
 are
 speaking
 up
 against
 the


administration
 that
 even
 if
 you
 feel


safe
 now
 in
 a
 country
 where
 that
 sort
 of


thing
 can
 be
 done
 where
 people
 can
 you


know
 where
 even
 comedians
 could
 lose


their
 jobs
 for
 criticizing
 the


government.
 Does
 any
 part
 of
 me
 wonder


if
 that
 might
 ever
 come
 for
 you


>> Pete?
 It
 did
 come
 for
 me.
 Here's
 what


I'm
 trying
 to
 tell
 you.
 after
 the


Patriot
 Act
 passed
 after
 9/11,
 I
 had
 to


come
 to
 terms
 with
 the
 fact
 that
 even
 as


a
 legal
 immigrant
 into
 the
 United
 States


that
 I
 was
 going
 to
 get
 extra
 searches,


I
 was
 going
 to
 get
 stopped.
 And
 it


happened
 for
 six
 years.
 I
 came
 to
 terms


with
 it.
 I
 put
 my
 head
 down
 and
 I
 kept


working.


>> But
 that
 didn't
 mean
 it
 was
 okay,
 right?


It
 was
 a
 law
 that
 was
 passed
 and
 people


felt
 for
 whatever
 reason
 that
 there
 was


an
 amount
 of
 racial
 profiling
 that
 could


happen
 then.
 And
 what
 I'm
 telling
 you
 is


every
 immigrant
 class
 at
 some
 point
 has


felt
 this.
 My
 point
 is
 it
 made
 things


safer
 in
 the
 aggregate.
 And
 what
 I'm


telling
 you
 now
 is
 what
 is
 happening
 now


makes
 cities
 safer.
 It
 makes
 places


safer.
 If
 you
 go
 to
 Washington
 DC,
 it
 is


the
 safest
 it's
 ever
 been.
 And
 you
 hear


this
 consistently
 from
 many
 many
 brown


and
 black
 people.


>> I
 guess
 what
 I'm
 telling
 you
 is
 if
 you


take
 the
 amount
 of
 money
 that
 it
 costs


to
 do
 a
 full-scale
 military
 deployment


in
 American
 city
 and
 you
 just
 used
 it
 on


uh
 you
 know
 improving
 funding
 for
 the


police
 and
 mental
 health
 and
 a
 whole
 lot


of
 other
 things,
 you
 probably
 get
 a


pretty
 good
 result
 that
 way
 too.
 But
 I


know
 there
 are
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 and
 I
 I
 I


have
 heard
 you
 know
 personal
 direct


examples
 of
 people
 who
 are
 in
 some
 cases


US
 citizens
 or
 in
 other
 cases
 here


illegally
 who
 no
 longer
 think
 it's
 even


okay
 to
 go
 outside
 who
 ask
 people
 to
 run


errands
 for
 them
 because
 of
 the


atmosphere
 that
 has
 been
 created
 in


Washington
 DC.
 So
 it's
 definitely
 not


safer
 for
 them.


Let
 me
 ask
 you
 a
 different
 question


which
 is
 I
 really
 want
 to
 get
 some


insight
 into
 what
 it
 was
 like
 for
 you
 to


work
 in
 the
 Biden
 administration.
 We've


had
 the
 sea
 of
 tell
 alls
 coming
 out,
 Kla


Harris's
 book,
 KJP's
 book.
 We
 had
 Joe


Mansion
 on
 last
 week
 and
 one
 of
 the


things
 that
 he
 said
 is
 that


>> it
 was
 not
 that
 Joe
 Biden
 changed,
 but


that
 the
 staff
 were
 nuts
 and
 that
 Ron


Clay
 was
 effectively
 a
 gatekeeper
 and
 if


you
 had
 reasonable
 proposals,
 they
 would


go
 into
 some
 black
 hole
 and
 die.


Can
 you
 give
 us
 a
 sense
 of
 what
 it
 was


like
 to
 work
 under
 Biden
 and
 the
 the


positives
 but
 also
 the
 negatives?
 Give


us
 a
 fair
 representation.


>> Yeah.
 And
 and
 in
 the
 spirit
 of
 fairness,


I
 should
 say
 this
 is
 the
 only
 time
 I've


outside
 of
 military,
 it's
 the
 only
 time


I've
 ever
 worked
 in
 the
 federal


government.
 So
 I
 can't
 benchmark,
 you


know,
 to
 compare
 one
 white
 house
 to


another
 or
 one
 president
 to
 another.
 But


I'll
 tell
 you
 what
 my
 experience
 was


like.
 There's
 a
 high
 level
 of
 ambition


trying
 to
 get
 big
 things
 done
 quickly,


especially
 in
 the
 first
 two
 years
 when


there
 was
 uh
 felt
 like
 there
 was
 that


opportunity
 to
 uh
 work
 with
 both
 houses


of
 Congress
 to
 make
 it
 happen,
 including


just
 a
 ton
 of
 energy
 going
 into
 well


among
 other
 things
 spending
 time
 with


folks
 like
 Joe
 Mansion
 trying
 to
 make


sure
 that
 that
 we
 held
 together
 that


that
 coalition
 to
 do
 things
 like
 the


infrastructure
 law.
 Um
 there
 were
 calls


I
 agree
 with,
 there
 were
 calls
 I


disagreed
 with.
 Um,
 there
 were
 also
 a


lot
 of
 times
 when
 it
 looked
 like


something
 wasn't
 going
 to
 happen
 and


then
 somehow
 it
 happened.
 And
 that
 was


where
 I
 I
 do
 think
 it
 helped
 to
 have
 a


president
 who
 spent
 as
 much
 time
 as
 he


did
 in
 the
 Senate
 because,
 you
 know,
 it


really
 felt
 like
 the
 infrastructure
 bill


was
 dead.
 We
 forget
 this
 now
 cuz
 cuz
 it


happened
 and
 it's
 kind
 of
 hard
 to


imagine
 it
 was
 any
 other
 way,
 but
 you


know,
 it
 was
 proclaimed
 dead
 many,
 many


times
 in
 that
 summer
 of
 2021
 before
 it


got
 done.
 So
 these
 moments
 of
 snatching


uh
 uh
 victory
 from
 the
 jaws
 of
 defeat,


you
 know,
 the
 word
 gatekeeper
 gets
 used


a
 lot
 for
 White
 House
 staff.
 I
 don't


think
 that's
 unfair.
 I
 would
 also
 say


though
 that
 I
 don't
 say
 that's
 new.
 Um


you
 know,
 the
 gatekeeper
 is
 often
 the


the
 kind
 of
 other
 word
 you
 use
 for
 a


chief
 of
 staff.


>> Was
 he
 into
 cognitive
 decline
 or
 when


did
 you
 first
 realize
 he
 was
 in


cognitive
 decline,
 I
 guess,
 would
 be
 the


better
 question,
 or
 suspect
 that
 he


wasn't,


>> you
 know,
 up
 for
 the
 job.


>> You
 could
 feel
 that
 he
 was
 growing


older.
 I
 mean,
 I
 think
 we
 all
 saw
 that.


Uh,
 I
 think
 my
 experience
 and
 obviously,


you
 know,
 I
 wasn't
 at
 the
 White
 House


every
 day.
 Most
 of
 the
 time
 I
 was
 I
 was


out
 in
 the
 field
 doing
 transportation


work.
 But,
 uh,
 you
 know,
 what
 I
 would


see
 if
 I
 was
 at
 an
 event
 was
 the
 same
 as


what
 you'd
 see,
 you
 know,
 watching
 TV.


Um,
 I
 think
 the
 debate
 was
 a
 real


turning
 point.


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 the
 debate
 was
 a
 turning


point,
 right,
 where
 you
 just
 saw
 I
 think


everybody
 saw
 what
 everybody
 saw.
 On
 the


other
 hand,
 you
 know,
 when
 we
 were


>> something
 like
 that
 happen,
 h
 how
 does


somebody
 who
 is
 so
 in
 cognitive
 decline


get
 put
 up
 into
 that
 situation
 because


it's
 clear
 that
 they
 knew
 many
 months


before
 that
 this
 was
 not
 going
 to
 end


well.
 How
 did
 they
 get
 to
 that
 point?


How
 insular
 were
 they?
 And
 then
 I
 want


to
 talk
 about
 the
 uh
 selection
 of
 Kamla


without
 having
 a
 primary.
 So
 yeah.


>> Yeah.
 I
 think
 the
 short
 answer
 is
 there


there's
 not
 really
 a
 they
 that
 makes


that
 decision,
 right?
 people
 give


advice,
 but
 there's
 a
 he
 like
 one
 person


decides
 if
 he's
 running
 again.
 One


person
 decides
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day
 on


the
 campaign
 strategy
 and
 is
 accountable


for
 that.
 Uh
 so,
 you
 know,
 I
 think
 I
 I


can't
 imagine
 what
 exactly
 was
 going
 on


in
 the
 inner
 circle.
 I
 wasn't
 I
 wasn't


part
 of
 those
 conversations,
 but
 um


yeah,
 I
 I
 do
 think
 that,
 you
 know,
 by


the
 time
 it
 got
 to
 that
 debate,
 uh
 it


was
 just
 very
 clear
 that
 it
 wasn't


serving
 him
 well,
 wasn't
 serving
 the


party
 well.


>> Okay.
 So
 now
 you
 don't
 want
 to
 go
 to


that
 point.
 But
 but
 just
 as
 the
 last


thing
 about
 the
 speedrun,
 there
 was
 no


primary.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 you
 know,
 we
 were
 speculating
 on


podcast
 like
 why
 not
 run
 a
 speedrun?


Just
 have
 the
 six
 or
 seven
 candidates,


including
 yourself,
 just
 do
 three
 weeks.


This
 would
 be
 like
 blockbuster


television.
 Were
 you
 in
 favor
 of
 the


speedrun
 or
 not?
 Was
 there
 discussion
 of


that?
 We're
 hearing
 that
 Obama
 and
 maybe


some
 other
 people
 wanted
 to
 have
 a
 quick


primary.
 And
 what
 do
 you
 think
 the


outcome
 would
 have
 been?
 Would
 you
 have


had
 a
 shot
 at
 uh
 winning?
 Yeah,
 there's


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 chatter
 of
 that.
 Um,


and
 I
 think
 in
 hindsight,
 we
 we've


obviously
 got
 to
 ask
 since
 the
 outcome


of
 what
 did
 happen
 was
 not
 good.
 I
 think


anyone
 serious
 in
 our
 party
 has
 to
 say,


okay,
 what
 if
 we'd
 done
 that?
 And
 you


could
 argue
 that
 it
 would
 would
 have
 led


to
 I
 don't
 know,
 but
 you
 could
 argue
 it


would
 have
 led
 to
 a
 different
 nominee.


You
 could
 also
 argue
 it
 would
 have
 led


to
 the
 same
 nominee,
 but
 that
 she
 would


have
 been
 stronger,
 right?
 I
 mean,
 if
 if


she
 had
 become
 the
 nominee
 by
 prevailing


over
 another
 half
 dozen
 people
 who


wanted
 a
 shot,
 presumably
 that
 kind
 of


sharpening
 that
 that
 happens
 uh
 would


have
 served
 her
 well
 in
 the
 general.
 And


and
 let's
 remember
 that
 that's
 actually


more
 normal,
 right?
 Like
 most
 countries


don't
 drag
 out
 their
 their
 presidential


>> process
 for
 more
 than
 a
 few
 weeks.


>> Let's
 move
 to
 a
 different
 more
 tactical


question.
 This
 is
 my
 last
 question
 for


you,
 Pete,
 which
 is
 there's
 some


discussion
 about
 moving
 NASA
 under
 the


Department
 of
 Transportation.


>> Good
 idea,
 bad
 idea.
 Give
 us
 your


reasoning.


>> Well,
 let
 me
 think
 of
 it.
 To
 be honest,


I
 haven't
 like
 deeply
 reflected
 on
 this.


Um,
 at
 a
 selfish
 and
 nerdy
 level,
 it


would
 have
 been
 amazing
 as
 Secretary
 of


Transportation
 to
 be
 working
 NASA,
 too.


Um,
 I
 think
 generally
 anytime
 you
 can


have
 like
 one


uh
 box
 or
 on
 an
 org
 chart
 where
 you


where
 there's
 two,
 you
 know,
 as
 long
 as


it's
 justified,
 I
 think
 there
 are
 some


benefits
 to
 that.
 I
 mean,
 definitely


right
 now
 the
 way
 that
 it
 let
 me
 put
 it


this
 way.
 If
 we
 think
 the
 future
 of


space
 is
 going
 to
 be
 more
 and
 more
 about


commercial
 space,
 which
 is
 is
 clearly


just
 as
 a
 matter
 of
 numbers
 what's


happening.
 The
 mishmash
 we
 have
 now


where
 you
 got
 NASA
 obviously
 leading


government-driven
 space
 missions.
 You


got
 the
 Department
 of
 Transportation


which
 actually
 already
 had


responsibility
 over
 some
 things
 and
 we


did
 commercial
 space
 licensing.
 We
 wound


up
 having
 to
 radically
 accelerate
 how


that
 worked.
 Uh
 because
 that
 actually


comes
 under
 the
 FAA
 um
 largely
 because


you
 have
 to
 go
 through
 the
 national


airspace
 to
 get
 to
 space,
 right?
 And


there's
 actually
 parts
 of
 it
 that
 sit


with
 commerce.
 So
 it
 would
 make
 sense
 to


disentangle
 that
 one
 way
 or
 the
 other,


whether
 it's
 inside
 of
 DOT
 or
 whether


you
 configure
 it
 a
 new
 way.
 I
 mean,
 I
 do


think
 that
 Washington
 in
 general,
 my


part
 is
 definitely
 guilty
 of
 this,
 is


too
 attached
 to
 all
 of
 the
 like


structures
 that
 we
 have
 right
 now
 and


the
 existing
 or
 charts
 and
 existing


habits.
 And
 you
 know,
 one
 message
 I'm


trying
 to
 get
 my
 party
 to
 accept
 is,
 you


know,
 if
 and
 when
 we
 get
 another
 chance,


a
 lot
 of
 the
 things
 that
 he
 has
 burned


down
 just
 aren't
 coming
 back
 the
 way


they
 were,
 why
 would
 we
 put
 them
 back


the
 way
 they
 used
 to
 be
 if
 it
 was
 full


of
 problems
 anyway?
 So,
 I
 don't
 have
 a


really
 deeply
 considered
 answer
 for
 you,


but
 I
 wouldn't
 be
 hostile
 to
 a
 change


just
 because
 it's
 a
 change
 or
 just


because
 it
 came
 from
 this


administration.


>> This
 is
 my
 last
 question.
 There
 was
 a


report
 that
 came
 out
 today.
 I
 think
 the


amount
 of
 miles
 driven
 per
 day
 by
 Whimo


is
 about
 to
 pass
 250,000.


We
 have
 Tesla
 with
 cyber
 cab
 and
 robo


taxi.
 These
 things
 have
 a
 material


ability
 to
 prevent
 drunk
 driving
 and


prevent
 vehicular
 deaths.


What
 do
 you
 think
 should
 be
 done?
 Should


we
 let
 this
 play
 out
 at
 this
 exact
 pace?


Is
 there
 a
 responsibility
 in
 from
 the


federal
 government?
 Do
 you
 wish
 you
 had


done
 more
 to
 accelerate
 this?
 Tell
 us


about
 autonomous
 driving
 and
 its
 role
 in


society.


>> So,
 I
 I
 think
 that
 there's
 the
 potential


to
 save
 a
 huge
 number
 of
 lives.
 You


know,
 we
 talked
 earlier
 about
 the


incredible
 standard
 of
 aviation
 safety,


right?
 Zero
 fatalities
 per
 billion


better.
 It's
 the
 opposite
 on
 roadway


safety.
 Nobody
 talks
 about
 it.
 I
 we
 had


a
 plug
 door
 blow
 out
 of
 an
 airplane
 and


we
 we
 reconsidered
 our
 whole
 oversight


framework
 because
 somebody
 could
 have


gotten
 hurt
 that
 day.
 Meanwhile,
 every


day
 100
 to
 150
 people
 die
 on
 our


roadways
 to
 car
 crashes
 and
 vehicles


driven
 by
 humans.
 I
 mean,
 it's
 enough
 to


fill
 a
 737
 every
 day.
 It's
 on
 par
 with


gun
 violence.
 30
 40,000
 people
 a
 year.


So,
 human
 drivers
 have
 a
 murderous
 track


record.
 It's
 a
 little
 bit
 different
 when


we
 talk
 about
 professional
 drivers
 who


have
 incredible
 I
 mean
 I
 met
 truck


drivers
 who'd
 have,
 you
 know,
 two


million
 miles
 with
 no
 uh
 crashes
 or


accidents.
 But
 just
 as
 a
 general
 rule,


most
 of
 us
 the
 average
 driver
 thinks


they're
 safer
 than
 the
 average
 driver.


And
 the
 average
 driver
 stands
 a


shockingly
 high
 percentage
 chance
 of


getting
 somebody
 killed.
 So,
 you
 know,
 I


think
 we're
 at
 the
 point
 where
 at
 least


some
 of
 these
 technologies
 right
 now


already
 are
 safer
 than
 human
 beings
 and


that's
 only
 going
 to
 increase
 and


improve.
 And
 the
 the
 irony
 of
 it
 is,
 you


know,
 even
 if
 a
 handful
 of
 highly


publicized
 uh
 negative
 incidents
 will


will
 really
 change
 public
 acceptance.
 So


my
 approach
 was


>> and
 they
 have.
 Yeah.


>> Yeah.
 So
 my
 approach
 was
 we
 we
 do
 need


to
 be
 conservative
 as
 a
 safety
 regular


to
 make
 sure
 it's
 safe.
 Not
 because
 I


don't
 believe
 in
 the
 technology,
 but


because
 I
 do
 because
 I
 think
 if
 people


see
 it
 unfolding
 safely,
 uh
 there's


going
 to
 be
 more
 acceptance.
 But
 are


there
 things
 we
 could
 or
 should
 do
 or


could
 or
 should
 have
 done
 to
 accelerate


AV
 adoption?
 Um,
 I
 think
 the
 answer
 is


yes.
 Like
 the
 the
 simple
 reality
 is
 we


we
 can't
 tolerate
 like
 it's
 no
 big
 deal


human
 drivers
 killing
 more
 than
 100


people
 a
 day
 on
 our
 roads.
 This
 is
 a


perfect
 segue
 for
 my
 final
 question.


We've
 had
 a
 grand
 debate
 occurring
 in


our
 industry
 about
 job
 displacement.
 Uh


Amazon
 announced
 yesterday,
 I'm
 sure
 you


saw
 30,000
 white
 collar
 jobs
 to
 be


eliminated.


UPS
 today
 something
 around
 40,000
 people


and
 there
 was
 a
 leak
 in
 the
 New
 York


Times


that
 Amazon
 was
 planning
 on
 eliminating


600,000
 job
 wrecks
 for
 the
 future
 and


not
 hiring
 them
 because
 they're
 so


convinced
 that
 robotics
 will
 do
 that.
 We


all
 know
 AI
 is
 going to
 be
 the
 biggest


change
 of
 our
 lifetime.
 I
 don't
 think


that's
 the
 debate.
 The
 question
 is
 um


what
 will
 job
 displacement
 and
 new
 job


creation
 look
 like
 this
 time?
 What
 does


Pete
 Buddhajed
 think?
 Do
 you
 think
 that


we
 have


a
 serious
 issue
 on
 our
 hands
 or
 do
 you


think
 we'll
 be
 able
 to
 navigate
 it?
 And


then
 what's
 the
 government's
 role
 in
 it


when
 you're
 president?
 What
 will
 it
 look


like
 if
 you
 inherit
 this
 chaotic
 AI
 job


displacement
 potential?


>> Yeah,
 I'm
 I'm
 seriously
 concerned
 about


it
 and
 and
 part
 of
 that's
 from
 growing


up
 in
 the
 industrial
 Midwest.
 Like,
 you


know,
 we
 were
 told
 I
 grew
 up
 in
 Northern


Indiana,
 uh,
 a
 lot
 of
 auto
 industry


supply
 chain
 companies
 there.
 And
 in
 the


90s
 and
 2000s,
 a
 lot
 of
 trade
 and


automation,
 but
 the
 truth
 is
 mostly


automation
 came
 in.
 And
 uh
 everybody
 was


told,
 you
 know,
 don't
 worry
 too
 much


about
 what
 you're
 doing
 today.
 The
 pie


is
 going
 to
 get
 so
 much
 bigger
 that


everybody
 will
 be
 better
 off.
 And
 the


thing
 is,
 the
 pie
 did
 get
 bigger,
 but


the
 rest
 of
 that
 promise
 didn't
 come


true.
 And
 people
 were
 pissed.
 People


were
 pissed
 because
 they
 lost
 their


income,
 but
 also
 even
 after
 they
 got


their
 income,
 if
 if
 they
 went
 through
 a


training
 program
 and
 got
 another
 job
 in


a
 field
 that
 was
 growing,
 but
 it
 wasn't


who
 they
 thought
 they
 were,
 it
 wasn't


connected
 to
 their
 their
 sense
 of


identity
 or
 belonging,
 then
 you
 continue


to
 have
 a
 displacement
 that's
 not
 just


economic,
 but
 but
 but
 really
 deeper
 than


that.
 And
 I
 actually
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 that


kind
 of
 leads
 directly
 to
 the
 populism


and
 the
 nationalism
 that
 you
 see
 in
 this


administration
 and
 this
 in
 this


political
 moment.
 So
 uh
 and
 the
 thing


that
 really
 haunts
 me
 is
 you
 know
 as


much
 as
 any
 auto
 worker
 or
 electrical


worker
 I
 know
 like
 their
 sense
 of


belonging
 and
 identity
 you
 know
 very


much
 depends
 in
 many
 ways
 on
 being
 an


autoworker
 or
 an
 electrical
 worker.


That's
 even
 more
 true
 for
 most
 white


collar
 workers.
 I
 know
 people
 who
 work


in
 law
 or
 or
 software
 or
 you
 know
 um
 uh


you
 know
 you
 see
 what's
 happening
 in


radiology
 just
 to
 take
 one
 example


what's
 happening
 in
 medicine
 that's


really
 changing
 because
 of
 AI
 and
 the


the
 displacement
 that
 could
 come
 with


that
 I
 think
 is
 enormous
 and
 I
 don't


think
 we're
 prepared.
 Yeah.
 I
 don't
 know


you
 know
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 get
 into


prediction
 games
 about
 which
 things
 will


happen
 in
 which
 order
 but
 I
 think
 it's


clear
 that
 it's
 big.
 It's
 clear
 that


it's
 fast.
 It's
 coming.
 It's


accelerating.
 And
 my
 big
 worry
 is
 that


if
 we're
 already
 at
 a
 level
 of


concentration
 of
 wealth
 and
 power
 that


no
 republic
 has
 ever
 survived,
 is
 this


going
 to
 be
 a
 development
 that
 just


makes
 wealth
 and
 power
 even
 more


concentrated
 in
 even
 fewer
 hands?
 I


don't
 think
 it
 has
 to
 be.
 I
 think
 that's


where,
 you
 know,
 good
 policy
 can
 make
 a


difference.


>> But
 I
 think
 if
 we
 just
 sleepwalk
 into


it,
 that
 could
 happen.
 It
 could
 be
 even


more


>> dabiliz.
 The
 thing
 that
 you
 just
 said
 is


the
 key.
 It
 doesn't
 have
 to
 be.
 It


requires
 very
 smart,
 thoughtful


legislation.
 I
 think
 that
 we
 had


>> some
 really
 idiotic
 legislation
 under


Biden
 that
 President
 Trump
 and
 David


Saxs
 have
 largely
 unwound
 these


diffusion
 rules,
 the
 gatekeeping,
 all
 of


those
 things,
 Pete,
 would
 have
 seen
 us


lose
 to
 China.
 Just
 to
 be
 very
 clear,
 as


a
 technologist
 who's
 in
 the
 middle
 of


it,
 who
 is
 investing
 and
 building,


>> what
 I'm
 telling
 you
 is
 those
 historic


rules
 were
 terrible
 and
 dumb.
 and
 they


had
 one
 or
 two
 companies
 who
 would
 have


basically
 had
 all
 the
 spoils
 and
 the


rest
 of
 us
 would
 have
 been
 standing
 on


the
 outside
 looking
 in.
 That's
 no
 longer


the
 case.
 We
 can
 run
 the
 race
 now.
 But
 I


think
 what
 you
 said
 there
 is
 very


critical.
 It
 doesn't
 have
 to
 be
 a
 winner


take
 all
 or
 winner
 take
 most
 outcome.


>> Well,
 and
 to
 me
 that's,
 you
 know,
 that's


not
 just
 a
 question
 of
 tech
 policy.
 Like


that's
 a
 question
 of


>> Well,
 this
 is
 by
 way
 and
 this
 is,
 by
 the


way,
 I
 just
 want
 to
 be
 clear.
 The
 reason


why
 it
 was
 likely
 under
 Biden
 is
 because


it
 was
 so
 difficult
 to
 actually
 talk
 to


him.
 he
 wouldn't
 talk
 to
 anybody.
 The


difference
 with
 Trump,
 just
 so
 it's


clear,
 is
 that
 he'll
 talk
 to
 everybody.


He'll
 make
 his
 own
 decision,
 but
 he
 gets


the
 broad
 tapestry
 of
 everybody's


feedback.
 The
 danger
 of
 that
 Biden


approach
 is
 that
 when
 one
 or
 two
 people


are
 allowed
 in
 and
 everybody
 else
 is


shut
 out,
 and
 you
 can't
 even
 find
 a
 way


of
 just
 proposing
 ideas
 or
 explaining


how
 it's
 going
 to
 be,
 you
 get
 things


like
 the
 Biden
 diffusion
 rule.
 So,
 just


as
 something
 to
 think
 about,
 I
 think


being
 open
 and
 being
 available
 to
 people


is
 a
 really
 good
 way
 of
 running
 the


country.
 That's
 one
 thing
 I
 definitely


believe
 in.


>> If
 you
 win,
 Pete,
 you
 going
 to
 forget
 us


and
 not
 come
 back
 on
 the
 pod
 and
 you


won't
 invite
 us
 to
 the
 White
 House
 or
 if


you
 win,
 can
 we
 still
 can
 I
 get
 an


invite
 to
 the
 White
 House?


>> I
 would
 love
 for
 this
 not
 to
 be
 our
 last


conversation.


>> Our
 friends
 at
 Poly
 Market,
 I'm
 sure
 you


know
 uh
 all
 about
 these
 uh
 prediction


markets
 and
 how
 good
 they
 are.
 Looks


like
 Gavin
 AOC
 oddly
 in
 second
 place
 and


then
 yourself
 in
 third
 place
 right
 now.


Gavin
 obviously
 is
 running
 up
 the
 hill.


Who
 knows
 if
 he
 takes
 the
 arrows
 first,


but
 it
 looks
 like
 you're
 in
 a
 pretty


good
 position
 here.
 What
 are
 your


thoughts
 here
 on
 the
 early
 um
 indicators


of
 who's
 connecting
 with
 the
 sharps
 over


at
 Poly
 Market?


>> Well,
 you
 guys
 don't
 strike
 me
 as
 folks


who'd
 be
 content
 with
 a
 6%
 return,
 but


[laughter]


>> got
 to
 get
 those
 numbers
 up,
 Pete.


>> Maybe
 a
 day,
 Pete.
 Maybe
 a
 day.


>> Well,
 I
 mean,
 what
 do
 you
 think
 about


Gavin
 coming
 out
 just
 strongly
 and


saying,
 "Hey,
 I'm
 running.
 Obviously,


I'm
 running.
 He's
 he's
 been
 pretty
 clear


about
 it.
 Do
 you
 think
 that's
 smart


savvy
 move
 or
 is
 that
 a
 crazy
 move
 three


years?


>> I
 don't
 know.
 I
 mean,
 you
 know,
 one


interesting
 thing
 about
 what
 the
 current


president
 did
 is
 I
 if
 I
 remember
 right,


he
 didn't
 even
 wait
 for
 the
 midterms
 uh


in
 order
 to
 announce.


>> So,
 you
 know,
 it
 feels
 like
 the


timelines
 keep
 shifting.
 I'll
 tell
 you


like
 I'm
 in
 no
 hurry
 to
 be
 in
 the
 middle


of
 presidential
 politics.
 Obviously,


it's
 something
 I
 care
 about.
 It's


something
 I
 have
 done
 uh
 already
 once


before
 in
 2020,
 but
 you
 know,
 this
 year,


this
 is
 the
 first
 year
 in
 in
 about
 15


that
 I
 haven't
 been
 uh
 in
 office
 or


running
 for
 office,
 and
 I'm
 kind
 of


enjoying
 it.
 I
 mean,
 I'm
 I'm
 working


hard
 supporting
 candidates
 I
 believe
 in.


We
 have
 a
 a
 pack
 uh
 and
 and
 I
 travel
 a


lot
 and
 speak
 a
 lot,
 but
 uh
 you
 know,


there
 there
 will
 be
 a
 time
 for
 those


kinds
 of
 things,
 and
 I'm
 not
 uh
 uh
 I'm


not
 going to
 try
 to
 rush.


>> You
 support
 mom
 Dami?
 Did
 you
 did
 you


support
 him?
 Did
 you
 come
 out
 publicly


for
 him
 or
 you
 have
 concerns?
 I'm
 not


getting
 directly
 involved
 in
 that
 race


uh
 or
 endorsing
 or
 anything
 like
 that.


>> You're
 gonna
 you're
 gonna
 dunk
 the


globalize
 the
 inifat
 bullet.
 I
 mean
 that


is
 the
 craziest
 obviously
 that's
 that's


a
 that's
 a
 problem.
 Uh
 you
 know
 he's
 got


a
 lot
 of
 he's
 got
 a
 lot
 of
 views
 that
 I


mean
 it's
 no
 surprise
 or
 secret
 that
 he


is
 further
 left
 than
 I
 am
 in
 the


Democratic
 coalition.
 That
 said,


>> you
 know,
 uh
 I
 was
 a
 a
 29year-old
 mayor


that
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 wrote
 off
 and
 and


uh
 didn't
 take
 seriously
 uh
 and
 was
 able


to
 get
 big
 things
 done.
 So,
 you
 know,
 I


expect
 that
 he's
 going
 to
 win.


>> Socialist
 experiment
 in
 the
 what
 was
 at


least
 before
 the
 greatest
 city
 in


America
 and
 one
 of
 the
 greatest
 cities


in
 the
 world.


>> Well,
 uh
 you
 know,
 the
 thing
 about


winning
 is
 you
 get
 a
 chance
 to
 uh
 find


out
 very
 quickly
 uh
 how
 good
 your
 ideas


are
 and
 whether
 they'll
 have
 the
 results


you
 have
 in
 mind.
 And
 you
 know,
 that's


something
 that
 I
 expect
 that
 he'll
 win


and
 then
 we'll
 all
 get
 to
 see.


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 it's
 it's
 going
 to
 be


interesting
 to
 see
 when
 that
 54%
 tax


hits
 like
 if
 people
 are
 like,
 you
 know


what,
 Miami
 and
 Texas
 look
 pretty
 great.


You
 know,
 maybe
 I'm
 going
 to
 bounce.
 All


right,
 listen.
 Pea
 Judge,
 uh,
 thanks
 so


much
 for
 taking
 the
 time.
 We'll
 have
 you


on
 again.
 Uh,
 great
 to
 talk
 with
 you


and,
 uh,
 we
 appreciate
 you
 coming
 on
 the


program.
 We'll
 see
 you
 all
 next
 time.


Byebye.


>> Same
 here.
 Good
 day.


>> Great
 job.
 [music]


>> I'm
 going
 all
 in.
