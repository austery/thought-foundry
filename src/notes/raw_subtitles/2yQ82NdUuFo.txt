What
 if
 I
 told
 you
 that
 one
 of
 the
 most


advanced
 tech
 countries
 in
 Europe
 isn't


Germany,
 isn't
 England,
 and
 isn't
 the


Netherlands.
 It's
 Sweden,
 a
 country
 of


just
 10
 million
 people
 with
 very
 cold


weather,
 high
 taxes,
 and
 somehow
 41


unicorns.
 This
 is
 episode
 4
 of
 Where
 to


Run,
 where
 I
 explore
 the
 smartest
 places


for
 a
 mid
 to
 senior
 tech
 workers
 to


rebuild
 post
 layoffs.
 And
 today
 we're


looking
 at
 Sweden,
 the
 low-key


powerhouse
 of
 Europe,
 and
 what
 it's


really
 like
 to
 work
 there
 in
 2025.
 This


video
 series
 is
 for
 tech
 professionals


already
 living
 and
 working
 in
 the
 US,


Canada,
 the
 UK,
 or
 the
 European
 Union.


If
 you're
 based
 outside
 these
 regions
 or


in
 an
 outsourcing
 heavy
 market,
 the
 data


in
 this
 video
 will
 not
 apply
 to
 your


situation.
 I
 do
 not
 cover
 immigration,


international
 job
 hunting,
 or
 topics


like
 how
 to
 break
 into
 tech
 without
 a


college
 degree.
 If
 that's
 what
 you're


here
 for,
 this
 probably
 isn't
 the
 right


channel.
 And
 that's
 okay.
 But
 if
 you
 are


operating
 within
 these
 markets,
 keep


watching.
 There's
 a
 lot
 ahead
 for


various
 seniority
 levels
 and
 career


tracks
 in
 tech.
 But
 what
 else
 is
 Sweden


given
 to
 the
 European
 tech
 scene?
 Sweden


ranks
 as
 the
 world's
 second
 most


innovative
 economy
 and
 is
 home
 to
 41


unicorns
 including
 Spotify,
 CLA,
 Cry
 and


Voy.
 Stockholm
 is
 the
 second
 only
 to


Silicon
 Valley
 in
 terms
 of
 unicorns
 per


capita,
 demonstrating
 Sweden's
 outsized


impact
 on
 the
 global
 startup
 ecosystem.


Swedish
 startups
 have
 doubled
 in
 value


over
 the
 past
 5
 years,
 now
 worth
 €238


billion.
 The
 country's
 culture
 of


successful
 founders
 becoming
 angel


investors
 fuel
 a
 very
 positive
 cycle
 of


mentorship
 and
 new
 company
 creation.


Tech
 scene
 and
 culture.
 Let's
 look
 at


Stockholm
 first.
 Stockholm
 can
 be


rightfully
 called
 the
 Silicon
 Valley
 of


the
 Nordics
 with
 perhaps
 the
 best


startup
 scene
 in
 Europe.
 There
 are
 some


reports
 that
 show
 Denmark
 as
 the
 Europe


startup
 leader,
 but
 those
 reports
 are


typically
 issued
 by
 the
 Danish


authorities
 or
 government,
 so
 I
 don't


know
 how
 unbiased
 they
 are.
 Once
 again,


in
 this
 specific
 series
 of
 videos,
 we're


focusing
 on
 people
 who
 work
 in


employment,
 not
 entrepreneurship.
 So,


what
 this
 means
 for
 the
 employees
 is
 the


abundance
 of
 roles
 at
 startups.
 Sweden


is
 known
 for
 its
 strong
 venture
 capital


presence
 and
 government
 support,
 high


salaries,
 excellent
 quality
 of
 life,


fantastic
 infrastructure.
 Now,
 a
 few


words
 about
 Goththingberg.
 Another
 city


with
 strong
 automotive
 and
 gaming


industries,
 growing
 tech
 ecosystems
 with


innovating
 startups,
 more
 affordable


than
 Stockholm
 with
 a
 focus
 on


sustainability
 and
 mobility
 tech.


Nevertheless,
 they
 are
 a
 smaller


ecosystem
 compared
 to
 Stockholm
 for


obvious
 reasons.
 There's
 fewer


large-scale
 global
 tech
 companies
 and


limited
 venture
 capital
 compared
 to


Stockholm.
 There
 are
 also
 other
 cities


where
 tech
 talent
 is
 present,
 but


they're
 a
 lot
 smaller
 than
 those
 two.
 As


for
 the
 state
 of
 the
 market
 and
 post


layoffs
 in
 2025,
 early
 2025
 saw


widespread
 layoffs
 across
 the
 global


tech
 industry
 with
 Sweden
 affected
 as


well.
 Even
 Northvolt,
 Sweden's
 electric


vehicle
 giant
 filed
 for
 bankruptcy
 in


2025,
 cutting
 over
 2,800
 jobs.
 Now,
 why


is
 this
 important
 specifically
 in
 the


context
 of
 Sweden?
 It's
 important


because
 Sweden
 has
 become
 a
 European


leader
 in
 electric
 vehicle
 adoption,


ranking
 second
 in
 registration
 in
 2023


and
 maintaining
 a
 strong
 growth


trajectory
 with
 plenty
 of
 tech
 talent


working
 in
 the
 automotive
 industry
 as


well
 as
 climate
 tech.
 These
 layoffs
 are


very
 significant
 on
 the
 country
 level.


Sweden
 has
 ambitious
 climate
 targets,


including
 reducing
 transport
 emissions


and
 achieving
 a
 fossil-free
 vehicle


fleet.
 Electric
 vehicles
 are
 central
 to


this
 strategy.
 Northvolt's
 bankruptcy


means
 that
 Sweden
 will
 see
 a
 dip
 in


electric
 vehicle
 sales
 and
 that
 could


have
 immediate
 negative
 effects
 on


Sweden's
 climate
 strategy.
 Despite
 the


layoffs,
 Sweden's
 tech
 job
 market
 is


described
 as
 booming
 and
 multiple


resources
 in
 2025
 with
 strong
 demand
 for


specialized
 talent,
 particularly
 NI,


cloud
 computing,
 cyber
 security,
 and


full
 stack
 development.
 AI
 is
 a


particular
 focus.
 The
 government
 has


committed
 over€1.1
 billion
 euros
 to
 AI


initiatives
 and
 Microsoft's
 3.2
 billion


investments
 in
 cloud
 and
 AI


infrastructure
 is
 expected
 to
 train


250,000
 people
 in
 AI
 skills
 all
 over


Sweden.
 Quality
 of
 talent.
 Sweden
 is


widely
 recognized
 for
 the
 high
 quality


of
 its
 tech
 talent
 driven
 by
 a
 strong


innovation
 culture,
 worldclass


companies,
 and
 significant
 government


investment.
 Swedish
 tech
 talent
 doesn't


shout,
 but
 it's
 ridiculously
 competent.


Most
 engineers
 and
 PMs
 come
 with
 serious


depth
 in
 system
 design,
 infrastructure,


and
 sustainability
 tech.
 But
 what
 really


stands
 out
 is
 the
 work
 culture.
 Flat


hierarchy
 isn't
 a
 buzzword.
 It's
 how


things
 are
 actually
 run.
 A
 junior
 dev


will
 question
 a
 director
 in
 a
 meeting


without
 flinching.
 People
 build
 for
 the


long
 term.
 They
 collaborate
 without
 ego.


And
 there
 is
 this
 quiet
 professionalism


that's
 very
 hard
 to
 explain
 unless


you've
 worked
 with
 them.
 You
 will
 not


see
 folks
 grinding
 100hour
 weeks,
 but


the
 quality
 of
 output
 is
 consistently


high.
 The
 vibe.
 So
 Stockholm,
 in
 my


humble
 opinion,
 definitely
 sits


somewhere
 between
 Toronto
 and
 California


vibe-wise,
 but
 definitely
 not
 New
 York.


It
 does
 not
 smell
 legacy
 because
 of
 the


vibrancy
 of
 the
 tech
 scene.
 I
 want
 to


say
 that
 the
 startup
 scene
 feels
 faster


than
 Toronto,
 but
 definitely
 far
 from


California.
 or
 any
 North
 Americans


exploring
 the
 European
 tech
 scene.
 I


cannot
 explain
 where
 it's
 coming
 from,


but
 I
 find
 that
 there
 is
 a
 lot
 of


cultural
 compatibility
 with
 North


Americans,
 not
 similarity,
 actual


compatibility.
 I
 don't
 know
 where
 it's


coming
 from,
 but
 to
 me,
 it
 explains
 why


tech
 talent
 coming
 out
 of
 Sweden
 does


very
 well
 in
 the
 US
 and
 Canada.
 Another


thing
 that
 amazes
 me
 about
 Sweden
 is


their
 country's
 success
 not
 just
 in
 tech


but
 in
 cultural
 industries
 as
 well
 such


as
 music,
 art,
 avanguard
 cinematography,


game
 development
 and
 game
 design.
 That


same
 creativity
 that
 fuels
 its
 music,


cinema
 and
 gamedev
 shows
 up
 in
 its
 tech.


This
 is
 a
 country
 that
 gave
 us
 Max


Martins
 and
 Minecraft.
 You're
 not
 just


getting
 coders,
 you're
 getting
 creators.


Another
 aspect
 where
 Sweden
 is
 a
 true


trends
 setter
 is
 design
 and
 aesthetics.


Just
 look
 at
 this.
 Speed
 of
 life
 is


slow.
 Slack
 pings
 will
 not
 fly
 on
 the


weekends.
 No
 10
 p.m.
 quick
 fixes.
 And


that
 is
 amazing
 unless
 you're
 the
 only


person
 on
 the
 team
 still
 on
 startup


autopilot.
 Yes,
 Stockholm
 is
 full
 of


expats,
 but
 most
 of
 the
 society
 still


runs
 in
 Swedish,
 which
 again,
 in
 my


opinion,
 is
 the
 right
 thing
 to
 do.
 They


are
 a
 beautiful
 country
 with
 very
 rich


history,
 and
 it's
 good
 for
 them
 for


preserving
 that.
 And
 outside
 of
 a
 few


big
 tech
 firms,
 you're
 not
 just
 expected


but
 socially
 pressured
 to
 learn
 the


language,
 which
 as
 I
 mentioned
 before
 is


the
 right
 thing
 to
 do
 in
 my
 opinion.
 I


cannot
 imagine
 coming
 to
 work
 in
 Italy


or
 Poland
 and
 expecting
 people
 to
 speak


English
 to
 me,
 no matter
 how


international
 they
 are.
 Tech
 workers
 are


respected
 but
 not
 glorified.
 If
 you're


used
 to
 being
 a
 minor
 celebrity
 just
 for


being
 a
 PM
 or
 an
 engineer,
 Sweden's
 flat


hierarchy
 will
 humble
 you.
 Those
 of
 you


uncomfortable
 with
 flat
 hierarchies,


consensus
 building,
 or
 highly


collaborative
 cultures
 may
 find
 it


challenging
 to
 fit
 in.
 Cost
 of
 living.


Now,
 let's
 talk
 money
 because
 for
 all


the
 innovation
 and
 quality
 of
 life,


Sweden
 isn't
 exactly
 a
 tax
 salary


paradise.
 Housing.
 A
 one-bedroom


apartment
 in
 central
 Stockholm
 will
 run


you
 around
 €13
 to
 €1,800
 a
 month.


Outside
 of
 the
 city
 center,
 between
 €900


and
 €1,200.
 Rent
 control
 laws
 and


limited
 supply
 mean
 finding
 a
 place


often
 harder
 than
 affording
 one.


Groceries
 and
 eating
 out
 are
 expensive.


Not
 New
 York
 or
 London
 expensive,
 but


still
 expensive
 compared
 to
 the
 rest
 of


Europe.
 Speaking
 from
 my
 own
 experience,


the
 last
 time
 I
 visited
 Sweden
 was
 in


2023.
 And
 compared
 to
 Toronto,
 it
 felt


like
 a
 breeze.
 It
 was
 a
 lot
 cheaper
 than


Toronto.
 I
 want
 to
 say
 about
 25
 to
 30%.


But
 still,
 compared
 to
 the
 rest
 of


Europe,
 it
 is
 very
 expensive.
 Tech


salaries.
 So,
 a
 mid-level
 engineer
 makes


about
 5
 to6,000
 a
 month
 before
 tax
 and


senior
 and
 staff
 level
 engineers
 and
 PMs


make
 between
 €7,000
 to
 €8,500
 a
 month.


Once
 again,
 that's
 before
 tax.
 Sounds


decent,
 right?
 But
 taxes,
 the
 top


marginal
 tax
 rate
 is


52.3%
 and
 it
 kicks
 in
 faster
 than
 you'd


expect,
 especially
 if
 you're
 single.
 For


a
 senior
 level
 tech
 worker
 making


€100,000
 a
 year,
 your
 net
 pay
 after


taxes
 is
 roughly
 56


to€60,000.
 That's
 around
 €5,000
 a
 month


take
 home.
 And
 no,
 there
 is
 no
 optimize


your
 taxes
 with
 an
 LLC
 culture
 similar


to
 what
 you
 find
 in
 Canada
 or
 the
 US.


It's
 airtight
 savings
 potential.
 After


taxes
 and
 essential
 expenses,
 a
 senior


tech
 worker
 in
 Stockholm
 might
 save
 up


to
 €2,000
 a
 month
 max.
 Compare
 that
 to


Austin
 or
 Seattle
 where
 you
 could
 save
 3


to
 5K
 a
 month
 in
 a
 high
 comp
 package.


Sweden
 starts
 looking
 soft.
 If
 you're


optimizing
 for
 wealth,
 Sweden
 offers


stability,
 not
 the
 upside.
 You
 can
 live


well,
 but
 you
 won't
 build
 wealth
 very


fast.
 The
 system
 is
 built
 for
 everyone


to
 live
 decently,
 which
 I
 don't
 know if


you
 share
 this
 opinion,
 but
 to
 me
 that


is
 a
 very
 strong
 socialistic
 vibe,
 very


similar
 to
 what
 you
 typically
 find
 in


Canada.
 The
 system
 is
 built
 for
 you
 to


be
 middle
 class,
 not
 for
 you
 to
 get


rich.


Conclusion:
 When
 is
 Sweden
 a
 good
 idea?


Sweden
 is
 great
 if
 you're
 optimizing
 for


quality
 of
 life,
 not
 career


acceleration.
 It
 is
 posh
 hustle,
 not


prehustle.
 If
 you're
 trying
 to
 escape
 US


burnout
 while
 still
 staying
 in
 tech,


it's
 a
 soft
 landing.
 If
 you're
 trying
 to


rebuild
 aggressively
 post
 layoff,
 it's


probably
 not
 the
 launch
 pad
 that
 you're


hoping
 for.
 It
 is
 great
 if
 you're


looking
 to
 optimize
 for
 family
 safety,


work
 life
 balance,
 not
 for
 maximizing


RSUs.
 Tech
 professionals
 with
 strong


skills
 in
 AI,
 data
 science,
 cloud


computing,
 and
 cyber
 security
 combined


with
 adaptability,
 collaboration,
 and
 a


willingness
 to
 engage
 with
 the
 Swedish


culture
 do
 exceptionally
 well
 in
 Sweden.


This
 environment
 is
 most
 suitable
 for


experienced,
 innovative,
 and
 team


oriented
 individuals
 ready
 to
 thrive
 in


a
 rapidly
 growing,
 inclusive,
 and
 future


focused
 tech
 ecosystem.
 If
 you're


joining
 a
 company
 with
 a
 pre-arranged


relocation
 package
 and
 ideally
 you
 speak


some
 Swedish
 or
 are
 willing
 to
 learn


some,
 Sweden
 would
 also
 be
 a
 great


choice
 for
 you.
 When
 Sweden
 doesn't
 make


sense,
 if
 you
 need
 aggressive
 salary


growth,
 Sweden's
 taxes
 are
 punishing


past
 a
 certain
 income
 and
 the
 top


marginal
 tax
 rate
 52.3.
 And
 unlike
 the


US,
 there
 is
 no
 loophole
 culture
 here.


Your
 net
 pay
 as
 a
 senior
 dev
 might
 feel


shockingly
 close
 to
 what
 a
 mid
 dev
 makes


in
 Texas
 after
 tax.
 Moving
 on
 to
 Denmark


and
 specifically
 Copenhagen.
 Denmark
 is


a
 masterclass
 in
 design,
 taste,
 and


modest
 elegance.
 Tech
 scene
 and
 culture.


Copenhagen
 has
 a
 tight
 but
 serious
 tech


ecosystem.
 You
 won't
 find
 the
 chaotic


scale
 of
 Berlin
 or
 the
 unicorn
 density


of
 San
 Francisco,
 but
 you
 will
 find


strong
 product
 culture,
 very
 thoughtful


engineering,
 and
 focus
 on
 design,
 clean


tech,
 and
 health
 tech.
 If
 there
 is
 a


place
 to
 learn
 top-notch
 UX,
 it's
 100%


Denmark
 because
 you
 will
 be
 surrounded


by
 beautiful
 functionality
 everywhere


you
 go.
 But
 don't
 expect
 100
 plus
 open


roles
 in
 every
 company.
 It
 is
 a
 very


small
 market
 after
 all.
 Recruiting
 is


very
 deliberate
 and
 many
 senior
 roles


are
 filled
 through
 network,
 not
 job


boards.
 Quality
 of
 talent,
 quietly


excellent
 by
 European
 standards.
 The


Danish
 tech
 talent
 pool
 is
 highly


educated,
 systemsoriented,
 and
 fluent
 in


English,
 but
 it
 is
 not
 competitive
 in


the
 American
 sense.
 So,
 if
 you're
 a


European
 tech
 worker
 looking
 for
 the


best
 country
 in
 the
 European
 Union
 that


can
 be
 your
 launch
 pad
 to
 the
 US,
 you


better
 be
 looking
 at
 Sweden.
 Most
 senior


tech
 talent
 comes
 from
 the
 Technical


University
 of
 Denmark
 and
 the
 IT


University
 of
 Copenhagen,
 the
 two


institution
 that
 punch
 well
 above
 their


global
 visibility.
 DTU
 especially
 has
 a


reputation
 for
 producing
 wonderful


engineers
 with
 a
 deep
 understanding
 of


sustainability.
 And
 here
 is
 what
 sets


Denmark
 apart.
 The
 culture
 promotes


ownership
 without
 ego.
 People
 will


challenge
 your
 ideas.
 It
 is
 very
 common


in
 the
 Nordics.
 There
 is
 no
 such
 thing


as
 a
 junior
 being
 afraid
 to
 speak
 to
 the


senior.
 And
 because
 education
 is
 free


and
 selective,
 the
 talent
 pool
 isn't


flooded
 with
 people
 chasing
 tech
 for


money.
 You
 will
 not
 find
 many
 fell
 into


this
 after
 a
 boot
 camp
 types.
 most


chosen
 and
 trained
 for
 it
 over
 five
 plus


years.
 You
 will
 not
 see
 people
 bragging


about
 their
 100hour
 weeks
 or
 side


hustles.
 In
 fact,
 bringing
 that
 kind
 of


energy
 into
 a
 Danish
 team
 might
 make
 you


look
 a
 little
 insecure.
 Work
 life


balance
 is
 sacred
 and
 that
 includes


senior
 leadership.
 The
 vibe
 flat


hierarchy
 very
 common
 in
 the
 Nordics.


Direct
 communication.
 Nobody
 cares
 about


your
 job
 title.
 Don't
 expect
 to
 be


addressed
 as
 director
 of
 product.
 You


will
 be
 called
 by
 your
 first
 name
 and


you
 will
 get
 questioned
 in
 meetings
 just


like
 everybody
 else.
 Also,
 people
 don't


network
 here
 in
 the
 way
 they
 do
 in
 North


America.
 I
 felt
 this
 firsthand.
 I
 have


this
 little
 thing
 I
 do
 every
 time
 I


travel
 internationally.
 So,
 as
 a
 little


refresher,
 I'm
 a
 product
 manager
 and


after
 years
 of
 living
 in
 Canada
 and


working
 with
 the
 Canadian
 and
 US


markets,
 I
 am
 aware
 that
 networking
 is


your
 bread
 and
 butter
 in
 tech.
 So
 every


time
 I
 travel,
 I
 do
 my
 best
 to
 attend
 at


least
 one
 local
 tech
 event
 just
 to
 see


what
 it
 feels
 like
 to
 work
 in
 that


ecosystem
 and
 to
 understand
 what
 tech


feels
 like
 in
 different
 parts
 of
 the


world.
 So
 I
 either
 go
 for
 a
 local
 meetup


or
 I
 try
 to
 look
 for
 meetups
 within


Lenny's
 community.
 For
 those
 of
 you


unfamiliar
 with
 the
 product
 management


world,
 there
 is
 an
 international


community
 of
 PMs
 gathered
 together
 by
 a


big
 creator.
 His
 name
 is
 Lenny
 Richinsky


and
 he
 has
 a
 Slack
 channel
 with
 channels


in
 every
 major
 tech
 hub.
 So,
 if
 you're


part
 of
 his
 paid
 community,
 you
 can
 join


that
 Slack
 channel
 and
 go
 for
 various


meetups
 wherever
 you
 are.
 The
 reason
 I


love
 Lenny's
 community
 is
 because
 due
 to


the
 nature
 of
 Lenny's
 content,
 people


who
 read
 him
 and
 are
 willing
 to
 pay
 for


his
 content,
 they
 have
 a
 lot
 in
 common.


There
 is
 this
 highly
 curated
 community


of
 PMs.
 And
 the
 biggest
 phenomenon
 is


that
 the
 curation
 isn't
 so
 much
 driven


by
 money.
 It's
 driven
 by
 the
 depth
 of


research
 that
 he
 does
 and
 the
 people
 who


are
 interested
 in
 his
 research.
 So


anyway,
 I
 go
 to
 Lenny's
 meetups
 wherever


I
 can.
 And
 the
 last
 time
 I
 went
 to


Denmark,
 I
 went
 onto
 the
 Slack
 channel


and
 I
 typed
 in
 the
 Danish
 group
 that
 I'm


visiting
 from
 Toronto
 that
 I'm
 looking


for
 people
 to
 meet
 and
 network
 with
 in


Copenhagen
 and
 I
 got
 only
 one
 response.


That
 is
 very
 rare.
 Like
 extremely
 rare.


It's
 not
 like
 many
 people
 responded
 by


the
 time
 it
 didn't
 work
 out.
 Like
 in


Toronto,
 if
 you'd
 send
 a
 message
 like


that,
 you'd
 get
 15
 responses
 within
 a


couple
 of
 hours.
 There
 would
 be
 some


networking
 happening
 after
 5:00.
 Now,
 to


be
 clear,
 I
 deeply
 respect
 the
 customs


and
 culture
 of
 each
 country,
 and
 I'm
 not


saying
 that
 everybody
 should
 be
 as


bubbly
 and
 chatty
 as
 North
 Americans,


but
 living
 in
 the
 Western
 Hemisphere


sort
 of
 dictates
 the
 kind
 of
 society


that
 I'm
 used
 to.
 So,
 there
 is
 that.


Denmark
 is
 definitely
 more
 of
 a
 closed


loop
 society.
 Breaking
 in
 as
 a
 foreigner


can
 take
 years
 and
 this
 I
 have
 confirmed


with
 some
 people
 that
 I
 know
 who
 are


German
 and
 Czech
 born
 living
 in
 Denmark.


Cost
 of
 living.
 Copenhagen
 is
 not
 cheap.


It
 is
 on
 par
 with
 Berlin
 and
 Amsterdam,


but
 some
 essentials
 such
 as
 groceries,


restaurants,
 and
 housing
 can
 be


eyewateringly
 expensive.
 My
 biggest


cultural
 shock
 was
 coffee.
 Guys,
 please


do
 something
 about
 your
 coffee.
 $10
 for


a
 cup
 of
 cappuccino
 is
 just
 that's
 worse


than
 New
 York.
 But
 the
 real
 hit
 taxes.


Top
 marginal
 tax
 rate


55.9.
 And
 yes,
 you
 get
 public
 health


care
 and
 free
 education.
 But
 if
 you're


coming
 from
 the
 US
 where
 250k
 means


upper
 middle
 class,
 brace
 yourself.
 Your


take-home
 in
 Denmark
 will
 feel
 pretty


small.
 Conclusion.
 When
 is
 Denmark
 a


good
 idea?
 If
 you're
 mid
 to
 senior
 level


post
 burnout
 and
 you
 want
 to
 optimize


for
 dignity,
 balance,
 and
 designdriven


work.
 If
 you're
 joining
 a
 company
 that


already
 understands
 global
 teams
 like


Unity
 or
 a
 US
 company
 with
 a
 Danish


office.
 If
 you
 want
 strong
 social


benefits
 for
 your
 family
 and
 a
 city
 that


is
 safe,
 very
 bikable,
 and


parentfriendly.
 If
 you've
 got
 an
 EU


passport
 or
 your
 employer
 is
 sponsoring


and
 walking
 you
 through
 the
 visa


process,
 which
 by
 the
 way
 is
 much
 faster


than
 in
 Sweden,
 usually
 1
 to
 3
 months
 if


your
 employer
 knows
 what
 they're
 doing.


When
 is
 Denmark
 not
 worth
 it?
 If
 you


want
 an
 explosive
 compensation
 growth,


that's
 not
 going
 to
 happen
 in
 Denmark.


Offers
 are
 modest,
 equity
 rarely
 turns


into
 cash,
 and
 bonuses
 are
 rare.
 You


rely
 on
 aggressive
 networking
 and
 side


gigs
 to
 level
 up.
 Denmark
 does
 not


reward
 hustle.
 It
 rewards
 stability
 and


seniority
 within
 the
 same
 work.
 It
 is


not
 worth
 it
 if
 you
 expect
 to
 build
 a


career
 purely
 in
 English.
 While
 office


life
 is
 English
 friendly,
 many


leadership
 roles
 still
 require
 Danish


and
 so
 does
 real
 career
 longevity
 which


I
 would
 like
 to
 emphasize
 once
 again
 in


my
 opinion
 is
 the
 right
 thing.
 I
 do


think
 that
 the
 country
 should
 preserve


their
 languages
 and
 that
 the
 local


languages
 should
 be
 prioritized.
 And


lastly,
 it
 is
 not
 a
 good
 choice
 if
 you


want
 to
 make
 international
 friends


quickly.
 The
 social
 scene
 is
 polite
 but


is
 not
 too
 available
 to
 outsiders.
 So
 to


sum
 it
 up,
 if
 your
 goal
 is
 to
 stabilize


your
 life
 and
 do
 meaningful
 work
 in
 a


highly
 civilized
 settings,
 this
 is
 one


of
 the
 best
 places
 in
 Europe.
 But
 if


you're
 still
 in
 growth
 mode,
 career


first,
 or
 chasing
 upside,
 you'll
 outgrow


Denmark
 very
 fast.
 Before
 we
 wrap
 up,


yes,
 I
 am
 well
 aware
 that
 there
 are
 five


Nordic
 countries.
 But
 for
 mid
 to
 senior


tech
 workers
 looking
 to
 relocate
 and


rebuild
 their
 lives
 post
 layoffs,
 Sweden


and
 Denmark
 are
 the
 only
 ones
 that
 I


think
 are
 worth
 a
 serious
 look.
 Norway's


tech
 scene
 is
 fairly
 small,
 risk
 averse,


and
 largely
 tied
 to
 oil
 money.
 Finland


is
 great
 if
 you're
 in
 gaming
 deep
 tech,


but
 it's
 very
 isolated
 and
 language


dependent
 and
 not
 built
 for


international
 PMs
 or
 engineers.
 So,
 no,


I
 didn't
 forget
 them.
 I
 just
 wanted
 to


specifically
 focus
 on
 Sweden
 and


Denmark.
 And
 that's
 a
 wrap
 for
 this


episode.
 Next
 up
 is
 the
 United
 Arab


Emirates
 and
 Saudi
 Arabia.
 As
 always,
 I


hope
 this
 was
 helpful.
 Till
 next
 time.
