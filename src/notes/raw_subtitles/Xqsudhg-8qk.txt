So
 there's
 a
 popular
 belief
 in
 Silicon


Valley
 of
 the
 best
 way
 to
 find
 startup


ideas
 is
 to
 try
 to
 solve
 your
 own


problems.
 But
 if
 everyone
 in
 the
 tech


industry
 is
 following
 that
 path,
 it


leads
 to
 this
 saturation
 of
 problems
 for


folks
 in
 the
 tech
 industry.
 That's
 what


led
 us
 to
 the
 insurance
 industry
 quickly


realized
 there's
 unsolved
 problems


everywhere.
 People
 we
 reached
 out
 to


early
 on
 in
 the
 industry
 were
 quite


skeptical.
 The
 f
 first
 thing
 I
 hear
 is,


you
 know,
 I
 just
 want
 to
 tell
 you,
 you


know,
 I'm
 taking
 this
 call
 as
 a
 favor,


but
 we
 don't
 need
 your
 services.
 We
 have


solved
 for
 this
 already.
 We're
 all
 set.


I'm
 just
 trying
 to
 do
 this
 as
 a
 favor.


And
 in
 retrospect,
 it's
 like,
 why
 would


they
 talk
 to
 two
 random
 outsiders?


People
 are
 busy
 and
 hear
 pitches
 like


that
 all
 the
 time.
 We
 had
 that
 quote
 in


our
 old
 office
 on
 the
 wall
 of
 that


formative
 moment
 of
 we
 don't
 need
 your


services.
 And
 that
 company
 that
 told
 us


we
 don't
 need
 your
 services
 is
 now
 one


of
 our
 largest
 customers.


I'm
 Jordan.
 I'm
 the
 co-founder
 and
 CEO


of
 Commulate.
 We're
 transforming
 the


insurance
 industry
 with
 AI.
 3
 years
 ago,


it
 seemed
 crazy
 to
 most
 folks
 that
 we


wanted
 to
 focus
 on
 the
 back
 office


insurance
 workflows.
 When
 you
 have
 like


two
 people
 with
 no
 background
 in
 doing


the
 thing
 that
 they're
 saying
 they're


going
 to
 be
 able
 to
 automate
 for
 you,


who
 the
 heck's
 going
 to
 take
 those
 those


people
 seriously?
 But
 since
 then,
 we've


scaled
 to
 over
 eight
 figures
 of
 ARR
 and


we're
 just
 getting
 started.


By
 the
 time
 I
 I
 was
 in
 college,
 I
 was


starting
 to
 try
 to
 build
 software
 in
 a


software
 company
 and
 spend
 thousands
 of


hours
 building
 actually
 one
 product
 in


particular.
 In
 reality,
 I
 realized
 as
 I


was
 going,
 I
 was
 building
 a
 huge


dumpster
 fire.
 Platform
 had
 500


features.
 is
 each
 of
 them
 was
 like
 5%


built.
 Through
 that
 I
 realized
 like
 how


actually
 complex
 it
 was
 to
 build
 great


software
 and
 I
 realized
 I
 think
 like
 I


needed
 to
 learn
 how
 to
 do
 that
 and
 I


wanted
 to
 learn
 how
 to
 build
 great


software
 and
 I
 kind
 of
 came
 across
 and


learned
 about
 the
 role
 of
 product


management
 and
 I
 read
 this
 book


particularly
 called
 cracking
 the
 PM


interview
 that
 sort
 of
 several
 folks
 had


told
 me
 to
 read
 the
 author
 was
 Jackie


who
 ran
 product
 at
 a
 sauna
 it
 was
 like


20
 pages
 into
 it
 I
 was
 like
 I
 need
 to


work
 for
 for
 Jackie
 and
 that's
 how
 I


ended
 up
 going
 to
 a
 sauna
 with
 a
 mission


of
 I
 want
 to
 learn
 how
 build
 great


product
 from
 Jackie
 and
 then
 I
 ended
 up


being
 able
 to
 learn
 from
 a
 lot
 of
 other


great
 folk
 around
 that.
 I
 met
 my


co-founder
 Michael
 towards
 the
 end
 of


college.
 I
 was
 going
 to
 work
 in
 product


at
 ASA
 and
 Michael
 reach
 out
 cuz
 he
 was


interested
 in
 in
 understanding
 what


product
 was
 like.
 We
 met
 for
 lunch
 and


it
 was
 one
 of
 those
 really
 one
 ina-


million
 conversations
 where
 you
 meet


someone
 and
 think
 like
 this
 person
 is


different.
 And
 it
 sounds
 pretty
 crazy,


but
 at
 that
 moment,
 I
 was
 actually


already
 thinking
 like,
 this
 might
 be


someone
 I
 start
 a
 company
 with.


Unfortunately,
 I
 think
 for
 me,
 Michael


didn't
 feel
 that
 way.
 He
 was
 going
 to


this
 company
 that
 no
 one
 knew
 about


called
 Brex,
 and
 he
 was
 going
 to
 be
 the


10th
 hire
 there.
 I'm
 Michael.
 I'm
 the


CTO
 and
 co-founder
 of
 Commulate.
 I
 was


an
 engineer
 at
 Brax
 uh
 prior.
 I
 joined


the
 company
 out
 of
 college
 when
 it
 was


just
 about
 10
 people
 and
 saw
 it
 grow


super
 quickly
 to
 over
 900
 during
 my
 time


there.
 Something
 the
 Bra
 founders
 are


really
 incredible
 at
 that
 I
 picked
 up
 on


is
 being
 able
 to
 see
 the
 business
 at


both
 a
 10,000
 ft
 view
 and
 a
 10-ft
 view.


Even
 from
 the
 very
 beginning
 they
 were


thinking
 about,
 hey,
 how
 do
 we
 scale


this
 to
 being
 100
 plus
 billion
 dollar


company
 at
 some
 point
 and
 becoming
 like


the
 global
 substrate
 for
 financial
 money


movement.
 At
 the
 same
 time,
 they're


extremely
 good
 at
 saying,
 hey,
 what


growth
 hacks
 do
 we
 need
 to
 do
 this
 week


to
 be
 able
 to
 push
 the
 company
 forward?


You
 know,
 what
 next
 feature
 do
 we
 need


to
 build
 and
 what
 should
 be
 the
 design


and
 product
 mocks
 to
 be
 able
 to
 do
 that?


And
 those
 two
 skill
 sets,
 it's
 pretty


rare
 to
 find
 in
 like
 the
 same
 person.


And
 that's
 a
 big
 part
 of
 what
 I
 found
 to


be
 really
 successful
 in
 that
 early
 state


is
 being
 able
 to
 do
 both.
 It
 was
 a


pretty
 incredible
 first
 job
 out
 of


college.
 But
 also,
 I
 had
 always
 thought


about
 starting
 a
 company.
 Jordan
 and
 I,


like
 I
 mentioned,
 we
 were
 super
 good


friends
 and
 we
 had
 been
 talking
 about
 it


more
 and
 more
 over
 time.
 Jordan
 had
 just


left
 his
 job
 and
 it
 got
 to
 a
 point
 where


we
 were
 starting
 like
 nights
 and


weekends
 to
 work
 on
 different
 startup


ideas
 together.
 All
 of
 these
 factors


seem
 to
 come
 together.
 It
 said
 like,


"Hey,
 if
 there
 was
 a
 moment
 to
 do
 this,


now
 is
 definitely
 it."
 So,
 I
 leave
 Bra


and
 jump
 right
 into
 starting
 a
 company


with
 Jordan.


[Music]


When
 Michael
 and
 I
 decided
 we're
 going


to
 do
 this
 together,
 we
 actually
 like


didn't
 know
 anything
 about
 insurance
 or


accounting.
 From
 our
 years
 at
 Asana
 and


Brex,
 we
 had
 a
 few
 ideas
 that
 we
 were


excited
 about.
 But
 as
 we
 went
 through


the
 early
 process
 of
 validating
 those,


talking
 to
 the
 folks
 that
 we
 would
 try


to
 serve
 and
 would
 be
 customers,
 the


problems
 that
 we
 thought
 were
 worth


solving
 weren't
 actually
 in
 practice,


they
 didn't
 feel
 as
 big
 as
 it
 seemed
 and


and
 the
 existing
 solutions
 didn't
 seem


as
 bad
 as
 we
 thought
 they
 were.
 And
 I


think
 Michael
 and
 I
 really
 got
 into
 the


idea
 of
 wanting
 to
 build
 something
 that


didn't
 already
 exist.
 We
 had
 started


learning
 about
 insurance
 and
 we
 were


immediately
 stunned
 by
 the
 amount
 of


paper,
 spreadsheets
 and
 time
 spent
 like


copying
 information
 from
 the
 analog


world
 to
 the
 digital
 world
 of
 very


legacy
 software
 and
 back
 in
 that
 we
 were


really
 especially
 fascinated
 by
 the


accounting
 workflows.
 We
 saw
 that
 there


was
 you
 know
 many
 intermediaries
 and
 in


the
 value
 chain
 that
 sort
 of
 bubbled
 up


into
 this
 observation.
 This
 whole


industry
 has
 an
 additional
 extra
 version


or
 extra
 type
 of
 accounting
 that
 other


industries
 don't
 have
 to
 deal
 with
 and


there's
 no
 good
 solutions
 that
 automate


that.
 Maybe
 we
 can
 develop
 that
 solution


and
 that
 ultimately
 led
 to
 the
 kind
 of


foundation
 for
 commulate.


People
 we
 reached
 out
 to
 early
 on
 in
 the


industry
 were
 quite
 skeptical.
 It
 was


hard
 initially
 to
 like
 talk
 to
 people
 in


this
 industry
 and
 you
 relied
 on
 like
 the


few
 second
 or
 third
 degree
 connection


you
 would
 have
 to
 get
 a
 conversation
 and


then
 the
 first
 thing
 I
 hear
 is
 you
 know


I
 just
 want
 to
 tell
 you
 you
 know
 I'm


taking
 this
 call
 as
 a
 favor
 but
 we
 don't


need
 your
 services
 we
 have
 solved
 for


this
 already.
 We're
 all
 set.
 I'm
 just


trying
 to
 do
 this
 as
 a
 favor.
 And
 at
 the


time
 that
 was
 a
 massive
 blow
 to
 us.


We're
 like
 oh
 wow
 like
 this
 is
 one
 of


like
 the
 largest
 companies
 into
 space.


if
 they
 don't
 need
 this,
 like
 why
 would


anyone
 else
 need
 it?
 But
 then
 as
 Baka


started
 diving
 into
 it,
 talking
 to
 more


people,
 we
 kind
 of
 got
 the
 sense
 like,


hey,
 he
 might
 just
 not
 be
 exposed
 to


this
 specific
 problem
 within
 his


company.
 And
 we
 got
 more
 and
 more


evidence
 many
 others
 actually
 did
 need


our
 services.
 And
 what
 we
 spent
 a
 ton
 of


time
 on
 in
 the
 early
 days
 was
 just
 on


Zoom
 calls
 with
 our
 customers
 really,


really
 deeply
 understanding
 what
 they're


doing.


>> And
 part
 of
 what
 helped
 us
 is
 we
 weren't


salespeople.
 We
 were
 product
 people
 like


trying
 to
 solve
 a
 problem
 and
 build
 a


solution
 for
 these
 folks.
 So
 our


questions
 usually
 were
 like
 very
 deep


about
 their
 workflows,
 about
 edge
 cases,


about
 why
 something
 was
 done
 a
 certain


way
 in
 the
 first
 place.
 I
 remember
 one


of
 our
 early
 customers
 wrote
 me
 a
 note


when
 they
 retired
 because
 I
 was
 issuing


them
 at
 retirement
 and
 they
 had
 been


instrumental
 in
 taking
 the
 bet
 on
 us
 in


one
 of
 those
 special
 relationships
 and


they
 had
 said
 50
 years
 of
 working
 at


this
 company
 working
 with
 you
 was
 the


first
 time
 someone
 who's
 brought
 in
 a


product
 has
 ever
 felt
 like
 they


understood
 us
 and
 to
 me
 that
 kind
 of


indicates
 the
 strength
 of
 coming
 in
 as


product
 person
 versus
 a
 salesoriented


mind
 of
 being
 able
 to
 build
 trust
 and


and
 build
 the
 depth
 of
 knowledge
 and


domain
 expertise
 that
 lends
 itself
 to
 a


customer
 wanting
 to
 believe
 you
 can


actually
 solve
 their
 problem
 versus
 make


promises.
 Luckily
 for
 us,
 there
 was
 like


just
 enough
 special
 people
 at
 a
 few


companies
 who
 sort
 of
 saw
 some
 potential


and
 spend
 the
 time
 and
 were
 willing
 to


sort
 of
 help
 us
 build
 the
 initial


kernel.
 It's
 somewhat
 luck
 and
 finding


the
 right
 person
 at
 the
 right
 time,
 it


resonating
 on
 on
 that
 day
 and
 then
 that


conversation
 going
 well
 and
 a
 lot


happens
 through
 that.
 Luckily,
 you
 don't


need
 that
 many
 of
 those
 experiences
 and


relationships
 at
 this
 point
 if
 you
 can


really
 develop
 some
 real
 core


relationships.


>> And
 that
 company
 that
 told
 us
 we
 don't


need
 your
 services
 is
 now
 one
 of
 our


largest
 customers.
 Even
 though
 at
 the


moment
 it
 feels
 like
 this
 setback
 and


you're
 not
 sure
 of
 the
 viability
 of
 what


you're
 doing
 and
 whether
 it's
 even
 worth


pursuing
 anymore,
 if
 you
 just
 keep
 on


persisting
 and
 actually
 getting
 more


information,
 building
 up
 that
 bottoms
 up


like
 confidence
 of
 what
 you're
 working


on,
 it
 actually
 led
 us
 to
 persist
 past


that
 they
 ended
 up
 needing
 the
 services.


Many
 people
 are
 thinking
 about
 AI
 in


terms
 of
 like
 how
 can
 you
 use
 it
 to


improve
 existing
 workflows
 and
 this
 is


especially
 true
 in
 traditional


industries
 where
 like
 how
 can
 you
 now


automate
 something
 you
 couldn't


previously
 automate
 with
 the
 prior
 you


know
 generation
 of
 tools
 or
 how
 to


augment
 humans
 by
 writing
 an
 email
 or


navigating
 a
 website.
 But
 I
 feel
 like


that's
 not
 actually
 the
 most
 interesting


question.
 I
 think
 the
 real
 question
 is


about
 like
 what
 fundamental
 constraints


created
 these
 workflows
 in
 the
 first


place
 and
 do
 those
 constraints
 actually


like
 still
 exist?
 If
 you
 think
 about
 any


prior
 platform
 shift
 like
 web
 to
 mobile


in
 the
 2010s,
 the
 most
 successful


products
 were
 actually
 rethinking
 what


should
 be
 on
 like
 a
 mobile
 app
 for


example,
 like
 Instagram
 for
 example,
 as


opposed
 to
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 unsuccessful


ones
 just
 took
 a
 normal
 website
 and
 put


it
 into
 a
 mobile
 app
 and
 it
 actually


wasn't
 that
 compelling.
 It's
 because


there's
 actually
 like
 new
 things
 that


are
 possible,
 right?
 You
 can
 like
 drag,


you
 can
 like
 multitask,
 etc.
 Now
 with


the
 AI
 platform
 shift,
 it's
 a
 similar


situation.
 In
 this
 context,
 it's
 all


based
 on
 this
 foundation
 of
 like
 really


understanding
 what
 are
 like
 the


fundamental
 problems
 that
 customers
 are


facing.
 When
 customers
 first
 come
 to
 us,


we'll
 map
 out
 their
 entire
 process.
 And


it
 often
 looks
 like
 this
 like
 crazy


flowchart
 with
 like
 30
 boxes
 all


interconnected.
 A
 big
 part
 of
 what
 we
 do


is
 look
 at
 that
 and
 say,
 "Hey,
 you
 can


actually
 simplify
 this
 to
 three
 or
 four


steps,
 especially
 with
 what
 software
 and


AI
 can
 do.
 And
 this
 is
 how
 our
 product


can
 actually
 do
 that."
 And
 that
 uh
 step


of
 actually
 simplification
 rather
 than


just
 trying
 to
 fit
 the
 crazy
 complexity


into
 a
 product
 is
 what
 actually
 lets
 us


able
 to
 rethink
 and
 reimagine
 what's


what's
 possible.
 That's
 the
 difference


between
 optimizing
 what
 exists
 today


versus
 like
 reimagining
 an
 entire


function
 from
 scratch.
 The
 latter
 is
 a


completely
 different
 opportunity
 that
 I


think
 will
 the
 winners
 of
 that


transition
 will
 have
 in
 common.


>> A
 few
 years
 ago
 when
 we
 started
 the


company
 building
 software
 for
 vertical


industries
 like
 automating
 work
 in
 them


was
 not
 that
 popular.
 It
 was
 a
 pretty


unconventional
 thing
 to
 go
 into


something
 like
 the
 insurance
 industry's


outsiders
 and
 try
 to
 understand
 and


automate
 a
 lot
 of the
 work
 that's


happening
 there.
 But
 now
 it's
 super
 hot.


So
 like
 70%
 of
 the
 most
 recent
 YC
 batch


is
 now
 doing
 AI
 agents
 for
 X
 industry.
 I


think
 a
 big
 part
 of
 that
 is
 just
 because


where
 AI
 is
 having
 the
 most
 impact
 right


now
 are
 these
 places
 that
 have
 been


pretty
 untouched
 by
 software


historically.
 I
 think
 the
 biggest
 advice


I
 have
 is
 like
 look
 where
 others
 don't


want
 to
 look.
 There's
 so
 many
 reasons


that
 folks
 will
 give
 you
 to
 like
 not


explore
 a
 space.
 And
 frankly,
 if
 we
 had


tried
 to
 raise
 our
 seed
 round,
 not
 doing


any
 discovery
 or
 validation
 before,
 we


would
 have
 never
 done
 this
 because


everyone
 told
 us
 it
 was
 a
 bad
 idea.
 But


going
 out
 on
 the
 field
 and
 sort
 of
 doing


what
 folks
 have
 told
 you
 is
 not
 a
 good


place
 to
 play
 in.
 Sometimes
 that's
 where


the
 opportunity
 is.
 And
 I
 really
 think


it's
 important
 to
 like
 go
 on
 a
 personal


mission
 to
 find
 the
 truth
 because
 you


never
 really
 know
 their
 altitude
 and


understanding
 of
 a
 problem
 until
 you


dive
 in
 and
 try
 to
 figure
 it
 out


yourself.
 So
 what
 has
 me
 really
 excited


about
 the
 future
 is
 there's
 still


hundreds
 of
 billions
 of
 dollars
 spent
 on


manual
 work
 every
 year
 in
 this
 space
 and


AI
 has
 opened
 that
 up
 into
 a
 massive


opportunity
 and
 we're
 right
 at
 the


forefront
 of
 being
 able
 to
 take


advantage
 of
 that


>> and
 that
 means
 that
 to
 me
 this
 is
 very


obviously
 one
 of
 the
 largest


opportunities
 and
 you
 think
 about
 the


next
 10
 and
 20
 years
 in
 software
 that's


super
 exciting
 for
 our
