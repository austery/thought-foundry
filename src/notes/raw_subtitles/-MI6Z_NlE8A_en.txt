- In the preamble to the
definition of PTSD, we write,
these people have been exposed
to an extraordinary event
that's outside of normal human experience.
So it turned out that this is not
an unusual experience at all.
The trauma is not the event that happens.
The trauma is how you respond to it.
The degree to which
when you're traumatized,
your body keeps mobilizing
itself to fight.
You have all kind of
immunological abnormalities,
you have endocrine abnormalities,
and that really devastates your health,
your physical health.
Has a long range,
oftentimes the physical problems
are longer lasting than
the mental problems.
(classical music)
One of the largest mitigating
factors against getting
traumatized is who is there for
you at that particular time.
I did the first study on Prozac for PTSD,
the first study for Zoloft for PTSD
and a number of other conventional drugs.
What we found is it didn't work very well.
Hi, my name is Bessel van der Kolk.
I'm a psychiatrist, neuroscientist.
Your author of the book,
"The Body Keeps The Score".
- Chapter 1: Trauma explained
- I got interested in trauma on my first day
working at the Veterans Administration.
By the very first day that
I met Vietnam veterans,
I was just blown away.
These were guys who were my age
who were clearly smart and competent
and had done very good things;
flying helicopters and running boats,
and doing good stuff in the military.
And they clearly were just a
shadow of their former self.
And what particularly intrigued me is
that they had nightmares
apart what had happened
and also that they kept referring back to
that dead comrades.
Their heart seemed to be with the people
who were no longer around.
And what struck me immediately
is they had a very hard
time connecting with new
people after the war.
What also struck me is how their bodies
were clearly affected by trauma.
These were guys who used to
be athletic, in other words,
who were slumped over
and they were uptight
and their voices were uptight,
and they were sort of
passive much of the time.
And then people told 'em
something that was disappointing
and they went from zero to 10,
and blew up and became extremely angry.
And it was just at the
time that we were having
two small children who were
a little bit like that.
You know, there were little
babies go from zero to 10,
but I know when a baby becomes very upset,
within 10 minutes you
could sort of hold them
and calm them down.
And these soldiers were
very much like little babies
except the stuff that's supposed to happen
to allow you to not
overreact to the minor things
seemed to have been destroyed
or something seemed to
have happened to them
that made it very hard for them
to modulate their responses
to the their environment.
And what is also really striking is
that they had a hard time
being anyway meaningfully
involved in the present.
They had a hard time loving
their wives and girlfriends.
They had a hard time really
connecting with their kids.
So if something seems
to have been destroyed
by their capacity to engage
and possibly even to
learn new experiences.
1978 was the year that
I first saw veterans.
And that was also the
time that my colleagues
and, I soon, joined them,
started to think about
how is what these guys
suffer from different
from what other people who
are in secular textbooks,
because clearly they were different
and I couldn't find the
textbook to describe them.
Around that time that I first
started to work for the VA,
a group of us started
to define what trauma is
and started to define
what happens to people.
In the preamble to the
definition of PTSD, we write,
these people have been exposed
to an extraordinary event
that's outside of normal human experience.
And in retrospect, that shows us
how ignorant and narrow minded we were
because it turned out that this is not
an unusual experience at all.
That one out of five women in America
has a history of sexual molestation.
Even a lot of men have
history of sexual molestation.
One out of four kids get beaten
very hard by their parents.
One out of eight kids see physical fights
between their parents.
When we started to work
with inner city kids,
the amount of trauma that
these kids experienced
was just on unspeakable.
So somehow we had managed to
turn a completely blind eye
how what happens in people's environment
creates the mind and
creates who people become
and creates certain forms of pathology.
It was a real wake up call
and there was a lot of debate of
what a trauma is to this day.
And even sometimes when I define it in
the way we officially do,
people still don't like what I say.
But basically what the
trauma is is something
that happens to you
that makes you so upset
that it overwhelms you,
it freaks you out and you cannot,
you just stand there or sit
there, lie there or whatever,
and you are at a loss, what to do.
You feel terrible, helpless,
hopeless, and you collapse.
Basically, there's an internal
state of, "oh my God".
So it's not somebody being mean to you
or nasty to you or it is really bad stuff,
but the trauma is not
the event that happens.
The trauma is how you respond to it.
Let me give you an example.
As a medical student, I
was trained to deal with
all kind of very difficult situations.
And I remember vividly
during my internship
that a kid was brought in a-little child-
with third degree burn
wounds all over his body.
But I was trained as a medical
student about what to do.
So rather than freaking
out, I thought, okay,
I need to get my IV going,
I need my fluids going.
I focused on what to do.
So that exposure to
these horribly burn kids
was not the trauma for me
because I was not paralyzed in my actions
because I'd been trained to deal with it.
And of course that happens to policemen,
that happens to people in the service,
it happens to physicians,
nurses, etcetera,
is you get trained on what to do
and not to get overwhelmed
by your feelings,
but to actually be able to
continue to act and do something.
And when you're traumatized,
you just are unable to do anything.
It's a subjective experience.
And what may be traumatic for you
may not be traumatic
for me, and vice versa,
depending on our personality
and our training.
An event becomes traumatic if
your response is, "oh my God".
And when there is
nothing you can think of,
you can do to stave off the inevitable
where you basically collapse
in state of confusion,
maybe rage, maybe collapse
because you are unable to function
in the face of this particular threat.
An event like that may not become a trauma
in the long range.
If at the moment that you collapse,
other people around you come over
and say, oh, I see that
you're really in bad shape,
let me help you.
Let me take over for you and do things
that you cannot do yourself.
And so the greatest
protector against the trauma
is the people around you
whether they're able to protect you
and to do what needs to be done
or whether the people around
you actually make it worse
by continuing to do terrible things to you
or blaming you for your responses.
Trauma is actually unlike
what we first thought,
extremely common.
At least one out of eight kids in America
witness physical violence
between their parents.
A larger number of kids
get hit in very nasty ways
by their own caregivers.
A very large number of people in general,
but women in particular,
have sexual experiences
that were clearly unwanted
and that left them helpless
and befuddled, confused and enraged
because they had no choice
about what they were doing.
These experiences extremely common.
So people usually think about the military
when they talk about trauma,
but I like to say somewhat
outside scientifically,
that's for every soldier who
gets PTSD in the war zone,
there's these 30 children
who gets traumatized at home.
The nature of trauma is
that an experience enters into your ears,
into your skin, into your
eyes, into sensations,
and it goes down into a very
primitive part of your brain
that automatically
interprets what is going on.
That's not your frontal lobe.
What your frontal lobe, your
conscious cognitive self;
that is a later issue.
The first thing is a somatic response.
So something happens to you,
your survival brain makes
the first interpretation
and says, is this
dangerous or is this safe?
That decision is made for you
by that primitive survival brain.
And that's what we learned a lot about
when we study trauma is the
power of that primitive brain,
which occupies a very
large part of our brain
that really automatically
makes decisions for us.
And on the basis of the
messages we get from our body,
our cognition interprets
in a particular way
depending on our prior experiences.
But the message come from our hormones
and our physiological impulses
that have to do with survival.
We are talking about staying alive.
And so when you're being
raped or you're being beaten
or you see your parents getting killed,
your body starts
automatically going to a state
trying to make yourself survive.
One of the states is
going to fight-flight,
to get up and to punch people
and to become very angry.
And that's oftentimes when people are
traumatized, they'll
fight-flight responses
continue to get activated in response
to situations where people,
their environment says,
hey, hey, cool it, this is not so bad.
But people have these automatic responses
or on a more primitive level even,
is that people's brain shuts down
and they lose track of themselves
and they basically make
themselves disappear.
Very much like animals can
do that also in the wild
because they can sort of collapse
and play possum as it were.
And playing possum is exactly
what happens to people also.
And when you beat a kid enough,
that kid starts collapsing
and no longer respond
to this environment.
And so it is either
fight-flight or collapse,
none of which have anything
to do with cognition.
And doing cognitive therapy with that
is really a misunderstanding
of what happens with traumatized people.
They have automatic responses
and they don't have these responses
because they're stupid
or because they don't
understand what's going on.
Most people actually do understand
that their reactions are
completely out of whack.
They don't need to be told that,
and but because they react
in such an extreme way,
they feel deeply ashamed about themselves
because they say to
themselves, I'm a nut cake.
I screamed at people.
I collapsed when I had
to stand up for myself.
And so you have these automatic responses
that are not a product of
your cognitive assessment.
They're product of your
animal brain trying
to stay alive in the face
of something that that part
of your brain interprets as a life threat,
even though people around you by now go,
this is not a life threat at all.
We come into the world being able to do
what little babies can do and
what can little babies do?
They can breathe, they
can sleep, they can suck,
they can feel hungry, they can poop,
they can pee, they can
cry, and that's about it.
And so we call that the
housekeeping of the body.
Little babies already can do that.
And little babies, the system
would get very activated.
So babies will scream and they'll cry,
and they'll look catastrophic,
and then the people
around them pick them up
and soothe them and calm that
part of their brain down.
Much of the imprint of trauma
is in a very primitive
survival part of your brain
that's already in place in little babies.
In fact, what the research
recently has been showing
this little area way, just
way this base of your skull,
periaqueductal gray, that I like to call
the cockroach brain as a part
of you that just picks up what's
dangerous and what's safe.
And now it turns out that
when you're traumatized,
that little part of your brain,
which is usually very
quiet for most of us,
continues to just send messages
to you when you're traumatized.
And so there's always this sort
of message you get from deep down inside
of your body of I'm in
danger, I'm not safe.
So you're always uptight, always on alert,
and you spend much of your energy trying
to suppress those feelings of fear
in order not to embarrass yourself
in order to be able to
work with what you do.
And so it's very primitive.
And then on top of that
middle of the primitive part
of your brain, you
develop a limbic system.
And your limbic system basically creates
an internal map of the
world that tells you
what out there is safe, what is dangerous.
So if you say to me, boy,
after this interview is
over, let's go to the store
and plow down the street,
and have a nice lager beer.
I go like, wow, that's so cool
because I love that bar
and I don't love that bar.
So already in my internal mind
I have a map of what is
safety and what's dangerous,
and that map is created by
the experiences we have.
And so the brain is a use dependent organ
and the brain gets formed on the basis
of the experiences that we have,
particularly in the first
few years of your life.
And so if you're a little kid
and you grow up in very safe surroundings
and people are delighted to see you,
and people say, isn't she cute?
Isn't she wonderful?
You grow up with a sense of,
I'm so cute and people love me
because that becomes
the map of your world.
That's how people respond to you.
And that basically that stays with you
for much of the rest of your life.
If you're a little kid
and people say to you,
as I hear all the time,
I wish you hadn't been born.
I try to abort you but I fail,
you're just really ruined my life.
You're just have always
been pain in the ass.
That becomes your map of the world.
And a little kid doesn't say
when you're three years-old
or five years old, mom, you're
crazy saying that about me
because a little kid doesn't have other
ways of looking at the world.
So the world that you live
in is the only world that is.
And if you're being
treated as an difficult,
unpleasant person, that becomes
your perception of yourself.
I'm fundamentally a bad defective person.
And that, people's cognition
does not make that go away.
People can tell you till
you're blue in the face, oh,
you're wonderful, you're terrific.
I've known a whole bunch
of people like that
who were very abused and neglected as kids
who have become amazing musicians.
Artists, athletes, the world adores them
and deep inside they still feel like crap,
that they're defective people,
because that imprint stays with them.
My colleagues and I started
to look at these dramatized
soldiers primarily.
We actually went back over
what had been written before.
The library at the VA I was working,
didn't have a single
book about war trauma,
war neurosis, any of these things.
But so I went down to the
old Harvard Medical Library
and I dug up a book
that was written in 1941
by a guy by the name of Abram Kardiner
who had been working with
first World War soldiers.
And he writes about his
first World War soldiers
back a long time ago.
He writes,
"these guys suffer from a physioneurosis.
"Their bodies continue to
re-experience the trauma."
And he says, "and the
trauma keeps coming back,
"keeps revisiting them in the form
of nightmares and flashbacks."
They keep reliving what
happened back there.
They cannot leave it behind,
and the trauma keeps coming
back either as images
or as behaviors as the
people behave again,
as if they're getting raped
or getting assaulted even
though they're not getting
raped or getting assaulted.
So what we defined, but
people had seen that
before us all the way back to
well over a hundred years
at the core of trauma
is that you get stuck
and that event keeps coming back
in terms of images, behaviors,
and physical sensations.
So that became at the core
of our definition of PTSD.
The second piece is that having
been constantly bombarded
with this horrifying stuff
makes you preoccupied with
how do I go on with my life?
And so you work very
hard on avoiding things
that make you lose your senses.
And so people avoid and people suppress it
and people actually learn to
not feel things in their bodies
and they stifle internal
sensations, eternal feelings.
So that's the second piece is
on the one side is this
fight-flight keeps going on.
The other thing is you calm yourself down.
You try to suppress yourself,
you try not to feel,
and so at the end you
don't feel very alive.
And the third thing is that
you continue to be hyper alert.
You know, you just keep being bombarded,
you keep overreacting to all
kinds of things in general.
That's the original definition of PTSD,
and that is still the definition
as you find in the textbook still.
But what we discovered
is that the whole impact
of trauma is much larger
and it also affects the way
you feel about yourself,
the way you feel about other people,
the way you are able to notice yourself,
the way you experience yourself.
And it has a lot of self distortions
and distortions of your body also.
And then over time we again,
rediscovered something
because these things always
have been noted before,
the degree to which
when you're traumatized,
your body keeps mobilizing itself to fight
and that you have all kind of
immunological abnormalities,
you have endocrine abnormalities
and that really devastates your health,
your physical health, and the long range,
oftentimes the physical
problems are longer lasting
than the mental problems.
The other thing that we discovered,
which is still an area of
some controversy in the field,
not for me but for my
colleagues who are in power,
is that trauma affects
the mind to the brain
very differently depending
on the age at which you are.
And so if something terrible
happens to me right now,
I have a whole well-developed brain
and my brain isn't really
growing all that much anymore.
So I'll get an imprint of the trauma
that is pretty much superimposed
on a relatively well-functioning brain.
If you're two, three or four years-old,
your mind and your brain is growing.
What various of my
research friends have shown
is that trauma at different
ages affects different ways
of wiring the brain and
it gets very complex.
As like my friend Marty
Teicher has really shown
that trauma at age three changes the brain
very differently than trauma at age five
and trauma age 14,
and that the brain keeps
growing and evolving.
And so different events
have a different imprint of the brain.
That's one aspect.
And the other thing that
is terribly important
is not only what's happening to you
but what's happening to your environment.
And by and large, as I said before,
if you are really freaked out as a kid
and your parents are there
for you and they smile
at you and say, I'll take care of it,
don't worry about it,
honey, I know what to do.
Or you have a doctor who really
knows what they're doing,
who you can trust,
you're going like, okay,
I can relax now 'cause even
if I can't take care of it,
other people can take care of it for me.
One of the largest mitigating factors
against getting traumatized is
who is there for you at
that particular time?
When you feel constantly threatened,
of course, you don't trust anybody,
but there is a reason to not trust people.
The tradition in mental
health is to dismiss people;
the reality of people's lives.
For example, it's only
in the past few years
that people are beginning
to talk about the impact
of poverty or the impact of racism
or the impact of unemployment.
And people have sort of
been labeling people, oh,
do something wrong with
you, let me fix you.
But mental health
professionals have been very
defective in helping people to really
come to terms with what
actually has happened to them
and what's happening to them right now.
So a good amount of distrust
is very well justified
and very likely today, if
you're a traumatized person,
you don't go to a doctor and say,
"I was raped when I was four years-old
"and that's why I come to be treated."
No, people go, come to be treated
because today you blow up at your husband
and today you cannot have a safe,
satisfactory sexual relationship
with your new partner.
And that's why coming into treatment
because the body ultimately
reacts to certain stimuli,
and most people actually are barely aware
or not aware at all, that their reactions
that they're having right now are actually
are rooted in experience
that they've had before.
So if you go to a physician or
a mental health practitioner
who doesn't understand that
they're going to try to fix you
with drugs or cognitive
behavioral treatment
to not do these crazy things anymore,
it usually doesn't work very well
because you need to really
develop a deep sense
of this what happened to me.
This is what I'm dealing with.
I need to really
acknowledge like, oh my God,
that was terrible what happened to me,
and I need to take care of the wounds
that I'm carrying inside of myself.
This issue of self-compassion
and really knowing that your
reactions are understandable
and are rooted in you
getting stuck in the past
is a terribly important part
of beginning to recover from trauma.
And as long as you ignore that,
you're just a crazy person
who has crazy reactions.
The problem with trauma
is that it starts off
with something that happens
to us or that's done to us,
but that's not where it stops
because it changes your brain.
And from now that event itself is over,
but you continue to react to
things as if you're in danger
and your brain actually gets changed
in a variety of different ways.
And the problem then becomes
that you are not able to engage
or to learn or to see other
people's point of view
or to coordinate your
feelings with your thinking.
And so yet it becomes an internal issue,
how the trauma continues to fester inside
of you in a variety of different
sensations and perceptions.
Yes, there is something wrong with you,
but people don't come to see, oh, see me
because of what happened to them.
People go, come to see me
because if feel is something
really wrong with me,
I cannot connect with my kids.
I become angry with all my coworkers.
Nobody can stand being around
me because I am so reactive.
Yes, trauma causes that there
is something wrong with you,
and my job as a psychiatrist
and all the colleagues
and students I have is
to help you to feel safe
in your body and to feel
like the trauma is over.
And if you don't continue to
react to all kind of things now
as if somebody is trying
to hit you or rape you.
I think the most
important thing to know is
that there's a difference
between trauma and stress.
As I like to say to people,
life sucks a good amount of the time.
Now we all have jobs
and situations that are really unpleasant,
but the moment that the
situation is over, it's over.
You go on with your life.
A trauma is happens and when it's over,
your body continues to relive it.
And the core issue is
that your body does it.
Your endocrine system,
your neurohormonal system,
the immunological system
continues to react
as if you're back there.
So there is something
about the development
of the mind that gets
stopped at that point
because the trauma cannot
be integrated as, oh yeah,
that really sucked, but it's over now.
Trauma makes you think that
it's still happening right now.
So the big challenge of treating trauma
is how do we help people to live in bodies
that feel fundamentally safe?
Where something unpleasant happens to you,
you don't react as if
your life is in danger.
But you go like, oh, how do I solve this?
But when you're traumatized,
what's very striking
and a whole variety of
different brain studies,
what you show is that when you
show a nontraumatized person
something ambiguous and difficult,
their cognitive brain tries
to figure out what's going on.
Where you saw this same stimulus
to people who are traumatized,
the emotional brain reacts like,
is this dangerous or is this safe?
Your brain goes into,
is my life in danger?
And that's an emotional reaction,
what lights up in the brain
is a very different part of the brain,
but then when you have to solve a problem,
so you're continuously trying
to manage your emotional reactions.
(graphics swooshing)
- Chapter 2: Shaping childhood trauma
- People have always noticed that
people relive their trauma.
But as I said before, usually
people are not aware of it.
Kids are not aware of that
they're reliving their having been beaten
or witnessing domestic violence.
And when they go to school,
they react in a very angry
and defiant way with
their teachers say, oh,
"this reminds me about my mom
and dad fighting, making me scared."
No, had they have an
automatic reaction to adults
who started in any way not okay to blow up
and become very frightened
so they don't make the connection.
And so what happened when we
created this diagnosis of PTSD,
you know, we weren't very
perceptive, you know,
we're just beginning to see
something for the first time.
And the most obvious thing in which people
relive the trauma is in nightmares.
In nightmares, people see it again
or they experience the
event in their dreams.
That is the most obvious,
and we could see it.
It took us a long time to
realize that people also are
continue to reenact the
trauma in their relationships.
That they may relate to their
kid the same way they related
to people who hurt them
as little children,
and so they don't make that connection.
But what what allows you
to make the connection
is when you actually have images
of what happened back there,
but most people don't have visual images.
Most people have sensory reactions,
how they feel suddenly feel uptight,
they feel nervous,
panicky, anxious, enraged.
They don't know where it's come from
after they read books like mine
they know at least where it comes from.
Comes from some part of your brain
that you actually cannot really know
because it's beyond cognition.
So, oh, that's why I'm doing that stuff.
That's sort of helpful to know
but most people who are reenacting
or replaying the trauma are not aware
that they're recreating
or replaying the trauma.
So trauma affects the developing brain
different from a well-developed brain.
The research is really very,
its intriguing about this
and that's the degree
to which parents hold
and modulate kids' traumatic responses.
As I said before, when as a
kid you get bitten by a dog,
it's really very scary and very nasty.
But if your parents pick you up and say,
oh, "I'm so sorry, let's
go and take care of it
and let's give you a bath
and we'll give you some
extra special food,"
that dog bite doesn't become a big issue
because the foundation of your safety
has not been destroyed.
A study I like to quote actually
and teach people about is a study
that was done in London right
after the second World War
because London was being
bombed by the Nazis.
The Brits decided let's
send the kids in London
who were being bombed out to
the bucolic English countryside
to live with very nice people.
And when the war is
over, they'll come back
and they won't have seen
all these dead people
and they had corpses and all the bombing,
they'd be much better off.
And so after the war,
Anna Freud of all people,
Sigmund Freud's daughter and
her friend Dorothy Burlingham,
did a study of what
happened to these kids.
It turned out that the
kids who stayed in London
with their parents did just fine
because the safety of kids is determined
by how safe they feel with their parents.
While the kids who went to the
countryside like Oliver Sacks
who some of your listeners
may also be a great fan
of like I am, he was
shipped to the countryside
and in his autobiography
Oliver Sacks writes,
like one of the two most traumatic events
in my life was being shipped
off to the countryside,
and I was a really scared and upset kid
who was primarily preoccupied with
but my parents are still alive,
but I didn't see them anymore.
But trauma also really
taught us is the degree
to which we are profoundly interconnected
and interdependent people and
we are relational creatures.
And as long as our
relationships are intact,
by and large we're
pretty good with trauma.
Who knows that the US Marine Corps
and the armed services,
they take a bunch of
people who are obviously,
who sometimes escape their own
horrible child environments,
had to and join the military
and they go into the military
and what does the military do for them?
They create a sense of cohesion,
a sense of predictability,
a sense of safety.
And so through all these
exercises they can do in the army,
you feel very connected with your group.
And when you go to war with your group,
you feel very safe that
your buddies are there
to protect you and that really protects
you against getting traumatized.
And the very first study I did
before we knew anything about trauma
was the discovery that the PTSD started
for many soldiers when they
saw their best friend being
blown up because they really
had the sense of safety
and cohesion because they had a friend
but then that friend got killed
the whole world collapsed
and they no longer had the
safety that came with the group.
And so what you see with
many traumatized people
is that they continue to really
pull towards reconnecting
with people who have
had similar experiences.
Because when you say I was raped
and I was raped too,
you're going like, you know
what I'm talking about, you're special.
I can be safe with you.
As opposed to all these people
who have no idea what I'm talking about.
The lingering effect of childhood trauma
is that you continue to react
to mild stressors as if
your life is in danger.
You tend to become hyper reactive.
People see your reactions as exaggerated.
Somebody may irritate
you in the supermarket,
they may yell at this person.
You may develop road rage.
You may have a difficult time putting up
with misbehavior from
your spouse or your kids,
and you have exaggerated
emotional responses.
The other thing is, it
oftentimes is very hard
to negotiate intimate relationships.
Negotiating both of our needs.
Your needs and my needs actually
is a very complex phenomenon.
How do we make compromises?
How do we make both of us
happy at the same time?
And when you have a childhood trauma
that oftentimes becomes very difficult.
Very difficult to say, okay honey,
if that's what you need, I wouldn't want
to do that, but I'm fine
with you if you do that.
And these issues of boundaries
and who's responsible for what
becomes very hard thing
to negotiate, oftentimes.
The big question for me continues
to be how do you help kids, in particular,
who have been exposed to
enormous amount of violence,
life threats, people who
don't pay attention to them,
how do you help these
kids get a sense of self,
a sense of agency so they can actually
make a life for themselves
where they can learn, acquire
skills, acquire competencies,
so they become full-fledged human beings?
What the data show is
that the long-term effect
of child abuse and neglect,
which is rampant in our country,
is the biggest public
health issue in America.
Let me give you an example.
There is other societies
that are much more
trauma savvy than we are
where it is not the enormous
amount of incoming inequality
where parents actually are helped
to take care of their kids.
Where healthcare is universal,
where childcare is universal.
One of these places is Holland,
which happens to be my native country,
which I left when I was 18 years-old
and which has become a very nice place.
So in a culture like that,
that really looks at
what are the antecedents
for getting people to be dysfunctional?
They do all these things to help people
to take care of their kids.
And so in the Netherlands right
now the incarceration rate
is 58 per 100,000 people.
In the US it's 950 per 100,000 people.
So the big issue is a political issue.
How do we rearrange our society
to really know about trauma
and to really do all the
things that are necessary
so that people who grow up
under extreme adverse conditions
can develop a brain and a mind
that can help them to
become full-fledged members
of society instead of so
on the edge as drug addicts
and disabled people or people
who need to go to jail?
That's our big issue,
and that's the big challenge that we have.

- Chapter 3: How to treat trauma
- I was raised in the mainstream
culture as a professor,
prestigious institutions and
what's mainstream culture,
the culture we live in is
that when you are feel bad,
you take a swig of alcohol or
you take a swig of something
to make that feeling go away.
I call our medical culture
right now a post alcoholic
culture where if you feel bad,
you take something to
make that feeling go away.
And it turned out that
that taking something didn't
make the feelings go away,
but wiggling your fingers
in front of people's eyes
as you think about the trauma
made the trauma go away.
And I go like, wow, this
is really interesting.
When I first got to see trauma
and got intrigued with it,
I looked at the treatments that we have.
And so I did the first
study on Prozac for PTSD,
the first study for Zoloft for PTSD
and a number of other conventional drugs.
What we found is it didn't work very well
and we published those data in
prestigious medical journals
and people said, boy,
van der Kolk is a great
psychopharmacology researcher,
but our results showed that
they don't work very well.
Somehow psychiatry never got the message
that said, no drugs are
not particularly helpful
and the VA still spends
billions of dollars
on drugs that don't work.
They were unable to go
through the trajectory
that I and most of my colleagues
went through like, okay,
if it doesn't work, let's
see what else can work.
And people over ask me,
how can you put up with all
this misery that you hear?
And I agree, it's not easy,
but one of the things that helps you
is to really understand that
people do the best they can.
There's somebody who's enraged in response
to a minor thing is not becoming enraged
because they just are unpleasant,
difficult people who don't try.
No, they try. People try to survive.
Every person tries to have
the best possible life they can have,
and sometimes it goes really wrong.
But for example, when you're a little kid
and you don't feel like any
anybody's there to help you
when you become distressed,
you may learn that banging
your head against the wall
or stabbing yourself or burning yourself
or starving yourself may
make you feel better.
And so we can discover is that people
do all kind of things that
seem pretty weird sometimes
on the surface to protect themselves.
There was a moments in sort
of the history of our field
that was particularly
poignant in this regard.
Vince Felitti who is the
internist who did the ACE study,
the Adverse Childhood Experiences study,
had a very important
experience that he shared
with all of us, which
makes perfect sense to me.
He had a weight loss program
and that's all he did.
He was very proud of
his weight loss program.
And then one day a
woman came to his office
who had lost something like 150 pounds
or something in the course
of weight loss program
and she came back three months later
and she had regained
almost all of her weight.
He said, I didn't know people could gain
so much weight in such a short
period, what happened to you?
And she says, you know, Dr. Felitti
your weight loss program was terrific,
and I became svelte and people's reaction
to me completely changed.
So after my last visit to you
where you complimented me
about how well I was doing,
I went back to my office
and one of my coworkers said,
"boy, you look really hot.
Would you like to go on a date tonight?"
And the moment he said
that I started to eat
and I haven't stopped eating
because what I realized is
overweight is overlooked.
And the way I dealt with
my childhood sexual abuse
is to make myself grossly obese
so nobody would have an
interest in me in a sexual way.
So that was one of these openings
you get to see that some of the behaviors
that you may condemn or be upset about
actually are behaviors that start off
try to take care of yourself.
That actually is also true for drug abuse.
People, you know, people say
it's a biological illness,
but it's not so simple.
But, you know, if I say
to you right now, oh,
I have a little needle
with some heroin in it,
makes you feel good,
would you like to try it,
you'd say "you're crazy,
I'm not gonna take heroin."
But if you are in despair,
and you don't know if
you're going to make it
through the night let's say
I have a little drug here
that can help you make
it through the night,
you go like, "please,
please give it to me."
That's where drug addiction comes from.
That's also to a large degree
our opioid epidemic comes from.
It's also the stuff being
made available to people,
but, you know, among
my colleagues who are,
you know, have privileged lives,
they don't become drug addicts
because they have good lives.
They don't need to cure something
in terms of how upset they are
but since time immemorial,
people take drugs in order
to deal with unbearable sensations.
The military had a huge drug
problem during the Vietnam War
because people take these drugs
in order not to feel their pain.
If we really want to
take care of drug abuse,
we really have to look
at social situations
and circumstances that make people
feel desperate and hopeless.
(graphics swooshing)
Very good psychotherapy not to fix people,
but helping people to
know what they're feeling,
find ways in which to
cope with those feelings
was really quite helpful.
What was very clear is that
being in a relationship
where people can hear you,
where you can talk about
how badly you feel, but you
can talk about your guilt
and where you can start opening up
where these feelings come from,
how old these feelings are,
and how you develop these feelings
in response to particular
things that happen to you,
that was actually quite helpful.
Finding words for your
internal experience,
which is oftentimes very
difficult for traumatized people.
They actually have
impairment of being able
to know themselves.
Being able to discover who they are
and how they got these
reactions is very helpful.
(graphics swooshing)
And then for me, the
opening to a new world
came when some people in my clinic started
to do something very strange,
something called EMDR.
Eye movement desensitization
and reprocessing.
A technique where you ask people to
call up the memory of
what you saw back then,
what you heard back then,
what you felt back then,
but you don't ask people to talk about it
'cause the moment you start
talking about something,
you get more preoccupied
whether the person you're talking to
understands you, likes
you, is disgusted with you.
So it becomes an interpersonal process.
You ask people to just
feel it and notice it.
And then what you do
is that you ask people
to follow your fingers
as you move your fingers
from side-to-side in front of their eyes.
And my first reaction with my students
and junior colleagues
who do it is like, man,
stop this crazy nonsense.
This is a crazy method.
And then I got to see some of the results.
I go like, wow, this is
interesting. This is different.
And so I did a study funded by NIH
funded because people saw me
as a very good psychopharmacologist,
not a guy who had gone off the
deep end doing crazy methods
like EMDR and they, everybody
expected that we'd find
that the drugs are much better than EMDR.
And what we found is
that this crazy eye
movement desensitization
had amazing effects on
people being able to let go
of what happened to say yes,
that's what happened to me.
And it happened a long time ago,
it's not happening right now.
That was the first time
that I saw a nonconventional
technique have a very profound effect.
And that really had a very deep effect
on my thinking about treatment of trauma,
and of course my colleague said,
Bessel has gone off the deep end,
the data on EMDR was
still better than any data
of the treatment outcome
that anybody had studied,
but people didn't want to go there
because it's such crazy method.
So I tried to get money to study
what those eye movements do to the brain.
It took us about 15 years to collect money
from other sources to
finally do that study
where we were able to show
that you move your eyes
from side-to-side, that you
actually change brain circuits.
That changes the executive
function of the brain,
the default mode network of the brain
and the salience network of the brain.
So what we discovered
with all the other things
that happened in neuroscience is
that this strange eye movement that sounds
so bizarre actually changed
the circuitry of the brain
to interpret your current
reality from a different angle.
But the discovery at this point
is that our conventional way
of thinking about it is not working,
but strange stuff works.
And then a bunch of yoga teachers
come to talk to me and
say, we do yoga for PTSD.
It seems to help people.
And that made sense to me on some level,
maybe if you do yoga,
yoga can open up your
relationship to your body,
to your physical self.
You learn how to breathe calmly.
You can learn to pay
attention to yourself.
You get to see how different movements
and different postures affect you.
And so you form a deep relationship
to your internal sensory system.
Trauma is carried in the sensations
in your body and heartbreak and gut wrench
and that you have been
able to see in the brain
is that your connection with your body
becomes weaker and weaker
so you don't feel your body anymore.
So you don't feel your pain anymore.
Problem is that if you don't
feel your pain anymore,
you don't feel your
pleasure anymore either.
I was reading an extraordinary
case report of somebody
who lost all sensations in
their skin, in their bodies.
And it's a very, very rare
thing to happen to people.
And what people discovered is
if you cannot have a
sensation in your skin,
you cannot have a sensation of pleasure.
A sensation of pleasure is carried
by the corpuscles in our skin.
So we need to get pleasurable sensations
coming from our body to get
a sense of pleasure and joy.
And that was really interesting to me also
because traumatized people,
and that's left out of the definition,
have a tremendous problem
experiencing pleasure and joy.
And we applied a number
of times to study that.
At the end we did get funded
to the very first yoga study for PTSD,
and what turned out is that
the way the data looked to me,
yoga at the end was a
more effective treatment
for PTSD than any of the
drugs we had studied.
And we did a number of yoga studies,
we published them in
respected medical journals,
but I've yet to see a
psychopharmacology clinic
being transformed to to
yoga studio even though
it's pretty clear that needing
to feel safe in your body
and to own your body and
to feel all the sensation
in your body is a critical
aspect of healing from PTSD.
(graphics swooshing)
The next thing that we studied
was theater and movement.
And it turns out that
playing different roles
in your body helps you to feel
that your body can feel differently
depending on how you organize
your relationship to yourself.
So I live in the Berkshires
and we have a great program here called
Shakespeare in the Courts
where if you're a juvenile
delinquent in this country,
you have a 50% chance that
the judge will condemn you
to become a Shakespearean actor.
That's civilization, huh?
And the Shakespeare program
is enormously helpful
because it helps people
to feel their bodies
and to feel what it
feels like to be a king,
and it feels like to be a warrior
and it feels what it
feels like to be Ophelia
and you get to really
have a deep experience
of yourself in different possibilities.
We learned that,
that you can actually put
electrodes on your skull
and you can harvest your brainwaves
and project 'em on a computer screen
and then you can program
the computer screen
so that when you make brainwaves
that help you to be calm and focused
so the computer game is working.
And if your brain makes
waves that don't do that,
there's no computer game.
So your brain wants to
play the computer game,
but the moment you develop
brainwaves that are not helpful
to you, the screen goes
blank so that your brain
sort of wants to do the right thing
and you can actually train people
to make the right brainwaves,
and that's another piece of research
that they feel very proud of
'cause it's very hard
to find funding for it
that we really showed that
we can change people's brain
and brain connections by
playing computer games again
for your own brain, which
is another important project
that I'm working on
and trying to implement in
the various communities.
And also I did a study
of foster care children
who are extremely outta control kids
who have no prognosis to
probably ever function very well
because they're just too
disorganized and too hurt.
And we did very well with
neurofeedback to help
to calm their brains down and to learn
and to be in classrooms
and to have friends.
So there's all these things that
at this point they're
still called alternatives.
That unless we go there,
our patients continue get
stuck on not getting better.
You have to keep looking.
(graphics swooshing)
About 15 years ago, two
guys came to talk to me,
Rick Dolbin and Michael Mithoefer,
and they said, Bessel, so
you know a lot about trauma.
What do you think about this idea?
We are thinking about psychedelics.
What do you think about
psychedelics for trauma?
And I go like, wow, that
you're speaking from my heart
because of course I'm a child of the '60s
and like everybody else who
I know who grew up with me,
we dabbled in LSD and
psychedelic substances.
I have a number of friends
who are very well known
scientists actually,
and I asked my, have
asked all of my friends,
did you top acid as a
college student also?
And every one of my
friends said, "sure did".
And I said, how do you think
it has affected your career?
And everyone of my friends says, you know,
I think I've become the creative scientist
that I am because I took these substances
because it allowed me
to see that the reality
that I was raised in that the reality
that I see is a very small part
of the overall reality that there is.
Those sort of answers
make me feel very curious
because one thing that all of us who
who know about trauma know is
that when you get traumatized,
you start living in a very narrow reality.
The reality of the war in Iraq.
The reality of your incest
that colors everything you do.
And so you become
intellectually and emotionally
quite a constricted person
because you are always afraid to get hurt
and you still feel like
I'm about to get hurt again
so that becomes your world.
I said to them, wouldn't it be great
if you could do psychedelic substances
to see if these substances
can open up people's minds
and to see that the
reality that they live in
is just a small part of
the reality that there is?
And then I said, don't do it.
You're crazy. These drugs are illegal.
I knew a whole bunch of people who did LSD
and psilocybin research
back when I was young.
It helps to be around a little bit
because I saw that revolution back then.
I had Timothy Leary's offices at Harvard
for a period of time.
I know what happened to all these guys.
I said to Rick and Michael, "Don't do it.
It will destroy your career.
You'll never get permission."
And they said, "thank you
very much for your opinion,
we'll try it anyway."
And they try it anyway, and
through great challenges
and lawsuits, etcetera,
they got permission
to do a study of MDMA for trauma
and it worked out pretty well.
And they got permission to
do a second study, again.
Very hard to do, and they did very well.
And then Rick Dolbin was able to collect
a large amount of money,
largely from Silicon Valley people
to do a very large and extremely
expensive study of MDMA,
also known as ecstasy or molly.
When that happened,
they asked me if I wanted to
be the principal investigator
of one of the sites; the sites in Boston.
And I said, boy, I admire you so much
for having been able to get
the study off the ground,
I would love to see what it does,
but the main reason why I want
to be involved in the
study is to warn people
not to get carried away
'cause last time people got carried away
and the whole world collapsed.
And this time we need
to be extremely careful
so that if we find something,
we do it very carefully
and we don't get the backlash.
We did the study, lots of
different sites around the us,
one in Israel, one in Canada.
We saw remarkable results.
The paper was published.
Nature Medicine, very
prestigious medical journal,
that shows that the MDMA caused a very,
very substantial drop in PTSD.
Probably more than just about
anything else we have studied,
although I'm not 100% sure
of that, but very dramatic.
And then what comes up for me is, yeah,
you know the PTSD score is interesting,
but what we see in the people we work
with is much more profound than just PTSD.
So let me tell you how
the study is set up.
People apply to be in a study.
It's a very tough study to be in.
It takes about nine months to do it.
You come in, you get tested up the wazoo.
You go off all your medications.
You do a lot of tests.
You have a number of preparatory sessions,
and then finally, after
all the preparation,
you have a whole day of taking
ecstasy while you lie on
the bed with the eye shade
with two therapists in
your room for eight hours.
And then stuff happens, which
I'll talk about in a second.
You sort of calm down from the experience,
you stay overnight, the next
day we interview people again.
We interview people
several times in between.
You have your next experience,
a month later number
essentially in between,
and you have your next experience again.
It's not surprising that our control group
where people get an inactive
substance also do very well
because people get very
intensive psychotherapy
alongside of the drug.
So half people get drug, half
people don't get the drug.
But what we see in the people
who get the drug is amazing.
What we see is that people are able to go
to places they have
never felt safe to go to.
This is not a picnic.
People go and see their rape,
they see their molestation,
they see the horrible things
that happened to them,
but what MDMA does, it allows
people to see themselves
with compassion and rather them blaming
themselves or getting freaked out.
They go like, oh yeah, that's
what happened to me back then.
It was horrible.
But what we see is a
profound transformation
of the personality, not just PTSD.
And so I was very lucky
that the organization
asked me to analyze the- what
is called the secondary data,
which I'm doing right now.
And the secondary data are, wow,
they're just manner for my soul.
It's like because it brings
the mind back into psychiatry.
After people take MDMA,
they're able to talk about themselves,
they're able to have
compassion for themselves.
They're much better able to say,
this is what's going on with me.
And so all these measures we
have about self-perception
and self-awareness just shoot up
and people become owners
of their own lives
and they're able to say, yes,
this what happened to me, but it's over.
And then we look at the whole issue of
executive functioning,
being able to make plans,
being able to attune to other people,
being able to feel alive.
Big changes. People could come to life.
And when people are in
difficult relationships,
they say, honey, that's your problem.
That's not my problem.
And people sometimes
leave abusive relationship
and they say, I don't need
this abusive relationship.
I'm okay. I can take care of myself.
And you see very profound existential
transformations in people,
and I think that's really at the end
holds the promise that people
can leave the trauma behind
and not say, I'm a veteran
who still screwed up.
Yes, I was a veteran back
then, I was 18 years-old,
but today I'm 23 years-old
or 48 years-old or 60;
and I'm a plumber, an electrician,
a movie maker, whatever.
And that's part of my experience,
but it doesn't define who I am anymore.
It's remarkable.
(gentle music)
(beep)
That’s good.
