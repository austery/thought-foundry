We
 are
 witnessing
 the
 most
 sophisticated


act
 of
 financial
 engineering
 of
 the
 21st


century.
 Billions
 of
 dollars
 move
 in


circles,
 valuations
 rise,
 debts
 vanish


from
 balance
 sheets,
 and
 the
 bubble


keeps
 inflating.
 2008
 had
 mortgages.


2025
 has
 GPUs.
 It
 looks
 like
 a
 Ponzi


scheme.
 It
 trades
 like
 a
 bubble.
 And


yet,
 this
 is
 the
 system
 that
 allows
 more


people
 than
 ever
 to
 become


entrepreneurs.
 By
 the
 end
 of
 this
 video,


you
 will
 understand
 exactly
 how


financial
 engineering
 built
 the
 modern


AI
 economy
 and
 see
 for
 yourself
 whether


the
 bubble
 is
 about
 to
 burst.
 Let's
 dive


in.


About
 2
 weeks
 ago,
 Bloomberg
 released
 an


article
 about
 the
 web
 of
 circular
 deals


shaping
 the
 AI
 infrastructure
 market.


Highly
 recommend
 giving
 it
 a
 read.
 It


sparked
 a
 lot
 of
 attention
 across
 all


tech
 community
 and
 media.
 But
 when
 you


start
 following
 the
 money,
 something


strange
 starts
 to
 appear.
 The
 same
 names


keep
 repeating.
 Investing
 in
 each
 other,


buying
 from
 each
 other,
 and
 reporting


explosive
 growth
 in
 the
 process
 of
 while


they're
 buying
 from
 each
 other.
 But
 when


you
 zoom
 out,
 all
 of
 those
 lines,
 every


connection,
 every
 dollar
 lead
 back
 to


one
 company,
 Nvidia.


Nvidia
 will
 invest
 up
 to
 $100
 billion
 in


OpenAI.
 Why?
 Because
 then
 OpenAI
 uses


that
 money
 to
 buy
 Nvidia's
 chips.
 It's


like
 if
 you're
 running
 a
 chocolate
 shop


and
 you
 give
 your
 friend
 $100
 and
 be


like,
 "Can
 you
 come
 to
 my
 shop
 and
 spend


this
 money
 at
 my
 store?"
 OpenAI
 inks
 a


$300
 billion
 cloud
 deal
 with
 Oracle.


Oracle
 desperately
 wants
 to
 compete
 with


Amazon
 and
 Microsoft
 in
 cloud
 services.


Landing
 OpenAI
 as
 a
 customer
 gives
 them


instant
 credibility
 in
 AI.
 Oracle
 gets


massive
 revenue
 and
 AI
 market
 presence


and
 in
 turn
 openai
 gets
 cloud


infrastructure
 without
 upfront
 costs.


NVIDIA
 buys
 $6.3
 billion
 of
 cloud


services
 from
 Coreeave.
 Nvidia
 already


owns
 7%
 of
 Coreeave.
 By
 buying
 6.3


billion
 in
 services
 from
 a
 company
 they


partially
 own,
 they're
 essentially


paying
 themselves.
 OpenAI
 to
 pay


Coreeave
 as
 much
 as
 $22.4
 billion.


OpenAI
 needs
 massive
 computing
 power,


but
 it
 doesn't
 want
 to
 build
 its
 own


data
 centers.
 Coreeave
 provides
 Nvidia


powered
 cloud
 infrastructure
 to
 OpenAI.


OpenAI
 agrees
 to
 deploy
 billions
 of


dollars
 worth
 of
 AMD
 chips.
 AMD
 is


desperate
 to
 compete
 with
 Nvidia
 in
 AI


chips.
 They're
 literally
 giving
 OpenAI


10%
 of
 their
 company
 to
 secure
 them
 as
 a


customer.
 AMD
 gets
 a
 major
 AI
 customer,


definitely
 the
 most
 well-known
 one
 on


the
 planet,
 and
 OpenAI
 gets
 chips
 and


equity
 in
 AMD.
 They
 become
 part
 owners


of
 their
 supplier.
 Nvidia
 invests
 $5


billion
 in
 Intel
 and
 plans
 to
 co-develop


chips.
 Intel
 was
 Nvidia's
 enemy
 for
 30


plus
 years,
 but
 now
 Nvidia
 needs
 them


because
 they
 need
 their
 x86
 architecture


to
 expand
 beyond
 just
 the
 GPUs.
 And


lastly,
 the
 United
 States
 takes
 a
 15%


cut
 of
 Nvidia's
 and
 AMD
 chip
 sales
 to


China.
 And
 so
 instead
 of
 completely


banning
 chip
 sales
 to
 China,
 which
 would


hurt
 the
 US,
 the
 government
 takes
 a
 15%


cut
 of
 all
 China
 revenue.
 So
 think
 about


it.
 You've
 got
 billions
 flowing
 between


the
 same
 handful
 of
 companies.
 And
 the


deeper
 you
 go,
 the
 stranger
 it
 gets.


Every
 deal
 loops
 back
 into
 another
 deal.


The
 money
 is
 flowing
 in
 circles
 and
 each


transaction
 is
 feeding
 the
 next.
 On


paper,
 everybody's
 growing.
 In
 reality,


they're
 passing
 the
 same
 money
 between


the
 same
 players.
 And
 here
 is
 the
 thing.


This
 circular
 economy
 doesn't
 just


create
 fake
 demand,
 it
 hides
 the
 risk.


And
 the
 tool
 that
 makes
 it
 possible
 is


called
 the
 SPV.
 The
 special
 purpose


vehicle.


A
 special
 purpose
 vehicle
 or
 an
 SPV
 is
 a


subsidiary
 company
 created
 by
 a
 parent


company
 for
 a
 specific
 limited
 financial


objective.
 Its
 primary
 purpose
 is
 to


protect
 the
 parent
 company
 from
 the


liabilities
 of
 a
 particular
 project
 or


transaction.
 In
 the
 AI
 market,
 it
 is


estimated
 that
 there
 is
 approximately


$24
 billion
 in
 debt.
 And
 of
 the
 $24


billion
 in
 debt,
 49
 is
 completely
 hidden


from
 balance
 sheets.
 The
 special
 purpose


vehicles
 are
 being
 heavily
 used
 in
 the


AI
 infrastructure
 market
 because
 they


serve
 as
 financial
 chameleons
 because


they
 make
 the
 corporate
 debt
 disappear


from
 the
 balance
 sheets
 of
 the
 companies


that
 actually
 control
 and
 benefit
 from


these
 structures.
 One
 of
 the
 most


striking
 examples
 is
 the
 XAI's
 $20


billion
 financial
 structure.
 Here's
 how


it
 works.
 Elon
 Musk's
 AI
 startup
 called


XAI
 is
 raising
 $20
 billion
 to
 build
 out


the
 next
 generation
 AI
 supercomputer


code
 named
 Colossus
 2.
 Main
 investor,


you
 guessed
 it,
 Nvidia.
 The
 funding


round
 combines
 $7.5
 billion
 in
 equity


and
 $12.5
 billion
 in
 debt,
 but
 instead


of
 direct
 investment,
 all
 of
 the
 money


is
 being
 funneled
 through
 an
 SPV.
 Who
 do


you
 think
 is
 the
 largest
 beneficiary
 of


this
 deal?
 Nvidia.
 Why?
 Let's
 break
 it


down
 step
 by
 step.


If
 you
 optimize
 for
 deep
 work
 and


practical
 spending,
 Flexaspot
 gets
 it


right.
 Flexaspot's
 whole
 bet
 is
 simple.


Make
 ergonomic
 work
 setups
 durable
 and


affordable.
 The
 company's
 building


furniture
 and
 tools
 that
 help
 people


work
 healthier
 and
 longer.
 They
 ship
 a


full
 system
 of
 ergonomic
 office


furniture,
 standing
 desks,
 converters,


chairs,
 even
 cable
 and
 power


accessories,
 so
 you
 can
 upgrade
 a
 home


office
 or
 a
 small
 team
 with
 minimal


setup.
 Flexis
 Spot
 leans
 into
 clean,


minimalist
 design
 and
 sustainable


materials.
 The
 desk
 I'm
 using
 is
 the
 E7


Pro
 Premium.
 It's
 wide
 enough
 to
 fit


several
 monitors.
 The
 sittost
 stand


transition
 is
 smooth
 and
 quiet,
 and
 the


frame
 feels
 planted
 even
 at
 full
 height.


No
 wobble
 while
 typing
 or
 whether
 you're


on
 camera.
 Controls
 are
 straightforward.


A
 small
 keypad
 with
 presets
 so
 you
 can


hop
 between
 your
 preferred
 heights
 on


autopilot.
 There
 is
 a
 built-in
 cable


tray
 and
 a
 magnetic
 cover
 which
 means


power
 bricks
 and
 loose
 cords
 actually


disappear.
 You
 can
 pick
 the
 top
 to
 match


your
 office
 space.
 They
 come
 in
 a


variety
 of
 sizes
 and
 finishes
 while


keeping
 a
 minimal
 and
 modern
 look
 that


blends
 into
 any
 office.
 The
 standing


desk
 and
 specifically
 the
 electric


parts,
 frame,
 motor,
 controller,
 and


switch,
 and
 electronics
 all
 come
 with
 a


15-year
 warranty.
 This
 desk
 really


becomes
 a
 long-term
 asset
 in
 your


office.
 Flexispot
 operates
 in
 North


America,
 European
 Union,
 and
 some


countries
 in
 the
 Asia-Pacific
 region.
 If


you're
 looking
 for
 a
 quality
 workspace


and
 want
 a
 stable,
 reliable
 standing


desk,
 the
 E7
 Pro
 Premium
 is
 the
 best


value
 for
 your
 money.
 It's
 built
 for


real
 work,
 not
 just
 a
 nice
 photo.

 Huge


thanks
 to
 Flexispot
 for
 sponsoring
 this


part
 of
 the
 video.
 We
 absolutely
 love


this
 desk
 and
 we'll
 be
 using
 it
 in
 our


future
 filming
 setups.


Step
 one,
 XAI
 creates
 a
 shell
 company
 or


an
 SPV.
 XAI
 does
 not
 raise
 money


directly.
 They
 use
 their
 SPV
 as
 a


middleman
 that
 only
 exists
 to
 receive


money
 from
 investors.
 Step
 two,
 the


Shell
 Company
 raises
 $20
 billion.
 Like
 I


said,
 7.5
 billion
 from
 investors,
 12.5


billion
 borrowed
 money,
 meaning
 debt.


Nvidia
 invests
 $2
 billion
 and
 the
 rest


comes
 from
 smaller
 investors.
 Of
 all
 of


the
 invested
 money,
 Nvidia
 owns
 2


billion.
 The
 rest
 comes
 from
 smaller


investors.
 Step
 number
 three,
 the
 Shell


company
 buys
 GPUs.
 The
 SPV
 uses
 all
 of


the
 $20
 billion
 to
 buy
 Nvidia's
 chips.


Important.
 It
 is
 not
 the
 XAI
 that
 owns


the
 chips.
 It's
 the
 SPV.
 Step
 number


four.
 XAI
 rents
 the
 GPUs
 from
 its
 own


SPV.
 They
 sign
 a
 5-year
 lease
 to
 rent


their
 own
 GPUs
 from
 the
 SPV
 and
 pay


monthly
 or
 quarterly
 payments.
 And
 the


Shell
 company
 essentially
 becomes
 the


GPU
 rental
 business.
 Step
 number
 five,


everybody
 wins.
 XAI
 gets
 access
 to
 20


billion
 worth
 of
 GPUs
 without
 debt
 on


their
 books.
 Nvidia
 gets
 $20
 billion
 in


guaranteed
 GPU
 sales
 plus
 the
 $2
 billion


that
 they
 invested.
 That's
 equity.
 Other


investors
 get
 steady
 rental
 income


secured
 by
 physical
 GPUs
 and
 debt


holders
 get
 interest
 payments
 backed
 by


valuable
 hardware.
 And
 the
 reason
 why


this
 works
 for
 all
 parties
 involved
 is


because
 XAI
 can
 claim
 we're
 not
 raising


capital,
 which
 is
 true
 because
 the
 SPV


raised
 it,
 not
 XAI.
 The
 12.2
 billion


debt
 does
 not
 appear
 on
 XAI's
 balance


sheet.
 XAI
 only
 shows
 rental
 expenses,


not
 the
 massive
 debt.
 And
 now
 let's
 come


back
 to
 the
 circular
 web
 that
 Bloomberg


reported.
 Nvidia
 invests
 $2
 billion.
 SPV


uses
 it
 to
 buy
 Nvidia's
 chips.
 Nvidia


gets
 sales
 revenue
 and
 also
 don't
 forget


about
 the
 risk.
 If
 XAI
 fails,
 the
 SPV


investors
 are
 stuck
 with
 depreciating


GPUs.
 But
 XAI
 comes
 out
 clean.
 The
 debt


is
 secured
 by
 hardware
 that
 can
 very


much
 become
 obsolete
 fairly
 quickly.
 And


we
 know
 this
 because
 GPU's
 rental
 rates


have
 already
 dropped
 75%
 in
 some


markets.
 Let
 me
 put
 this
 in
 perspective


and
 give
 you
 an
 analogy
 that
 we
 have


seen
 before.
 And
 the
 closest
 I
 can
 think


of
 is
 actually
 the
 synthetic
 CDOS's
 from


2008.
 The
 current
 financial
 state
 of
 the


AI
 market
 has
 created
 a
 2008
 synthetic


CDOS,
 but
 instead
 of
 mortgages,
 we
 got


GPUs.
 Just
 think
 about
 it
 for
 a
 second.


Let's
 recall
 what
 caused
 the
 2008


collapse.
 In
 simple
 terms,
 John
 bought
 a


house
 that
 cost
 $200,000
 and
 he
 took
 a


mortgage
 from
 bank
 A.
 Bank
 A
 now
 has
 J's


promise
 to
 pay
 the
 $200,000
 plus


interest.
 Bank
 A
 takes
 J's
 mortgage
 and


a
 ton
 of
 other
 mortgages,
 packages
 them


into
 a
 mortgage
 bundle
 one
 and
 calls
 it


an
 MBS.
 Then
 bank
 A
 sells
 shares
 of
 this


bundle
 to
 investor
 B
 for
 $200
 million.


Now
 investor
 B
 owns
 a
 piece
 of
 the


mortgages
 that
 were
 in
 that
 bundle.


Investment
 bank
 C
 takes
 mortgage
 bundle


one
 and
 nine
 other
 mortgage
 bundles
 and


creates
 a
 super
 bundle.
 Let's
 call
 it


super
 bundle
 number
 one.
 And
 that
 super


bundle
 contains
 10,000
 mortgages.
 And


then
 they
 sell
 it
 to
 pension
 fund
 D
 for


$2
 billion.
 And
 now
 that
 pension
 fund
 D


owns
 a
 ton
 of
 mortgages
 including


John's.
 And
 this
 is
 where
 we
 move
 to
 the


most
 dangerous
 part.
 The
 artificial
 cos


hedge
 fund
 E
 creates
 bets
 on
 the
 super


bundle
 number
 one
 without
 owning
 it
 and


this
 becomes
 a
 superficial
 CDO.
 They


start
 selling
 insurance
 on
 super
 bundle


number
 one
 to
 five
 different
 investors


and
 the
 result
 is
 that
 John's
 $200,000


house
 is
 now
 riding
 on
 $1.2
 million
 in


bets.
 And
 now
 map
 this
 to
 the
 2025
 AI


bubble.
 AI
 infrastructure
 companies


create
 GPUs.
 They
 then
 offer
 finances


and
 investments
 to
 customers
 to
 buy


their
 GPUs.
 Customers
 create
 SPVS
 backed


by
 the
 GPUs
 and
 then
 their
 SPVS
 issue


more
 debt
 to
 buy
 more
 GPUs.
 What
 this


essentially
 means
 is
 that
 multiple


financial
 instruments
 are
 betting
 on
 the


same
 GPU
 demand
 and
 the
 entire
 risk
 is


placed
 on
 a
 piece
 of
 hardware
 that
 can


very
 much
 depreciate.
 The
 whole
 industry


is
 betting
 on
 the
 fact
 that
 we
 need
 more


GPUs.
 That
 was
 the
 US
 loop.
 But
 there
 is


a
 second
 even
 more
 complex
 loop,
 the


geographic
 one.
 Let's
 come
 back
 to
 the


graph
 and
 see
 how
 far
 it
 spreads.
 Where


are
 all
 these
 companies
 based?
 US,
 US,


US,
 mostly
 US,
 France,
 but
 that's


Mistrol.
 Makes
 sense.
 And
 the


Netherlands,
 Nebus.


What
 about
 Nebus?
 Nebus
 is
 an
 AIcentric


cloud
 platform
 ready
 for
 intense


workloads
 and
 full
 stack
 infrastructure


for
 AI.
 Hold
 up.
 Wouldn't
 they
 be


Nvidia's
 competitor?
 Yes.
 But


remember
 the
 good
 old
 rule.
 If
 you
 can't


beat
 them,
 join
 them.
 Nebus
 is
 Nvidia's


European
 representative.
 And
 if
 you


study
 them
 closely,
 you
 will
 see
 that


there
 is
 a
 sophisticated
 legal


workaround
 that
 takes
 advantage
 of
 the


regulatory
 geography.
 When
 it
 comes
 to


AI,
 especially
 given
 the
 current


geopolitical
 situation,
 location
 is


everything.
 And
 in
 many
 ways,
 the
 US


itself
 has
 created
 a
 three-
 tiered


system
 for
 AI
 chip
 exports
 that
 creates


massive
 advantage
 for
 companies
 in
 the


right
 locations.
 Tier
 one,
 unlimited


access.
 All
 US
 allies,
 including
 the


European
 Union,
 UK,
 Canada,
 Australia,


Israel,
 and
 Japan.
 Restrictions,
 none,


can
 buy
 H100s,
 H200s,
 and
 the
 future


Blackwell
 GBUs.
 The
 company
 in
 question,


Nibbius,
 is
 headquartered
 in
 Amsterdam,


which
 means
 tier
 one
 access.
 Tier
 2


countries,
 limited
 access.
 India,


Brazil,
 UAE,
 Saudi
 Arabia,
 and
 most


other
 countries
 that
 are
 not
 heavily


sanctioned.
 Restrictions,
 listen


closely.
 Maximum
 of
 50,000
 H100
 GBUs.


Put
 a
 pin
 on
 this.
 I'll
 come
 back
 to
 it.


This
 is
 important.
 And
 lastly,
 tier


three
 countries
 that
 are
 severely


restricted
 and
 sanctioned.
 And
 you


guessed
 it,
 China,
 Russia,
 North
 Korea,


and
 Iran.
 Restrictions
 only
 downgraded


chips.
 H20s
 instead
 of
 H100s,
 H800s


instead
 of
 H200s.
 Nvidia,
 as
 an
 American


company,
 must
 comply
 with
 American
 laws.


But
 they're
 not
 going
 to
 miss
 out
 on


this
 entire
 chunk.
 So,
 what
 did
 they
 do?


They
 partnered
 with
 Nebas.
 And
 here
 is


how
 Nebus,
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 say
 the
 word


exploit
 because
 they're
 not
 really


exploiting.
 They're
 using
 the
 system


that
 lets
 them
 do
 this.
 So
 this
 is
 how


Nebius
 and
 Nvidia's
 schema
 works.
 Nebus


operates
 from
 Amsterdam,
 tier
 one


location,
 unrestricted
 access
 to
 the


world's
 most
 advanced
 AI
 chips.
 Nebus


buys
 Nvidia's
 chips.
 This
 creates
 a


legal
 way
 for
 Nebius
 to
 circumvent


export
 controls
 and
 sell
 AI
 power
 to


tier
 three
 markets,
 which
 let
 me
 remind


tier
 three
 markets
 contain
 two
 of
 the


largest
 countries
 on
 the
 planet.
 Chinese


companies
 or
 any
 other
 tier
 three


country
 cannot
 buy
 H100s
 directly,
 but


they
 can
 use
 Nebia's
 cloud
 services
 for


tier
 2
 countries.
 And
 let's
 come
 back
 to


that
 pin.
 Remember
 when
 I
 said
 that
 they


get
 up
 to
 50,000
 GPUs?
 You
 may
 ask,
 is


50,000
 a
 lot?
 It
 is
 enormous.


50,000
 H100s
 is
 more
 AI
 computing
 power


than
 most
 countries
 will
 ever
 need.
 The


next
 logical
 question
 would
 be,
 so
 why


does
 Nebus
 model
 work?
 If
 50,000
 units


is
 more
 than
 a
 country
 will
 ever
 need,


why
 buy
 from
 Nebus?
 Because
 countries


hit
 the
 GPU
 limit,
 not
 because
 50k
 is


not
 enough,
 but
 because
 building
 and


operating
 AI
 infra
 requires
 massive


capital,
 expertise,
 and
 ongoing


operational
 costs
 and
 capacity
 that
 most


nations
 cannot
 or
 will
 not
 have.
 Then


Nvidia
 invests
 $700
 million
 in
 Nebus
 in


December
 2024.
 No,
 it
 is
 not
 the
 largest


investment,
 but
 through
 this


partnership,
 Nvidia
 provides
 priority


access
 to
 latest
 high
 performance
 GPUs


and
 Nebus
 starts
 distributing
 AI


compute.
 And
 coming
 back
 to
 the


Bloomberg's
 diagram,
 this
 deal
 fits


right
 into
 the
 circular
 flow.
 Nvidia


invests,
 Nebius
 buys
 Nvidia's
 chips,


Nvidia
 profits
 twice.
 On
 top
 of
 it,
 they


create
 market
 access
 to
 restricted


customers
 through
 European
 or
 Middle


Eastern
 cloud
 services.
 They
 generate


revenue
 from
 both
 chip
 sales
 and
 equity


appreciation.
 They
 bypass
 export


controls
 without
 violating
 a
 single
 law.


I
 mean,
 say
 what
 you
 will,
 but
 this
 is


genius.
 Again,
 to
 put
 this
 in


perspective
 and
 give
 you
 a
 more
 familiar


analogy,
 imagine
 the
 US
 government
 said


Americans
 can
 buy
 unlimited
 Ferrari


sport
 cars.
 Europeans
 can
 also
 buy


unlimited
 Ferraris.
 Middle
 Eastern


countries
 can
 only
 buy
 50
 Ferraris,
 but


Chinese
 can
 only
 buy
 Toyota
 Camry.
 And


then
 Nebia
 steps
 in
 and
 Nebas
 sets
 up
 a


European
 Ferrari
 rental
 company.
 They


get
 the
 Ferrari
 to
 invest
 in
 their


rental
 company.
 They
 buy
 Ferraris
 with


no
 restrictions
 because
 they
 are
 a


European
 company
 and
 then
 they
 start


renting
 them
 to
 restricted
 customers
 who


cannot
 buy
 directly
 from
 Ferrari.
 They


charge
 premium
 prices
 because
 they're


the
 only
 game
 in
 town
 and
 they
 use
 the


rental
 contracts
 as
 collateral
 to
 borrow


money
 for
 more
 Ferraris.
 And
 there
 you


go.
 Should
 have
 probably
 included
 this


into
 our
 billion-dollar
 ideas
 video.
 The


interesting
 thing
 is
 that
 Nebius,
 unlike


many
 others,
 does
 not
 have
 an
 SPV.
 Nebus


is
 actually
 a
 formidable
 independent


competitor
 that
 Nvidia
 chose
 to
 invest


in
 rather
 than
 compete
 against
 and
 there


is
 proof
 that
 it
 works.
 Microsoft's
 17.4


billion
 agreement
 with
 Nebius


demonstrates
 the
 power
 of
 this


arbitrage.
 The
 reason
 why
 Microsoft
 uses


Nebus
 instead
 of
 building
 their
 own
 data


centers
 is
 because
 Nebus
 guarantees


faster
 deployment,
 lower
 capital


investments,
 regulatory
 compliance,
 and


risk
 transfer.
 And
 the
 best
 part
 is
 that


Microsoft
 isn't
 stuck
 with
 depreciating


assets.
 And
 the
 circular
 benefit
 comes


into
 play
 again.
 Microsoft
 pays
 Nebia


17.4
 billion.
 Nebus
 buys
 Nvidia's
 GPUs.


Nvidia
 profits
 from
 both
 chip
 sales
 and


equity
 stake
 in
 Nebas.
 This
 is
 why


Nvidia
 is
 in
 the
 very
 middle
 of
 this


whole
 web.
 Nvidia
 benefits
 from
 its
 own


restrictions.
 The
 three-
 tiered
 system


that
 the
 US
 has
 created
 stimulates
 a


regulatory
 arbitrage
 and
 in
 this


arbitrage,
 the
 location
 matters
 more


than
 the
 technology
 itself.
 Expert


controls
 that
 appear
 to
 hurt
 Nvidia
 in


fact
 increase
 demand
 for
 Nvidia's


products
 because
 they
 create
 artificial


scarcity
 and
 that
 drives
 premium


pricing.
 The
 Nebus
 or
 the
 European


representative
 model
 is
 actually


spreading.
 G42
 the
 UEE
 based
 where
 I


actually
 applied
 for
 a
 job
 a
 couple
 of


years
 ago
 serves
 the
 Middle
 Eastern


market
 and
 there
 are
 many
 more
 NeoCloud


companies
 that
 now
 position
 themselves


as
 regional
 gateways.
 And
 this


financially
 engineered
 system
 where
 you


have
 a
 combination
 of
 expert
 controls,


SPV
 financing,
 and
 circular
 investments


create
 a
 self-reinforcing
 system
 where


geography
 gets
 leveraged
 into
 massive


financial
 returns.
 The
 bubble
 is
 indeed


forming
 and
 it's
 growing
 day
 by
 day.


Which
 leads
 me
 to
 my
 final
 question.


Will
 it
 burst?
 After
 studying
 lots
 of


data
 related
 to
 this
 topic,
 it
 does
 seem


like
 the
 bubble
 conditions
 are
 more


extreme
 than
 in
 any
 previous
 technology


cycle.
 And
 the
 pinnacle
 of
 all
 of
 this


is
 that
 the
 GPU
 demand
 is
 largely


artificial
 because
 AI
 has
 not
 proven
 to


be
 profitable.
 Productivity
 does
 not


equal
 profitability.
 20%
 of
 US
 adults


use
 Chad
 GBT,
 but
 enterprise
 AI
 ROI


averages
 only
 6%.
 80%
 of
 companies


report
 no
 significant
 bottomline
 impact


from
 AI.
 95%
 of
 Genaii
 pilots
 fail
 to


reach
 production.
 Developers
 are
 not


becoming
 extinct.
 Yes,
 the
 entry-
 level


market
 is
 very
 difficult
 right
 now,
 but


it's
 due
 to
 two
 factors.
 post-pandemic


overhiring
 correction
 and
 because


seniors
 have
 indeed
 become
 more


productive.
 But
 GitHub
 copilot
 numbers


confirm
 that
 the
 increase
 in


productivity
 is
 very
 small.
 A
 ton
 of


examples
 of
 companies
 with
 unprofitable


business
 models,
 no
 moes,
 risks
 to
 be


wiped
 out
 the
 moment
 the
 foundational


company
 releases
 a
 native
 product.
 There


has
 never
 been
 so
 much
 money
 spent
 on


technology
 with
 unproven
 profits.


This
 creates
 a
 massive
 paradox
 and
 the


paradox
 is
 that
 even
 though
 it
 looks


like
 a
 bubble.
 Even
 though
 parts
 of
 it


trade
 like
 a
 Ponzi
 scheme,
 the
 AI


infraarket
 will
 definitely
 deflate
 and


balance
 itself
 out.
 There
 has
 never
 been


a
 better
 time
 to
 build
 a
 technology


product.
 These
 are
 mad
 times
 we
 live
 in.


Absolutely
 mad.
 As
 always,
 I
 do
 not
 mean


to
 criticize
 anybody.
 My
 goal
 is
 to


deeply
 research
 and
 truly
 understand


what's
 happening.
 And
 I
 really
 hope
 that


this
 video
 gave
 you
 a
 little
 bit
 more


clarity
 in
 terms
 of
 what
 happens
 in
 the


financial
 engineering
 behind
 the
 AI


market.
 Would
 love
 to
 hear
 your


feedback.
 Thanks
 for
 listening.
 Until


next
 time.
 Bye.
