Hello everyone, I am Anthony
Welcome to my channel
Originally, today's video
I want to continue talking about Yangming's philosophy of mind and Chinese culture.
This thread has been delayed for two weeks.
Many netizens also urged me to remind
But because I recently caught up
The season for applying for college entrance examination in China
Many people ask me questions about this.
So I want to add a video temporarily
Talk about the academic and career planning of Chinese college students
Of course, we explore the depth
It's not limited to these very specific topics.
And more with the help of this topic
To explore a more universal philosophy of life
Before the video starts, let me say
If you have anything you want to discuss with me
And consulting topics
You can contact my email to make an appointment
So let's get back to today's topic.
first
Among the students I have met recently
Almost everyone is very confused and anxious
They face a vast number of university majors.
and complex employment situation
I also feel very powerless
This is of course due to the deterioration of the overall environment.
In the past, the industry relied on real estate and high-intensity manufacturing.
and infrastructure investment
The economic growth model driven by
It is foreseeable that
China's economic and employment situation
It's bad in the short term.
In this context of increasing uncertainty
Predict so-called employment hotspots and popular majors
It became an almost impossible thing.
To combat this uncertainty,
More and more families and candidates
Instinctively choose a strategy that enhances planning
They tend to
Designing a more clear and closed future
For example, "I want to take the civil service exam in the future"
"I want to enter the system" and "take the exam"
Once this goal is established
They will focus on this goal
To deploy all resources
So we see
Some majors have become extremely popular——
For example, Chinese language and literature, law, administrative management, etc.
These majors
Not performing well in the job market
But they are more likely to enter the system
Being sought after
Many people also choose teaching majors, medical majors,
Police schools, military schools, and other schools with certain "organizational" attributes
More and more universities are moving towards
The development direction of civil service examination and postgraduate examination training institutions
For example, the famous Qufu Normal University
As this article says
The author arrived at Qufu Normal University on his first day
I saw the banner of the Chemistry Department.
It says
Warm congratulations to the Department of Chemistry for having a postgraduate entrance examination rate of over 70%
The author himself
I could have applied to a better school.
But it's also because I heard
This university has a high admission rate.
So I chose this place
It is said that many students start preparing since their freshman year.
They even work harder than the seniors
I go to the library at 4 o'clock every morning to reserve a seat
For example
Southwest University once opened a course called Civil Service
This major offers official document writing.
Official communication and etiquette, administrative ability test,
Courses on emotional management and mental health for public servants
This completely equates university with a training class for civil service exams.
Of course, in recent years
Chinese universities
It was originally moving towards maintaining stability,
Development in the direction of high school
More universities
Start recording attendance by taking roll call, etc.
Students are required to attend morning and evening self-study, morning reading, and morning exercises
After the students finished their morning exercises
You also need to upload screenshots or photos to the system
The administrative management system of colleges and universities is becoming increasingly rigid.
For example, this article says
In a university
A student wants to take a leave
Actually, a deputy monitor is needed. After the counselors approve it in turn,
To succeed
As
What we said in the video last May
Many universities
Although slow to address the real problem
However, in terms of maintaining stability, a set of
Efficient and skilled coping strategies
Students' living conditions are increasingly neglected
Schools increasingly view students as a
Pure resources and objects of control
Rather than a subject with an independent personality
But it is conceivable that
This management strategy of Chinese universities
actually
It is welcomed by many parents and students.
Because this also caters to
They desire more psychological needs for certainty
However
In an era of increasing uncertainty
Is increasing planning a reliable strategy?
On the surface
It is a rational choice to fight against uncertainty
But in an environment like China
It's just a reliance on pseudo-certainty.
Because if you look at history you will know
There are no truly stable industries or professions in China
This stems from its social structure and the way the country is governed.
Very sporty
This system
Does not provide real institutional stability
Those paths that seem to be the "optimal solution" today
Often when policy direction and power structure change
Rapid depreciation
Even reverse to the most risky option
We don't need to list the history of the Mao era
It can be inferred from common sense alone
Those paths that seem to be highly certain
Soon we will face institutional saturation
For example, more and more people are taking the civil service exam
The landing rate will become lower and lower
This will inevitably lead to a gradual decline in income
Narrow promotion space
Most people still have to experience compression,
The process of marginalization
In fact, many in China
Paths that are generally considered to be highly certain
Not a very long history
But only in the past 20 years
Even the concept that has only emerged in the past 10 years
Then it is certainly not natural.
So
What can combat uncertainty?
What about truly stable capital?
We say
In an era of rapid change
Really stable capital
It must be based on one's own mind.
Traditional capital
Such as education, certificates, assets, etc.
This may be due to policy changes and technological changes
Depreciation
But human mental abilities, inner resources
For example, critical thinking ability, mind reading ability
The ability to regulate emotions,
The ability to empathize with and cooperate with others
The ability to find and establish intimate relationships
This intangible capital
Intrinsic capital
It's not like education and money.
Can be directly quantified
But it is transferable across scenarios
and risk resistance
They can help individuals
In an era of ever-changing meaning
To reestablish the stability and continuity of personality
Academic qualifications can only be recognized under certain systems
But whether you are in China, the United States or Africa
The ability to understand and work with others is always effective
When faced with unemployment, bankruptcy and various unexpected blows
A person who is good at seeking intimacy and social support,
People with reflective and emotional regulation abilities
Often more than those who simply have education or wealth
Rebuild Yourself Faster
When life is in turmoil
The biggest dilemma is often not survival itself
It is the disintegration of one's identity and sense of meaning in life.
Once we realize
Human mental abilities
It is the most stable and valuable capital in the face of turbulence.
We can use a new standard
Re-examining China’s university education
Traditional ideas
Always emphasize professional education, knowledge reserves,
Test scores are “quantifiable indicators”
I believe that the core value of a university is
"Imparting knowledge" and "Developing professional capabilities"
But university education is seriously out of touch with reality
At the same time, China's social structure is undergoing drastic changes
The practical utility of most professional knowledge
It is very delayed
Many university majors
Not only can it not help students adapt to the future
Instead, it consumes them
The time and energy that could have been used for free exploration
Really worth paying attention to
are more likely to support students' autonomous growth
A university environment that develops inner resources
A good university
I don't have to teach you anything.
But it should be as little as possible
Interferes with your growth and development
for example
If its administrative system could be more relaxed
Less bureaucracy and formalism
Less time for things like roll call, morning and evening self-study,
Complicated procedures such as leave approval
Then it is even more difficult
Causing you unnecessary psychological trauma
In simple terms
Good university
It is not reflected in how much benefit it can bring to us
And it is reflected in how much less harm it can bring to us
The standards for good professions should also be adjusted
Since I work hard in school, my GPA
It could be a complete waste of time and useless
Then we should make the future
Build on the part you have developed
A good professional
It does not necessarily have to be reflected in high employment rates and high incomes.
It should be less academic pressure,
Majors with easy exams and loose course schedules
Because this means
You can free up more time
Do things that are of real interest and importance
For example, read books that you are really interested in.
Attend lectures and courses that interest you more
Participate in social practice outside the school
Meet interesting and thoughtful people,
Learn to build high-quality relationships
These things
It is the foundation of your mental ability.
Although it doesn't seem to help you directly
Find a good job and make lots of money
but
For a complex goal like career planning,
Follow your interests and passions
Rather than developing a grand and detailed plan
To be more effective
I just happened to read a very good book recently.
The title is "Why Greatness Can't Be Planned:
A free exploration of creativity, innovation and creation
Many of the contents of this book
This is what we mentioned repeatedly in previous videos.
However, the author emphasizes the concept of stepping stones
Meaning
For a huge goal
We often have to go through very complicated paths
To achieve
These paths involve countless stepping stones
That is, some mediating variables
These mediating variables are initially
Not designed for the ultimate purpose
Even contrary to the ultimate goal
But later they
Unexpectedly became a springboard to the goal
For example, paleontology shows
Birds evolved from dinosaurs
Bird feathers come from primitive feathers on dinosaurs
But these feathers often had nothing to do with flight in the first place.
It's for warmth or courtship.
However, in the long history
It unexpectedly flew
Provides the basis for aerodynamics
if
We just keep our eyes on our ultimate goal.
You'll miss out on a lot of valuable things.
These things seem to have no value.
But it may be of great significance to your ultimate goal.
Play a kind of intermediary support role
Even without considering the grand example of biological evolution
For our college life and career path
Don't make overly detailed plans
It is also possible to remain open and flexible
The author also gives two examples
Say a lawyer
Keen on assembling various models with Lego bricks
Immersed in it all day
Finally decided to quit the job
Develop this hobby full time
This looks risky.
But follow your true passion
This enabled him to create more unique works
And it is very popular
It also allowed him to live a richer life.
Another person
Spend most of your time
Used to build Rube Goldberg machines
For example, in a device
A ball goes down the slope
Falling onto a lever
Lighted a fuse
Burned a rope
Released a ball
Finally helped him open the newspaper
This device can't do anything specific.
But it looks interesting
So it attracted millions of fans
I also mentioned this in the video on December 1 last year.
When I was in primary school
Lots of time to play with lots of toys
At that time
I often indulge in imagination and pretend play
These games seemed
Seems like a lot of time wasted
But when I grew up
I often feel
My memory is better than that of my peers.
This can be attributed to
Imagination and pretend play
Exercise children's empathy and projection abilities
This promotes the refinement of emotions
So we say
The kind of overly closed academic and career planning
Gradually losing its effect
This is because
Our plans and goals
Always based on current experience and information
It's bound to be imperfect
We cannot predict
To achieve what we define as a good life
Which variables are valuable?
We can only accumulate transferable capabilities while
Keep open enough
certainly
We will discuss this topic in detail later
on the other hand
When choosing a university and a major
We must also have a
Sensitivity and vigilance to psychological trauma
for example
Many people still mistakenly believe that
“The more rigorous a university is, the better”
“The higher the teacher’s expectations of students, the better”
Even think that strict attendance, frequent inspections,
Mandatory participation in activities
It is the school's responsibility
But in reality
These are often the source of trauma.
For example
Some parents think
School administrators have an obligation
Inform parents of all student information
For example, grades, entry and exit records, and psychological counseling status
etc.
Many schools want to take less responsibility.
Will do the same
But this is actually treating students as if they have no privacy
Individuals with independent personalities
This kind of information exchange between parents and schools
In fact, it makes students under long-term surveillance,
The status of being reviewed
They lose their most basic independent space
Many students
Seems to have suffered psychological trauma and crisis at school
But these crises
Often can be traced back to the family of origin
The school will use this information
Feedback to parents as is
In fact, it is equivalent to reactivating and amplifying the trauma.
This also led to many people spending four years in college.
I have lost a person who can think independently,
A psychological space for repair and reflection
They also fail to develop a true sense of self.
I have been living under the shadow of my parents.
so
On the one hand, we need to be wary of this system.
On the other hand, we must also be aware of privacy
Psychologically and parents
Keep enough distance from the school
Learn to hide and conceal
Don't show yourself without reservation
In addition to institutional trauma
Chinese universities
There is still a lot of hidden harm from interpersonal relationships
Because most students have interpersonal relationships
Such as roommates, classmates, partners
Many times
This is for the school's management purposes.
Results of random assignment and scheduling
The quality of these relationships
It was completely accidental, random.
But this psychological environment
But it has a greater impact than the physical environment
A person's living condition
We often see
Many students are in a very toxic environment.
For example, cold violence, isolation and exclusion between roommates
Sarcasm and verbal humiliation
This will cause great anxiety and internal consumption to a person.
More common is the superficial harmony
But there is an atmosphere of competition and hostility
Chinese culture does not encourage individuals to screen their relationships
Reselect the environment
Instead, it simply emphasizes that individuals must learn to adapt to the environment
Forcing two people who are not compatible to get together
The result is more psychological trauma.
Even if there is no major interpersonal conflict
But in a world lacking response,
The interpersonal environment of resonance and feedback
It will still make us think and explore
Very restricted
How to screen interpersonal relationships
We will discuss this later.
Overall
My judgment criteria are two:
The first is to what extent universities
It helps us develop our mental abilities
The second is
To what extent can institutional and interpersonal trauma be reduced?
A traumatic environment
No matter how rich the academic resources it provides
What a resounding title
It is impossible to be truly beneficial to our development
How to determine which schools or regions
More conducive to such growth
Although
The overall situation of Chinese universities is deteriorating
Commonalities outweigh differences
But relatively speaking
The private economy is developed, entrepreneurship is active,
Areas with a strong atmosphere of going abroad
More likely to be relatively open-minded
and a relaxed social ecology
In that class concept
Regions with greater government power
A humiliating management style is more likely to occur
