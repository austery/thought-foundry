>> She's
 a
 film
 executive.
 She's
 a


producer.
 She's
 the
 president
 of
 Orion


Pictures.
 She
 helps
 bring
 us
 films,


including
 American
 Fiction.
 Alana
 Mayo


stops
 by.
 We're
 going
 to
 be
 speaking
 to


her
 in
 just
 a
 minute.


>> Yeah,
 Ryan
 Pictures,
 man.
 They've
 been


around
 for
 a
 while.
 So
 interesting.


>> Different
 now,
 though,
 than
 than
 it
 was


in
 the
 1970s,


>> which
 is
 fascinating,
 right?
 You
 like
 to


see
 how
 these
 things
 change.
 Hey,
 also


billionaire
 real
 estate
 developer
 and


maybe
 LA
 mayoral
 candidate
 or
 maybe
 he


wants
 to
 be
 governor
 of
 the
 state
 of


California.
 Rick
 Caruso
 of
 Caruso
 is


going
 to
 be
 back
 with
 us.
 We're
 going
 to


ask
 him.
 We're
 going to
 push
 him.
 Last


time
 we
 talked
 with
 him,
 he
 was
 like,


"Maybe
 I'm
 going
 to
 have
 a
 decision
 or


announcement."
 So
 maybe
 he
 wants
 to
 do


it
 live
 with
 us
 on
 air.


>> Maybe.


>> Just
 saying.
 Maybe
 we're
 ready.


>> Let's
 do
 it.


>> Also,
 Yes
 Chef.


>> Yes,
 Chef.


>> Yes,
 Chef.


>> Yes,
 Chef.


>> We
 got
 the
 culinary
 producer
 of
 The
 Bear


stopping
 by.
 and
 also
 the
 youngest


female
 self-made
 billionaire
 in
 the


world
 joins
 us,
 Lucy
 Guo,
 co-founder.


>> My
 husband
 at
 home
 wants
 us
 to
 say
 yes


chef
 when
 he's
 cooking
 and
 we're
 like


not
 happening,
 honey.


>> Not
 happening.


>> Not
 happening.
 Hey,
 also
 the
 youngest


female
 self-made
 billionaire
 in
 the


world
 is
 with
 us.
 Um
 we've
 got
 uh
 Lucy


Gro,
 co-founder
 of
 Scale
 AI
 and
 founder


of
 Passes.
 She's
 going
 to
 be
 along
 as


well.
 So,
 she's
 a
 once
 to
 watch,
 isn't


she?


>> Yeah,
 she's
 here
 with
 us.
 She's
 right


here.


>> She
 is
 right
 here.


>> Yeah,
 she's
 coming
 by
 in
 like
 in
 like
 45


minutes.
 It's
 going
 to
 be
 great.
 Um,
 I


want
 to
 get
 to
 our
 next
 guest
 though


because
 we
 are
 in
 the
 heart
 of
 Hollywood


live
 at
 Bloomberg
 screen
 time
 in
 LA.


We're
 speaking
 to
 the
 folks
 who
 are


defining
 the
 next
 phase
 of
 pop
 culture


includes
 film
 and
 streaming.
 Alana
 Mayo


Mayo
 is
 with
 us.
 She
 thinks
 a
 lot
 about


these
 things
 streaming
 and
 traditional


releases
 probably
 simultaneously
 these


days
 which
 is
 like
 a
 little
 crazy
 of
 the


world
 that
 we
 live
 in.
 Uh,
 Orion


Pictures
 goes
 back
 to
 the
 late
 1970s.


>> Think
 Amadeas,
 Silence
 of
 the
 Lambs,
 and


more.
 It's
 different
 now
 though.
 Alana


joins
 us
 here
 at
 screen
 time.
 These


days,
 Orion
 focuses
 primarily
 on
 films


from
 underrepresented
 filmmakers.


Releases
 under
 her
 tenure
 include


American
 Fiction,
 Academy
 Award


nominated
 Nickel
 Boys,
 and
 many
 more.


And
 a
 lot
 coming
 on
 the
 horizon
 now,


too.
 Welcome.
 How
 are
 you?


>> Thank
 you.
 I'm
 very
 well.
 I'm
 happy
 to


be
 here.


>> Uh
 you
 just
 wrapped
 up
 this
 conversation


with
 Mark
 Duplos.
 We
 spoke
 to
 him
 a


little
 earlier.
 Uh
 also
 Katherine
 Oliver


as
 well
 for
 from
 Bloomberg.
 Uh
 she
 was


the
 former
 film
 commissioner
 of
 New
 York


City.
 The
 focus
 was
 on
 reinvigorating


the
 creative
 community.


How
 do
 you
 do
 it?


>> Just
 that
 small
 question.
 Um,


>> this
 is
 I
 mean
 this
 is
 the
 I
 just
 want


this
 is
 like
 the
 underlying
 theme
 of
 the


entire


how
 do
 we
 improve


>> and
 why
 are
 we
 here?


>> Well,
 I
 think
 we're
 here
 because
 we
 have


so
 much
 change
 and
 so
 dynam
 so
 much


dynamism
 and
 the
 reality
 is
 that
 no
 one


really
 knows
 what
 the
 next
 wave
 of
 media


content
 Hollywood
 is
 going
 to
 look
 like.


So
 we're
 at
 this
 incredible
 inflection


point
 and
 having
 to
 innovate
 in
 real


time
 and
 build
 new
 systems
 while
 the


previous
 systems
 are
 being
 dismantled,


are
 evolving,
 are
 changing.
 So
 um
 while


I
 wish
 I
 had
 a
 quick
 answer
 to
 your


question
 of
 how
 do
 we
 do
 it,
 what
 we


ended
 up
 talking
 about
 mostly
 is
 how
 do


we
 just
 create
 enough
 sustainability
 for


artists
 so
 that
 everyone
 can
 sustain


this
 moment
 in
 time
 and
 so
 whatever
 is


on
 the
 other
 side
 of
 this,
 whatever
 that


looks
 like,
 that
 the
 creative
 voices


that
 build
 our
 industry
 can
 still


survive.
 Does
 it
 get
 worse
 before
 it


gets
 better?


>> I
 mean,
 if
 you
 look
 at
 it
 with
 a
 long


lens,
 you
 know,
 define
 worse,
 right?
 If


you
 look
 at
 a
 long
 with
 a
 long
 lens,


it's
 always
 this
 business
 has
 always


been
 challenged.
 This
 business
 has


always
 gone
 through
 dips.
 It's
 always


gone
 through
 ES.
 Um,
 and
 how
 long
 this


moment
 of
 uncertainty
 lasts
 is
 probably


longer
 than
 any
 of
 us
 would
 love.
 And
 if


that's
 how
 you
 define
 worse,
 then
 yes.


But
 I
 think,
 you
 know,
 um,
 I
 think
 it's


just
 going
 to
 always
 be
 changing.
 I


don't
 know if
 it's
 going
 to
 get
 worse
 or


better.
 I
 think
 we're
 going
 to
 continue


to
 change
 and
 evolve.
 You
 know,
 I
 always


think
 about
 supply
 and
 demand
 cycles.


I've
 got
 a
 degree
 in
 economics
 and
 I


think
 about
 the
 world
 in
 that
 way.
 And
 I


think
 there
 was
 a
 period
 where
 we


thought,
 man,
 if
 you're
 a
 content


creator,
 you
 are
 good
 as
 gold
 because


there's
 so
 many,
 you
 know,
 different


platforms
 that
 need
 your
 services,
 they


need
 your
 content.
 And
 then
 all
 of
 a


sudden,
 I
 think
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 content


and
 maybe
 I
 don't
 know,
 there
 was
 too


much
 content
 and
 they
 over
 supply.
 So,


where
 is
 the
 rebalancing
 or
 or
 how
 do
 we


get
 back
 to
 a
 different
 level?


>> I
 think
 we're
 seeing
 the
 rebalancing


now.
 I
 will
 say
 I
 personally
 am
 a
 little


bit
 worried
 about
 the
 level
 of


consolidation
 that
 we
 have
 because
 I
 do


think
 that
 it
 is
 hard
 to
 keep
 things


swayed
 in
 the
 favor
 of
 the
 creators
 and


of
 the
 artists
 which
 is
 really
 the


community
 that
 we
 need
 to
 continue
 any


sort
 of
 artistic
 endeavor
 in
 media.
 Um,


but
 you
 know,
 I
 think
 Mark
 said


something
 I
 he
 may
 have
 already
 said


this
 to
 you
 guys
 earlier,
 but
 that
 I


think
 is
 a
 really
 important
 bit
 of


context,
 which
 is
 the
 past
 10
 years
 of


the
 streaming
 arms
 race
 was
 a
 boon.
 Like


that
 was
 a
 spike.
 That
 was
 an
 that
 was


an
 abnormal
 state
 of
 our
 industry,


right?
 So,
 this
 is
 a
 little
 bit


corrective,
 right?
 It's
 not
 completely


just
 the,
 you
 know,
 earth
 has
 fallen
 out


underneath
 us.
 This
 is
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a


correction
 of
 something
 that
 was
 a
 real


kind
 of
 an
 aberration
 in
 of
 itself.


>> So,
 a
 good
 thing
 a
 little
 bit
 maybe.


But
 not
 if
 you're
 a
 content
 creator
 say


I
 think
 what
 I
 think
 the
 the
 the
 good


thing
 is
 that
 there
 are
 more
 ways
 to


monetize
 content
 right
 and
 we
 talked


about
 everything
 from
 direct
 to
 consumer


models
 to
 YouTube.
 There
 are
 a
 lot
 of


different
 platforms
 in
 addition
 to


Hollywood
 where
 you
 can
 monetize


content.
 How
 you
 do
 that,
 right,
 is
 the


thing
 that
 a
 lot
 of
 us
 don't
 yet
 know.


>> Is
 um
 you
 know,


>> uh
 oh,
 when
 he
 pauses,
 this
 could
 be


serious.


>> It's
 political,
 too.
 The
 president
 has


weighed
 in
 recently
 and
 he
 said
 the
 the


way
 to
 fix
 this
 is
 to
 put
 tariffs
 on


films
 that
 are
 made
 outside
 the
 US.


You're
 shaking
 your
 head.


>> I
 don't
 think
 that's
 the
 way
 to
 fix


this.


>> Why
 should
 we
 be
 filming
 scenes
 about


Brooklyn
 in
 Vancouver?
 I
 think
 that
 we


listen
 I
 definitely
 am
 personally


invested
 in
 us
 keeping
 production
 inside


of
 the
 communities
 that
 you
 know
 where


the
 people
 that
 make
 them
 live
 right
 um


because
 it's
 not
 just
 about
 um
 are
 we


maintaining
 the
 integrity
 of
 the
 film


itself
 by
 location
 space
 shooting.
 This


city
 is
 where
 the
 majority
 of
 people


that
 make
 stuff
 live.
 And
 we've
 got
 to


keep
 this
 city
 healthy
 and
 the
 economy


and
 the
 infrastructure
 of
 that
 has
 to
 be


supported
 by
 films
 being
 made
 here.
 And


we've
 got
 to
 figure
 that
 out.
 At
 the


same
 time,
 if
 we're
 going
 to
 make
 the


path
 of
 supporting
 these
 artists
 is
 to


be
 able
 to
 make
 more
 to
 increase
 the


amount
 of
 stuff
 that
 is
 being
 made,


we've
 got
 to
 be
 nimble.
 And
 if
 that


means
 that
 sometimes
 shooting
 things


outside
 of
 the
 states
 or
 shooting
 things


outside
 of
 LA
 and
 New
 York
 is
 the
 way
 to


do
 that.
 You
 know,
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 films


that
 we've
 been
 able
 to
 make
 um
 that
 are


really
 innovative
 and
 original
 and
 risky


um
 have
 to
 find
 ways
 to
 cost
 less.
 And


some
 of
 the
 ways
 that
 we
 find
 to
 make


them
 cost
 less
 is
 to
 shoot
 them


elsewhere.
 And
 then
 you
 have
 American


Viction,
 which
 is
 a
 Boston
 set
 story


that
 shot
 in
 Massachusetts.
 So,
 you


know,
 we
 can
 figure
 it
 out
 different


ways,
 but
 we've
 got
 to
 have
 some
 flex.


>> I'm
 trying
 forever
 to
 figure
 out
 what


college
 that
 was.


>> What
 was
 it?
 I
 went
 to
 college
 in
 New


England.


>> They
 didn't
 I
 don't
 believe
 they
 shot
 I


would
 I
 would
 be
 lying
 to
 you
 if
 I
 told


you
 I
 knew
 exactly
 where
 that
 location


was,
 but
 it
 may
 not
 have
 been
 a
 college


at
 all.
 It
 may
 have
 been
 a
 conference


bubble.
 This
 is
 the
 magic
 of
 film.
 My


guess.
 Wait,
 so
 you're
 telling
 me?
 No,


I'm
 just
 kidding.


>> Listen,
 I
 remember
 Sopranos
 was
 like


taped
 in
 my
 neighborhood
 and
 it's
 not
 in


New
 York
 City.
 It's
 just
 outside
 New


York.


>> That's
 because
 you
 live
 in
 New
 Jersey


and
 that's


>> But
 it
 was
 But
 I
 think
 at
 the
 moment
 it


was
 supposed
 to
 be
 New
 York.
 Perfect.
 So


funny.
 What
 are
 you
 saying?
 What
 are
 you


saying?
 We're
 talking
 with
 Alana
 Mayo.


She
 is
 president
 of
 Orion
 Pictures.
 Um,


you
 know,
 but
 when
 you
 talk
 about,


right,
 like
 you
 want
 LA
 and
 the
 film


scene
 and
 the
 filmy
 like
 you
 want
 it
 to


be
 um
 alive
 and
 healthy,
 but
 I
 also
 do


think
 about,
 you
 know,
 part
 of
 your


market
 is
 a
 global
 market.


>> Yeah,
 exactly.


>> So,
 being
 able
 to
 film
 wherever
 in
 the


world,
 like
 that's
 part
 of
 it,
 right?


>> 100%.
 We're,
 you
 know,
 we're
 a
 global


community


>> without
 without
 a
 penalty,
 whether
 it's


a
 tariff
 or
 whatever.


>> 100%.
 And
 also
 what
 about
 the
 movies


that
 we
 produce
 out
 of
 Hollywood
 that


are
 not
 set
 in
 the
 US?
 You
 know,
 we
 also


produce
 movies
 that
 are
 set
 all
 over
 the


world.
 You
 know,
 Mission
 Impossible


doesn't
 just
 all
 take
 place
 here,
 right?


So,
 I
 think
 we
 have
 to
 be
 a
 global


industry.
 We
 have
 to,
 you
 know,
 be
 a


global
 economy
 with
 artisans
 that
 are


working
 all
 over
 the
 world.
 But
 the


argument
 that
 I
 understand
 is
 that


shouldn't
 be
 to
 the
 expense
 of
 the
 film


industries
 locally.
 I
 really
 I
 feel
 very


strongly
 about
 that.


>> You
 have
 a
 really
 cool
 background.
 You


have
 worked
 uh
 20th
 Century
 Fox,


Paramount
 Pictures.


>> You
 did
 a
 stint
 at
 Vimeo.


>> I
 did.
 Yeah.


>> Oh
 my
 god.


>> That's
 a
 blast
 from
 the
 past.
 I
 know.


>> It's
 It's
 amazing.


>> Still
 around.
 Still
 around.


>> I
 know.
 But
 I
 haven't
 heard
 it
 in
 a


while.


>> Outlier
 Society.


>> Sorry,
 Vimeo.


>> You
 you
 came
 of
 age
 in
 an
 industry
 while


it
 was
 like
 undergoing
 this
 massive


shift
 to
 streaming,
 which
 you
 alluded


to.
 When
 you
 began
 your
 career,
 did
 you


ever
 think
 that
 you'd
 be
 making
 movies


at
 a
 company
 that
 was
 owned
 by
 Amazon?


No,
 I
 couldn't.
 This
 I
 shouldn't
 say


this,
 but
 I
 remember
 when
 Amazon
 first


started
 making
 television
 shows,
 I
 was


at
 Fox
 and
 I
 laughed.
 I
 was
 like,
 "This


is
 ridiculous.
 This
 will
 never
 last."


>> Came
 out
 and
 everyone
 was
 like,
 "This
 is


pretty
 good."


>> They
 they
 started
 making
 incredible
 TV


shows.
 And
 then,
 you
 know,
 to
 track
 from


that
 moment
 to
 now
 working
 at
 a
 film


studio
 that
 is
 under
 the
 Amazon


umbrella,
 I
 couldn't
 have
 predicted
 any


of
 this.
 Um,
 I
 I
 will
 say
 though,
 when


you
 talk
 about
 all
 of
 those
 places
 that


I
 worked,
 part
 of
 the
 reason
 why
 I
 I
 got


my
 dream
 job,
 the
 best
 job
 that
 I


thought
 you
 could
 ever
 have
 in
 film,
 I


was
 a
 movie
 studio
 executive
 at


Paramount.
 I
 was
 on
 the
 Paramount
 lot.


And
 after
 being
 there
 for
 five
 or
 6


years,
 I
 realized
 that
 the
 world
 around


me
 had
 changed.
 And
 I
 went
 to
 Vimeo
 very


intentionally
 because
 I
 thought
 there's


all
 of
 this
 cool
 stuff
 that
 is
 happening


in
 this
 digital
 space
 and
 I
 need
 to


understand
 it.
 And
 then
 I
 said,
 I
 got
 to


work
 with
 close
 to
 the
 talent
 and
 I've


got
 to
 produce
 and
 be
 able
 to
 be
 scrappy


and
 produce
 for
 different
 platforms
 and


different
 mediums.
 So
 I
 went
 to
 go
 work


with
 Michael
 B.
 Jordan.
 And
 so
 it's
 been


ever
 changing
 for
 the
 entirety
 of
 the


time
 that
 I've
 had
 the,
 you
 know,


blessing
 of
 having
 a
 career
 in
 this


industry,
 which
 is
 why
 I
 think
 it's
 not


falling,
 you
 know,
 it's
 not
 all
 falling


apart.


>> What's
 it
 like?
 I
 mean,
 Amazon
 this
 mass


company,
 and
 there
 are a
 lot
 of
 folks


like,
 yeah,
 that's
 where
 I
 buy
 all
 my


stuff,
 right?
 But
 we
 know
 AWS
 is


massive,
 and
 we
 talked
 about
 it
 earlier,


too.
 um
 here
 in
 terms
 of
 what
 they
 are


doing,
 media,
 sports,
 entertainment.


>> My
 doctor
 works
 for
 Amazon
 and


>> and
 your
 pharmacist


>> like
 hands
 in
 so
 much
 of
 our
 world
 and


increasingly
 more
 so.
 Um
 what's
 it
 like


though
 running
 a
 studio
 within


>> the
 Amazon
 world?


>> It's
 interesting.
 You
 know,
 the
 great


benefit
 of
 it
 is
 in
 this
 time
 of


instability,
 Amazon
 has
 such
 scale
 that


it
 feels
 as
 if
 you
 can
 one
 still
 be


innovative,
 you
 can
 still
 take
 risks,


and
 you
 can
 ride
 these
 waves
 of
 change


with
 within
 this
 massive,
 you
 know,
 uh,


company
 that
 can
 withstand
 some
 of
 the


headwinds
 that
 we're
 experiencing.
 So,
 I


think
 it's
 actually
 a
 place
 where


innovation
 thrives.
 Um,
 which
 sounds


like
 a
 talking
 point,
 but
 I
 swear
 I
 just


made
 that
 up.
 I'm
 like,


>> wait,
 let
 me
 see.
 Are
 there
 like
 my
 Q


cards?
 Let
 me
 pull
 them
 out.
 Um,
 but
 it


is
 also
 a
 big
 culture
 clash,
 you
 know,


so
 it's
 navigating
 those
 two
 things
 at


once.


>> Well,
 and
 I
 also
 can
 I
 just
 just
 to


follow
 like
 AI,
 right?
 Amazon,
 they're


so
 interchangeable.
 And
 then
 we're


looking
 at
 anybody
 who
 creates
 content


is
 a
 little
 terrified
 of
 AI.


>> They
 are.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 We're
 it's
 those


are
 difficult
 conversations
 that
 we're


navigating
 every
 single
 day
 in
 real


time.
 And
 I
 think
 the
 difference
 from


last
 year
 where
 AI
 never
 came
 up,
 not


once
 in
 a
 conversation
 about
 any
 movie


that
 I
 was
 working
 on
 to
 this
 year
 where


it
 is
 ever
 present
 in
 what
 tools
 are
 we


using,
 what
 tools
 are
 we
 not
 using
 and


also
 the
 fear.
 Um,
 I
 can
 only
 imagine


next
 year,
 you
 know,
 this
 stuff
 is


happening
 exponentially.


>> Is
 the
 fear
 warranted?


>> I
 think
 yes
 and
 no,
 right?
 I
 think


anytime
 that
 you
 have
 a
 technology
 that


is
 going
 to
 cause
 a
 reduction
 in
 jobs,


of
 course,
 it's
 worrisome
 for
 people.


Like
 that's
 a
 real
 humanity.


I
 can't,
 you
 know,
 I
 don't
 know.
 I
 think


for
 me,
 who
 works
 with
 a
 lot
 of


independent
 filmmakers
 and
 people
 that


are
 making
 really
 highly
 original
 stuff


but
 at
 a
 lower
 cost,
 I
 think
 the
 the


tools
 have
 honestly
 been
 mostly
 helpful


cuz
 they
 are
 creating,
 you
 know,


reductions
 in
 cost
 to
 our
 budget.
 Um,


beyond
 that,
 I
 don't
 know
 like
 how
 do
 I


was
 thinking
 I
 think
 about
 this
 a
 lot


like
 cuz
 we're
 starting
 to
 increasingly


play
 around
 with
 things
 like
 chat,
 but


>> I
 still
 like
 can't
 I
 can't
 rely
 on
 it
 at


all.


>> No.
 Like
 it's
 it's
 not


>> No,
 no,
 we're
 careful.
 We
 are
 I


>> like
 I
 spend
 more
 time
 trying
 to
 make


>> I
 do
 everything
 I
 spend
 so
 much
 time


trying
 to
 make
 it
 good
 and
 it's
 like
 I
 I


don't
 when
 I
 get
 back
 I
 don't
 get
 the


love
 that
 that
 I
 need.


>> We
 check
 sources
 but
 I
 was
 thinking


about
 in
 the
 entertainment
 world
 you
 go


back
 to
 like
 that
 Star
 Wars
 movie
 the


first
 one
 they
 were
 playing
 around
 with


stuff
 but
 I
 think
 about
 CGI
 and
 I
 think


about
 animation.


>> Wait,
 the
 first
 one
 or
 the
 fourth
 one?


The
 first
 one
 like
 in
 the
 1970s
 first


one.
 Okay.
 But
 but
 that
 was
 considered


high.
 But
 you
 know
 technology
 has
 always


had
 a
 role
 increasingly
 you
 know
 whether


it's
 Mission
 Impossible
 and
 the
 things


that
 Cruz
 is
 doing
 and
 the
 stuff


happening
 around
 like
 pick
 whatever
 it


is
 um
 Game
 of
 Thron
 like
 everything.
 So


technology
 has
 a
 role.
 So
 are
 we
 being


silly
 to
 be
 so
 fearful
 of
 AI
 or
 we
 just


have
 to
 be
 smart
 or
 or
 is
 it
 something


very
 very
 different
 from
 the
 things
 that


we've
 had
 in
 the
 digital
 universe?
 I
 I


don't
 think
 that
 it's
 silly
 to
 be


cautious
 about
 technological
 um


revolutions,
 evolutions,
 because
 they


usually
 come
 with
 a
 flip
 side
 to
 the


coin
 that
 can
 have
 some
 sort
 of
 damaging


impact.
 But
 what
 I
 don't
 think
 it's


going
 to
 happen
 is
 I
 don't
 think
 that
 we


as
 studios
 are
 going
 to
 start
 generating


all
 of
 our
 scripts
 from
 some
 LLM
 and


producing
 those
 scripts
 so
 that
 we
 don't


have
 to
 pay
 writers.
 I
 said
 that
 to
 a


very


>> not
 going
 to
 be
 all
 over
 the
 actress.


>> I'm
 sure
 Tilly
 will
 be
 in
 some
 things.


She
 will
 not
 be
 in
 a
 Ryan
 film.
 I
 have


seen
 stuff
 that
 is
 so
 bad
 where
 I'm
 like


this
 was
 definitely
 from
 AI
 but


>> of
 course


>> I
 want
 to
 shift
 gears
 a
 little
 bit
 and


talk
 about
 sort
 of the
 old
 school


creative
 process


>> and
 just
 ask
 the
 basic
 question
 how
 do


you
 find
 the
 good
 stuff?


>> Well
 that's
 you
 know
 that's
 part
 of
 the


job
 is
 you
 you
 spend
 10
 15
 20
 years


reading
 20
 scripts
 a
 week
 and
 part
 of
 my


job
 is
 to
 sift
 through
 all
 of
 that.


Okay.
 So,
 for
 example,
 to
 pick
 something


like
 to
 bet
 on
 something
 like
 American


Fiction,
 which
 I
 think
 everybody
 knows


about,


>> how
 many
 how
 many
 things
 do
 you
 pass
 on


before
 you
 get
 to
 that?


>> Probably
 over
 a
 hundred.
 Yeah.
 The
 the


conversion
 rate
 of
 American
 Fiction
 was


an
 incredible
 script.
 One
 of
 the
 best


scripts
 I've
 ever
 read
 in
 my
 life.
 And


those
 are
 unicorns
 and
 they
 don't
 come


around
 often
 and
 they
 cannot
 be


generated.
 Can
 someone
 now
 write
 a,
 you


know,
 a
 replicate
 script
 that's
 American


fictionesque?
 perhaps
 through
 an
 LLM,


but
 that's
 not
 something
 that's
 an


incredible
 voice
 and
 writer
 who
 wrote


almost
 a
 perfect
 script
 and
 that
 those


just
 don't
 come
 along
 often.


>> Do
 we
 have
 time?


>> Yeah,
 go.


>> Your
 background,
 your
 dad,


>> radio,
 like
 he
 was
 a
 big
 deal.
 He
 was


big
 deal.
 He


>> was
 a
 big
 deal,
 I
 think.
 So,
 yeah.


>> How
 did
 that
 shape
 you
 kind
 of
 growing


up
 in
 that
 world?


>> Um,
 the
 best
 thing
 about
 having
 my
 dad


and
 my
 mom
 both
 worked
 in
 the


entertainment
 industries
 is
 I
 knew
 that


you
 could
 make
 a
 living
 doing
 this
 and
 I


didn't
 have
 parents
 who
 were
 scared
 of


me
 chasing
 this.
 But
 I
 will
 say
 I
 also


had
 a
 parent
 who
 lived
 through
 massive


massive
 technological
 changes
 in
 his


industry.
 I
 remember
 showing
 my
 dad
 an


iPod,
 showing
 him
 Napster
 and
 his


reaction
 to
 how
 that
 was
 going
 to
 affect


things.
 So
 I
 think
 I
 have
 a
 little
 bit


more
 kind
 of
 tenacity
 around
 this


because
 I
 saw
 that
 happen
 very
 up
 close


in
 radio
 and
 it's
 almost
 exactly
 the


same
 as
 what
 we're
 experiencing
 now
 in


in
 filmed
 entertainment.


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean
 like
 we
 see
 it
 in
 our
 world


and
 we
 now
 do
 shows
 that
 you
 know
 right


now
 you're
 on
 our
 streaming
 service,


you're
 on
 YouTube,
 you're
 on
 radio
 and


we
 do
 a
 couple
 of
 hours
 that
 throw,
 you


know,
 traditional
 linear
 television
 into


it.
 So
 it's
 this
 melding
 is
 pretty
 wild.


>> Yeah.


>> Thank
 you.


>> Thank
 you.


>> What
 a
 pleasure.


>> Likewise.


>> Yeah,
 really
 fun.
 I
 hope
 we
 can
 catch
 up


at
 some
 point
 in
 the
 future
 as
 well.
 Um,


Alana
 mayor,
 she's
 president
 of
 Ryan


Pictures.
