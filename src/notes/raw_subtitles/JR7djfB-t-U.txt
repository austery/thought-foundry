Good
 afternoon
 everyone.
 It's
 great
 to


be
 here.
 This
 is
 a
 place
 I
 grew
 up
 in


Oslo.
 Four
 amazing
 companies.
 Tremendous


to
 hear


from.


Um
 what
 makes
 a
 really
 great
 company?


This
 is
 a
 fascinating
 question
 that
 I


spent
 decades
 researching.
 And
 one
 of


the
 things
 we
 have
 done
 is
 that
 we
 have


done
 three
 studies
 published
 in
 three


books.
 Built
 to
 last,
 good
 to
 great
 and


great
 by
 choice.
 And
 uh
 probably


Benedetto
 probably
 would
 take
 quite
 a


bit
 of
 time
 to
 read
 all
 three
 books.
 I


hope
 it's
 worth
 your
 time.
 Uh
 so
 uh
 what


are
 these
 all
 about
 in
 built
 to
 last?


What
 we
 did
 was
 to
 say
 what
 are
 some
 of


the
 enduring
 principles
 of
 great


companies
 over
 the
 long
 hall
 and
 we


studied
 that
 in
 the
 context
 of
 United


States
 and
 we're
 looking
 at
 those


companies
 that
 have
 endured
 for
 decades


even
 more
 than
 50
 years
 and
 we
 heard


from
 many
 of
 them
 today
 and
 we're
 using


cumulative
 shareholder
 return
 over
 the


long
 haul
 as
 a
 metric
 compared
 to
 the


market
 and
 industry
 that
 they're
 in
 and


as
 you
 can
 see
 from
 this
 graph
 many
 of


these
 rise
 rose
 above
 the
 crowd
 to


become
 a
 truly
 great
 company.
 That
 was


the
 first
 study.
 In
 a
 second


study,
 the
 question
 was,
 can
 a
 good


company
 become
 great?
 And
 if
 so,
 how?


And
 of
 course,
 not
 all
 companies
 are


born
 great.
 They
 have
 to
 transition
 like


in
 this
 hockey
 stick
 that
 you're
 seeing


here.
 And
 in
 the
 third
 study,
 we
 asked
 a


different
 question
 which
 was
 in
 a
 world


full
 of
 change
 and
 uncertainty
 like
 the


one
 we
 live
 in


today,
 what
 do
 you
 do
 as
 a
 leader
 to


navigate
 that
 circumstance
 to
 become
 a


truly
 great
 company
 and
 attain
 that
 kind


of
 extraordinary
 performance
 over
 the


long


hall.
 So
 these
 are
 the
 studies
 that
 we


have
 done
 and
 to
 sit
 at
 what
 we
 just


heard
 from
 these
 four
 amazing
 companies


into
 some
 of
 this
 research.


First
 characteristic
 that
 is
 important


is
 that
 we
 have
 to
 look
 over
 the
 long


term.
 When
 we
 think
 about
 what
 makes
 for


a
 great
 company,
 we're
 not
 talking
 about


short-term
 performance,
 three
 years,
 5


years,
 10
 years.
 We're
 talking
 beyond


that.
 That's
 all
 of
 the
 studies
 that
 we


have
 looked
 at.
 You
 have
 to
 stand
 the


the
 test
 of
 time.
 And
 these
 four


companies
 we
 just
 heard
 from
 stood
 the


test
 of
 time.
 I
 plotted
 them
 here
 on
 the


timeline.
 Utis
 being
 the
 oldest
 one


founded
 before
 the
 American
 Civil
 War.


Then
 we
 have
 Goldman
 Sachs
 also
 this
 era


back
 then
 and
 Nova
 Nordisk
 and
 the


youngest
 company
 we
 just
 heard
 from
 is


Ferrari
 but
 is
 more
 than
 100
 years


old.
 Why
 is
 that
 important?


They
 have
 traversed
 circumstances
 of


hardship,
 recessions,
 even
 a
 depression,


wars,
 downturns,
 industry
 cycle,
 and
 yet


they
 have
 come
 out
 great.
 That's
 the


first
 characteristic.
 The
 second
 we
 have


to
 look
 for
 is
 to


ask
 compared
 to
 what.
 We
 can't
 just
 look


at
 successful
 companies
 and
 say
 what
 did


they
 do?
 In
 academic
 research,
 we
 call


that
 selecting
 on
 the
 outcome
 variable


of
 success
 only
 and
 that's
 a
 bias.
 So
 we


have
 to
 look
 at
 what
 have
 they
 done
 that


was
 different
 and
 better
 than
 what


industry
 peers
 did
 at
 the
 same
 time.


Industry
 peer
 that
 had
 the
 same


opportunity
 back
 in
 the
 day
 to
 become


great
 but
 became
 only
 merely
 good
 or


worse.
 So
 what
 we're
 looking
 for
 are


principles
 that
 separate
 the
 great
 from


the
 good.
 Let
 me
 share
 a
 few
 of
 those


principles
 and
 relate
 them
 to
 what
 we


just
 heard.
 So
 the
 first
 principle
 is


that
 these
 companies
 had
 this
 duality


about
 them.
 On
 one
 hand
 they
 focused
 on


preserving
 the
 core
 core
 purpose
 values


and
 principles
 and
 we
 just
 heard
 that


today.
 Nova
 Nordisk
 about
 chronic


diseases,
 Goldman
 Sachs
 customer


excellence
 and
 partnership
 and
 so
 forth.


It's
 a
 very
 clear
 purpose
 that
 remains


stable
 over
 time.
 So
 that's
 one
 part.


The
 other
 part
 of
 the
 duality
 is


everything
 else
 is
 up
 for
 change
 and


progress
 and
 relentless
 innovation
 like


we
 also
 heard
 innovation
 in
 Ferrari
 Nova


Nordisk
 the
 flywheel
 of
 Otus
 everything


done
 in
 Goldman
 Sachs
 right
 there's
 that


duality
 about
 these
 two
 companies
 now


what
 is
 interesting
 is
 that
 many


companies
 and
 leaders
 they
 confuse
 the


two
 what
 should
 remain
 constant
 and


stable
 over
 time
 and
 what
 should
 not


here's
 an
 example
 of
 that
 many
 years
 ago


The
 leaders
 at
 IBM
 decided
 that
 they


corporate
 their
 sales
 force
 and


employees
 should
 dress
 like
 their


corporate
 clients.
 And
 back
 in
 the
 day,


the
 clients
 were
 wearing
 a
 suit
 and
 a


tie.
 So
 then
 the
 salesforce
 started


wearing
 a
 suit,
 a
 tie
 and
 ideally
 a
 blue


shirt
 and
 that
 become
 the
 matching


because
 they
 were
 in
 a
 customer
 service


business
 and
 the
 idea
 was
 to
 gain


respect
 and
 credibility
 with
 the
 clients


they
 served.
 Good
 idea.


Then
 years
 passed
 by
 and
 they
 started


dropping
 the
 clients
 started
 dropping


the
 suit
 and
 the
 tie
 and
 so
 forth


particularly
 in
 the
 tech
 sector.
 But
 the


IBM
 dress
 code
 marched
 on
 decade
 after


decade
 until
 one
 day
 a
 new
 CEO
 from
 the


outside
 Lou
 Gersonner
 walked
 in
 the
 door


and
 asked
 why
 you
 dressed
 like
 that
 and


they
 had
 no
 good
 answer
 because
 30
 40


years
 ago
 it
 was
 a
 good
 answer
 but
 no


longer.
 It
 had
 become
 dogma
 a
 practice.


That's
 the
 way
 we
 do
 things
 around
 here.


That's
 kind
 of
 culture
 to
 dress
 like


that.
 Of
 course
 not.
 Gerson
 stopped
 it.


That
 was
 a
 practice
 that
 got
 confused
 by


what
 was
 the
 culture.
 The
 culture
 was


customer
 service.
 But
 the
 practice


addressing
 like
 that
 was
 just
 a
 practice


that
 had
 become


obsolete.
 Leadership
 implication


challenge
 the
 status
 quo.
 what
 should


change
 and
 what
 should
 remain
 stable


over
 time.
 That's
 the
 first
 principle.


The
 second
 principle
 I'd
 like
 to
 share


is
 this
 idea
 that
 this
 company
 had
 a


pierce
 and
 clarity
 about
 the
 operating


model.
 And
 I'm
 so
 glad
 we
 heard
 from


Otus
 today
 because
 you
 just
 provided
 a


fantastic
 example
 of
 this
 idea.
 You
 call


it
 the
 flywheel.
 Those
 of
 you
 are


familiar
 with
 the
 book
 Good
 to
 Great,


you
 will
 recognize
 these
 three


intersecting
 circles.
 What
 this
 company


had
 going
 for
 them
 was
 very
 clear
 what


they
 can
 be
 the
 best
 at
 in
 the
 world
 and


that's
 what
 we
 heard
 today
 the
 excellent


of
 Goldman
 Sachs
 what
 Nova
 Nordis
 can
 do


Otis
 can
 do
 and
 Ferrari
 right
 you
 you


answer
 this
 question
 but
 then
 there
 is
 a


second
 question
 and
 that
 is
 passion
 that


the
 employees
 coming
 to
 the
 working
 for


the
 company
 feels
 the
 passion
 for
 the


company
 they
 feel
 passion
 for
 what


they're
 doing
 they
 feel
 passion
 for
 the


customer
 but
 in
 mentioned
 so
 much
 about


the
 employees
 and
 the
 passion
 that
 they


have
 coming
 and
 working
 at


Ferrari.
 Then
 the
 third
 thing
 is
 having


that
 profit
 model
 economic
 engine.
 And


when
 you
 answer
 the
 three
 questions,
 you


get
 an
 operating
 model.
 Here's
 an


example.
 Great
 by
 choice.
 We


studied
 Southwest


Airlines.
 This
 is
 their
 business
 model.


Bus
 on


wings.
 Just
 to
 be
 clear,
 that's
 not
 an


actual
 bus.
 That's
 an
 AI
 generated
 image


by
 my
 slide


designer.
 Uh
 what
 does
 that
 mean?
 They


figured
 out
 that
 this
 operating
 model
 is


going
 from
 A
 to
 B.
 No
 frrills,
 no


luxuries,
 free
 seating
 and
 so
 forth.
 We


get
 you
 there.
 Many
 others
 that
 copy


this
 model
 later
 on.
 Historically
 the


most
 successful
 business
 model
 in
 in
 the


airline
 industry
 in
 the
 United
 States.


Some
 years
 ago,
 the
 then
 CEO
 Howard


Putnham
 described
 the
 model.
 What
 was


the
 operating
 model?
 This
 is
 what
 he


wrote
 in
 the
 Wall
 Street
 transcript.
 He


said,
 "This
 is
 what
 we
 do.
 Under
 two


hours
 only,
 you
 737s
 only
 quicks
 10


minutes
 at
 the
 gate,
 in
 and
 out
 in
 10


minutes.
 Low
 fear,
 high
 frequency,
 keep


it
 fun,
 no
 interlining,
 no
 food,
 people


not
 mail,
 no
 seat
 assignment,
 bags,
 fly


free."
 It's
 a
 brilliant
 articulation
 of


an
 operating
 model
 for
 an


airline.
 Right?
 Everybody
 can
 understand


it.
 You're
 that
 flight
 attendant.
 You


understand
 it.
 Of
 course,
 some
 of
 these


things
 have
 evolved
 over
 time.
 You
 apply


fly
 wells,
 you
 evolve
 it,
 you
 expand
 it,


you
 become
 better
 at


it.
 But
 it's
 that
 kind
 of
 piercing


clarity
 and
 what
 we're
 about
 and
 what


we're
 not
 trying
 to
 do
 that
 really
 makes


a
 difference
 of
 these
 companies.


Third


principle
 driving


progress
 and
 particularly
 how
 did
 this


company
 drive


progress.
 Here's
 another
 company
 we


studied
 which
 is
 progressive
 insurance


in
 United
 States
 and
 one
 year
 they


decided
 that
 they
 were
 looking
 at
 the


market
 to
 enter
 of
 insurance
 for
 trucks


big
 cars.
 They
 did
 an
 exhaustive


analysis
 and
 they
 figured
 out
 this
 seems


attractive
 and
 they
 decided
 on


aggressive
 investment
 into
 that
 market.


Turned
 out
 to
 be
 a
 failure
 and
 they
 had


to
 pull
 back
 for
 a
 variety
 of


reasons.
 Then
 a
 few
 years
 later
 they


decided
 to
 go
 into
 the
 market
 for
 safe


drivers.
 Here
 they
 can't
 the
 approach


was
 completely


different.
 Let's
 do
 experiments.
 Let's


start
 small.
 Let's
 start
 with
 a
 thousand


subscribers
 in
 Florida.
 next
 year
 Texas


and
 so
 on.
 And
 after
 three
 years
 of


experimentation,
 they
 then
 figure
 out


this
 is
 how
 we
 can
 make
 money
 in
 this


market.
 We
 have
 a
 good
 pricing
 model
 and


then
 they
 launched
 aggressively
 across


the
 United
 States.
 Very
 different


approaches
 and
 the
 key
 here
 is
 that
 in


markets
 uh
 that
 characterize
 uncertainty


there
 is
 a
 premium
 of
 experimentation.


experimentation
 and
 not
 just
 analysis


gives
 you
 empirical
 validation
 for
 what


works.
 So
 these
 companies
 we
 studied
 and


I
 think
 we
 heard
 it
 from
 today
 of


innovation


experimentation
 but
 in
 I
 remember
 on
 the


podcast
 when
 Nikolai
 you
 talked
 about
 in


electric
 vehicles
 and
 how
 you
 have


experimented
 with
 that
 for
 several
 years


right
 it
 takes
 like
 a
 long
 time
 to


experiment
 you
 got
 to
 be
 patient
 but


doing
 that
 creates
 a
 culture
 of


experimentation
 and
 that's
 what
 we
 saw


in
 these
 companies
 and
 that
 is
 that
 you


got
 to
 have
 starting
 a
 lot
 of
 exper


experiments
 both
 in
 products
 and


processes


pilots,
 test
 marketers,
 demos,
 and
 so


forth.
 Going
 to
 kill
 the
 bad
 ones.
 Then


you're
 going
 to
 have
 the
 courage
 to
 go


all
 in
 on
 some
 of
 the
 very
 good
 ones
 and


scale
 it
 aggressively.
 This
 means
 that


you
 have
 to
 have
 a
 culture
 of


appropriate
 risktaking
 and
 learning
 that


professor
 James
 talked
 about
 in
 the


opening
 remarks.
 Having
 that
 openness
 to


learning
 and
 being
 able
 to
 have
 that


culture
 that
 drive
 the
 progress


forward.
 So
 three
 principles
 preserve


the
 core
 stimulate
 progress
 a
 very
 clear


operating
 model
 and
 a
 premium
 of


experimentation
 to
 drive


progress.
 So
 what
 have
 we
 not
 find
 in


some
 of
 our


research?
 Well
 one
 thing


is
 were
 these
 leaders
 visionaries?
 No


it's
 not
 the
 idea
 that
 they
 could
 see


where
 the
 business
 is
 going
 to
 be
 10


years
 from
 now.
 I
 mean,
 who
 can
 predict


where
 we're
 going
 to
 be
 10
 years
 from


now
 in
 any
 industry
 and
 sort
 of
 point


the
 company
 toward
 that
 destination?


Absolutely
 not.
 We
 do
 not
 see
 that.


Another
 one
 that
 comes
 up
 is
 this
 one.


Were
 the
 leaders
 charismatic?
 Well,
 some


were.
 We
 saw
 that
 today
 and
 some
 were


not.
 It's
 a


nonvariable.
 And
 then


finally,
 what
 about
 luck?


Maybe
 this
 is
 just
 a
 random
 walk
 that


the
 great
 companies
 that
 we
 see
 are
 just


we're
 just
 lucky
 the
 right
 place
 at
 the


right


time.
 And
 our
 answer
 is


no.
 Why?
 Because
 we
 studied
 luck.
 We
 had


these
 great
 companies
 and
 then
 we
 had


the
 merely
 good
 one,
 the
 average


industry
 peers.
 And
 over
 the
 long
 time


all
 these
 companies
 had
 a
 fair
 amount
 of


bad
 luck
 and
 good
 luck.
 And
 the
 question


is,
 what
 are
 you
 doing
 with
 that
 luck?


What
 are
 you
 doing
 with
 the
 good
 luck


and
 seize
 the
 moment?
 And
 what
 are
 you


doing
 to
 be
 prepared
 to
 weather
 the


storms?
 And
 so
 therefore,
 let
 me
 then


close
 since
 we're
 in
 Norway,
 a
 quote
 by


our
 great
 Norwegian
 explorer
 Ru


Ammonson
 who
 said,
 "Victory,


um,
 there
 we
 are.
 Victory
 awaits
 the


person
 who
 has
 everything
 in
 order.


luck.
 Some
 people
 call


it
 greatness
 is
 not
 a
 function
 of


circumstant
 luck.
 Greatness
 is
 a


function
 of
 the
 lead
 the
 choices
 that


the
 leaders
 have
 made
 over
 time
 to
 build


a
 great
 company
 culture
 as
 we
 heard
 from


today
 of
 these
 four
 amazing
 companies.


Thank
 you.
