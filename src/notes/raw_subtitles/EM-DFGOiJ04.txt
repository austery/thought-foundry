About
 two
 minutes
 away
 from
 the
 end
 of


the
 trading
 day,
 Katie
 Grifeld
 and
 Matt


Miller
 in
 for
 Roma
 Bosik.
 And
 here
 to


help
 take
 us
 through
 the
 closing
 bell,


we're
 joined
 by
 a
 global
 simal
 cast,


Carol
 Masser
 and
 Bailey
 Lipult.
 He's
 in


for
 Tim
 Stenovic,
 bringing
 together
 all


of
 our
 audiences,
 Carol
 Masser
 to
 parse


through
 the
 most
 crucial
 moments
 of
 this


trading
 day
 on
 this
 Monday.
 And
 the
 dip


buyers,
 they're
 back.


Yeah,
 right.
 What
 a
 different
 tone
 from


Friday.
 But,
 you
 know,
 also
 uh
 we
 got
 to


write
 a
 love
 letter
 to
 OpenAI
 and


Broadcom
 because
 the
 semiconductors


really
 some
 outperformance
 up
 about
 5%.


A
 lot
 of
 it,
 you
 know,
 barely
 had
 to
 do


with
 Broadcom
 today.


And
 who
 even
 cares
 about
 a
 government


shutdown
 in
 a
 market
 like
 this?
 Yes,


we've
 not
 we've
 barely
 t
 talked
 about
 it


today.


Didn't
 even
 mention
 it.
 Didn't
 even


cross
 our
 minds.
 And
 yet,
 the
 MA
 major


averages
 are
 up
 almost
 2%,
 S&P
 up
 more


than
 one
 and
 a
 half%.
 And
 Katie
 and


Matt,
 guys,
 the
 bond
 market's
 closed,


but
 stocks
 are
 partying.
 Yeah,
 I
 think


uh
 I
 think
 to
 some
 extent
 the


administration
 took
 the
 teeth
 out
 of


that
 shutdown
 by
 agreeing
 to
 pay
 or


finding
 the
 money
 to
 pay
 the
 military
 at


least
 um
 on
 Wednesday
 when
 the
 next


check
 is
 due.
 But
 I
 think
 it's
 really


interesting
 that
 we've
 gone
 so
 far
 so


fast.
 You
 know,
 BTI
 was
 out
 with
 a
 note


yesterday
 saying
 that
 we're
 um
 still


above
 the
 50-day
 moving
 average
 and
 have


been
 for
 113
 days.
 That's
 the
 third


longest
 stretch
 since
 1990.
 That's


before
 Bailey
 and
 Katie
 were
 even
 born.


That
 might
 be
 true
 actually.


But
 I
 mean
 it's
 a
 good
 point
 that
 we


have
 been
 so
 strong
 for
 so
 long
 and
 we


really
 haven't
 seen
 a
 dip
 to
 buy
 in


quite
 a
 long
 time.
 So
 of
 course
 a
 lot
 of


this
 is
 open
 AI
 but
 a
 lot
 of
 this
 is


just
 folks
 seizing
 on
 a
 sale
 right
 now.


And
 that's
 definitely
 was
 the
 story
 of


this
 market
 action
 on
 this
 Monday.
 You


can
 see
 the
 S&P
 500
 looks
 like
 we're


going
 to
 finish
 about
 1
 and
 a
 half%


higher.
 You
 take
 a
 look
 at
 the
 NASDAQ


doing
 even
 better.
 That's
 a
 lot
 of
 that


chip
 influence
 coming
 through
 there.
 The


NASDAQ
 finishing
 2.2%
 higher
 on
 the
 day.


We
 show
 the
 Dow
 Jones
 here.
 I
 wouldn't.


It's
 not
 my
 favorite
 index,
 but
 we'll
 do


it.
 It's
 up
 about
 1.3%.


Carol
 Masser.


I
 know
 what's
 wrong
 with
 the
 Dow.


She
 likes
 the
 small
 caps.


The
 thing
 is
 it's
 a
 price
 weighted


index.
 How
 much
 of
 a
 signal
 can
 you
 get


from
 that?


Matt
 Matt,
 remember
 way
 back
 when
 we


only
 used
 to
 like
 talk
 largely
 about
 the


Dow?


I
 remember
 Dow
 6000.
 I
 know.
 All right,


let's
 go
 to
 the
 S&P
 500.
 We'll
 put
 the


Dow
 aside
 for
 a
 moment.
 Uh
 most
 names
 in


the
 index
 higher,
 guys,
 today.
 359


gaining
 ground
 142
 to
 the
 downside.


Matt,
 two
 unchanged.


Take
 a
 look
 at
 the
 uh
 industry
 groups


moving
 higher
 and
 you'll
 see
 um
 pretty


much
 all
 of
 them
 that
 aren't
 defensive


did.
 So,
 you've
 got
 consumer
 staples


down.
 And
 if
 you
 uh
 look
 at
 the
 S&P,


which
 is,
 I
 think
 Katie
 agrees,
 you


know,
 much
 better
 yard
 stick.


It's
 the
 index
 you
 you
 can
 see
 that
 um


you
 had
 a
 lot
 of
 consumer
 staples
 on
 the


downside,
 Proctor
 and
 Gamble,
 uh
 you
 had


Philip
 Morris
 at
 one
 point
 one
 of
 the


biggest
 losers
 on
 the
 index.
 Altria


Group
 also
 these
 are
 things
 that
 you


know
 you
 uh
 either
 need
 to
 buy
 again


every
 month
 or
 you're
 just
 addicted
 to


so
 you
 have
 no
 choice.
 Um
 but
 for
 the
 uh


for
 the
 most
 part
 you
 had
 every
 other


group
 rising
 healthcare
 you
 see
 down
 but


really
 just
 unchanged.


All right
 guys,
 let's
 get
 to
 some
 of
 the


individual
 gainers.
 No
 surprise
 I'm


going
 to
 talk
 about
 Broadcom.
 Of
 course,


ticker
 AVGO
 up
 as
 much
 as
 uh
 almost
 11%


finishing
 the
 day
 with
 a
 gain
 of
 just


shy
 of
 10%.
 Number
 two
 gainer
 in
 the
 S&P


500,
 number
 one
 gainer
 in
 the
 NASDAQ


100.
 No,
 number
 two,
 forgive
 me.
 Uh
 but


nonetheless,
 uh
 really
 just
 pushed
 the


whole
 semis
 sector
 higher
 in
 today's


session.
 This
 as
 uh
 OpenAI
 signed
 a


multi-year
 agreement
 with
 Broadcom
 to


collaborate
 on
 custom
 chips
 and


networking
 equipment.
 So,
 it's
 the


latest
 step
 in
 OpenAI's
 ambitious
 uh


plan
 to
 add
 computing
 infrastructure,


but
 it
 really
 gave
 some
 juice
 to


Broadcom.
 All right.
 The
 other
 thing
 uh


that
 was
 kind
 of
 a
 broader
 uh
 story


today
 was
 um
 when
 you
 look
 at
 rare
 earth


and
 critical
 mineral
 stocks
 uh
 rising


following
 strong
 gains
 among
 Asian


peers,
 fresh
 tensions
 between
 Beijing


and
 Washington
 over
 China's
 exports
 of


critical
 minerals,
 fueling
 bets
 on


alternative
 suppliers.
 So,
 two
 names
 I


just
 want
 to
 uh
 show.
 Critical
 uh


materials,
 critical
 medicals.
 Yeah.
 Try


this
 again.


Uh
 shall
 we
 try
 that
 again?
 Take
 two


everybody.
 3
 2
 1.
 Critical
 metals
 up


almost
 55%
 in
 today's
 session.
 And
 then


MP
 materials
 up
 just
 about
 21%.
 Remember


MP
 materials
 is
 the
 one
 that
 the
 US


government
 has
 taken
 a
 stake
 in
 along


with
 some
 other
 uh
 investments
 in
 raw


materials
 companies.
 And
 then
 I
 got
 to


mention
 Warner
 Brothers
 up
 uh
 almost
 4%


here.
 this
 as
 the
 company
 according
 to


reports
 that
 cited
 people
 familiar
 with


the
 matter
 rejected
 Paramount
 Sky


Dance's
 initial
 takeover
 approach
 for


being
 too
 low.


Can
 I
 just


go
 ahead


can
 I
 just
 uh
 interject
 with
 a
 little


bit
 of
 an
 editorial
 comment?


This
 is
 very
 Roma
 of
 you.
 So
 go
 ahead.


I
 know
 I'm
 like
 what?
 I
 thought
 I
 could


get
 through
 it
 and
 then
 just
 pass
 the


baton.
 No,
 because
 Carol,
 because
 you


and
 Tim
 were
 there
 at
 screen
 time
 last


week
 and
 I
 Lucas
 Shaw's
 conversation


with
 David
 Ellison
 was
 amazing.


It
 was
 amazing.


I
 understand
 so
 much
 more
 about
 the


company,
 about
 the
 industry,
 about
 their


aim.
 Um,


that's
 funny
 because
 Laura
 Martin
 of


Needam
 said,
 she
 goes,
 "I
 don't
 feel


like
 that
 David
 Ellison
 has
 really
 laid


out
 his
 strategy
 that
 he
 keeps
 making


these
 acquisitions
 but
 not
 kind
 of


saying
 what
 the
 overall
 strategy
 is."


I'm
 just
 just
 sharing
 you
 cuz
 she
 talked


with
 us
 at
 screen
 time.


I
 just
 thought
 it
 was
 good.
 So
 good.
 Go


back
 and
 listen
 to
 it
 if
 you
 haven't.


Or
 buy
 tickets
 for
 next
 year.
 Bailey,


there
 were
 stocks
 that
 fell
 today.


There
 are
 stocks
 that
 fell
 today
 and
 the


worst
 performer
 in
 the
 S&P
 500
 is
 not
 in


the
 Dow
 Jones
 Industrials.
 Katie,
 that


is
 fast
 and
 all.
 Ticker
 FAS
 falling
 the


most
 since
 March
 2020.
 This
 came
 after


earnings.
 CEO
 told
 Carol
 and
 I
 that


their
 stock
 was
 actually
 priced
 to


perfection
 and
 that's
 why
 they
 were


down.
 But
 analysts
 called
 out
 some
 soft


pricing
 overshadowing
 results
 that
 at


the
 top
 line
 actually
 weren't
 that
 bad.


And
 I
 want
 to
 call
 out
 this
 second
 and


third
 worst
 performers
 in
 the
 S&P
 500


casino
 stocks.
 We
 saw
 both
 Las
 Vegas


Sands
 and
 Win
 Resorts
 under
 pressure


each
 falling
 more
 than
 6%.
 Not
 because


people
 aren't
 going
 to
 Las
 Vegas,
 but


there's
 a
 holiday
 on
 the
 other
 side
 of


the
 world
 and
 that's
 Golden
 Week.
 And
 we


saw
 Macau
 data
 disappointing.
 So


investors
 really
 selling
 down
 those
 two


stocks.
 Again,
 Las
 Vegas
 Sands
 ticker


LVS
 down
 more
 than
 6%
 worst
 drop
 since


earlier
 uh
 in
 the
 month,
 but
 closing
 at


the
 lowest
 level
 since
 June.
 And
 guys,
 I


just
 want
 to
 wrap
 up
 with
 one
 of
 my


favorite
 stocks
 to
 cover.
 Beyond
 Meat,


ticker
 BN.


Is
 that
 cuz
 you
 like
 to
 eat
 it?


I
 do
 not
 like
 to
 eat
 it.
 It's
 I'm


questioning
 I
 question
 it.
 It's
 a
 little


concerning
 how
 it
 bleeds,
 but
 it
 was
 it


was
 at
 one
 point
 one
 of
 the
 best
 stocks


to
 IPO
 ever.


Very
 real.
 It
 was
 it
 was
 it
 was
 you
 know


it's
 a
 very
 logical
 fundamental
 uh


argument
 at
 least
 when
 when
 the
 stock


was
 trading
 for
 whatever
 number
 it
 was


but
 closing
 at
 a
 record
 low
 losing
 about


half
 its
 value.
 This
 came
 after
 debt


investors
 swap
 their
 notes
 for
 shares


diluting
 investors.
 So
 it
 does
 seem
 like


uh
 slow
 burn
 to
 the
 end
 for
 Beyond
 Meat.


Yeah,
 pour
 out
 some
 beet
 juice
 for


Beyond
 Meat.
 The
 bond
 market
 was
 closed


today.
 It
 was
 one
 of
 those
 weird
 days


where
 equities
 were
 open,
 bonds
 were


closed.
 I
 want
 to
 take
 a
 look
 at
 TLT


here
 though.
 This
 of
 course
 tracks


20-year
 treasuries
 and
 beyond.
 And
 you


can
 see
 that
 it's
 just
 about
 flat
 on
 the


day.
 It
 opened
 up
 lower.
 That
 would
 have


meant
 that
 yields
 were
 higher,
 but
 you


can
 see
 it
 finished
 just
 about


unchanged.
 So
 that
 sets
 us
 up.
 Well,


shall
 we
 talk
 about
 Taylor
 Swift
 though


because
 she
 did
 have
 an
 impact
 in
 the


stock
 market
 here.
 I
 I
 wonder
 if
 Carol


if
 you
 know
 the
 way
 that
 Katie
 talks


about
 Taylor
 Swift
 and
 her
 impact
 or
 her


importance


respectfully.


Um


yeah,
 I
 call
 her


What
 do
 you
 say?


I
 call
 her
 the
 Bob
 Dylan
 of
 our


generation,
 the
 millennial
 generation


for
 millennial
 women.
 And
 I'm
 willing
 to


back
 that
 up.
 I'm
 not
 the
 biggest
 Taylor


Swift
 fan
 out
 there,
 Carol.
 I
 am
 a
 huge


fan.
 But
 just
 in
 terms
 of
 her
 impact,
 I


think
 that
 that's
 a
 pretty
 fair


characterization.


Well,
 you
 know
 what's
 interesting?
 You


talk
 about
 impact
 and
 you
 know
 some
 of


it
 is
 just
 what
 she
 does
 up
 on
 stage
 um


fighting
 for
 rights
 in
 terms
 of
 owning


your
 own
 um
 material
 if
 you
 will
 but


she's
 also
 become
 pretty
 wealthy
 and


with
 money
 comes
 influence
 and
 I
 just


want
 to
 mention
 I
 know
 we're
 going
 to
 go


back
 to
 Taylor
 but
 there's
 an


interesting
 story
 on
 the
 Bloomberg
 about


how
 kind
 of
 Wall
 Street's
 been
 getting


ready
 for
 this
 incredible
 wealth


transfer
 of
 like
 105
 trillion
 to
 pass


from
 elderly
 parents
 to
 children
 but


Bailey
 there's
 actually
 a
 different
 kind


of
 wealth
 transfer
 uh
 already
 underway


and
 we're
 talking
 about
 women
 who
 are


actually
 becoming
 billionaires
 after
 the


death
 of
 their
 spouses.


Yeah.
 Bloomberg
 reporting
 that
 more
 than


a
 dozen
 women
 in
 the
 world's
 500
 richest


people
 have
 become
 billionaires
 because


of
 that
 overseeing
 fortunes
 totaling
 365


billion
 dollars.
 That's
 a
 lot
 of
 money


to
 be.


Yeah.
 And
 it
 means
 a
 lot
 of
 influence


whether
 it's
 you
 know
 philanthropy
 um


finance
 consumer
 goods
 get
 like
 a
 lot
 of


things.
 So
 now
 we
 go
 back
 to
 Taylor
 who


is
 pretty
 wealthy
 and
 she's
 influential.


You
 know
 Katie
 and
 I
 uh
 we
 used
 to


co-anchor
 a
 show
 called
 Bloomberg
 Open


Interest.


It
 still
 airs
 I'm
 told


9
 to11
 weekdays.
 Tune
 in.
 Um
 we
 talked


to
 Sally
 Crotch
 on
 that
 program
 if
 you


recall
 and
 she
 said
 that
 um
 we're
 going


to
 see
 like
 I
 think
 massive
 numbers
 like


35
 or
 40
 trillion
 dollars
 shifted
 in


this
 silver
 tsunami.
 Maybe
 it
 was
 uh


even
 more.
 But
 the
 lion's
 share
 of
 that


is
 going
 to
 shift
 from
 the
 control
 of


men
 to
 the
 control
 of
 women.
 So
 that's


going
 to
 be


as
 it
 should.


It's
 really
 interesting
 too.
 You
 think


about
 all
 the
 different
 ripple
 effects


there.
 One
 of
 them
 being
 what
 does
 this


mean
 for
 the
 financial
 advisor


community.
 There
 are
 a
 lot
 of
 things


that
 we'll
 have
 to
 adjust
 to
 sort
 of


accommodate
 what
 that
 new
 phase
 of


wealth
 looks
 like.


I
 heard
 Carol
 and
 Tim
 talking
 to
 April


Ruden
 about
 this
 last
 week.


Oh
 my
 god,
 I'm
 so
 God,
 I'm
 just
 warmed.


He's
 your
 biggest
 fan.


I
 thought
 we
 were
 going
 to
 talk
 about


the
 docu
 series.
 Like


she's
 going
 to
 make
 she's
 going
 to
 make


a
 six-part
 docu
 series
 about
 the
 eras


tour,
 which
 regardless
 of
 how
 you
 feel


about
 her
 music,
 even
 if
 you
 think
 that


she
 only
 had
 one
 good
 album
 in
 her


entire
 catalog,
 the
 one
 about
 the


cardigan
 and


folklore.


Uh,
 exactly.


1989.
 But
 sure,
 you
 still
 can't
 deny
 the


impact
 that
 her
 AOS
 tour
 had
 on,
 you


know,
 the
 global
 economy.
 Really?


I
 saw
 it
 in
 Toronto
 and
 let
 me
 tell
 you


that
 was
 a
 production.
