 what

 the

during

 the

 they

 this

 has
 raised
 questions
 about


their

 the

 recent


focus

 has
 become
 a


lightning

 Black

 the

 what

 what

the
 Carlile
 group
 embodies
 the


intersection
 of
 political
 power
 and


private


Equity
 founded
 in

 in
 Washington

Carlile
 turned
 political

into
 a
 business

 initially
 focusing


on

 at

 of

their

 included


former

 and

 managing

 Bridgewater

 has
 grown


into
 the
 world's
 larg
 EST
 hedge
 fund


managing
 roughly
 $150
 billion
 in
 assets


but
 what
 truly
 sets
 Bridgewater
 apart


isn't
 just
 its
 size
 it's
 their
 radical


approach
 to
 both
 investing
 and
 corporate


culture
 Bridgewater's
 Flagship
 pure


Alpha
 strategy
 has
 returned
 an
 average


of


11.5%
 annually
 since


1991
 weathering
 multiple
 Market
 crashes


their
 success
 stems
 from
 a
 unique
 macro


investing
 approach
 that
 combines
 deep


economic
 research
 with
 sophisticated


computer
 modeling
 to
 identify
 Global


Market
 patterns
 during
 the
 2008


financial
 crisis
 While
 most
 funds


collapsed
 Bridgewater's
 main
 fund
 gained


99.5%
 but
 it's
 Doo's
 Infamous
 company


culture
 that
 captures
 headlines


operating
 under
 radical


transparency
 every
 meeting
 is
 recorded


and
 employees
 are
 encouraged
 to
 publicly


criticize
 anyone
 including
 Doo
 himself


workers
 rate
 each
 other's
 performance
 in


real

 through
 an
 app
 called
 The
 Dot


collector
 this
 unusual
 approach
 has
 led


some
 to
 call
 Bridgewater
 a
 cult
 While


others
 view
 it
 as
 the
 future
 of


management
 The
 Firm
 pioneered
 the
 risk


parity
 approach
 through
 their
 all-


weather
 portfolio
 which
 has
 become
 a


blueprint
 for
 institutional
 investors


worldwide
 even
 as

 World
 Vanguard
 revolutionized


investing
 through
 a
 radical
 idea
 instead


of
 trying
 to
 beat
 the
 market
 why
 not


just
 own
 it
 founded
 by
 Jack
 Bogle
 in


1975
 Vanguard
 introduced
 the
 first
 Index


Fund
 for
 retail
 investors
 a
 move


initially
 mocked
 as
 unamerican
 by
 Wall


Street
 but
 that
 would
 ultimately


transform
 the
 entire
 investment


landscape
 with
 over
 8
 trillion
 do
 in


assets
 today
 vanguard's
 true
 Innovation


isn't
 just
 in
 what
 they
 invest
 in
 but
 in


their
 unique
 ownership
 structure
 unlike


other
 investment
 firms
 Vanguard
 is
 owned


by
 its
 own
 funds
 which
 are
 in
 turn
 owned


by
 their
 investors
 this
 Mutual
 ownership


model
 allows
 them
 to
 consistently
 offer


some
 of
 the
 lowest
 fees
 in
 the
 industry


saving
 investors
 billions
 annually
 their


impact
 on
 Wall
 Street
 has
 been
 profound


the
 rise
 of
 passive
 investing
 largely


pioneered
 by
 Vanguard
 has
 forced
 a


fundamental
 shift
 in
 how
 Market
 markets


operate
 together
 with
 black
 rock
 they


effectively
 control
 about
 15%
 of
 voting


shares
 in
 most
 major
 US
 companies
 this


concentration
 of
 power
 has
 led
 some
 to


call
 them
 the
 new
 Kings
 of


capitalism
 but
 perhaps
 vanguard's
 most


lasting
 Legacy
 is
 democratizing


investment
 by
 making
 lowcost
 Diversified


investing
 accessible
 to
 average
 people


they've
 helped
 millions
 of
 Americans


build
 wealth
 for
 retirement
 the
 Vanguard


off
 effect
 continues
 to
 drive
 down
 fees


across
 the
 industry
 fundamentally


changing
 how
 money
 is
 managed
 globally


these
 eight
 investment
 Giants


collectively
 managing
 over2
 trillion


represent
 more
 than
 just
 Financial
 power


they're
 reshaping
 the
 very
 nature
 of


capitalism
 through
 technological


dominance
 like
 black
 Rock's
 Aladdin
 and


renaissance's
 Quantum

 they've


created
 an
 unprecedented
 concentration


of

 their
 power
 extends


Beyond

 into

with
 firms
 like
 Goldman

 and


Carlile
 group
 blurring
 the
 lines
 between


public
 and
 private

 the
 future


their
 building
 is
 already
 visible


passive
 investing
 and
 quantitative

 are
 replacing
 traditional

 picking
 artificial

 is


becoming
 Central
 to
 investment

and
 their
 influence
 extends
 into


everything
 from
 climate
 policy
 to


corporate
 governance
 as
 these
 firms


continue
 to
 grow
 the
 fundamental


question
 question
 isn't
 about
 their


financial
 success
 but
 about
 their
 role


in

 they're
 not
 just


participating
 in

 anymore
 they're


creating
 the
 new

 of
 global


capitalism
