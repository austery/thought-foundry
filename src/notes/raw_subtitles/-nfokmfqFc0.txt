From
 the
 New
 York
 Times,
 it's
 the


headlines.
 I'm
 Tracy
 Mumford.
 Today's


Friday,
 October
 17th.
 Here's
 what
 we're


covering.


[Music]


Today
 at
 the
 White
 House,
 Ukrainian


President
 Vladimir
 Zalinski
 will
 meet


with
 President
 Trump.
 The
 two
 are


expected
 to
 talk
 about
 a
 big
 thing
 on


Zilinsk's
 wish
 list,
 Tomahawk
 missiles.


Ukraine
 is
 eager
 to
 buy
 them
 from
 the
 US


because
 they
 have
 a
 range
 of
 more
 than
 a


thousand
 miles,
 allowing
 the
 country
 to


strike
 even
 deeper
 into
 Russia.
 Lately,


it's
 been
 ramping
 up
 its
 campaign
 to


cause
 as
 much
 damage
 as
 possible
 to


Russian
 targets,
 like
 oil
 refineries,
 as


a
 way
 to
 bring
 Russia
 to
 the
 negotiating


table.
 The
 Tomahawks
 would
 be
 the


longest
 range
 weapons
 the
 US
 has
 ever


provided
 to
 Ukraine.
 And
 Trump
 said


earlier
 this
 week
 he
 was
 open
 to
 making


the
 sale.
 The
 Pentagon
 drew
 up
 plans
 to


transfer
 the
 missiles,
 awaiting
 Trump's


order.
 But
 yesterday,
 Trump
 got
 on
 the


phone
 with
 Russian
 leader
 Vladimir


Putin.
 After
 speaking
 with
 him
 for
 2


hours,
 Trump
 abruptly
 changed
 his
 tone


on
 the
 weapons.


>> We
 have
 uh
 a
 lot
 of
 them,
 but
 we
 need


them.
 I
 mean,
 we
 uh
 we
 can't
 deplete
 for


our
 country.
 So,
 you
 know,
 they're
 very


vital.
 They're
 very
 powerful.
 He


suggested
 he
 might
 hold
 them
 back
 if


Putin
 is
 willing
 to
 negotiate
 an
 end
 to


the
 war.


>> Right.
 But
 did
 President
 Putin
 try
 to


dissuade
 you
 from
 selling
 Tomahawk


missiles?


>> Well,
 of
 course.
 What
 do
 you
 think
 he's


going
 to
 say?
 Please
 sell
 Tommahawks.


>> Trump's
 apparent
 pivot
 on
 the
 missiles


is
 part
 of
 a
 pattern
 of
 how
 he's
 dealt


with
 Putin.
 Multiple
 times
 this
 year,


Trump
 has
 been
 on
 the
 brink
 of
 putting


new
 sanctions
 on
 Russia
 or
 giving
 new


military
 aid
 to
 Ukraine,
 only
 to
 have
 a


conversation
 with
 Putin
 and
 come
 out
 of


it
 pushing
 for
 more
 talks
 instead.
 Each


time,
 Putin
 has
 then
 continued
 the


Russian
 assault
 on
 Ukraine.
 Critics
 say


it's
 a
 trap
 that
 Trump
 has
 fallen
 into


again.
 Trump
 says
 he
 plans
 to
 meet
 with


Putin
 face
 to
 face
 in
 the
 next
 two
 weeks


at
 a
 summit
 in
 Hungary.


[Music]


On
 Thursday,
 John
 Bolton,
 President


Trump's
 former
 national
 security


adviser,
 was
 indicted
 for
 mishandling


classified
 information.
 He's
 facing
 18


counts
 that
 could
 send
 him
 to
 prison
 for


the
 rest
 of
 his
 life.
 Prosecutors
 say


that
 when
 Bolton
 was
 serving
 in
 Trump's


first
 term,
 he
 sent
 more
 than
 a
 thousand


pages
 of
 notes
 about
 his
 day-to-day


activities,
 which
 included
 top
 secret


defense
 information,
 to
 his
 family


members.
 Those
 notes
 sometimes
 came
 from


his
 AOL
 or
 Gmail
 accounts.
 At
 one
 point,


prosecutors
 say
 Bolton
 followed
 one
 of


them
 up
 with
 a
 message
 saying,
 quote,


"None
 of
 which
 we
 talked
 about."


Exclamation
 point
 exclamation
 point.
 The


person
 responded,
 "Sh."
 Making
 matters


worse,
 Bolton's
 emails
 were
 later
 hacked


by
 someone
 associated
 with
 the


government
 of
 Iran.
 Bolton's


relationship
 with
 Trump
 eventually


imploded,
 and
 Bolton
 went
 on
 to
 publish


a
 highly
 critical
 behind-the-scenes
 book


about
 the
 administration.
 Now,
 he's
 the


latest
 in
 a
 string
 of
 Trump's
 perceived


enemies
 to
 be
 charged
 by
 the
 Justice


Department.
 But
 my
 colleague
 Devlin


Barrett,
 who
 covers
 the
 DOJ,
 says
 it
 is


different
 from
 the
 recent
 indictments
 of


former
 FBI
 Director
 James
 Comey
 and
 New


York
 Attorney
 General
 Leticia
 James.
 For


those
 cases,
 Trump
 installed
 his
 former


personal
 lawyer,
 who
 had
 no


prosecutorial
 experience,
 to
 bring
 the


charges.
 For
 one
 thing,
 the
 prosecutors


who
 have
 handled
 this
 case
 are
 the


career
 prosecutors
 inside
 the
 Justice


Department
 who
 normally
 handle
 national


security
 cases,
 and
 they're
 the
 ones


that
 brought
 this
 case
 to
 the
 grand
 jury


and
 got
 the
 indictment.
 It's
 also


different
 because
 this
 investigation,


which
 sort
 of
 began
 in
 the
 first
 Trump


administration,
 really
 gained
 new


momentum
 during
 the
 Biden
 years
 and
 was


investigated
 and
 taken
 seriously
 during


the
 period
 of
 time
 in
 which
 Joe
 Biden


was
 the
 president
 and
 his
 attorney


general
 was
 running
 the
 Justice


Department.
 So,
 it's
 not
 the
 same


procedure,
 the
 same
 alarming
 procedure


that
 you
 saw
 in
 some
 of
 these
 other


cases
 involving
 people
 that
 Trump
 has


publicly
 criticized.


>> Bolton
 is
 expected
 to
 make
 his
 first


court
 appearance
 later
 today
 in


Maryland.
 In
 a
 statement,
 he
 said
 his


indictment
 was
 part
 of
 an
 intimidation


campaign
 against
 critics
 of
 President


Trump,
 writing,
 quote,
 I
 look
 forward
 to


the
 fight
 to
 defend
 my
 lawful
 conduct


and
 to
 expose
 his
 abuse
 of
 power.


[Music]


Now,
 two
 other
 updates
 on
 the
 Trump


administration.
 The
 US
 military


commander,
 who
 oversees
 all
 operations


in
 Central
 and
 South
 America,
 where
 the


US
 has
 been
 carrying
 out
 strikes
 on


boats
 it
 says
 were
 smuggling
 drugs,
 is


stepping
 down.
 Admiral
 Alvin
 Holy
 is


leaving
 the
 position
 suddenly,
 less
 than


a
 year
 into
 what's
 typically
 a


three-year
 job.
 It's
 unclear
 why,
 but


one
 current
 US
 official
 and
 one
 former


one
 told
 the
 Times
 that
 Holsey
 had


raised
 concerns
 about
 the
 recent
 boat


attacks.
 The
 administration
 has
 said
 the


strikes
 were
 necessary
 to
 prevent


dangerous
 drugs
 from
 entering
 the
 US,


though
 many
 experts
 in
 military
 law
 have


questioned
 the
 administration's
 claim


that
 it
 can
 lawfully
 kill
 people


suspected
 of
 drug
 trafficking
 instead
 of


arresting
 them.
 With
 Holse's
 departure,


there
 was
 no
 public
 mention
 of
 any


friction
 over
 that
 issue.
 Defense


Secretary
 Pete
 Hgsth
 thanked
 the
 admiral


for
 his
 service
 on
 social
 media
 and


Holsey
 in
 a
 statement
 urged
 those
 in
 his


command
 to
 quote
 keep
 charging.


Also,


>> the
 initiatives
 I've
 just
 announced
 are


the
 boldest
 and
 most
 significant
 actions


ever
 taken
 by
 any
 president
 to
 bring
 the


miracle
 of
 life
 into
 more
 American


homes.
 And
 I
 will
 say
 Katie


>> in
 the
 Oval
 Office
 yesterday,
 President


Trump
 announced
 an
 initiative
 to
 make
 in


vitro
 fertilization
 more
 accessible
 for


Americans.
 He
 said
 the
 goal
 is
 to
 reduce


the
 cost
 of
 the
 drugs
 necessary
 for
 IVF


and
 to
 encourage
 more
 employers
 to
 offer


coverage
 for
 it
 just
 like
 they
 do
 dental


or
 vision.
 At
 the
 moment,
 it's
 unclear


how
 much
 the
 plan
 will
 lower
 the
 price,


which
 can
 hit
 15
 or
 $20,000
 for
 a
 single


IVF
 cycle,
 or
 if
 companies
 will
 get
 on


board.
 The
 announcement
 is
 one
 of


Trump's
 clearest
 efforts
 yet
 to
 embrace


the
 pro-Natalist
 movement,
 which
 is


aimed
 at
 raising
 the
 US
 birth
 rate.
 Dr.


Meett
 Oz,
 who
 joined
 the
 administration


in
 April,
 said
 at
 the
 event,
 quote,
 "I


know
 what
 you're
 all
 thinking,
 and


you're
 probably
 right.
 There
 are
 going


to
 be
 a
 lot
 of
 Trump
 babies."
 Notably,


the
 president
 stopped
 short
 of
 requiring


employers
 to
 cover
 IVF,
 potentially
 in


deference
 to
 some
 Christian


conservatives
 in
 his
 base
 who
 are


staunchly
 against
 the
 procedure,
 saying


they
 have
 ethical
 concerns
 with
 IVF


because
 it
 can
 involve
 discarding
 human


embryos.


[Music]


And
 finally,


>> welcome
 to
 Iran,
 a
 land
 of
 breathtaking


beauty
 and
 worldclass
 healthcare.
 The


Times
 has
 been
 covering
 how
 in
 Iran,


with
 the
 country's
 economy
 crippled
 by


war
 and
 sanctions,
 the
 government
 is


trying
 to
 promote
 medical
 tourism
 as
 a


way
 to
 bring
 in
 outside
 cash.
 Imagine


receiving
 the
 highest
 quality
 of
 care
 in


cuttingedge
 medical
 facilities
 all
 while


experiencing
 the
 warmth
 and
 hospitality


of
 Iran.


>> They've
 been
 pushing
 the
 country
 as
 a


destination
 for
 hair
 transplants,
 nose


jobs,
 and
 also
 for
 gender
 transition


surgeries
 for
 transgender
 foreigners.


For
 40
 years,
 Iran
 has
 performed
 more


gender
 transition
 surgeries
 than
 many


other
 countries
 in
 the
 world.
 But
 it's


not
 because
 the
 country
 has
 embraced


trans
 rights.
 It's
 because
 they
 have


extremely
 strict
 views
 on
 gender
 norms.


>> My
 colleague
 Pranav
 Boser
 has
 been


reporting
 on
 transition
 surgeries
 in


Iran.
 He
 says
 that
 for
 years
 the


conservative
 Iranian
 government
 has


forced
 gender
 non-conforming
 people
 to


undergo
 transition
 surgeries.
 For


example,
 a
 transman
 might
 be
 pressured


into
 having
 a
 mastctomy.
 People
 who


don't
 submit
 to
 them
 can
 face
 extreme


punishments
 like
 public
 flogging
 or
 even


the
 death
 penalty.
 Under
 that
 system,


Iranian
 doctors
 perform,
 by
 some


estimates,
 thousands
 of
 transition


surgeries
 every
 year,
 giving
 them


extensive
 experience
 in
 those


procedures.
 And
 Pronov
 says
 they're


charging
 foreigners
 a
 lot
 less
 than
 they


would
 pay
 elsewhere.
 For
 example,
 a


surgery
 that
 could
 cost
 $45,000
 in
 the


United
 States
 could
 go
 for
 10
 times


cheaper
 in
 Iran.
 You
 know,
 we
 found
 that


those
 cut
 rate
 prices
 are
 drawing


transgender
 individuals
 from
 as
 far
 away


as
 Australia,
 the
 United
 States,


Britain,
 and
 Europe.


But
 even
 as
 Iran
 is
 becoming
 more
 widely


advertised
 as
 the
 destination
 for
 gender


transition
 surgery,
 there's
 firstly


concerns
 about
 safety.
 Some
 activists


have
 likened
 the
 country's
 gender


clinics
 to
 butcher
 shops.
 And
 according


to
 some
 reports,
 there
 have
 been


complications
 like
 bleeding
 and


infection
 associated
 with
 the
 surgeries.


And
 adding
 to
 the
 risks
 are
 questions


about
 whether
 there
 will
 be
 rush


timelines.
 For
 operations
 that
 experts


say
 typically
 involve
 months
 of
 planning


and
 post-operative
 care,
 medical
 tourism


groups
 are
 marketing
 timelines
 as
 quick


as
 7
 to
 9
 days.


At
 the
 same
 time,
 many
 trans
 foreigners


traveling
 to
 Iran
 for
 transition
 surgery


who
 we
 spoke
 to
 described
 a
 tension
 and


conflict
 that
 they
 were
 navigating


because
 they
 were
 glad
 that
 there
 was
 a


place
 that
 they
 could
 go
 to
 to
 get


access
 to
 this
 sort
 of
 medical
 care
 that


they
 saw
 as
 life-saving.
 But
 they
 were


also
 troubled
 that
 the
 place
 that
 they


had
 to
 go
 to
 had
 such
 a
 long
 history
 of


targeting
 and
 persecuting
 LGBTQ
 people.


>> Those
 are
 the
 headlines.
 If
 you'd
 like


to
 play
 the
 Friday
 News
 quiz,
 stick


around.
 It's
 just
 after
 these
 credits.


This
 show
 is

Now,
 time
 for
 the
 quiz.
 Every
 week,
 we


ask
 you
 a
 few
 questions
 about
 stories


the
 Times
 has
 been
 covering.
 Can
 you


answer
 them
 all?


Okay,
 first
 up


it's
 not
 doing
 anything.


Not
 doing
 anything.


>> In
 recent
 weeks,
 there
 have
 been
 tense


confrontations
 between
 federal
 agents


and
 protesters
 across
 the
 country
 as


crowds
 have
 gathered
 to
 push
 back
 on
 the


government's
 escalating
 immigration


operations.


In
 one
 city,
 some
 of
 those
 protests
 have


had
 an
 unusual
 look
 with
 demonstrators


dressed
 as
 frogs,
 unicorns,
 raccoons,


pickles.
 We're
 in
 costumes
 to
 show
 just


how
 ridiculous
 that
 is.
 It's
 not
 a
 war


zone.


>> People
 even
 stred
 by
 an
 ice
 facility


there
 this
 past
 week
 in
 a
 coordinated


naked
 bike
 ride.


>> We're
 here
 representing
 peace.
 We're


here
 representing
 love.


>> Your
 question,
 what
 city
 is
 this


happening
 in?


The
 answer,
 Portland,
 Oregon.
 Those
 big


jiggling
 inflatable
 costumes
 have
 become


particularly
 popular
 at
 the
 protests


there,
 giving
 some
 otherwise
 intense


scenes
 with
 arrests
 and
 tear
 gas
 a
 sort


of
 surreal
 look.
 A
 man
 who's
 been


wearing
 a
 chicken
 onesie
 to
 protests


told
 the
 Times,
 quote,
 "It
 just
 makes
 it


seem
 sillier
 when
 they
 come
 after
 us."


Okay,
 next
 question.
 In
 the
 US,
 the


government
 shutdown
 has
 now
 stretched


into
 a
 third
 week.
 Flights
 have
 been


delayed.
 Workers
 are
 furoughed.
 Some


national
 parks
 have
 closed.
 And
 in
 DC,


anyone
 hoping
 to
 enjoy
 DC's
 beloved


museums
 is
 now
 out
 of
 luck.


>> The
 Smithsonian
 museums
 have
 shut.


>> Came
 here
 for
 an
 exhibit,
 so
 just
 a


little
 disappointed.
 Of
 course,


>> that
 means
 tourists
 are
 being
 turned


away
 from
 some
 of
 the
 most
 popular


destinations
 in
 the
 city
 where
 millions


of
 people
 go
 every
 year
 to
 see
 the


collections.
 We're
 going
 to
 ask
 you
 if


you
 can
 identify
 three
 of
 the
 most


iconic
 objects
 the
 Smithsonian
 has
 in


its
 possession.
 We'll
 give
 you
 a
 little


audio
 clues.
 Ready?
 Here's
 the
 first


one.
 It's
 some
 very
 famous
 footwear.


>> Give
 them
 back
 to
 me.
 Give
 them
 back.


>> Keep
 tight
 inside
 of
 them.
 Their
 magic


must
 be
 very
 powerful
 or
 she
 wouldn't


want
 them
 so
 badly.


>> You
 stay
 on
 this,
 Glenda,
 or
 I'll
 fix


you
 as
 well.


>> The
 answer,
 a
 set
 of
 ruby
 slippers
 that


Judy
 Garland
 wore
 when
 she
 played


Dorothy
 in
 the
 Wizard
 of
 Oz.
 There's
 no


place
 like
 home.
 There's
 no
 place
 like


home.


>> Okay,
 next
 one.
 It
 is
 the
 object
 that


inspired
 this
 pretty
 famous
 song.


[Music]


>> What
 object
 is
 that
 in
 Ode
 to?


The
 answer.


The
 Smithsonian
 has
 the
 actual
 star


spangled
 banner,
 the
 slightly
 tattered


American
 flag
 that
 flew
 over
 the


ramparts
 at
 Fort
 Mckenry
 in
 the
 rockets


red
 glare
 and
 all
 that
 during
 the
 War
 of


1812.


[Music]


And
 your
 last
 object
 is
 some
 important


gear
 from
 an
 athlete
 who
 sports


Illustrated
 called
 the
 sportsman
 of
 the


20th
 century.


>> I
 have
 rousled
 with
 an
 alligator.
 I
 done


tussled
 with
 a
 whale.
 out
 and
 handcuffed


lightning,
 throw
 thunder
 in
 jail.


>> Name
 that
 athlete
 and
 his
 gear
 that
 is


at
 the
 Smithsonian.


>> A
 little
 hint,
 you
 would
 not
 want
 to
 be


on
 the
 receiving
 end
 of
 it.


The
 answer,


Muhammad
 Ali's
 boxing
 gloves.


>> Only
 last
 week
 I
 murdered
 a
 rock.
 Angela


Stone,


>> known
 for
 his
 boxing
 more
 than
 his


humility.
 When
 Ali
 donated
 them
 to
 the


Smithsonian,
 he
 predicted
 the
 gloves


would
 become
 quote
 the
 most
 famous
 thing


in
 this
 building.


And
 final
 question,
 in
 Chicago
 last


year,


>> so
 you
 had
 to
 come
 and
 see
 for
 yourself,


huh?


>> I
 couldn't
 believe
 it
 until
 I
 saw
 with


my
 own
 eyes.


>> A
 segment
 of
 the
 sidewalk
 became
 one
 of


the
 city's
 most
 unexpected
 landmarks.


and
 an
 internet
 sensation.


>> It's
 not
 our
 favorite
 distinction
 in
 the


city
 of
 Chicago
 being
 known
 as
 the


rattiest
 city.
 This
 is
 not
 helping.


>> Nicknamed
 the
 Chicago
 rat
 hole
 or


splatouille.
 It
 was
 a
 mark
 where


something
 seemed
 to
 have
 fallen
 into
 the


cement
 while
 it
 was
 still
 wet,
 leaving
 a


pretty
 cartoony
 impression,
 complete


with
 what
 looks
 like
 little
 outstretched


arms.
 But
 this
 week,
 a
 team
 of


researchers
 announced
 the
 findings
 of
 an


investigation
 they'd
 done,
 saying,


quote,
 "We
 can
 affirmatively
 conclude


that
 this
 imprint
 was
 not
 created
 by
 a


rat."
 So,
 your
 question,
 what
 did
 they


find
 created
 it?
 I'm
 going
 give
 you
 four


options.
 A,
 a
 child's
 toy.
 B,
 a


squirrel.
 C,
 a
 prankster
 who
 drew
 it


into
 the
 cement.
 D,
 an
 unlucky
 frog.


Again,
 those
 options
 are
 toy,
 squirrel,


artistic
 human,
 or
 frog.


[Music]


The
 answer,


the
 scientists
 said
 they
 are
 99%
 certain


it
 was
 either
 an
 eastern
 gray
 squirrel


or
 a
 fox
 squirrel.
 Now,
 to
 be
 fair,


there
 were
 some
 rat
 hole
 truthers
 out


there
 all
 along,


>> but
 I
 just
 don't
 believe
 that
 a
 rat
 like


hops
 in
 the
 air
 and
 belly
 flaps
 straight


down.
 The
 theory
 goes
 that
 the
 squirrel


fell
 out
 of
 a
 tree
 onto
 the
 wet
 cement,


immortalizing
 itself.
 The
 scientists
 say


squirrels
 actually
 fall
 a
 lot.
 My


question,
 since
 there
 are
 definitely
 no


little
 footprints
 leading
 away
 from
 the


rat
 hole
 squirrel
 dent,
 um,
 what


happened
 to
 it?
 No,
 that
 is
 it
 for
 the


news
 quiz.
