Good
 morning
 everybody.
 Welcome
 back
 to


another
 episode
 of
 the
 market
 open.
 It


is
 Monday
 morning.
 We
 are
 live
 October


13th.
 We
 are
 back
 to
 action.
 Hope


everyone
 had
 a
 good
 weekend.
 It
 is


Monday
 and
 uh
 you
 know
 we
 are
 blessed
 to


live
 another
 day
 on
 this
 planet
 and
 get


to
 analyze
 the
 global
 capital
 equity


markets
 and
 boy
 are
 they
 giving
 us


something
 to
 analyze.
 This
 has
 been
 a


wild
 weekend.
 I
 could
 argue
 this
 is
 one


of
 the
 most
 wild
 weekends
 we've
 had
 all


year.
 Obviously
 the
 April
 tariff


liberation
 stuff
 was
 uh
 definitely
 a


moment
 in
 time
 that
 created
 some
 crazy


weekends,
 but
 this
 has
 been
 a
 crazy


weekend
 as
 well.
 We're
 going
 to
 go


through
 what
 happened
 on
 Friday,
 what


happened
 on
 Saturday
 and
 Sunday,
 what


happened
 literally
 this
 morning
 in


regards
 to
 the
 equity
 markets.


Obviously,
 the
 pre-markets
 are
 green.


For
 those
 that
 missed
 the
 news,
 Trump


had
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 pivot,
 which
 maybe


means,
 as
 Albert
 says
 right
 here,


October,
 could
 be
 back.
 Uh,
 and
 the


pivot
 essentially
 is
 Trump
 deescalating


the
 situation
 that
 caused
 the
 nasty
 3%


day
 on
 Friday
 that
 hurt
 all
 of
 us.
 uh


not
 only
 Trump
 JD
 Vance
 descent
 this


morning
 everyone
 in
 the
 administration


basically
 came
 out
 and
 said
 yeah
 it's


not
 as
 serious
 as
 like
 you
 might
 have


thought
 it
 was
 on
 Friday
 and
 as
 a
 result


uh
 you're
 getting
 a
 green
 premarket


you're
 getting
 a
 pretty
 green
 pre-market


so
 it
 is
 a
 lot
 to
 analyze
 a
 lot
 to
 get


into
 we
 got
 a
 bunch
 of
 other
 headlines


in
 general
 that
 we'll
 go
 through
 but
 as


you
 can
 take
 a
 look
 in
 the
 pre-markets


Robin
 got
 to
 132
 it's
 at
 144
 pounder
 got


to
 170
 it's
 at
 179
 Tesla
 got
 to
 410
 it's


at
 422
 the
 S&P
 was
 647


after
 hours
 on
 Friday.
 It's
 at
 661.
 So
 I


mean
 now
 we're
 still
 down
 from
 673.
 It's


obviously
 been
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 rough
 3


4
 days
 based
 on
 that
 Trump
 China
 tweet


which
 kind
 of
 caused
 all
 of
 this.
 But


based
 on
 the
 pivot
 we
 got
 over
 the


weekend
 and
 we'll
 talk
 about
 kind
 of


what
 that
 pivot
 was.
 You're
 seeing
 a
 lot


of
 green.
 Bitcoin
 and
 Ethereum
 they
 have


uh
 rebounded.
 Ethereum
 was
 at
 3,400.


It's
 at
 4160
 down
 a
 little
 bit
 from


where
 it
 was
 yesterday.
 Bitcoin
 was
 at


106
 down
 from
 126.
 Right
 now
 it's
 at


114.
 So,
 I
 don't
 think
 it's
 the
 worst


thing
 in
 the
 world
 to
 at least
 get
 that


bit
 of
 a
 rebound.
 But,
 you
 do
 have
 these


two
 that
 have
 been
 hurt
 from
 the
 Trump


Truth
 Social
 China
 announcements
 and


hopefully
 throughout
 the
 coming
 week


they'll
 be
 able
 to
 rebound
 and
 we'll
 be


able
 to
 to
 go
 from
 there.
 So,
 there
 we


go.
 We
 got
 a
 lot
 to
 talk
 about,
 a
 lot
 to


get
 into.
 Thank
 you
 everybody
 for
 being


here
 again.
 It
 is
 Monday,
 Monday


morning.
 Um,
 the
 sync
 of
 the
 audio,
 I


noticed
 that
 last
 night.
 I
 think
 I


genuinely
 I
 think
 that's
 a
 YouTube


thing.
 It's
 either
 a
 YouTube
 thing
 or
 a


Streamyard
 thing.
 I'm
 leaning
 more


towards
 that's
 a
 YouTube
 thing.
 If
 you


refresh
 that
 might
 get
 fixed,
 but
 also


it
 might
 naturally
 just
 get
 fixed
 in
 a


couple
 minutes
 because
 it
 was
 happening


last
 week
 and
 it
 got
 fixed.
 So,
 I
 think


the
 sync
 thing
 should
 be
 fixed
 pretty


soon.
 But,
 it's
 definitely
 not
 I
 I
 don't


think
 it's
 me.
 I
 don't
 think
 there's


anything
 I'm
 doing
 to
 get
 the
 sync
 up


here.
 There
 was
 a
 couple
 other


streamers.
 Tanner
 was
 having
 that


problem.
 There's
 a
 couple
 other


streamers
 that
 were
 having
 that
 issue.


So,
 hopefully
 it's
 not
 uh
 hopefully
 it's


not
 just
 me
 and
 and
 YouTube
 will
 fix
 it.


Just
 restart.
 Okay.
 Yeah,
 restart


YouTube.
 Okay.
 So,
 uh,
 raw
 floor
 lore


restarted
 YouTube
 and
 it
 fixed.
 So,


restart
 it
 and,
 uh,
 if
 you
 do
 that,
 that


should
 that
 should
 help
 out.
 Okay,
 cool.


So,
 uh,
 let's
 get
 into
 it.
 I
 think
 we'll


start
 off
 with
 a
 couple
 headlines
 that


we
 got
 this
 morning
 and
 then
 we'll
 get


into
 all
 the
 macro
 stuff
 that
 happened


over
 the
 weekend.
 First
 of
 all,
 BMR,


this
 broke
 literally
 five
 minutes
 before


I
 went
 live.
 Um,
 and
 we
 got
 confirmation


that
 Tom
 Lee
 bought
 more
 Ethereum.
 3


million
 ETH
 Tom
 Lee
 has
 now
 put
 on
 the


balance
 sheet.
 They
 bought
 202,000
 ETH


over
 the
 weekend.
 He
 writes,
 "The
 crypto


liquidation
 over
 the
 past
 few
 days


created
 a
 price
 decline
 in
 ETH,
 which


Bitmine
 took
 advantage
 of.
 We
 acquired


200,37
 ETH
 tokens
 over
 the
 past
 few


days,
 pushing
 our
 ETH
 holdings
 over
 to
 3


million
 or
 2.5%


of
 the
 supply
 of
 ETH.
 We
 are
 now
 more


than
 halfway
 towards
 our
 initial
 pursuit


of
 the
 alchemy
 of
 5%.
 Bit
 mine
 has
 not


started
 staking
 yet,
 and
 they
 want
 to


get
 into
 the
 staking
 game
 after
 they
 get


to
 that
 alchemy
 of
 5%.
 So
 it
 looks
 like


they
 are
 going
 to
 work
 really
 hard
 to


get
 to
 the
 process
 at
 which
 they
 could


stake.
 Uh
 and
 you
 know
 at
 the
 rate
 at


which
 they're
 going
 it
 seems
 like
 in
 the


next
 what
 next
 coming
 I
 don't know


couple
 months
 they're
 going to
 be
 able


to
 get
 there.
 And
 if
 they
 do
 that
 would


be
 quite
 incredible.
 So
 you
 do
 have
 Tom


Lee
 issuing
 that
 update
 as
 soon
 as
 uh


five
 minutes
 ago
 about
 the
 Ethereum
 that


they
 have
 on
 their
 balance
 sheet.
 Now,
 I


believe
 their
 net
 asset
 value
 is
 around


12.9
 billion
 if
 you
 add
 up
 everything


else
 that
 they
 have
 as
 well.
 Uh,
 so
 they


have,
 as
 you
 can
 see
 right
 here,
 yeah,


12.9
 billion,
 3
 million
 ETH,


unencumbered
 cash
 of
 104
 million.
 Other


crypto
 holdings,
 they
 have
 $134
 million


stake
 in
 Orbs,
 and
 I
 think
 they
 have


some
 Bitcoin
 as
 well.
 And
 so
 that
 gets


you
 a
 13
 billion
 uh
 net
 asset
 value.


Now,
 Bitine
 was
 hit
 the
 worst,
 I
 would


argue,
 almost
 a
 20%
 decline
 on
 Friday.


It
 fell
 all
 the
 way
 to
 47,
 rebounding


right
 here
 at
 5471.
 I
 don't
 think
 this


thing
 has
 to
 jump
 back
 to
 60
 anytime


soon,
 but
 it's
 nice
 to
 see
 it
 stabilize


a
 bit
 because
 Ethereum
 is
 stabilizing.


Nvidia
 as
 well.
 Nvidia
 fell
 all
 the
 way


to
 180,
 right
 back
 here
 to
 188
 after


going
 to
 195
 in
 the
 morning
 on
 Friday.
 I


mean,
 if
 you
 bought
 anything
 in
 the


morning
 on
 Friday,
 unfortunately,
 it
 was


just
 not
 the
 best
 timing
 and
 including


myself,
 right?
 Uh
 but
 nonetheless,
 you


did
 get
 an
 opportunity
 intraday
 and
 it


seems
 like
 we
 are
 rebounding.
 Not
 fully


recovered,
 but
 there
 is
 an
 opportunity


still
 potentially
 to
 get
 into
 some
 of


these
 names
 at
 a
 discount.
 And
 so
 you


got
 BMR
 and
 Nvidia
 trying
 to
 recover


back
 to
 where
 they
 were
 back
 on
 Friday.


So
 yes,
 they
 are
 halfway
 to
 that
 5%
 goal


and
 that
 5%
 goal
 obviously
 is
 going
 to


be
 very
 strong
 for
 them
 to
 get
 to.
 But


it
 is
 nice
 to
 see
 that
 they
 took


advantage
 of
 it.
 And
 why
 did
 they
 take


advantage
 of
 it?
 Well,
 you
 know,
 Tom
 Lee


believes
 in
 the
 broader
 ETH
 ecosystem


long
 term.
 And
 as
 a
 result
 of
 that


belief
 in
 the
 ecosystem,
 they're
 not


going
 to
 get
 scared
 if
 ETH
 falls
 10
 15%.


They're
 probably
 going
 to
 use
 that
 as


the
 best
 opportunity
 they
 can
 end
 up


buying
 the
 dip.
 And
 it
 seems
 like
 that


is
 what
 ended
 up
 playing
 out.
 So,
 uh


we'll
 calculate
 their
 new
 NAV,
 but
 they


do
 have
 13
 billion.
 And
 so,
 when
 the


market
 opens,
 we'll
 see
 what
 the
 uh
 NAV


is
 and
 what
 the
 premium
 to
 that
 NAV
 is


as
 well.
 And
 uh
 and
 we'll
 keep
 going


from
 there.
 So,
 that
 was
 the
 update
 we


got
 on
 Ethereum
 with
 Tom
 Lee.
 Now,
 in


terms
 of
 what's
 going
 on
 with
 US
 and


China,
 so
 just
 do
 a
 quick
 little
 recap


of
 what
 happened
 on
 Friday.
 Uh
 Trump


said
 that
 we
 are
 going
 to
 be
 imposing


100%
 tariffs
 on
 China
 and
 that
 is
 what


created
 the
 waterfall
 decline
 that
 we


all
 experienced
 live.
 In
 fact,


ironically,
 I
 clicked
 on
 Bitmine
 because


someone
 sent
 a
 super
 chat
 asking
 a


question
 about
 Bit
 Bitmine
 and
 we
 saw
 it


go
 from
 58
 to
 56
 and
 I
 was
 like,
 "Oh,


that's
 weird."
 We
 we
 clicked
 on
 the
 the


ticker
 as
 soon
 as
 the
 uh
 the
 stock


starts
 falling.
 They're
 probably


diluting
 at
 this
 moment,
 right?
 So


they're
 probably
 like
 Tom
 Le
 is


literally
 dumping
 shares
 in
 front
 of
 us


and
 we're
 watching
 it
 happen
 because


that
 type
 of
 a
 precipitous
 decline
 you


could
 only
 describe
 through
 some
 level


of
 mass
 selling.
 But
 then
 we
 looked
 at


the
 S&P,
 then
 we
 looked
 at
 Palanteer,


then
 we
 looked
 at
 Robin,
 then
 looked
 at


Rocket
 Lab,
 we're
 like,
 "Oh
 no,


everything's
 selling
 off."
 And
 so
 that


that
 actually
 started
 the
 discovery
 of


what
 the
 hell
 is
 happening.
 And
 what


ended
 up
 happening
 is
 Trump
 tweeted


that,
 "Hey,
 uh,
 we
 have
 a
 very
 very
 big


issue
 with
 China
 and
 we're
 going
 to
 have


to
 take
 action."
 He
 said
 that
 China's


threatening
 export
 controls
 and
 bans
 for


countries
 across
 the
 world
 and
 we
 might


have
 to
 respond
 to
 that.
 And
 then
 after


hours
 he
 made
 it
 worse
 by
 confirming


that
 America
 will
 impose
 a
 tariff
 of


100%
 on
 China
 over
 and
 above
 any
 tariff


that
 they
 are
 currently
 paying
 on


November
 1st.
 I
 mean
 quite
 literally


guys
 it
 this
 feels
 like
 April
 2.0


because
 and
 I
 I
 think
 retail
 really
 did


see
 through
 it.
 We're
 going
 to
 get
 more


data
 in
 the
 next
 coming
 days
 of
 how
 much


money
 retail
 put
 into
 this
 dip
 on


Friday.
 But
 based
 on
 what
 I
 asked
 on
 the


market
 close,
 I
 mean,
 a
 lot
 of
 you
 guys


bought
 the
 dip
 because
 a
 lot of
 you
 guys


just
 didn't
 believe
 that,
 oh,
 really,


November
 1st,
 we
 have
 a
 month
 for
 100%


tariffs?
 Yeah,
 I
 guess
 so.
 I
 mean,
 most


people
 were
 like,
 we're
 probably
 going


to
 negotiate
 something
 in
 a
 month
 and


there's
 probably
 going
 to
 be
 a
 very
 low


probability
 of
 Trump
 actually
 messing
 up


the
 bull
 market
 by
 putting
 on
 tariffs
 on


China
 after
 he
 just
 negotiated
 a
 China


deal.
 Like,
 it
 just
 didn't
 make
 sense


across
 the
 board.
 And
 it's
 not
 like
 it


wasn't
 treated
 as
 something
 serious,
 but


it
 was
 one
 of
 those
 things
 that
 was
 like


really
 is
 this
 going
 to
 be
 the
 thing


that
 messes
 up
 everything
 and
 it
 didn't


feel
 like
 that.
 And
 as
 a
 result,
 you
 get


this
 tweet
 Sunday
 afternoon
 and
 that's


when
 the
 future
 started
 going
 crazy.


Trump
 says,
 don't
 worry
 about
 China.
 It


will
 all
 be
 fine.
 This
 is
 not
 literally,


hey,
 it's
 a
 great
 time
 to
 buy,
 but
 I


mean,
 how
 much
 more
 explicit
 can
 you
 get


about
 probably
 it's
 a
 time
 to
 buy.
 You


shouldn't
 worry
 about
 anything.
 Highly


respected
 President
 Xi
 just
 had
 a
 bad


moment.
 He
 doesn't
 want
 depression
 for


this
 country
 and
 neither
 do
 I.
 the
 USA


wants
 to
 help
 China,
 not
 hurt
 it.
 And


that
 right
 there
 was
 the
 pivot.
 That


right
 there
 was
 when
 uh
 you
 know,
 it


wasn't
 Tuesday
 yesterday,
 but
 it
 but
 it


might
 as
 well
 have
 been
 Tuesday
 because


it
 was
 a
 taco
 Tuesday.
 And
 nonetheless,


Trump
 said,
 "Well,
 Z
 had
 a
 bad
 moment.


It's
 not
 that
 big
 of
 a
 deal
 and
 you


know,
 we're
 going
 to
 be
 okay."
 And
 then


you
 had
 JD
 Vance
 come
 out
 a
 couple
 hours


before
 that
 and
 says,
 "We
 appreciate
 the


friendship
 with
 China.
 Trump
 hopes
 that


we
 don't
 have
 to
 use
 leverage.
 Trump
 is


willing
 to
 be
 a
 reasonable
 negotiator."


And
 then
 you
 had
 Bend
 this
 morning
 that


said
 the
 USChina
 relationship
 is
 good.


100%
 tariffs
 doesn't
 have
 to
 happen
 aka


we
 don't
 really
 want
 to
 impose
 tariffs


and
 we'll
 see
 if
 China
 wants
 to
 be
 a


reliable
 supplier
 for
 rare
 earths.
 Now


China
 came
 out
 Saturday
 night
 which


already
 began
 deescalating
 the


situation.
 And
 they
 said
 look
 we're
 not


even
 trying
 to
 be
 that
 aggressive
 with


rare
 earth
 minerals
 and
 we
 want
 to
 work


with
 the
 United
 States.
 This
 is
 the
 post


right
 here
 translated
 uh
 from
 their


language
 into
 the
 United
 into
 English.


And
 basically
 they
 were
 saying
 export


controls
 are
 not
 a
 ban.
 Global
 civilian


supply
 chains
 aren't
 going
 to
 be


impacted.
 We're
 only
 doing
 this
 because


the
 US
 is
 being
 unfair
 in
 certain
 areas.


We
 want
 to
 work
 with
 the
 US.
 We
 don't


want
 to
 fight
 a
 trade
 war.
 It
 was
 a
 very


kind
 of
 like,
 hey,
 let's
 come
 to
 the


table.
 Let's
 have
 a
 conversation
 and


let's
 talk.
 And
 the
 way
 Trump
 framed
 it


on
 Friday,
 which
 is
 why
 it
 was
 kind
 of


scary
 when
 you
 saw
 everything
 falling


off
 is
 because
 Trump
 was
 like,
 China's


isolating
 from
 the
 entire
 world
 and
 it's


almost
 like
 it's
 a
 us
 against
 them
 and


we're
 about
 to
 decouple.
 I
 mean,
 that


was
 the
 tone
 that
 was
 being
 given
 off


from
 the
 tweets.
 It
 created
 a
 $20


billion
 liquidation
 in
 crypto
 which
 has


not
 been
 seen
 since
 co
 and
 and
 it
 wasn't


even
 near
 any
 of
 those
 levels
 during
 co


but
 it
 really
 created
 some
 issues
 only


for
 all
 of
 this
 to
 just
 come
 back
 to


normal
 and
 for
 the
 markets
 to
 realize
 oh


it's
 not
 that
 big
 of
 a
 deal
 and
 uh
 we


went
 down
 3%
 on
 this
 Trump
 China
 tweet


that
 had
 nothing
 to
 do
 with
 the
 earnings


picture,
 nothing
 to
 do
 with
 the
 Fed.
 I


guess
 the
 markets
 needed
 a
 reason
 to


come
 down
 and
 Trump
 gave
 them
 a
 reason


to
 come
 down
 but
 it
 wasn't
 actually
 as


serious
 as
 a
 structural
 flaw
 in
 the


broader
 thesis
 of
 the
 bull
 market
 right


now.
 And
 as
 a
 result,
 you
 have
 markets


starting
 to
 recover.
 So
 wild,
 wild,
 wild


weekend.
 And
 as
 a
 result
 of
 that


weekend,
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 got
 the


opportunity
 to
 buy
 the
 dip.
 Now,
 does


that
 mean
 you
 pile
 into
 the
 market


today?
 I
 I
 I
 don't
 think
 the
 answer
 is


yes.
 However,
 I
 think
 the
 perception
 of


this
 dip
 could
 be
 as
 follows.
 This
 is
 my


last
 opportunity
 to
 get
 in
 before
 Q4


run.
 uh
 these
 prices
 are
 likely
 not


going
 to
 give
 me
 better
 entry
 better


entries
 if
 there's
 not
 something


structural
 that
 changes
 the
 economy
 aka


the
 Fed
 interest
 rates
 earnings
 and


we're
 going to
 talk
 about
 earnings
 but


earnings
 this
 week
 look
 like
 they're


going
 to
 be
 pretty
 good
 so
 I
 need
 to
 buy


the
 dip
 and
 I
 think
 that
 is
 the
 the


mentality
 that
 could
 be
 happening


through
 retail
 investors
 and
 fund


managers
 that
 are
 underperforming
 the


S&P
 this
 year
 and
 might
 it
 might
 be


saying
 look
 you
 know
 I
 missed
 the
 entire


run
 and
 robbed
 at
 Nvidia
 but
 at least


I'm
 getting
 it
 10%
 lower
 than
 what
 I


could
 get
 it
 at
 alltime
 highs
 and
 I


don't
 know
 if
 there's
 going
 to
 be


another
 shock
 to
 the
 system
 as


aggressive
 as
 there
 was
 on
 Friday
 to
 get


these
 prices,
 especially
 going
 into


earning
 season.
 Now,
 maybe
 there
 are


multiple
 shocks
 of
 the
 system
 and
 maybe


Q4
 is
 going to
 be
 very
 bumpy
 going


throughout
 the
 end
 of the
 year,
 but
 I


think
 the
 mentality
 might
 be
 from
 a
 lot


of
 people,
 hey,
 this
 is
 my
 one
 last
 dip


to
 get
 in.
 Uh,
 does
 that
 mean
 today's


the
 day
 to
 to
 to
 to
 spend
 a
 ton
 of


money?
 I
 don't
 think
 so
 because
 I
 think


you
 still
 have
 to
 be
 cautious
 and
 I


think
 if
 you
 did
 spend,
 you
 know,
 if
 you


had
 100,000
 and
 you
 spent
 20,000
 on


Friday,
 you
 know,
 maybe
 you
 spend


another
 20,000
 a
 day
 and
 you
 still
 keep


that
 60,000
 left
 in
 case
 there's
 other


opportunities.
 But
 there
 might
 be
 some


people
 that
 are
 underperforming


massively
 this
 year
 and
 they
 may
 be


saying,
 "You
 know what?
 I've
 got
 to
 put


the
 final
 80,000
 I
 have
 into
 the
 market


because
 I've
 been
 waiting
 so
 long
 for
 a


dip.
 This
 probably
 is
 my
 opportunity.


And
 if
 I
 don't
 get
 another
 one,
 I'm


going
 to
 be
 on
 the
 sidelines
 until


probably
 early
 2026."
 And
 I
 and
 then
 I'm


going
 to
 be
 have
 to
 be
 hoping
 that
 2026


gives
 me
 a
 dip
 opportunity,
 which
 maybe


it
 does,
 maybe
 it
 doesn't.
 But
 if
 you're


hoping
 for
 that
 long,
 again,
 that
 might


not
 also
 be
 the
 best
 idea
 in
 the
 world.


So,
 as
 a
 result,
 yes,
 I
 do
 think
 it's


going to
 be
 a
 volatile
 week,
 but
 we're


going
 to
 have
 to
 see
 how
 much
 money
 ends


up
 coming
 in.
 We
 also
 have
 to
 see,
 is


this
 a
 rugpull?
 Is
 this
 a
 little bit
 of


a
 bull
 trap?
 I
 mean,
 that's
 a


possibility,
 right?
 I
 do
 think
 based
 on


how
 the
 futures
 are
 going
 and
 based
 on


Trump's
 statements,
 it
 might
 not
 easily


be
 a
 bull
 trap,
 but
 you
 might
 have


market
 makers
 that
 want
 to
 toy
 around


and
 pump
 things
 up
 and
 then
 rug
 it


midday
 and
 then
 maybe
 it
 comes
 back
 to


normal.
 So,
 this
 is
 going
 to
 be
 a
 very


important
 week.
 We
 do
 have
 earnings


starting,
 so
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 how
 the


earnings
 effects
 from
 those
 financials


uh
 are
 going to
 have
 on
 the
 psych


psychology
 of
 the
 market.
 But


nonetheless,
 that
 is
 something
 that
 I


think
 everyone
 does
 have
 to
 watch
 out


for.
 What
 about
 government
 shutdown


effect
 on
 on
 our
 economy?
 So,
 the


government
 shutdown
 is
 still
 in
 place


and
 hopefully
 it
 ends
 by
 the
 end
 of
 this


week.
 I
 mean,
 if
 it
 continues
 this
 week,


it'll
 be
 the
 second
 longest
 shutdown
 in


history.
 The
 uh
 the
 Trump
 administration


has
 come
 out
 and
 said
 that
 they
 are


finding
 a
 way
 to
 pay
 military
 members.


So,
 October
 15th
 in
 two
 days
 is
 when
 a


lot
 of
 those
 military
 members
 get
 paid.


And
 it
 looks
 like
 the
 Trump


administration
 is
 going
 to
 find
 a
 way
 to


make
 sure
 they
 get
 paid.
 That's
 what


Trump
 confirmed
 last
 night.
 But,
 they've


already
 started
 laying
 off
 a
 lot
 of


people.
 And
 so
 I
 mean
 I
 don't
 know
 what


the
 impact
 is
 going to
 be.
 So
 far


markets
 have
 basically
 said
 they
 don't


much
 about
 it
 just
 based
 on
 the
 sheer


price
 action.
 The
 reason
 we
 had
 a
 3%


decline
 is
 because
 of
 a
 China
 truth


social
 post
 not
 because
 of
 the


government
 shutdown.
 But
 if
 this
 goes


any
 longer
 obviously
 won't
 be
 the
 work


the
 best
 thing
 in
 the
 world.
 And
 so


that's
 one
 thing
 we're
 going to
 have
 to


keep
 an
 eye
 on
 as
 well
 going
 into
 uh


going
 into
 the
 end
 of
 this
 week.


I
 think
 the
 market
 maker
 is
 going to
 be


choppy.
 Yeah,
 I
 agree.
 I
 think
 well
 the


the
 thing
 is
 though
 if
 we
 get
 a
 strong


earning
 cycle
 and
 we'll
 talk
 more
 about


earnings
 I
 mean
 it
 you
 might
 just
 have
 a


lot
 of
 money
 saying
 dude
 we
 cannot
 deny


double
 digit
 earnings
 growth
 and
 the
 the


most
 important
 companies
 in
 the


financial
 space
 JP
 Morgan
 Wells
 Fargo


City
 Bank
 etc.
 By
 the
 way
 JPM
 made
 a
 big


announcement
 today
 that
 we'll
 talk
 about


as
 well
 they
 they
 got
 to
 set
 the
 tone


and
 if
 they
 set
 the
 tone
 I
 think
 it


would
 be
 very
 very
 exciting
 to
 see
 where


this
 market
 can
 go.
 Here
 is
 Tom
 Lee
 this


morning
 on
 what
 he
 thought
 about
 the


Friday
 selloff
 and
 where
 he
 thinks
 the


opportunities
 may
 lie.


>> Morgan's
 announcement
 today
 uh
 really


ties
 into
 why
 investors
 should
 stay


pretty
 constructive
 on
 the
 US.
 I
 mean
 JP


Morgan
 the
 biggest
 and
 one
 of
 the
 and


the
 most
 powerful
 bank
 in
 the
 world
 is


investing
 a
 trillion
 and
 a
 half
 dollars


into
 the
 US
 into
 things
 that
 are
 going


to
 strengthen
 sort
 of
 US
 advantages
 you


know
 critically
 important
 areas
 and
 at
 a


time
 when
 the
 US
 is
 dominating
 AI
 and
 of


course
 now
 we
 have
 this
 big
 tailwind
 as


as
 blockchain
 is
 an
 initiative
 that
 Wall


Street
 is
 is
 building
 products
 on.
 So,
 I


I
 think
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 reasons
 for


investors
 to
 stay
 optimistic.


And
 I
 know
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 talk
 about


bubbles,
 but
 I
 think
 the
 thing
 I
 would


just
 continue
 to
 point
 out
 is
 Nvidia


trades
 at
 around
 27
 times
 Ford
 earnings.


It's
 still
 on
 a
 PE
 basis
 cheaper
 than


Walmart
 and
 Costco,
 which
 trade
 at


around
 47
 and
 34
 times
 Ford
 earnings.


Yeah,
 we've
 got
 you
 you've
 got
 positive


um
 reasons
 to
 think
 that
 earnings
 are


are
 going
 to
 do
 well
 in
 a
 time
 when


interest
 rates
 are
 coming
 down.
 So
 that


that's
 just
 like
 an
 elixir
 for
 stocks


that
 that
 uh
 is
 very
 powerful.


>> That's
 right.
 And
 as
 you
 know,
 CEOs
 have


not
 been
 that
 confident
 for
 the
 last
 two


and
 a
 half
 years
 because
 the
 Fed's
 been


running
 tight
 monetary
 policy.
 The
 ISM's


been
 below
 50
 for
 31
 months
 now.
 That's


the
 longest
 stretch
 in
 history.
 Um
 I


think
 the
 sell
 off
 Friday
 is
 giving
 us
 a


bit
 of
 a
 gift
 because
 that
 surge
 in
 the


VIX
 32%
 rise
 is
 the
 39th
 highest
 ever


one
 day
 surge
 and
 the
 one
 month
 median


return
 is
 almost
 3%
 um
 of
 the
 38
 other


instances.
 So
 I
 think
 the
 S&P
 could
 add


you
 know
 200
 points
 between
 today
 and


and
 mid
 November.
 So,
 I
 think
 that's
 an


important
 stat.
 Tom
 Lee
 basically


saying,
 "Hey,
 every
 and
 we
 were
 talking


about
 this
 last
 night
 on
 the
 on
 the


future
 show.
 Every
 time
 the
 VIX
 has
 a


dramatic
 uh
 upswing,
 a
 spike,
 as
 you


could
 call
 it,
 of
 more
 than
 30%.
 38
 out


of
 the
 39
 times,
 Friday
 was
 the
 39th


time,
 the
 S&P
 is
 up
 a
 month
 later
 on


average
 3%.
 If
 that's
 the
 case,
 we're


going
 to
 recover
 everything
 that
 we
 lost


on
 Friday.
 If
 history
 repeats
 itself
 and


we
 have
 a
 VIX
 spike
 of
 up
 plus
 30%,


which
 usually
 tends
 to
 be
 a
 panic


moment,
 and
 usually
 in
 a
 panic
 moment,


you
 buy.
 You
 know,
 if
 the
 VIX
 gradually


goes
 up
 over
 the
 coming
 days
 and
 weeks,


then
 you
 tend
 to
 have
 like
 a
 more


prolonged
 sell-off.
 If
 you
 have
 a
 rapid


one
 day
 30%,
 and
 April
 it
 was
 one
 day


60%
 uh
 move
 on
 the
 VIX,
 that
 means


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 panic
 and
 that
 tends
 to


set
 a
 bottom
 in
 equities
 because
 that


that
 that
 uh
 that
 that
 panic
 essentially


signals
 that
 people
 should
 be
 buying


right
 here
 because
 it's
 not
 as
 serious


of
 an
 issue
 for
 why
 the
 markets
 are


collapsing.
 By
 the
 way,
 Broadcom
 right


here
 is
 up
 10%.
 Not
 really
 sure
 why.
 The


only
 headline
 I
 have
 on
 Broadcom
 is
 they


got
 an
 upgrade
 um
 to
 $400
 this
 morning,


but
 I
 don't
 think
 there's
 anything


deeper
 than
 that.
 Maybe
 Broadcom's
 just


recovering
 everything
 it
 lost
 on
 uh
 on


Friday.
 Now,
 it
 lost
 5%
 on
 Friday.
 So,


it's
 recovering.
 It's
 up
 10%
 right
 here.


Means
 it's
 up
 another
 net
 net
 5%.
 I


don't
 see
 any
 headlines
 though
 outside


of
 the
 upgrade.
 So,
 maybe
 there's


something
 else.
 I'll
 see
 if
 there's
 any


other
 news.
 But,
 if
 you're
 in
 Broadcom,


you're
 getting
 a
 10%
 move
 right
 here
 in


the
 pre-market.
 Oh,
 is
 this
 it?
 Open
 AAI


chip
 deal
 with
 Broadcom
 covers
 10


gigawatts
 of
 compute
 capacity.
 Broadcom


shares
 up
 12%
 based
 on
 the
 custom
 AI


deal
 with
 OpenAI.
 So
 this
 AI
 deal
 with


OpenAI
 was
 announced
 on
 their
 earnings.


I
 guess
 the
 the
 this
 the
 street
 is


reacting
 to
 Oh,
 hold
 on.
 I
 think
 I
 have


some
 coverage
 on
 it.
 The
 street
 is


reacting
 to
 the
 10
 gigawatt
 deployment


of
 it,
 which
 maybe
 that
 number
 wasn't


talked
 about,
 but
 the
 10
 billion
 dollar


partnership
 was
 talked
 about.
 Now
 10


gigawatts
 is
 way
 more
 than
 10
 billion.


Like
 way
 more
 than
 10
 billion.
 That's


closer
 to
 100
 billion.
 But
 let's
 uh


let's
 get
 an
 update
 right
 here.


>> And


>> Trump
 against
 China
 with
 its
 rare
 earth


magnet
 restrictions,
 you
 know,
 triggered


some
 some
 fears
 that,
 you
 know,
 here
 we


here
 we
 are
 again.
 I
 think
 the


consolatory
 post
 from
 President
 Trump


over
 the
 weekend
 toward
 China
 said
 it


will
 all
 be
 fine.
 Highly
 respected
 pre


tariffs
 on
 China.
 And
 I
 think
 Jim,
 the


other
 the
 other
 important
 point
 here
 is


that,
 you
 know,
 we
 are
 less.


>> Okay,
 so
 they're
 not
 talking
 about
 it


yet,
 but
 it
 looks
 like
 that's
 the
 case,


folks.
 Open
 AAI
 and
 Broadcom
 10
 gawatt.


My
 goodness,


that
 is
 massive,
 dude.
 That
 is
 not
 the


simple
 $10
 billion
 custom
 AS6
 deal
 they


had
 back
 in
 freaking


back
 in
 freaking
 uh
 in
 in
 in
 in


September
 when
 they
 announced
 their


earnings.


Dude,
 10
 gigawatts
 is
 different.


That
 That's
 a
 lot
 of
 money,
 dude.
 I
 mean


I
 mean
 Nvidia
 is
 doing
 a
 10
 gigawatt


deal.
 It's
 up
 13%
 right
 here.
 One
 could


argue
 it
 should
 be
 up
 even
 more.
 Now


granted,
 none
 of
 this
 is
 like
 finalized


or
 real.
 All
 this
 stuff
 is
 just


promises,
 but
 the
 perception
 of
 10


gigawatts
 is


Yeah,
 that's
 500
 billion,
 right?
 That's


not
 even
 100
 billion.
 That's
 closer
 to


500.
 This
 is
 like
 And
 if
 this
 is
 all
 for


AS6,


I
 mean,
 if
 you're
 a
 Broadcom


shareholder,
 you've
 got
 to
 be
 happy.


These
 are
 custom-designed
 AI


accelerators.
 These
 aren't
 uh
 regular


general
 purpose
 GPUs.


And
 one
 of
 the
 arguments
 the
 Broadcom


had
 back
 then
 when
 they
 signed
 this
 deal


with
 OpenAI
 is
 that,
 you
 know,
 OpenAI
 is


going to
 need
 more
 custom
 chips
 than


general
 purpose
 chips.
 Now,
 OpenAI
 said


they're
 going
 to
 need
 a
 lot
 of
 chips.


AMD
 chips,
 you
 know,
 Nvidia
 chips,


Broadcom
 chips,
 but
 that's
 big.
 That
 is


big.
 There
 you
 go.
 It
 looks
 like
 again


open
 AI
 continues
 to
 be
 at
 the
 center
 of


everything
 in
 AI.
 Whether
 it's
 getting


AMD
 stock
 to
 go
 up
 or
 getting
 Nvidia


stock
 to
 go
 up
 or
 getting
 Broadcom
 stock


to
 go
 up
 or
 getting
 Oracle
 stock
 to
 go


up,
 like
 whenever
 these
 stocks
 take
 a


massive
 rise,
 it's
 an
 OpenAI


partnership,
 which
 is
 a
 little
 scary
 to


some
 extent,
 but
 it's
 also
 like
 my


goodness,
 OpenAI
 might
 just
 be
 one
 of


those
 companies
 that
 ends
 up
 becoming
 a


multi
 multi-
 trillion
 dollar
 enterprise.


So
 we'll
 talk
 more
 about
 this
 deal
 in
 a


bit,
 but
 goodness
 gracious.
 There
 you


go.
 Open
 eye
 and
 Broadcom
 10
 gawatt


deal.
 Broadcom
 right
 there
 up
 11%
 on
 the


day.


>> Still
 got,
 you
 know,
 if
 people


>> I
 think
 with
 Friday's
 selloff,
 I
 I
 saw


many
 people
 calling
 the
 top
 of
 the


markets
 or
 declaring
 that
 the
 bubble
 is


bursting
 or
 that,
 you
 know,
 this
 is
 the


reason
 to
 be
 buying
 gold.
 And
 and
 if


that's
 if
 investors
 are
 that
 quick
 to


call
 a
 top
 just
 on
 a
 2%
 2.7%
 decline,
 I


just
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 good
 news
 isn't


really
 priced
 in.
 I
 think
 there's
 still


a
 lot
 of
 reluctant
 investors
 on
 the


sidelines.


>> You
 have
 found
 a
 kind
 of
 everything's


about
 crypto.
 You
 found
 a
 reason
 gold's


up
 and
 it's
 because
 of
 crypto.
 Not


directly
 because
 of
 crypto,
 but
 you


think
 the
 incremental
 buyer
 in
 gold
 are


there's
 gold
 based
 stable
 coins
 and


people
 need
 to
 buy
 gold
 to
 to
 back
 the


stable
 coins
 and
 that
 do
 you
 think


that's
 enough
 to
 be
 up
 $92
 all
 all
 the


way
 up
 to
 a
 new
 high?
 Well,
 there
 is
 an


interesting
 correlation
 we
 found
 which


is
 when
 I
 look
 at
 Tether's
 supply
 of


dollars
 outstanding,
 it
 really
 started


to
 rise
 uh
 about
 3
 months
 ago
 and
 that


corresponded
 with
 a
 with
 gold


essentially
 going
 up
 every
 day.
 I'm
 not


positive
 of
 this,
 but
 I
 think
 stable


coins,
 including
 Tether,
 may
 be
 one
 of


the
 largest
 buyers
 of
 gold
 today.


There
 has
 been
 some
 reporting
 over
 the


weekend
 that
 Tether
 is
 launching


essentially
 tokenized
 gold.
 So
 they're


backing
 gold
 onetoone
 with
 the
 their


gold
 stable
 coin.
 And
 as
 a
 result,
 I


mean,
 it's
 quite
 fascinating.
 I
 I
 don't


think
 I've
 heard
 this
 over
 the
 past


couple
 months
 as
 we've
 been
 analyzing


gold.
 One
 of
 the
 reasons
 gold
 could
 be


running
 as
 much
 as
 it's
 running
 is


because
 Tether,
 one
 of
 the
 largest


stable
 coin
 issuers,
 is
 buying
 a
 ton
 of


gold
 to
 custody
 it,
 which
 means
 there
 is


gold
 demand,
 right?
 Because
 the
 reason


they're
 buying
 it
 is
 because
 people
 want


exposure
 to
 it.
 But
 it
 also
 means
 that
 a


crypto
 company
 could
 be
 the
 reason
 for


why
 there
 is
 this
 much
 um
 buying


pressure
 coming
 in
 on
 gold.
 Here's
 some


coverage
 on
 the
 Broadcom
 deal
 and
 then


we'll
 keep
 going
 from
 there
 and
 see
 if


we
 can
 get
 some
 of
 these
 details.


>> Talking
 about
 a
 collaboration
 of
 10


gigawatts
 of
 custom
 AI
 accelerators,


OpenAI
 designing
 these
 accelerators
 and


systems.
 They'll
 de
 developed
 and


deployed
 in
 partnership
 with
 Broadcom.


uh
 essentially
 their
 own
 chips
 and


systems
 for
 open
 AI
 that
 they
 can
 embed


uh
 and
 again
 I'm
 reading
 from
 the


release
 here
 what
 is
 learned
 from


developing
 frontier
 models
 and
 products


directly
 into
 the
 hardware
 Jim
 now
 as


opposed
 to
 that
 Nvidia
 deal
 which


captured
 the
 market's
 imagination
 a


couple
 of
 weeks
 back
 there's
 no
 money


changing
 hands
 here
 um
 and
 it's


different
 obviously
 than
 the
 Oracle
 deal


which
 has
 never
 been
 fully
 confirmed
 but


which
 news
 reports
 have
 it's
 some
 300


billion
 in
 terms
 of
 building
 compute
 for


open
 AI
 essentially
 um
 over
 the
 next
 5


years.
 This
 is
 for
 them
 to
 develop
 their


own
 chips
 conceivably,
 I
 would
 think,
 to


bring
 down
 the
 overall
 cost
 because,
 as


you
 well
 know,
 you
 know,
 cost
 per
 token


is
 sort
 of
 a
 key
 thing
 we're
 watching


here
 in
 terms
 of
 these
 uh
 these
 LLMs
 and


the
 like
 and
 they
 got
 to
 bring
 their


cost
 down
 if
 they're
 ever
 going
 to
 hit


the
 kind
 of
 numbers
 they
 need
 to
 to
 deal


with
 how
 much
 they've
 got
 going
 out
 the


door
 and
 how
 much
 the
 losses
 are


ultimately
 going
 to
 be
 at
 least
 in
 the


near
 term.
 Well,
 look,
 I'm
 glad
 I
 have


uh
 Greg
 Brockman,
 OpenAI
 co-founder
 and


president,
 and
 I
 also
 have
 Charlie


Kawas,
 who's
 the
 Broadcom
 president
 in
 a


few
 minutes
 to
 be
 able
 to
 talk
 more


about
 this
 deal.
 Sarah,
 you
 talked
 to
 a


lot
 of
 people.
 A
 lot
 of
 bankers
 and
 you


know
 that
 what's
 happening
 here
 is


OpenAI
 without
 having
 any
 real
 money
 in


uh
 to
 be
 able
 to
 make
 these
 deals


continues
 to
 make
 them.
 I
 I
 believe
 also


I
 can't
 wait
 to
 speak
 to
 Oracle
 and


David
 because
 they
 continue
 to
 make


them.
 At
 the
 heart
 of
 all
 this
 is
 either


a
 belief
 that
 this
 whole
 thing
 is
 a
 is


precipitating
 the
 giant
 bubble
 uh
 this


is
 separate
 from
 the
 raw
 earth
 mineral


bubble
 or
 it's
 you
 as
 as
 open
 AI
 has


said
 over
 and
 over
 again
 hey
 get
 with
 it


this
 is
 an
 industrial
 revolution
 and
 and


and
 the
 people
 who
 move
 first
 win.
 I


don't
 know
 Sarah
 I
 heard
 Pat
 Gellinger


talk
 earlier
 about
 how
 it's
 all
 a
 bubble


but
 Pat's
 out.
 These
 guys
 are
 in
 and
 I


think
 that
 the
 guys
 who
 are
 in
 are


driving
 it
 and
 if
 they
 have
 the
 money,


they're
 going
 to
 take
 it.


>> Here's
 the
 case
 against
 the
 bubble.
 So


that
 that
 I
 hear
 actually
 from
 a
 lot
 of


people
 that
 I
 trust.
 It's
 it's
 it's
 not


being
 driven
 by
 irrational
 speculation,


right?
 We
 don't
 know
 exactly.
 I
 mean,


and
 I
 guess
 it
 hasn't
 been
 proven
 to
 be


profitable
 growth
 ultimately,
 but
 it
 it


is
 being
 driven
 by
 fundamental
 growth.


And
 if
 you
 look
 I
 definitely
 open
 AI
 is


at
 the
 heart
 of
 it
 but
 if
 you
 look
 in


the
 public
 market
 at
 the
 companies
 that


are
 at
 the
 heart
 of
 it
 it's
 dominated
 by


a
 few
 incumbents
 that
 have
 very
 strong


balance
 sheets
 and
 very
 strong
 growth


Jim
 and
 that
 that
 to
 me
 that's
 the
 best


that's
 the
 best
 case
 against
 it.
 Now


again
 the
 case
 realistically
 against
 all


this
 circular
 money
 going
 round
 and


round
 is
 there
 will
 be
 an
 ROI
 on
 this


but
 my
 goodness
 folks
 for
 those
 that
 are


just
 joining
 OpenAI
 Broadcom
 custom
 ASIC


deal
 here
 are
 some
 details
 of
 it
 openai


will
 design
 the
 chipscom
 will
 build
 the


racks
 the
 system
 will
 include


accelerators
 and
 Ethernet
 solutions
 for


scale
 up
 and
 scale
 out
 deployment
 starts


second
 half
 of
 next
 year
 ends
 2029
 so


three-year
 deal
 uh
 racks
 will
 will
 be


deployed
 across
 OpenAI
 facilities
 the


goal
 will
 be
 to
 embed
 frontier
 model


learnings
 directly
 into
 the
 hardware.


Total
 power
 capacity
 10
 gawatts.
 If
 one


gigawatt
 is
 around
 35
 to
 40
 billion,


this
 is
 a
 350
 to400
 billion
 deal.
 I
 mean


now
 again
 I
 I
 can't
 lie.
 It
 does
 feel
 a


little
 scary
 seeing
 open
 AI
 at
 the


center
 of
 every
 single
 major
 company


that
 is
 had
 their
 stock
 go
 up
 30
 40%


this
 year
 based
 on
 relying
 on
 OpenAI.


AMD,
 Nvidia,
 Nvidia
 to
 a
 lesser
 extent.


Uh
 but
 they
 did
 have
 a
 big
 move
 from
 the


170s
 once
 they
 announced
 that


partnership.
 And
 then
 uh
 Oracle
 Oracle's


entire
 move
 was
 was
 because
 of
 the
 RPO


growth
 remaining
 performance
 obligations


because
 of
 OpenAI.
 So
 OpenAI
 I
 think


whether
 you
 like
 them
 or
 not
 whether
 you


hate
 Sam
 Alman
 you
 love
 Sam
 Alman
 I
 mean


he
 is
 responsible
 one
 could
 argue
 for


this
 entire
 AI
 ecosystem
 manifesting
 in


real
 revenues
 and
 real
 profits.
 And
 I


mean
 we've
 got
 to
 hope
 that
 OpenAI


success
 continues
 to
 to
 flourish
 because


if
 it
 doesn't
 there's
 going
 to
 be
 some


issues.
 But
 a
 lot
 of
 this
 money
 right


now
 is
 not
 confirmed.
 I
 mean,
 how
 is


OpenAI
 going
 to
 pay
 for
 this
 400
 billion


from
 Broadcom?
 I
 mean,
 they're
 probably


going
 to
 use
 some
 of
 the
 money
 they
 get


from
 AMD
 or
 some
 of
 the
 stock
 they


eventually
 get
 from
 AMD.
 They're
 going


to
 probably
 have
 to
 sell
 that
 stock.


They're
 going to
 have
 to
 use
 some
 of the


$10
 billion
 investments
 they
 get
 from


Nvidia.
 Overall,
 a
 hundred
 billion
 is


what
 Nvidia
 is
 pledging
 for
 them
 to
 be


able
 to
 even
 pay
 for
 any
 of
 this
 stuff


or
 they're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 actually,


you
 know,
 do
 some
 real
 growth.
 Now,
 Brad


Gersonner
 on
 the
 podcast
 said
 that


they're
 going
 to
 do
 20
 billion
 of


revenue
 or
 they're
 already
 doing
 20


billion
 in
 the
 TTM
 and
 he
 thinks
 that


can
 double
 by
 next
 year.
 So
 even
 if


they'll
 still
 lose
 money,
 they're
 on


track
 to
 do
 around
 150
 billion
 of


revenues
 by
 2030,
 which
 would
 be


incredible.
 And
 if
 that
 growth,
 you


know,
 doesn't
 keep
 up,
 then
 this
 is


going
 to
 have
 an
 issue.
 But
 if
 it
 does,


then
 hopefully
 there
 is
 a
 ability
 for


them
 to
 pay
 on
 it.
 This
 is
 a
 chart
 that


we've
 been
 looking
 at
 for
 the
 past


couple
 weeks.
 But
 take
 a
 look
 at
 this.


13
 years
 it
 took
 the
 internet
 to
 get
 to


800
 million
 users.
 Chat
 GPT
 took
 two
 and


a
 half.
 This
 is
 not
 Grock.
 This
 is
 not


Gemini.
 This
 is
 not
 any
 of
 this
 is
 not


anthropic.
 This
 is
 chat
 GPT.
 I
 mean
 that


singular
 product
 seems
 to
 be
 the
 most


successful
 startup
 idea
 of
 the
 past
 two


decades
 and
 it
 is
 the
 fastest
 growing


idea
 that
 we've
 seen
 in
 terms
 of
 pure


user
 growth.
 800
 million
 weekly
 users


now
 uh
 are
 on
 the
 product
 and
 Gemini
 and


XAI
 although
 they
 are
 far
 behind
 XAI


it's
 not
 like
 or
 far
 behind
 CHP
 it's
 not


like
 they're
 slowing
 down.
 I
 mean


they're
 growing
 pretty
 dramatically.


Google
 said
 they're
 processing
 1.8


trillion
 tokens
 an
 hour
 over
 the
 past


seven
 months.
 So,
 I
 mean,
 like,
 if
 all


of
 this
 is
 going
 to
 take
 more
 computing


capacity
 and
 OpenAI
 needs
 AMD
 chips,


Nvidia
 chips,
 and
 Broadcom
 chips,
 it's


basically
 them
 admitting
 we
 need
 as
 many


freaking
 chips
 as
 possible,
 and
 we
 are


willing
 to
 work
 with
 anybody
 to
 get


these
 deals.
 It's
 just
 they
 don't
 have


the
 money
 for
 these
 deals.
 But
 I
 guess


the
 money
 is
 inevitably
 going
 to
 come.


Also,
 you
 have
 two
 updates
 this
 morning.


Um,
 Salesforce
 is
 committing
 15
 billion


to
 develop
 San
 Francisco
 as
 the
 global


hub
 for
 artificial
 intelligence.
 So,
 you


have
 another
 multi-billion
 dollar


investment
 from
 a
 tech
 company.
 And
 you


have
 Google
 that's
 launching
 a
 9
 billion


investment
 in
 South
 Carolina
 through


2027.
 So,
 Google
 already
 announced
 they


were
 going
 to
 do
 a
 $10
 billion
 data


center
 investment
 in
 uh
 India
 last
 week.


And
 now
 you
 have
 Google
 saying
 we're


going
 to
 do
 nine
 billion.
 So,
 10
 billion


in
 one
 country,
 nine
 billion
 in
 one


state
 is
 what
 Google
 is
 planning
 to
 do.


all
 these
 companies
 realizing
 they
 need


more
 data
 centers,
 they
 need
 more
 uh


land
 and
 they
 are
 committing
 to


different
 places
 to
 build
 out
 all
 those


data
 centers.
 By
 the
 way,
 Grab
 got
 an


upgrade
 today
 from
 Jeff.
 630
 to
 680.
 630


to
 680
 is
 the
 price
 target.
 Analysts


expect
 strong
 3Q
 execution
 with
 margin


and
 GMV
 acceleration
 across
 segments.


Grab
 got
 all
 the
 way
 to
 550
 on
 Friday.
 I


mean,
 we
 had
 some
 really
 crazy


opportunities
 on
 Friday
 in
 terms
 of
 the


dip.
 We're
 going
 to
 see
 if
 the
 market


recovers
 going
 into
 this
 morning,
 but


you
 do
 have
 some
 upgrades


across
 the
 board.
 So,
 there
 you
 go.


Broadcom
 getting
 some
 love
 up
 now
 10.6%


on
 the
 day.
 Let's
 finish
 up
 with
 Tom
 Lee


and
 then
 we
 will
 keep
 going
 from
 there.


>> That's
 perfect.
 So,
 the
 the
 people


>> a
 good
 meeting
 ground
 between
 Bitcoiners


and
 gold
 people.


Tom,
 can
 you
 just
 explain
 though
 to
 the


extent
 we
 can
 understand
 it
 within
 at


least
 the
 Bitcoin
 world
 just
 how
 much


leverage
 there
 is
 in
 that
 system?


Because
 I
 think
 one
 of
 the
 things
 that


Friday


>> we
 were
 looking
 at
 Friday
 was
 the
 the


possibility
 at
 least
 that
 some
 of
 that


selling
 or
 maybe
 even
 a
 lot
 of
 that


selling
 came
 from
 margin
 calls
 um
 at


that
 time.


>> Andrew,
 there's
 a
 there
 there
 has
 always


been
 a
 lot
 of
 leverage
 in
 crypto.
 I


think
 that
 the
 volatility
 and
 leverage


is
 what
 has
 drawn
 people
 into
 that
 space


especially
 when
 you
 get
 outside
 of


Bitcoin
 and
 Ethereum.


>> Uh
 those
 two
 are
 generally
 not
 held
 on


margin.
 I
 mean
 there
 is
 some
 leverage


with
 what
 they
 call
 perpetuals
 but


that's
 why
 they
 held
 up
 so
 well
 uh
 over


the
 weekend
 but
 this
 liquidation
 that


was
 triggered
 over
 the
 last
 3
 days
 uh


the
 estimates
 are
 at
 least
 19
 billion
 of


liquidations
 but
 it's
 probably


understated.
 it
 might
 be
 four
 times


bigger.
 It's
 the
 largest
 since
 2021.
 Um


essentially
 you
 have
 to
 go
 back
 to
 FTX.


Uh
 I
 think
 there
 is
 a
 lot
 of
 leverage
 in


the
 way
 people
 use
 this
 product
 called


perpetuals
 which
 is
 trading
 uh
 on
 margin


you
 know
 like
 3x
 20x
 um
 and
 it
 and
 it


lurks
 uh
 and
 it's
 held
 through


collateral
 you
 know
 people
 like
 sort
 of


pledging
 something
 that
 thinks
 it's
 safe


but
 when
 the
 price
 of
 that
 collateral


drops
 it
 triggers
 a
 cascade.
 And
 so
 I


think
 people
 talk
 about


>> this
 thing
 called
 auto.
 So
 a
 lot
 of


leverage.
 Yes.


>> Okay.
 So
 at
 its
 core
 what
 Tom
 Lee's


talking
 about
 right
 there
 is
 that
 there


was
 massive
 massive
 leverage
 in
 the


system.
 I
 mean
 I
 don't
 know
 how
 many


people
 read
 stories
 over
 the
 weekend
 but


based
 on
 what
 I
 was
 reading
 I
 mean
 there


are
 some
 people
 that
 took
 their
 own
 life


over
 the
 weekend.
 It
 it
 got
 bad
 dude.


People
 lost
 a
 lot
 of
 money.
 19.5
 billion


is
 the
 estimated
 number.
 Tom
 Lee's


argument
 is,
 wait
 a
 second,
 it's
 more


than
 19.5
 billion.
 It's
 it
 might
 be
 4x


that.
 And
 as
 a
 result,
 you
 had
 a
 ton
 of


crypto
 pain
 over
 the
 weekend
 only
 for


the
 markets
 to
 kind
 of
 recover
 and
 the


leverage
 wipes
 you
 out
 in
 the
 short


term,
 but
 realistically,
 if
 it's
 not


that
 big
 of
 a
 deal,
 then
 it
 ends
 up
 not


being
 that
 painful.
 So,
 it
 was
 a
 pretty


pretty
 wild
 week.
 AMD,
 what's
 going
 on?


You
 guys
 are
 saying
 AMD
 is
 crashing.


AMD,


what
 are
 we
 seeing
 right
 here?
 AMD,


I
 wouldn't
 say
 it's
 crashing.
 It's
 still


up
 in
 the
 pre-markets,
 but
 there
 is
 a


pretty
 big
 red
 candle
 right
 there
 as
 you


can
 see.
 Let's
 see
 if
 there's
 some
 news.


It
 might
 end
 up
 actually
 crashing
 if


this
 news
 is
 legit.


Um,


I
 don't
 see
 any
 headlines
 on
 AMD.
 In


fact,
 I
 see
 a
 bunch
 of
 price
 target


increases.
 205
 to
 275
 at
 Mizuo.


Is
 this
 because
 of
 the
 Broadcom
 deal?


Is
 this
 because
 of
 Broadcom?
 Is
 this
 the


reason?
 I
 feel
 like
 it
 I
 feel
 like
 it


has
 to
 be
 Broadcom.
 I
 don't
 see
 anything


specific.
 I
 wouldn't
 say
 it's
 crashing


though.
 It's
 still
 up
 1%
 in
 the


pre-markets.
 It's
 just
 not
 up
 as
 much
 as


it
 was.
 Yeah,
 it's
 probably
 because
 of


Broadcom.
 Now,
 it's
 it's
 weird
 that
 it's


because
 of
 Broadcom
 because
 at
 the
 end


of
 the
 day,
 OpenAI
 said
 they
 are
 ready


to
 buy
 what
 is
 it
 basically
 $80
 billion


worth
 of
 AMD
 chips.
 So,
 it's
 not
 like


OpenAI
 is
 renegotiating
 on
 that.
 It's


just
 apparently
 they
 need
 so
 much


capacity
 they're
 ready
 to
 buy
 350


billion
 of
 chips
 from
 Broadcom.
 Maybe


it's
 kind
 of
 bearish
 because
 they
 could


have
 done
 a
 $400
 billion
 deal
 with
 AMD


and
 they
 didn't
 and
 they
 only
 did
 like


an
 $80
 billion
 deal,
 but
 still
 it's
 a


decent
 amount
 of
 money
 going
 to
 AMD.
 So,


it'd
 be
 very
 weird
 to
 see
 that
 one
 kind


of
 kind
 of
 change
 in
 the
 way
 that
 it's


happening,
 but
 AMD
 is


slightly
 red
 from
 the
 highs,
 but
 still


green
 for
 the
 day.
 Um,
 but
 yeah,
 crypto


was
 bad,
 dude.
 Crypto
 was
 really
 bad.


$20
 billion
 liquidations.
 A
 lot
 of


people
 lost
 a
 lot
 of
 money.
 Bitcoin
 and


Ethereum
 doesn't
 look
 like,
 you
 know,


they're
 dead
 by
 any
 sense
 of
 the


imagination.
 But
 if
 you
 were
 super


levered
 on
 Bitcoin
 and
 if,
 you
 know,
 it


falls
 a
 $20,000
 candle,
 you
 get
 wiped


out
 completely.
 And
 some
 of
 these


perpetual
 future
 contracts
 that
 Tomley's


talking
 about,
 I
 mean,
 you
 can
 lever
 up


up
 to
 250
 times.
 You
 can
 turn
 $1
 into


250
 on
 leverage,
 which
 you
 know,
 that


type
 of
 leverage
 and
 that
 type
 of


margin,
 that
 type
 of
 borrowing
 to
 the
 to


the
 tune
 of
 250
 times
 should
 only
 be


done
 in
 a
 most
 sophisticated
 way,
 right?


You
 should
 be
 a
 very
 there
 should
 be
 a


hedging
 strategy.
 There
 should
 be
 not


the
 average
 person
 doing
 that,
 but


nonetheless,
 the
 average
 person
 if
 they


are
 doing
 that,
 it
 can
 wipe
 you
 out


really
 bad,
 especially
 if
 there's
 a


random
 uh
 event
 like
 a
 Trump
 China
 tweet


that
 plays
 out.
 Also,
 there
 were
 some


issues
 with
 Binance's
 exchange
 and
 so


like
 Binance
 put
 out
 a
 note
 saying
 there


were
 some
 issues
 that
 caused
 some
 of
 the


problem.
 So,
 there
 was
 just
 a
 lot
 of


[ __ ]
 that
 happened
 on
 Friday,
 but
 it


wiped
 out
 a
 ton
 of
 people.
 And
 I
 think,


you
 know,
 to
 some
 extent
 Tom
 Lee's


argument
 is
 it's
 not
 the
 worst
 thing
 in


the
 world
 for
 some
 of
 that
 leverage
 to


get
 out
 of
 the
 system
 because
 you
 had
 a


lot
 of
 frothiness
 and
 to
 make
 the
 next


move
 higher
 in
 the
 markets
 generally,


you
 have
 to
 have
 a
 little
 bit
 of a


pullback.
 And
 it
 seems
 like
 that's
 what


we
 got
 on
 Friday
 across
 the
 equity


markets
 as
 well.
 So
 that's
 what
 we
 got.


Also,
 yeah,
 I
 agree
 with
 30
 and
 a
 wake


up
 right
 here.
 Never
 take
 on
 leverage


after
 a
 three-year
 bull
 market
 at


alltime
 highs.
 When
 you're
 taking
 on


leverage,
 like
 you're
 supposed
 to
 take


on
 leverage
 when
 something's
 at
 a


bottom,
 theoretically,
 or
 something's
 so


beat
 up
 that
 it
 has
 nowhere
 to
 go
 but


up.
 When
 you
 take
 on
 leverage
 after


everything's
 running
 and
 like
 the


inevitable
 conclusion
 is
 after
 5
 months,


we
 haven't
 had
 a
 negative
 2%
 day.
 We


haven't
 had
 a
 negative
 1.7%
 day,
 you're


probably
 going
 to
 get
 some
 type
 of


catalyst
 that
 creates
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a


sell-off,
 which
 is
 why
 I
 think
 most
 of


us
 have
 not
 been
 buying
 that
 much
 until


Friday.
 I
 mean,
 some
 dips
 here
 and


there,
 but
 it's
 not
 like
 everyone's


super
 eager
 to
 just
 put
 tons
 and
 tons
 of


money
 into
 the
 market
 because
 things


were
 at
 an
 all-time
 high.
 A
 lot
 of


people
 were
 waiting
 for
 a
 dip
 and
 Friday


ended
 up
 creating
 that
 opportunity.
 I


think
 a
 lot
 of
 retail
 ended
 up
 buying
 on


Friday,
 but
 as
 a
 result,
 when
 you
 lever


up
 when
 things
 are
 already
 that
 high,
 it


might
 not
 be
 the
 easiest
 to
 just
 go
 that


much
 higher
 unless
 we
 get
 a
 pullback.


And
 it
 seems
 like
 that's
 what
 we
 got
 on


uh
 on
 Friday.


So,
 there
 you
 go.
 Crypto
 was
 a
 little


ugly.
 I
 saw
 a
 screenshot.
 Someone
 went


from
 15
 million
 to
 4K
 heavily
 leveraged.


Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 there
 was
 a
 lot
 of


screenshots
 over
 the
 weekend.
 People


just
 lost
 a
 ton
 of
 money


all
 over
 a
 Trump
 chi
 China
 tweet
 that


wasn't
 even
 real,
 which
 is
 it's
 wild.
 It


is
 absolutely
 wild
 how
 it
 played
 out.
 I


mean,
 I
 think
 we
 were
 all
 expecting
 a


dip.
 I
 didn't
 think
 we
 expected
 on


something.
 Trump
 just
 went
 back
 to
 his


normal
 playbook.
 He
 was
 like,
 "Oh,
 oh


yeah,
 tariffs
 will
 create
 a
 dip.
 Let's


do
 tariffs."
 He
 was
 like, "Oh,
 what


creates
 a
 dip?
 Tariffs."
 And
 it
 went


into
 tariffs.
 So
 that
 is
 that
 is
 what
 we


ended
 up
 getting.
 Here's
 some
 analysis


right
 here
 from
 Beijing
 on
 China's


attitude
 towards
 all
 this
 and
 then
 we'll


keep
 going
 from
 there.


>> Thanks
 David.
 Well,
 after
 getting
 a
 very


strong
 reaction
 from
 the
 US,
 the
 Chinese


are
 defending
 their
 newly
 expanded
 rare


earth
 curves.
 Today
 the
 foreign
 ministry


said
 the
 US
 has
 continuously
 introduced


a
 series
 of
 restrictions
 and
 sanctions


against
 China
 which
 have
 severely
 harmed


China's
 interests.
 China
 firmly
 opposes


this.
 So
 in
 other
 words,
 from
 China's


perspective,
 Beijing
 is
 merely
 matching


what
 Washington
 is
 already
 doing.
 The


Chinese
 have
 also
 said
 that
 they
 are
 uh


going
 to
 uh
 take
 counter
 measures


against
 President
 Trump's
 uh
 threat
 of


100%
 tariffs.
 of
 the
 commerce
 ministry


over
 the
 weekend
 said
 uh
 that
 they


pledged
 to
 take
 quote
 corresponding


measures.
 At
 the
 same
 time,
 the
 Chinese


appear
 to
 be
 trying
 to
 mitigate
 some
 of


the
 negative
 response.
 Uh
 the
 ministry


had
 said
 that
 those
 curbs
 do
 not
 equate


to
 a
 ban.
 Um
 there
 is
 speculation
 though


as
 you
 could
 imagine
 about
 why
 the


Chinese
 would
 make
 this
 decision
 at
 a


time
 when
 there
 are
 ongoing
 negotiations


between
 the
 US
 and
 China
 and
 also
 when


President
 C
 and
 President
 Trump
 are


supposed
 to
 meet
 or
 expected
 to
 meet
 um


at
 the
 end
 of
 this
 month
 at
 APEC.
 One


>> by
 the
 way
 said
 this
 morning
 that
 the
 uh


uh
 meeting
 between
 Trump
 and
 China
 which


also
 was
 another
 reason
 why
 markets
 kind


of
 took
 a
 hit
 um
 on
 Friday
 is
 still
 on.


And
 Trump
 basically
 said
 that
 last
 night


as
 well
 that
 he
 thinks
 he's
 going
 to


meet
 with
 uh
 with
 Xi.
 So
 I
 mean
 as
 long


as
 that
 meeting
 happens
 and
 it's
 not


that
 hostile
 and
 you
 have
 both
 sides


coming
 to
 some
 conclusion.
 I
 mean
 we


were
 promised
 a
 trade
 deal
 like
 10


months
 ago
 it
 hasn't
 manifested.
 Even


though
 Trump
 said
 in
 June
 it
 was
 like


getting
 close.
 And
 so
 it's
 been
 a
 long


time
 coming
 for
 a
 real
 negotiation
 with


China.
 Hopefully
 by
 the
 end
 of
 the
 year


that
 takes
 place
 and
 if
 it
 does
 that


could
 be
 another
 tailwind
 for
 the


broader
 markets
 if
 we
 finally
 get
 a


meaningful
 trade
 deal
 that's
 center


around
 rare
 earth
 minerals.
 Um,
 and


maybe
 that's
 what
 ends
 up
 happening.


Now,
 MP
 Materials
 US
 AR,
 the
 only
 safety


on
 Friday
 were
 these
 rare
 earth
 stocks


that
 seemingly
 were
 getting
 the


perception
 of
 having
 massive
 demand
 if


China
 was
 going
 to
 isolate
 from


providing
 the
 United
 States
 rare
 earth


minerals,
 which
 is
 basically
 what
 Trump


claimed.
 You
 had
 some
 of
 the
 energy


names
 also
 be
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 safe


haven.
 All
 of
 them
 are
 up
 right
 here
 in


the
 pre-markets.
 Look
 at
 energy.
 Fuels


up
 16%.
 My
 goodness.
 How
 about
 a


158
 is
 up
 7%.
 Now,
 Aqua
 fell
 to
 147.
 It


was
 still
 up
 for
 the
 day
 even
 though
 it


fell,
 which
 is
 how
 crazy
 Friday
 was.
 You


had
 Nvidia
 down
 300
 billion
 in
 market


cap,
 but
 Ollo
 was
 down
 like
 two
 billion


and
 it
 was
 still
 green
 for
 the
 day.
 So,


it's
 it's
 just
 quite
 incredible.
 But


these
 seem
 to
 be
 the
 sectors
 the
 markets


piling
 into
 off
 the
 fear
 of
 uh
 growth,


financials,
 industrials,
 anything
 that


scares
 them,
 they
 get
 into
 utilities,


which
 ends
 up
 being
 energy
 and
 rare


earths,
 which
 is
 quite
 incredible.
 And


obviously
 if
 you're
 in
 these
 names
 then


you've
 been
 doing
 well
 on
 these
 names
 as


well.
 MBS,
 thanks
 for
 the
 super
 chat.


Emit,
 are
 you
 adding
 any
 spy
 hedges?
 I


feel
 like
 the
 time
 to
 add
 spy
 hedges
 was


Tuesday
 or
 Wednesday
 last
 week.


Obviously
 in
 hindsight,
 uh,
 you
 know,


that's
 when
 it
 made
 more
 sense
 given
 the


spy
 was
 at
 all
 time
 highs.
 I
 don't
 think


spy
 hedges
 are
 a
 bad
 thing
 right
 now.


It's
 just
 the
 put
 premium
 you're
 paying


is
 going
 to
 be
 more
 elevated
 because
 the


markets
 have
 come
 down.
 So,
 um
 I
 don't


know
 after
 you
 got
 the
 VIX
 spike
 and


waterfall
 decline
 and
 now
 a
 potential


recovery
 like
 it
 does
 it
 really
 make


sense
 to
 be
 buying
 puts
 at
 these
 levels


potentially
 if
 you're
 going
 out
 like
 a


year
 or
 two
 years
 and
 you
 just
 want
 a


long
 time
 of
 protection
 but


realistically
 those
 that
 hedged
 last


week
 by
 buying
 puts
 it
 I
 mean
 today
 is


probably
 day
 you
 close
 some
 of
 those


puts
 and
 you
 take
 some
 of
 those
 profits


off
 the
 table
 in
 general
 I
 think
 going


into
 2026
 there
 needs
 to
 be
 some


strategy
 of
 hedging
 and
 we'll
 talk
 more


about
 it
 but
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 today's
 the


best
 day
 given
 we
 might
 get
 a
 decent


recovery
 and
 the
 the
 you
 know
 if
 we
 do


get
 a
 really
 good
 recovery
 then
 the
 put


premiums
 become
 way
 cheaper
 so
 that's


when
 you
 want
 to
 buy
 them
 because


insurance
 is
 cheap
 whereas
 today


it
 might
 not
 be
 it
 might
 not
 be
 as
 cheap


Iran
 all
 the
 data
 center
 plays
 they
 are


recovering
 look
 at
 that
 IN
 64
 bits
 is
 it


back
 above
 five
 it's
 at
 479
 clean
 spark


getting
 some
 momentum
 that's
 back
 at
 20


bucks
 I
 mean
 all
 of
 these
 names
 continue


to
 just
 do
 what
 they're
 doing
 and
 it


looks
 like
 the
 data
 center
 momentum
 is


not
 slowing


Even
 with
 the
 Trump
 China
 tweets,
 uh,


Bloom
 Energy,
 I
 don't
 know why
 this


one's
 up
 as
 much
 as
 it's
 up,
 24%.


I
 don't
 think
 they
 had
 earnings
 or


something.
 This
 one
 has
 to
 be
 catalyst


driven.
 It
 feels
 like
 I
 don't
 see
 Oh,
 I


got
 the
 headline.
 Bloom
 Energy
 and


Brookfield
 announced
 a
 $5
 billion


partnership
 for
 global
 AI
 infrastructure


facilities.


My
 goodness,
 dude.
 Every
 day
 it's


something
 else.
 The
 deal
 marks


Brookfield's
 first
 investment
 into
 its


AI
 infrastructure
 strategy
 and
 will
 use


Bloom
 Fuel's
 cell
 technology
 to
 power


data
 centers
 requiring
 massive
 always
 on


electricity
 capacity.
 The
 company
 said
 a


European
 site
 will
 be
 announced
 later


this
 year.


Dude,
 I
 get
 like
 whatever
 Trump
 tweeted


about
 China,
 it's
 not
 enough.
 It's
 not


enough
 to
 stop
 this
 tsunami
 of
 AI


ecosystem
 spending
 that
 that's
 that's


taking
 place.
 By
 the
 way,
 this
 is
 the


news
 that
 we
 didn't
 get
 to
 talk
 about


yet.
 JP
 Morgan
 came
 out
 this
 morning.


Tom
 Lee
 was
 mentioning
 it
 and
 is


launching
 a
 $ 1.5
 trillion
 financing


initiative
 over
 the
 next
 decade
 to
 back


industries
 vital
 to
 US
 national
 security


and
 economic
 dependence.
 Jamie
 Diamond


said
 the
 US
 had
 become
 too
 reliant
 on


unreliable
 sources
 of
 critical
 minerals,


products,
 and
 manufacturing.
 This
 is


basically
 what
 Trump
 has
 been
 saying
 as


well,
 calling
 for
 faster
 policy
 action


and
 initiatives,
 and
 the
 initiative


aligns
 with
 Trump's
 administration's


push
 to
 strengthen
 domestic
 production


and
 infrastructure
 and
 builds
 on
 JP


Morgan's
 earlier
 trillion
 dollar


commitment.
 The
 plant
 focuses
 on
 supply


chain
 resilience,
 defense
 and
 aerospace,


energy
 independence,
 and
 frontier
 tech


like
 AI
 and
 quantum
 computing.
 I
 mean,


this
 makes
 a
 lot
 of
 sense
 for
 JP
 Morgan


if
 we
 are
 getting
 into
 an
 industrial


buildout
 that
 is
 fueled
 by
 data
 centers,


land,
 and
 power
 initiatives.
 I
 mean,


JPM,
 Black
 Rockck,
 they're
 going to
 be


at
 the
 center
 of
 wanting
 to
 fund
 all


that
 stuff.
 And
 those
 are
 massive


opportunities
 to
 invest
 in.
 And
 so,
 you


got
 JP
 Morgan
 right
 there
 committing
 a


trillion
 dollars.
 Bloom
 Energy
 up
 23%
 on


the
 day
 on
 that
 Brookfield
 deal.
 a


massive
 Brookfield
 deal,
 $5
 billion


partnership.
 I
 mean,
 Bloom
 Energy
 was


tossed
 into
 the
 meme
 stock
 ETF
 that


Roundhill
 launched
 last
 week.
 And
 I


don't
 know
 that
 much
 about
 Bloom
 Energy,


but
 I
 mean
 a
 $5
 billion
 deal
 with


Brookfield


to
 in
 to
 ensure
 data
 center
 capacity
 and


expand
 AI
 initiatives.
 That
 does
 not


seem
 meish
 to
 me.
 That
 it
 is
 quite


incredible


how
 some
 of
 these
 companies
 are


continuing
 to
 get
 more
 momentum.
 Let
 me


see
 what
 I
 Let
 me
 see
 what
 you
 guys
 said


in
 the
 chat.
 I
 did
 a
 poll
 on
 green
 or


red
 day.
 Uh
 81%
 of
 you
 say
 green.
 81%
 of


you
 say
 green.
 I'm
 assuming
 some
 people


probably
 think
 it's
 a
 bull
 trap.
 We'll


see
 in
 about
 two
 minutes
 when
 the
 market


opens
 if
 this
 has
 the
 resemblance
 of
 a


bull
 trap.
 But
 if
 not,
 maybe
 we
 go


higher.
 Wow.
 Gold
 4,90.
 Holy
 crap.
 Gold.


My
 goodness.
 Gold
 futures
 are
 already


above
 4100.
 Gold
 futures
 already
 above


4,100.
 Silver,
 by
 the
 way,
 I
 think
 it's


crossed
 50
 if
 I'm
 not
 wrong.
 Silver,


um,
 I
 think
 it
 was
 it
 was
 at
 50
 last


night.
 The
 Yeah,
 50
 right
 here
 in
 the


pre-markets
 again.


I
 mean,
 this
 is
 this
 is
 one
 of
 the
 most


incredible
 years
 we've
 seen
 for
 precious


metals.
 We
 have
 not
 had
 a
 50%
 year
 in


gold
 in
 a
 long
 time.
 But
 there
 is


silver.
 I
 mean,
 it's
 taken
 11
 years
 for


silver
 to
 get
 back
 here,
 but
 here
 it
 is.


Incredible,
 incredible,
 incredible


stuff.
 All right,
 we
 got
 a
 minute
 until


the
 market
 opens.
 Put
 in
 the
 chat
 what


dip
 you
 bought
 on
 Friday.
 If
 you
 did


take
 advantage
 of
 any
 dips
 and
 we're


going
 to
 see
 if
 those
 dips
 end
 up
 being


rewarded
 and
 uh
 if
 they
 do
 end
 up
 being


rewarded
 today,
 it
 will
 be
 very
 nice
 to


see.
 Again,
 retail
 has
 continued
 to
 buy


the
 dip.
 That
 has
 been
 the
 strategy.


Friday
 gave
 a
 pretty
 strong
 opportunity.


We're
 going
 to
 see
 if
 that
 opportunity


is
 rewarded
 today.
 Trump
 pivoted
 on


China,
 said
 literally
 do
 not
 worry
 about


it.
 As
 long
 as
 he
 is
 not
 really
 bluffing


here
 on
 the
 China
 pivot,
 then
 it
 looks


like
 there
 is
 an
 opportunity
 for
 the


markets
 potentially
 to
 have
 a
 massive


amount
 of
 buying
 today
 as
 a
 lot
 of


people
 think.
 Maybe
 this
 is
 the
 dip


they've
 been
 waiting
 for.
 And
 as
 a


result,
 we
 might
 have
 a
 chance
 to


recover.
 Maybe
 not
 fully,
 but
 a
 decent


chunk
 of
 what
 we
 lost
 on
 Friday.
 Here
 we


go.
 Thank
 you
 everybody
 for
 being
 here.


Monday,
 October
 13th,
 9:30.
 Snack
 market


is
 now
 open.


All
 right,
 wake
 your
 ass
 up.
 Let's
 get


into
 it.
 Nvidia
 is
 up
 3%
 on
 the
 day.


There
 you
 go.
 18880
 on
 Nvidia
 again.
 195


was
 that
 alltime
 high.
 Let's
 see
 if
 we


can
 get
 back
 there.
 Pound
 share.
 That's


up
 1.63%.
 That
 is
 green
 hoodie
 14475


that
 fell
 all
 the
 way
 to
 132.
 That
 is


back
 to
 being
 green.
 The
 S&P
 500
 up
 1.2%


on
 the
 day
 against
 673
 is
 that
 all-time


high.
 If
 we
 get
 a
 recovery
 anywhere
 near


that
 665
 level
 and
 close
 above
 it,
 I


think
 that
 would
 be
 super
 bullish.
 But


there
 you
 go.
 S&P
 that's
 up
 1.2%
 on
 the


day.
 SoFi
 is
 up
 3%.
 Grabby
 Grab
 fell
 to


550,
 back
 up
 to
 607,
 that's
 up
 three
 and


a
 half%
 on
 the
 day.
 Google
 that's
 up
 2%


fell
 all
 the
 way
 to
 232.
 Reddit's
 up
 1%.


Amazon
 fell
 to
 210.
 That's
 now
 at
 218.


Meta
 right
 there
 is
 up
 1%.
 Salesforce
 up


half
 a
 percent.
 PayPal
 fell
 all
 the
 way


down
 to
 67.
 Back
 above
 70.
 That's
 up


1.2%
 on
 the
 day.
 Apple
 right
 there
 is
 up


1.3%.
 SMCI
 is
 green.
 How
 about
 Open?


Open
 is
 green.
 That's
 up
 1.72%
 at
 770.


Tesla
 right
 there
 2.4%.
 425
 fell
 all
 the


way
 to
 410.
 Robin
 right
 there
 at
 145.


Where
 is
 Rocket
 Lab
 which
 got
 to
 7350
 on


Friday.
 Rocket
 Left
 6843


back
 trying
 to
 get
 to
 that
 75
 level.
 Bit


Bars
 is
 green
 13%
 on
 the
 day.
 EOS,


another
 energy
 name.
 That
 one
 is
 also


green.
 Wow.
 13%.
 My
 goodness.
 Take
 a


look
 at
 that.
 Energy
 continues
 to
 be
 one


of
 the
 sectors
 that
 does
 very
 well.


Bloom
 Energy
 also
 up
 27%
 on
 that


Brookfield
 deal.
 Fantastic.
 Broadcom,


for
 those
 that
 are
 just
 joining,
 signed


a
 10
 gigawatt
 deal
 with
 OpenAI.
 It's
 up


7%.
 It
 was
 up
 about
 15%.
 So,
 not
 up
 as


much
 as
 it
 was
 in
 the
 pre-markets,
 but


that
 is
 another
 deal
 with
 OpenAI.
 That


stock
 right
 there
 up
 7%
 on
 the
 day.
 How


about
 Nebius?
 This
 fell
 all
 the
 way
 to


110.
 Nebius
 right
 there
 back
 up
 to
 137


basically
 at
 all
 time
 highs.
 141
 was


alltime
 highs.
 AS
 cross
 91.
 AS
 8877.
 91


was
 alltime
 highs,
 but
 that
 one
 is
 up
 8%


on
 the
 day.
 Hims
 is
 up
 1.63%.
 Uber's
 up


1.5%.
 IN
 is
 up
 7%.


on
 the
 day
 continues
 to
 go
 green.
 I


mean,
 this
 is
 just
 a
 phenomenal
 recovery


so
 far.
 I'm
 not
 saying
 it's
 a
 full


recovery,
 but
 it's
 a
 phenomenal
 rebound


post
 a
 3%
 waterfall.
 And
 again,
 one
 of


the
 the
 theories
 that
 I
 have
 today
 is
 a


lot
 of
 money
 across
 the
 entire
 market.


Uh,
 you
 know,
 retail
 investors,
 fund


managers,
 institutional
 managers,
 they


might
 be
 thinking
 this
 is
 it.
 This
 might


be
 their
 final
 opportunity.
 I
 mean,
 if


we
 get
 into
 a
 strong
 earnings,
 it's


going
 to
 be
 tough
 for
 the
 market
 to
 go


down
 another
 3
 4%
 when
 earnings
 are


crushing
 it
 across
 the
 board
 from


financials
 to
 industrials
 to
 utilities


to
 tech
 companies.
 So,
 it's
 going
 to
 be


one
 of
 those
 days
 where
 maybe
 money,


even
 though
 the
 banks
 are
 closed
 today,


the
 credit
 markets
 are
 closed
 today


because
 of
 Columbus
 Day.
 TSM
 right
 there


is
 up
 5%.
 You
 still
 might
 have
 a
 lot
 of


money
 that
 comes
 into
 the
 broader


markets
 and
 maybe
 that's
 a
 tailwind.
 If


the
 credit
 markets
 are
 closed,
 money


might
 end
 up
 coming
 into
 the
 stock


market
 instead.
 Rocket
 Lab
 back
 to
 70.


Rocket
 Lab
 back
 to
 70.
 My
 goodness,


dude.


My
 goodness,
 absolutely
 incredible.
 BMR,


we
 at
 54.
 BMR
 is
 at
 5470.
 Not
 too
 bad.


That's
 up
 4.3%.
 Fell
 all
 the
 way
 to
 47.


Again,
 Tom
 Lee
 bought
 200,000
 Ethereum


over
 the
 week.
 Um,
 I
 should
 say
 over
 the


weekend
 when
 Ethereum
 really
 dipped.
 And


Ethereum
 right
 there
 at
 46416.
 We
 don't


know
 exact
 his
 exact
 average,
 but
 he


probably
 got
 it
 anywhere
 below
 uh
 37
 to


3,800,
 which
 is
 not
 too
 bad
 given


Ethereum
 was
 at
 4,700


last
 week.
 Uh,
 Oaklow,
 is
 that
 one


moving?
 probably
 with
 Bloom
 Energy.
 That


one's
 moving.
 Yep.
 Wow.
 11%.
 That's


alltime
 highs
 on
 Oaklook
 from
 6
 to
 160.


What
 a
 run.
 What
 a
 run.
 ALD
 that
 is
 also


moving
 as
 well.
 Another
 massive,
 massive


move
 on
 the
 day
 for
 APLD.
 That's
 up


another
 15%.
 That
 stock
 is
 hitting


alltime
 highs.
 It
 was
 at
 35
 on
 Friday.


Then
 it
 took
 a
 hit
 when
 the
 Trump
 tweet


came
 out
 and
 now
 it's
 right
 back
 here.


MP
 materials,
 that
 one
 also
 moving
 as


well.
 There
 you
 go.
 9123
 up
 16%.


US
 probably
 following.
 Yep,
 US
 AR
 right


there
 up
 22%.


My
 goodness.
 How
 about
 Amcor?
 We
 did
 buy


this
 one
 last
 week.
 We
 are
 at
 2980.


That's
 up
 5
 and a
 half%.
 That
 one
 fell


like
 10%.
 So,
 that
 one's
 recovering
 50%


of
 what
 it
 fell,
 which
 is
 not
 too
 bad.


Robin
 Hood
 right
 there
 at
 14361.
 Big


Bear
 AI,
 I
 think,
 signed
 a
 partnership


this
 morning
 with
 a
 government
 agency.


That's
 why
 that's
 up
 12%.
 And
 we
 did


have
 a
 politician
 buy
 that
 a
 couple


months
 ago.
 50,000
 worth
 of
 it
 at
 around


$6.
 So
 that
 has
 been
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 catalyst


for
 it
 as
 well.
 And
 then
 SoFi
 right
 here


up
 2%
 read
 it
 slightly
 flat
 and
 then


grab
 up
 3%


on
 the
 day.
 Um
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 people


that
 were
 down
 a
 decent
 chunk
 on
 Friday,


you're
 probably
 recovering
 at
 least
 50%


of
 what
 you
 were
 down
 from
 Friday,
 which


is
 good
 to
 see.
 You
 do
 have
 some
 red


candles
 on
 some
 of these
 names.
 You
 do


have
 some
 selling
 pressure.
 Nvidia


getting
 a
 red
 candle
 right
 there.
 But


overall,
 not
 too
 bad.
 AMD
 at
 219.


AMD
 at
 219.
 AMD
 did
 go
 down
 real
 quick


in
 the
 pre-markets,
 back
 to
 220
 on
 that


Broadcom
 news,
 but
 it
 looks
 like
 it's


back.
 You're
 going
 to
 have
 some
 of
 the


Broadcom
 officials
 come
 live
 soon,
 and


we'll
 get
 to
 hear
 from
 them
 on
 this


multi-year
 partnership
 to
 deploy
 custom


chips.


But
 Broadcom
 getting
 the
 benefit
 of
 this


right
 here.
 That's
 up
 7%.
 Coreweave
 is


dumping.
 Where's
 Coreeave?
 Yeah,
 Cororee


goes
 red.
 All right.
 So
 you're
 seeing


some
 of
 the
 first
 names
 go
 red.
 The
 VIX


is
 down
 6%.
 Still
 above
 20,
 but
 the
 VIX


is
 down.
 Not
 a
 massive
 decline,
 but
 it


is
 down
 from
 where
 it
 was
 on
 Friday.


Tesla
 right
 there
 up
 1.8.
 Hoodie
 losing


146
 back
 to
 143.
 And
 then
 Palanteer


losing
 179
 back
 to
 176.
 I
 wouldn't
 say


it's
 a
 full-on
 reversal.
 S&P
 still
 up


1%.
 But
 you
 are
 seeing
 some
 red
 candles


across
 the
 board.
 Now
 again
 the
 the
 the


underlying
 uh
 tone
 of
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 bears


today
 will
 be
 that
 this
 is
 a
 dead
 cat


bounce
 and
 you
 should
 sell
 it.
 So
 I


think
 the
 market
 will
 tell
 us
 over
 the


coming


over
 the
 coming
 hours
 if
 this
 has
 any


momentum
 behind
 it
 or
 if
 it
 is
 a
 dead


cat
 and
 maybe
 Trump's
 tweets
 are
 not


enough
 for
 the
 market
 to
 be
 convinced


that
 there
 is
 momentum.
 So
 we're
 going


to
 have
 to
 see.
 But
 overall
 we
 are
 at


least
 not
 continuing
 to
 fall
 as


aggressively
 as
 we
 were
 on
 Friday.
 Um,


Nvidia
 right
 there,
 18776,
 the
 S&P


1.08%.
 All right,
 we
 have
 the
 OpenAI.com


people.
 Let's
 hear
 from
 them
 real
 quick


and


see
 uh
 exactly
 why
 they
 just
 signed
 a


basically
 $400
 billion
 deal
 with


Broadcom.


>> We
 need
 way
 more
 compute
 power
 than
 we


are
 still
 on
 trajectory
 to
 build.
 And
 so


I
 think
 that
 there's
 a
 whole
 industry


that
 still
 needs
 to
 be
 created
 in
 terms


of
 how
 to
 have
 both
 the
 power
 and
 the


computational
 power
 available
 to
 power


the
 AI
 revolution
 that
 we
 see
 coming.


And
 so
 part
 of
 what
 we're
 looking
 for


here,
 part
 of
 what
 we've
 been
 working


with
 Charlie
 and
 his
 team
 on
 is
 how
 to


actually
 build
 chips
 that
 are
 customized


for
 specific
 workloads
 so
 that
 we
 can


take
 our
 knowledge
 of
 how
 to
 build
 the


AI
 models
 and
 combine
 it
 with
 the
 best


possible
 way
 of
 implementing
 that
 into


silicon.


>> Excellent.
 Well,
 Charlie,
 welcome
 aboard


here.
 I've
 not
 met
 you.
 One
 of
 the


things
 that
 I
 think
 people
 are
 skeptical


about
 is
 the
 idea
 that
 still
 one
 more


company
 has
 to
 be
 involved
 because


there's
 just
 so
 much
 demand.
 Uh,
 and
 I


know
 your
 company
 as
 being
 about
 maybe


the
 most
 hard-nosed
 company
 in
 Silicon


Valley.
 I
 don't
 I
 think
 that's
 fine.
 I


talked
 I
 joke
 with
 Hawk
 about
 that.
 But


the
 fact
 is
 is
 that
 your
 company
 is
 not


idly
 thinking,
 you
 know,
 we're
 going
 to


do
 this
 thing.
 no
 money's
 exchanged,
 but


we
 we're
 confident
 that
 open
 AI
 is
 going


to
 exist.
 Will
 you
 please
 dispel
 a


narrative?
 It
 just
 says
 that
 this
 man


and
 his
 company
 are
 spending
 like


drunken
 sailors
 and
 it
 doesn't
 matter


what
 they
 do
 because
 build
 if
 they
 come.


Whereas
 I
 know
 Broadcom
 is
 saying
 we


better
 meet
 this
 darn
 demand
 or
 else


we're
 going
 to
 be
 left
 behind.


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 first
 of
 all,
 Jim,
 thank
 you


for
 having
 us
 here.
 It's
 an
 honor
 and
 a


pleasure
 to
 be
 here
 with
 you
 and
 Greg.


Um,
 at
 Broadcom,
 actually,
 we've
 been


building
 and
 enabling
 the
 AI


infrastructure
 for
 over
 a
 decade.
 So


it's
 not
 new
 experience
 for
 us.
 But


what's
 exciting
 here
 with
 Greg
 and
 the


team
 is
 we're
 actually
 having
 a
 very


unique
 collaboration.
 As
 you
 said,
 it's


a
 co-development
 and
 it
 actually
 what
 I


call
 a
 trifecta.
 So
 the
 first
 thing
 that


we
 do
 is
 exactly
 that
 custom
 AI


accelerator
 or
 custom
 GPU
 or
 XPU
 that


Greg
 talked
 about.
 That's
 where
 the


compute
 is.
 The
 second
 piece
 that
 we
 put


together
 is
 the
 network.
 you
 need
 to


connect
 all
 of
 these
 XPUs
 so
 that
 you


actually
 can
 scale
 them.
 And
 one
 of
 the


coolest
 things
 that
 we
 do
 is
 it's
 based


on
 open
 standard
 Ethernet
 networking.


And
 the
 best
 thing
 that


>> Okay,
 so
 we'll
 get
 back
 to
 that
 in
 a


second.
 He's
 not
 fully
 answering
 the


question
 yet.
 I
 mean,
 quite
 frankly,
 no


one
 cares
 about
 the
 technicalities.
 They


care
 about
 how
 they're
 going
 to
 finance


this.
 Uh
 so,
 you
 know,
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the


day,
 I
 think
 everyone
 feels
 a
 little
 bit


of
 just
 uneasiness
 that
 OpenAI
 is
 part


of
 all
 these
 deals
 and
 they're
 somehow


coming
 up
 with
 billions
 of
 dollars
 out


of
 nowhere.
 But
 if
 there
 is
 going
 to
 be


an
 ROI,
 that's
 going
 to
 be
 how
 it
 ends


up
 playing
 out.
 You
 got
 the
 S&P,
 there's


that
 big
 red
 candle
 right
 there,
 folks.


It's
 not
 a
 full-on


bull
 market
 uh
 recovery
 yet.
 I
 mean,
 you


have
 a
 decent
 amount
 of
 red.
 PayPal


loses
 its
 momentum.
 Bitcoin
 and


Ethereum,
 they
 lose
 their
 momentum.


Palanteer
 just
 went
 red.
 You're
 seeing
 a


ton
 of
 different
 names
 that
 are
 getting


hit.
 I
 I
 cannot
 I
 mean
 I
 don't
 think


anyone
 can
 say
 with
 confidence
 that


you're
 seeing
 a
 a
 decent
 level
 of
 upward


swing.
 I
 mean
 we
 are
 green
 but
 it's
 not


the
 type
 of
 green
 that
 is
 a
 full-on


pivot.
 Again
 DJT
 hasn't
 fully
 said
 it's


time
 to
 buy.
 Hasn't
 he
 hasn't
 literally


said
 that.
 It's
 just
 the
 explicitness
 of


the
 China
 remarks
 yesterday
 one
 could


argue
 might
 be
 the
 signal.
 The
 question


is
 will
 it
 manifest
 into
 that
 signal?


And
 we
 have
 to
 see.
 We
 have
 to
 see.
 Doug


says,
 "You
 got
 to
 remember
 liberation


day
 took
 a
 few
 days,
 dropped
 on
 44.
 The


big
 recovery
 was
 on
 49."
 That's
 also
 a


good
 point.
 I
 mean,
 expecting
 the


recovery
 today
 might
 not
 be
 as
 easy.
 It


might
 be
 asking
 for
 too
 much,
 but
 S&P


still
 holding
 one.
 If
 we
 give
 up
 1%
 on


the
 day,
 you
 know,
 he
 goes
 down
 to
 only


up
 half
 a
 percent,
 then
 you
 would
 see


some
 real
 sellers
 coming
 in.
 You're
 not


really
 seeing
 that
 yet,
 but
 you
 are


getting
 that
 in
 certain
 pockets.
 Micro


Strategy
 bought
 220
 Bitcoin
 last
 week
 at


the
 beautiful
 price
 of
 123,000.
 So,


unfortunately,
 they
 did
 not
 get
 the


Bitcoin
 dip.
 Archer
 right
 here,
 that's


down.
 Intel,
 that's
 down.
 Verizon's
 down


a
 little
 bit
 and
 then
 Dell
 is
 slightly


up
 after
 increasing
 their
 financial


projections.
 Pounder
 trying
 to
 go
 back


to
 green.
 Let's
 go
 back
 to
 Broadcom
 and


see
 get
 some
 more
 details
 on
 that
 deal.


>> That
 comes
 on
 top
 of
 this
 is
 the


software
 and
 that's
 where
 Greg
 and
 Sam


and
 the
 team
 come
 together.
 So
 when
 we


combine
 all
 of
 these
 things
 things


together
 and
 we
 fine-tune
 them,
 we


actually
 create
 the
 best
 AI
 platform


that
 delivers
 the
 highest
 performance
 at


really
 unprecedented
 power
 as
 you
 were


saying
 and
 costs.
 And
 so
 we're
 very


excited
 about
 this.
 We've
 been
 doing


this
 for
 a
 while
 with
 Greg
 and
 I.
 We


actually
 talk
 about
 it
 multiple
 times
 a


week
 and
 and
 we
 see
 this
 happening.


>> All right.
 So
 Greg,
 I
 want
 people
 to


understand
 that
 there's
 an
 NVIDIA.


>> Actually
 figuring
 out
 how
 to
 build
 this


compute
 is
 extremely
 difficult
 and
 it's


going
 to
 require
 financing
 in
 in


different
 mechanisms.
 And
 so
 we've


really
 been
 going
 to
 the
 industry
 to


say,
 hey,
 how
 can
 we
 possibly
 get
 ahead


of
 this
 sort
 of
 avalanche
 of
 demand
 we


see
 coming
 our
 way.


>> Avalanche
 of
 demand.
 Not
 hoping
 for


avalanche,
 but
 avalanche.


>> We
 are
 currently
 being
 swept
 along
 by


the
 avalanche.
 Just
 like
 you
 between


last
 month
 and
 this
 month,
 how
 much
 more


business
 do
 you
 have?


>> Uh,
 quite
 a
 lot.
 So,
 uh,
 I
 mean,
 first


of
 all,
 Sora
 did
 not
 exist
 a
 month
 ago


and
 it's
 now
 the
 number


>> S's
 pretty
 cool.
 I've
 been
 playing
 with


it.


>> Oh,
 glad
 to
 hear
 it.
 It's
 so
 much
 fun.


It's
 so
 much
 fun
 and
 I
 think
 it
 just


shows
 you
 how
 quickly
 these
 AI
 products


get
 adopted,
 right?
 It's
 like
 we've


never
 seen
 growth
 like
 this.
 So,
 Catch


EBT
 was
 the
 fastest
 growing
 consumer
 app


in
 history,
 but
 actually
 Sora
 is
 now


even
 faster
 than


>> Incredible.
 Well,
 it
 was
 easy
 to


download.
 My
 colleague
 David
 Faber
 has
 a


question.


Yeah,
 I
 guess
 I'd
 come
 to
 you
 first,


Greg,
 and
 you
 know,
 my
 my
 question
 is


simply
 uh
 is
 this
 going
 to
 reduce


the
 uh
 the
 cost
 per
 token
 over
 time?
 I


mean,
 I
 know
 in
 a
 podcast
 I
 think
 you


guys
 have
 just
 done
 to
 sort
 of
 explain


the
 deal
 as
 well,
 you
 talk
 about
 it


leading
 to
 much
 better
 performance,


faster
 models,
 and
 cheaper
 models.
 Um,


is
 that
 sort
 of
 the
 goal
 here?


>> Well,
 I
 think
 of
 it
 in
 two
 dimensions.


So,
 first
 of
 all,
 we
 definitely
 are


decreasing
 the
 cost
 of
 of
 each
 token
 at


a
 fixed
 level
 of
 intelligence,
 and
 we've


been
 doing
 that
 for
 years.
 But
 having


our
 own
 accelerator
 that's
 really
 tuned


for
 specific
 workloads
 will
 let
 us


really
 accelerate
 that,
 get
 more
 power


efficiency,
 everything
 that
 you'd
 want.


But
 even
 more
 importantly,
 we
 will
 be


able
 to
 serve
 even
 smarter
 models.
 And


so,
 what
 you
 actually
 really
 want
 is
 you


almost
 want
 the
 amount
 of
 dollars
 that


people
 will
 spend
 on
 AI
 to
 increase


because
 it's
 cheaper
 to
 get
 to
 the
 same


level.
 And
 you
 just
 want
 way
 more
 of
 it.


you
 can
 actually
 reach
 new
 heights
 in


order
 to
 solve
 new
 kinds
 of
 problems


that
 were
 totally
 impossible
 otherwise.


>> Uh
 and
 you
 know


>> so
 an
 avalanche
 of
 demand
 pounder
 right


there
 continuing
 to
 go
 red.
 The
 hoodie


is
 very
 close
 to
 going
 red
 but
 still
 up


2%
 on
 the
 day.
 Dude,
 an
 avalanche
 of


demand.
 Basically,
 OpenAI
 is
 saying
 we


are
 building
 and
 partnering
 with
 all


these
 companies,
 Oracle,
 Broadcom,
 AMD,


Nvidia,
 because
 we
 think
 there
 is
 so


much
 demand
 that
 is
 coming
 up
 uh
 that
 we


just
 want
 to
 be
 ahead
 of
 it.
 And
 as
 a


result,
 that's
 why
 we're
 signing
 these


deals.
 I
 mean,
 it
 seems
 like
 they're


pretty
 confident
 about
 the
 amount
 of


demand
 that
 they're
 uh
 supposedly
 going


to
 get.
 By
 the
 way,
 the
 S&P
 actually


making
 a
 nice
 little
 green
 candle
 right


there,
 1.2%.


I
 think
 that's
 close
 to
 the
 high
 of
 day


that
 we
 have
 on
 the
 day.
 So
 that's


really
 good
 to
 see
 the
 S&P
 getting
 that


momentum.
 But
 if
 that's
 the
 case,
 then


you
 either
 believe
 them
 or
 you
 don't.


Palanteer
 just
 flipped
 green.
 And
 if
 you


believe
 them,
 then
 I
 guess
 Broadcom
 and


Oracle
 and
 Nvidia
 and
 AMD
 are
 going
 to


benefit.
 They're
 going
 to
 benefit
 from


Nvidia.
 The
 rare
 earth
 mineral
 companies


massive.
 MP
 material
 still
 up
 12%
 on
 the


day.
 US,
 look
 at
 that,
 up
 18
 per
 22%.


LEU,
 Centric
 Energy,
 a
 lot
 of
 these


names
 just
 continuing
 to
 hold
 on.
 I


think
 I
 think
 we
 got
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a


algo
 move
 to
 the
 upside
 just
 now.
 Pretty


much
 everything
 just
 went
 green.
 We're


going
 to
 see
 how
 much
 of
 it
 can
 hold.


Again,
 it
 might
 be
 very
 very
 choppy,


but
 we
 were
 getting
 some
 red
 about
 5


minutes
 ago
 and
 everything
 that
 was
 red


just
 flipped,
 which
 means
 you're
 likely


getting
 alos
 that
 are
 going
 to
 start


buying
 and
 we'll
 see
 if
 that
 can


continue.
 But
 you're
 getting
 some
 love


right
 here.
 Oaklo
 still
 moving
 as
 well


on
 the
 day.
 That
 one
 164
 hit
 165
 at
 some


point.
 China,
 by
 the
 way,
 they
 came
 out


and
 they
 just
 said,
 "Threatening
 high


tariffs
 is
 not
 the
 right
 way
 to
 deal


with
 China."
 That
 was
 one
 of the


ministry
 spokespersons
 like
 20
 minutes


ago,
 just
 put
 out
 that
 statement.
 And


they
 also
 said,
 "China
 will
 do
 what
 is


necessary
 to
 protect
 its
 legitimate


right
 and
 interests."


So
 basically,
 China
 is
 saying
 the
 same


thing
 they
 said
 on
 Friday,
 which
 is,


hey,
 like
 let's
 find
 a
 way
 to
 get
 a
 deal


because
 you're
 not
 going
 to
 scare
 us


into


acting
 differently
 because
 with
 high


tariffs,


which
 hopefully
 is,
 you
 know,
 something


that
 Trump
 and
 them
 can
 negotiate
 on


meaningfully.
 Iran
 right
 there
 6373
 that


is
 up
 7%


on
 the
 day.
 Volume
 might
 be
 down
 due
 to


lack
 of
 money,
 so
 ALGO
 is
 going
 to
 play.


Yeah,
 that's
 a
 fair
 point
 as
 well.


Volume
 could
 be
 down
 today.
 Again,
 it
 is


Columbus
 Day.
 You
 do
 have
 a
 lot
 of


financial
 institutions
 that
 are
 just
 not


trading
 today.
 And
 that
 could
 be
 another


reason
 why
 we're
 not
 seeing
 as
 much


volume.
 Dutch
 Bros.,
 how's
 that
 one


doing?
 This
 one's
 been
 down
 for
 a
 bit.


Dutch
 Bros,
 that's
 up
 today.
 Wow.
 7%.


I
 don't
 know if
 they
 got
 an
 analyst


upgrade
 or
 something.
 Or
 maybe
 that's


just
 a
 recovery
 from
 Friday.
 But
 Dutch


Bros
 getting
 some
 love.
 When
 I
 asked


what
 uh
 or
 what
 stock
 people
 bought
 the


dip
 on,
 I
 saw
 a
 lot
 of
 BMRs.
 I
 saw
 a
 lot


of
 Amazon's.


I
 saw
 a
 lot
 of
 um


Grabs.
 I
 saw
 a
 lot
 of
 Google.
 So
 kind
 of


your
 typical
 clients
 that
 end
 up
 getting


momentum
 invid
 right
 there
 187
 looks


like
 that
 was
 what
 people
 ended
 up


buying
 again
 in
 September
 hundred


billion
 was
 spent
 by
 retail
 and
 $und00


billion
 was
 spent
 when
 when
 when
 things


were
 relatively
 decent
 in
 September.
 So


the
 idea
 that
 retail
 didn't
 come
 in
 on


Friday
 to
 me
 is
 unlikely
 when
 you
 know


things
 got
 really
 bad
 because
 that's


when
 people
 start
 and
 or
 at least
 that's


when
 retail
 this
 year
 has
 has
 bought.
 By


the
 way,
 Goldman
 Sachs,
 they
 they they


they
 downgraded
 PayPal
 from
 neutral
 to


sell.
 They
 set
 a
 price
 target
 at
 70.
 I


mean,
 just
 when
 PayPal
 starts
 to
 get


some
 momentum,
 you
 have
 Goldman
 Sachs


come
 out
 and
 say,
 "Yeah,
 we
 don't
 like


it.
 We're
 downgrading
 it
 to
 a
 sell
 from


neutral."
 So,
 you
 do
 have
 a
 little
 bit


of
 downward
 pressure
 on
 PayPal
 as
 well,


even
 though
 it
 is
 recovering


from
 yesterday.
 How
 about
 Quantum
 today?


What
 is
 going
 on
 with
 them?
 S&P
 right


there, they're
 up
 1.2.
 SoFi's
 up
 3.6.


QBTS


D-Wave
 that
 is
 up
 two
 and a
 half%


getting
 a
 recovery.
 Regetti
 also
 getting


some
 recovery.
 That's
 up
 9%
 on
 the
 day.


And
 then
 IQ
 that's
 getting
 some
 love,
 up


6%.
 TSM
 or
 TMC,
 this
 is
 the
 metals


company,
 another
 very
 important
 company


when
 it
 comes
 to
 rare
 earth
 minerals,


copper,
 cobalt
 or
 cobalt,
 nickel,
 all


that
 stuff.
 That's
 up
 17%
 on
 the
 day.


That
 one
 I
 guess
 you
 can
 put
 in
 the


bucket
 with
 um
 US
 and
 MP
 as
 a
 company


that
 will
 be
 perceived
 as
 getting


massive
 demand
 based
 on
 rare
 earth


metals
 and
 it's
 getting
 it
 right
 here
 up


16%


on
 the
 day.
 And
 again,
 uh
 JP
 Morgan
 is


tomorrow.
 A
 lot
 of
 the
 banks
 are


tomorrow.
 They've
 got
 a
 I
 mean
 that's


why
 that
 JP
 Morgan
 trillion
 dollar


announcement
 came
 out
 today
 because
 it's


likely
 that
 they're
 going to
 announce
 a


ton
 of
 new
 initiatives
 tomorrow
 on
 their


earnings.
 So
 tomorrow's
 going
 to
 be
 a


massive,
 massive
 day
 to
 see
 how
 these


companies
 perform.
 And


United,
 J&J,
 Goldman,
 JP
 Morgan,
 if
 all


these
 guys,
 Black
 Rockck
 can
 put
 up
 some


good
 numbers.
 The
 market
 likely
 is
 not


going
 to
 be
 too
 upset.
 Tesla
 right
 here


going
 green.
 That's
 up
 2.2.
 S&P
 1.25.


Very
 close
 to
 breaking
 the
 high
 of
 day.


If
 it
 does,
 that
 would
 be
 very
 nice
 to


see.
 We
 potentially
 got
 to
 wait
 out
 for


that
 10:30
 slam
 as
 well.
 Let's
 take
 a


look
 at
 the
 heat
 map.
 We
 are
 Wow,
 look


at
 that.
 Pretty
 much
 green
 across
 the


board.


It's
 not
 a
 full
 recovery,
 but
 healthcare


is
 the
 only
 thing
 that's
 down
 today


along
 with
 consumer
 defensives,
 Walmart,


Costco,
 PG,
 etc.
 Everything
 else,
 tech


and
 semis
 led
 by
 Broadcom,


massively


green
 on
 the
 day.
 I
 think
 SMCI
 will
 get


a
 tailwind
 from
 this
 Broadcom
 deal.
 I


think
 all
 the
 uh
 GPU
 service
 companies,


SMCI,
 Dell,
 etc.,
 HP,
 they
 should
 get
 a


tailwind.
 It
 might
 not
 reflect
 right


now,
 but
 SMCI's
 got
 to
 put
 up
 some


really
 good
 earnings.
 I
 mean,
 Dell


already
 increased
 their
 financial


projections.
 because
 if
 SMCI
 does
 that,


then
 that
 could
 be
 the
 tailwind
 SMCI


needs
 to
 get
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 boost.
 Uh
 stock


draft,
 Matt's
 at
 45.
 He's
 still
 at


number
 one.
 I'm
 at
 41.7.
 Steve's
 at
 7.


Tanner's
 at
 20.
 And
 then
 Chris
 is
 at


12.34.


Anyone
 who
 wants
 to
 see
 the
 whole
 thing,


go
 to
 2025stockdraft.com


and
 you
 can
 look
 at
 all
 the
 individual


holdings.
 But
 Matt
 right
 there
 is
 up
 45%


still
 in
 first
 place
 based
 on
 AS


Rock
 Lab.
 All
 right,
 let's
 finish
 up


with
 that
 broadcast
 interview
 and
 let's


see
 if
 we
 can
 get
 a
 little
 bit
 more


details
 out
 of
 this
 deal.


>> How
 you
 actually
 describe
 the
 size
 of


these
 efforts.
 Will
 it
 be
 there
 for
 you?


And
 can
 you
 just
 put
 in
 perspective
 what


we're
 talking
 about
 for
 our
 viewers
 in


terms
 of
 the
 time
 and
 effort
 that
 will


take?


>> Well,
 the
 way
 to
 think
 about
 this
 is
 I


think
 we
 are
 embarking
 on
 the
 largest


infrastructure
 build
 in
 history,
 right?


I
 think
 that
 the
 the
 kind
 of


infrastructure
 that
 everyone
 is


building,
 it
 really
 makes
 programs
 like


the
 Apollo
 program
 almost
 small
 in


comparison,
 which
 is
 a
 really
 wild


statement,
 but
 it
 makes
 sense
 because


the
 economic
 return
 is
 there
 because


this
 is
 really
 going
 to
 be
 the


underpinning
 of
 our
 future
 economy
 and


is
 already
 showing
 the
 the
 promise
 and


and
 benefit
 to
 people's
 lives.
 And
 I
 in


terms
 of
 actually
 producing
 this
 power,


I
 think
 that
 the
 the
 power
 industry
 is


one
 that's
 in
 in
 America
 is
 actually


very
 slow
 to
 update
 to
 demand.
 that
 the


growth
 there
 has
 been
 very
 slow
 over


time.
 We've
 been
 spending
 a
 lot
 of
 time


talking
 to
 executives,
 talking
 to
 these


companies
 saying
 that,
 hey,
 we
 need
 far


more
 power
 than
 has
 been
 planned
 for.


And
 we're
 starting
 to
 see
 the
 response


in
 the
 market.
 But,
 you
 know,
 our
 view


has
 been
 for
 the
 past
 couple
 years,
 we


see
 this
 wave
 coming
 and
 we've
 spent


years
 really
 trying
 to
 say
 what
 is
 the


way
 to
 increase
 every
 single
 part
 of
 the


supply
 chain.
 So,
 this
 deal
 is
 part
 of


that
 of
 trying
 to
 say
 let's
 build
 chips


that
 are
 that
 are,
 you
 know,
 tuned
 for


workloads
 that
 are
 more
 power
 efficient.


Um,
 but
 also
 how
 do
 we
 have
 every
 single


part
 of
 the
 supply
 chain
 respond
 to
 the


demand
 that
 we
 see?


>> Now,
 Charlie,
 we're
 talking
 about
 the


biggest
 joint
 industrial
 project
 in


human
 history,
 correct?


>> Something
 that
 exceeds
 far
 versus
 what


say
 the
 the
 highway
 system,
 the


interstate
 highway
 system.


>> Uh
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 uh
 incredulous


behaviors
 will
 help
 us
 in
 our
 daily
 job


as
 engineers.
 We
 said,
 let's
 do
 a
 proof


of
 concept.
 We
 took
 about
 a
 dozen


engineers.
 The
 result
 was
 good.
 Last


year
 we
 said,
 you
 know what?
 Let's
 take


a
 couple
 of
 projects,
 applied
 it
 to
 a


couple
 of
 projects.
 We
 put
 tens
 of


engineers
 now.
 And
 you
 know
 what?
 The


result
 is
 actually
 impressive.
 So
 this


year,
 we're
 actually
 going
 to
 fully


adopt
 this.
 And
 we
 expect
 productivity


for
 our
 engineering
 team
 to
 be
 20
 to


30%.
 So
 imagine
 if
 you
 have
 10,000


engineers
 and
 now
 suddenly
 you
 use
 these


smarter
 tools
 that
 are
 optimized
 you
 can


get
 10
 to
 20%
 more


>> each
 single
 engineer
 being
 kind
 of
 have


his
 own
 assistant
 going
 from
 100
 to


120%.


>> Correct.
 Correct.
 So
 you
 will
 use


actually
 these
 custom
 accelerators
 and


the
 networking
 and
 the
 AI
 cluster
 as


well
 as
 obviously
 the
 software
 to
 for


example
 for
 code
 assist
 and
 once
 you


apply
 that
 you
 get
 so
 much
 better


productivity.
 So
 instead
 of
 a
 a
 key


architect
 sitting
 down
 and
 spending
 time


on
 doing
 verification
 or
 testing,
 we


actually
 can
 take
 his
 time
 or
 her
 time


to
 actually
 write
 smarter
 code
 and
 let


these
 agentic
 machines
 do
 a
 lot
 of
 the


stuff
 for
 us.
 And
 so
 it's
 going
 to


change
 the
 way
 we
 actually
 work
 and


live.
 And
 that's
 why
 we're
 excited
 about


it.
 And
 we
 we're
 seeing
 this
 journey


just
 like
 you
 said,
 the
 railroads
 took
 a


century
 to
 build,
 right?
 The
 internet


took
 30
 plus
 years
 to
 build.
 This
 is


going
 to
 take
 many
 many
 years,
 probably


a
 couple
 of
 decades,
 but
 we
 will
 see


smarter
 and
 better
 capabilities
 going


back
 to
 the
 trifecta,
 the
 custom


compute,
 the
 network,
 and
 the
 stack
 that


we're
 co-engineering
 together.


>> Software
 engineering
 really
 has
 changed


already
 this
 year,
 just
 over
 the
 course


of
 the
 past
 12
 months.
 It's
 just
 night


and
 day.
 And
 I
 think
 that
 now
 if
 you're


not
 using
 AI
 as
 a
 software
 engineer,
 you


are
 just
 far
 less
 productive.
 We
 see


this
 internally
 that
 the
 difference


between
 people
 who
 use
 AI
 and
 don't
 that


there's
 like
 a
 like
 70%
 gap
 like
 these


numbers
 are
 are
 real.
 We
 see
 it
 in
 in


the
 the
 productivity
 stats.
 Um
 but
 we're


starting
 to
 see
 that
 across
 every


endeavor
 of
 human
 business.
 Um
 even
 for


designing
 our
 own
 chip
 we
 applied
 our
 AI


to
 it
 and
 we
 would
 actually
 have


incurred
 like
 a
 month
 schedule
 slip
 if


we
 didn't
 do
 that.


>> David,
 you
 have
 question.


>> I
 mean
 again
 wow
 S&P
 662.
 Okay
 there
 you


go.
 making
 some
 moves.
 It's
 not
 even
 if


individual
 stocks
 are
 not
 kind
 of


following
 the
 trajectory,
 it
 is
 really


nice
 to
 see
 the
 S&P
 get
 above
 some
 of


those
 levels.
 662
 on
 the
 day
 up
 almost


one
 and
 a
 half%.
 Again,
 the
 Broadcom


deal
 feels
 super
 bullish.
 I
 think
 the


number
 one
 question
 everyone's
 left
 with


is
 just
 where
 is
 the
 money
 coming
 from


and
 um
 Broadcom
 right
 there
 up
 10%.
 You


know,
 Jensen
 did
 clarify
 last
 week.


Jensen
 tried
 to
 make
 the
 argument
 that


this
 is
 not
 circular
 financing
 because


there
 is
 an
 ROI
 on
 all
 this
 money.
 And


again,
 what
 is
 Nvidia
 going
 to
 do
 with


their
 60
 billion?
 Like,
 they
 have
 to
 put


it
 somewhere.
 I
 rent,
 right?
 They're
 up


7.5%.
 They
 can't
 buy
 back
 their
 stock.


They
 can't
 give
 a
 better
 dividend.
 I


mean,
 they
 could
 do
 those
 things,
 but


it's
 not
 really
 beneficial.
 They're


going
 to
 have
 to
 put
 the
 money
 to
 use.


And
 so,
 if
 they're
 investing
 in
 the
 AI


ecosystem


overall,
 if
 there
 is
 an
 ROI
 on
 that


ecosystem,
 there
 should
 be
 an
 ROI
 on


those
 investments
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day.


So,
 you
 know,
 one
 could
 argue
 it's


circular
 financing
 and
 it
 definitely


feels
 circular
 to
 an
 extent.
 One
 could


also
 say,
 hey,
 the
 money's
 got
 to
 come


from
 somewhere
 and
 inevitably
 the
 money


is
 going
 to
 come
 from
 the
 biggest


players
 in
 the
 world.
 But
 as
 long
 as


that
 money
 delivers
 a
 return,
 which
 is


the
 number
 one
 thing
 everyone's
 waiting


for
 over
 the
 next
 coming
 years,
 then


this
 should
 end
 up
 working
 out.
 I
 right


there
 up
 8%
 on
 the
 day.
 AMD
 recovering


everything
 it
 lost
 in
 the
 pre-market,


that's
 up
 4%.
 So,
 it
 looks
 like
 it
 was
 a


little
 bit
 of
 a
 flash
 crash
 on
 AMD
 after


the
 Broadcom
 news.
 That
 one
 goes
 green.


And
 then
 Broadcom
 right
 there
 354.


That's
 still
 up.
 TS
 TMC
 again,
 massive


day
 for
 this
 guy.
 Up
 20%.


What
 is
 this
 guy
 doing
 year
 to
 date?
 I


think
 we've
 talked
 about
 this
 a
 couple


times.
 Wow.


800%
 year
 to
 date.
 My
 goodness.
 Um
 I
 do


not
 have
 a
 position
 in
 them,
 but
 for


those
 that
 did
 take
 a
 position,
 rare


earth
 metals
 and
 rare
 earth
 minerals


minerals.
 I
 mean
 minerals
 and
 metal


metals.
 Th
 those
 two
 have
 been
 massive


massive
 components
 of
 the
 supply
 chain


that
 Trump
 has
 been
 trying
 to


um
 essentially
 securitize
 within
 the


United
 States.
 Lithium
 America's
 that's


also
 up
 11.2%.


And
 as
 a
 result
 being
 in
 the
 energy


stocks,
 being
 in
 the
 rare
 earth
 minerals


and
 metal
 stocks,
 those
 have
 done
 very


well.


Very,
 very,
 very
 well.
 Now,
 are
 they


buys
 right
 now?
 I
 don't
 know.
 I
 mean,


they've
 had
 a
 massive
 run.
 Now
 granted,


if
 we're
 going
 to
 continue
 having
 a
 run


going
 into
 2026
 because
 there's
 so
 much


demand
 for
 that,
 then
 you
 know,
 one


could
 argue
 they
 are
 buys.
 But
 I
 think


there
 needs
 to
 be
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 of
 a


deep
 dive
 to
 see
 are
 these
 companies
 do


they
 actually
 have
 the
 demand
 that
 is


necessary
 to
 to
 kind
 of
 live
 up
 to
 the


hype?
 Oaklo
 right
 there
 170.
 I
 mean,


again,
 is
 Oak
 buy
 at
 170?
 No.
 But
 Oaklo


wasn't
 really
 perceived
 as
 a
 buy
 at
 140.


It's
 just
 the
 demand
 for
 energy
 seems
 to


be
 catching
 up
 with
 the
 perception
 of


the
 stock
 and
 that's
 what's
 leading
 to


Oakllo
 getting
 some
 love.
 You
 know,


historically
 in
 markets
 when
 a
 company


outruns
 uh
 you
 know,
 the
 most
 important


companies
 in
 the
 world
 like
 an
 Nvidia


and
 a
 Meta
 and
 the
 company
 has
 zero


earnings,
 zero
 revenue,
 that
 company


tends
 to
 be
 in
 a
 bubble.
 I
 wonder
 if


that
 actually
 plays
 out
 in
 this
 sort
 of


AI
 ecosystem
 over
 the
 next
 decade


because
 I
 if
 we're
 going
 to
 need
 nuclear


energy
 and
 Oklahoma's
 going to
 get
 a


couple
 billion
 dollars
 worth
 of
 deals


and
 it's
 a
 $20
 billion
 company
 it's


going
 to
 trade
 at
 a
 couple
 time
 you
 know


five
 times
 10
 times
 sales
 which
 is
 an


aggressive
 price
 of
 sales
 multiple
 but


it's
 not
 egregious
 especially
 if
 their


demand
 is
 growing
 maybe
 Oaklo
 gets
 to


hold
 on
 to
 this
 valuation
 maybe
 it


legitimately
 gets
 to
 grow
 into
 the


valuation
 and
 it's
 potentially
 not
 the


same
 as
 it
 was
 in
 previous
 markets
 where


a
 random
 stock
 outruns
 the
 most


important
 companies
 in
 the
 world
 because


those
 stocks
 tend
 to
 crash
 badly.


Maybe
 that's
 not
 the
 case.
 Maybe
 there's


just
 so
 much
 demand.
 That's
 not
 how
 it


plays
 out.
 S&P
 right
 there
 662
 again.


66214.


Grab
 holding
 on
 to
 six.
 Not
 really


getting
 below
 there
 yet.
 Bitcoin
 back
 to


115.
 That's
 nice
 to
 see.
 And
 then
 ETH


trying
 to
 get
 back
 up


to
 4200,


which
 is
 also
 not
 too
 bad.
 hoodie
 not


really
 recovering
 as
 well
 uh
 as
 it
 did


last
 week
 when
 it
 dropped
 all
 the
 way
 to


the
 140s
 gapped
 up
 back
 to
 155.
 Right


here
 you're
 at
 140.
 Now
 it
 is
 up
 from


132
 on
 Friday.
 So
 that
 is
 a
 decent


recovery
 from
 the
 low
 130s.
 Um
 I
 think


on
 Hood
 also
 dude
 like
 I've
 been
 pretty


transparent
 about
 this.
 I
 think
 Hood


just
 got
 really
 expensive
 and
 it
 was


outrunning


um
 it
 its
 earnings
 growth.
 I
 mean
 at
 150


as
 excited
 as
 I
 was
 for
 it
 and
 I
 think


all
 of
 us
 were
 happy.
 It
 was
 also
 like,


dude,
 really
 120
 to
 150
 in
 a
 week
 off


nothing.
 There
 was
 no
 real
 catalyst.
 So,


I
 think
 Hood
 normalizing
 in
 the
 140s
 is


good.
 It
 gives
 it
 a
 chance
 to
 run
 on


earnings
 if
 they
 have
 a
 good
 earnings


and
 I
 think
 they're
 going to
 have
 a


pretty
 decent
 earnings.
 And
 I
 think
 this


is
 actually
 really
 healthy
 for
 it.
 Now,


is
 Hood
 buy
 the
 dip
 right
 here?
 You
 got


to
 imagine
 what
 the
 end
 of
 the
 year


looks
 like.
 If
 S&P
 gets
 to
 7,000,
 if


Bitcoin
 gets
 to
 150,
 then
 yeah,
 I
 think


that's
 an
 obvious
 buy
 the
 dip.
 If
 it


doesn't,
 might
 end
 up
 consolidating


at
 these
 levels.
 So,
 we're
 gonna
 have
 to


see.
 We're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 see
 if
 that


plays
 out.
 But
 if
 you
 did
 buy
 the
 dip
 on


Friday,
 there
 were
 some
 good


opportunities.
 S&P
 right
 there
 66230


high
 of
 day.
 TMC
 as
 well
 11.
 That's
 also


high
 of
 day.
 IN
 65.
 Oaklo
 170.


AIT
 gold
 is
 up
 54%
 year
 to
 date.
 The


market
 still
 likes
 gold.
 Why?
 Well,


again,
 we
 were
 covering
 it
 in
 the


morning.
 S&P
 moving
 now.
 Wow.
 S&P
 really


moving
 up
 1.45.
 There
 might
 be
 a
 lot
 of


crypto
 companies
 that
 are
 buying
 gold,


including
 Tether,
 which
 is
 creating
 a


stable
 coin
 out
 of
 gold
 and
 backing
 it


one
 to
 one.
 So,
 there
 could
 be
 a
 variety


of
 reasons
 for
 why
 gold
 is
 getting
 the


run
 that
 it's
 getting.
 At
 its
 core,
 I


mean,
 the
 the
 argument
 that
 we've
 been


talking
 about
 for
 months
 now
 is
 that
 I


mean,
 cash
 is
 trash
 and
 you
 have
 the


biggest
 financial
 institutions
 in
 the


world
 saying
 like
 you
 your
 dollar
 the


dollar
 is
 not
 as
 exciting
 along
 with


central
 banks
 that
 are,
 you
 know,


transitioning
 into
 a
 lot
 of
 gold
 versus


treasuries
 as
 their
 reserves.


But
 regardless,
 you
 are
 seeing
 a


momentum
 in
 precious
 earth's
 copper,


gold
 price,
 etc.
 And
 we
 have
 not
 seen


that
 in
 a
 in
 a
 very
 long
 time
 with
 gold,


silver,
 and
 copper
 moving
 the
 way
 it
 is.


And
 that's
 why
 these
 rare
 earth
 mineral


stocks
 are
 moving
 as
 well.
 66250
 on
 the


S&P
 again,
 a
 new
 alltime
 high
 or
 not


alltime
 high,
 a
 new
 intraday
 high
 on
 the


day.
 Cipher
 and
 IN


also
 getting
 some
 love.
 Cipher,
 right,


they're
 up
 12%
 and
 I


6560.
 I
 ran
 hit
 70
 last
 week.
 Look
 at


that
 10%
 move.
 Dude,
 again,
 when
 you


have
 this
 type
 of
 a
 Monday
 morning,
 you


it
 tells
 retail
 to
 continue
 buying
 the


dip
 because
 the
 dip
 gets
 rewarded
 and


you're
 going
 to
 need
 a
 nice
 little
 rug


pull
 to
 get
 people
 to
 be
 annoyed
 with


anything
 they
 bought
 on
 Friday,
 but


you're
 not
 seeing
 that
 yet.
 Maybe
 you'll


see
 it
 this
 week,
 but
 you're
 not
 seeing


it
 yet.


We're
 also
 going
 to
 get
 the
 um


the
 uh
 the
 the
 the
 CPI
 from
 the
 BLS
 on


the
 24th.
 If
 that
 CPI
 is
 good
 right


before
 the
 Fed
 meeting
 and
 we
 get
 a
 cut


again,
 I
 think
 that's
 why
 the
 theory


over
 the
 next
 couple
 weeks
 is
 markets


are
 going
 to
 be
 like,
 wait
 a
 second,


earnings
 growth
 is
 good,
 rate
 rates
 are


coming
 down
 and
 Trump
 China
 is
 a


non-issue,
 but
 the
 market
 is
 still
 down


4%
 from
 where
 it
 was
 last
 week.
 Maybe


that's
 a
 buying
 opportunity


and
 that's
 where
 money
 comes
 in.
 Pounder


right
 here
 177.


I
 will
 say
 though,
 it
 obviously
 does


feel
 like
 certain
 stocks
 are
 frothy.


Like
 Rocket
 Lab,
 as
 much
 as
 I
 love


Rocket
 Lab,
 I
 don't
 think
 $70
 like
 makes


sense
 quantitatively.
 Like
 I
 just
 don't


like
 I
 I
 I
 and
 I
 think
 Matt
 Money
 would


agree
 with
 me.
 Matt's
 a
 big
 Rocket
 Lab


bull
 and
 he
 would
 probably
 say,
 "Yeah,


it's
 probably
 pushing
 a
 little
 bit."


Same
 thing
 with
 Hood.
 As
 bullish
 as
 I'm


on
 it,
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 150
 really
 makes


sense
 until
 they
 put
 up
 the
 earnings


growth.
 So
 the
 question
 then
 becomes,
 do


these
 stocks
 just
 continue
 to
 hold
 their


multiples
 and
 do
 they
 put
 up
 the


earnings
 growth
 that
 allows
 those


multiples
 to
 be
 justified
 or
 are
 they


just
 running
 for
 the
 hell
 of
 running?


And
 I
 hope
 it's
 the
 former
 versus
 the


latter
 because
 that's
 a
 more
 tangible


structural
 reason
 why
 these
 stocks
 are


getting
 a
 multiple
 versus,
 you
 know,


just
 money
 entering
 into
 the
 system,


which
 is
 inevitable.
 Money
 is
 going
 to


enter
 the
 system.
 But,
 you
 know,
 if


you're
 in
 a
 stock
 for
 a
 long
 time,
 you


also
 want
 it
 to
 be
 based
 on
 a
 more


fundamental
 catalyst.
 S&P
 663.
 Now,


she's
 really
 moving,
 busting
 through
 661


and
 662.


There
 you
 go.


663
 on
 the
 day.
 Now
 granted,
 if
 Oakl
 is


going to
 go
 to
 200,
 I
 mean,
 you're
 going


to
 Rocket
 Labs
 and
 Hood
 are,
 you
 know,


much
 better
 companies
 in
 my
 opinion
 than


an
 Oaklo
 just
 on
 an
 earnings
 basis,
 on
 a


revenue
 basis.
 They
 actually
 have
 a


little
 bit
 of
 money
 coming
 through
 the


door.
 So
 those
 names
 probably
 do


continue
 getting
 a
 premium
 if
 a
 name


like
 Oaklo
 gets
 a
 premium
 17%
 on
 the


day.


I
 mean,
 like
 this
 is
 I
 don't know,
 dude.


This
 is
 weird.
 This
 is
 weird.
 You
 think


on
 a
 day
 that
 flushes
 out
 the
 entire


system,
 the
 names
 that
 are
 are,
 you


know,
 a
 bit
 frothy
 don't
 get
 a
 massive


move.
 But
 though,
 that's
 the
 exact


opposite.
 You're
 getting
 a
 massive
 move


on
 these
 names
 on
 a
 Monday
 morning.
 I


don't
 know
 if
 that's
 bullish
 or
 bearish.


I
 mean,
 put
 in
 the
 chat,
 is
 that
 bullish


or
 bearish?
 What
 do
 you
 think?
 Is
 Oakl


gapping
 up
 17%
 making
 alltime
 highs


after
 a
 flush
 out
 bullish
 or
 bearish?
 I


mean,
 on
 on
 the
 surface,
 it
 looks


bullish.


underlying
 strength
 of
 some
 of
 these


names
 kind
 of
 feels
 a
 little
 bearish


because
 it's
 like
 you
 you
 don't
 want
 to


see
 some
 of
 that
 stuff
 happen.


It
 kind
 of
 here's
 the
 thing.
 It
 kind
 of


makes
 no
 sense,
 but
 it
 also
 is


potentially
 bullish.


And
 that
 can
 happen,
 right?
 Sometimes


things
 can
 make
 no
 sense,
 but
 they
 can


also
 be
 bullish.


And
 I
 think
 that's
 what
 we
 might
 be


seeing
 right
 here.


Or
 it's
 indicative
 of
 a
 bull
 trap.
 I


mean,
 we've
 got
 to
 see.
 We've
 really
 got


to
 get
 a
 lot
 more
 data.
 But
 S&P
 right


500
 right
 there
 662
 got
 all
 the
 way
 up


to
 663


on
 the
 day.
 Now
 if
 you
 own
 Oaklow
 it's


super
 bullish
 because
 you're
 probably


very
 happy
 and
 look
 that's
 great.
 The


question
 is
 just


you
 know
 can
 those
 stocks
 hold
 those


multiples.
 Big
 Bear
 by
 the
 way
 up
 17%.
 I


think
 Big
 Bear
 got
 a
 partnership
 this


morning.
 That's
 why
 that
 one's
 running.


This
 thing
 fell
 below
 $5
 um
 two
 months


ago.


So,


Big
 Bear
 and


TC
 partner
 to
 deliver
 AI
 enabled
 edge


infrastructure
 for
 the
 battlefield.


Okay,
 that's
 the
 partnership.
 I
 don't


know
 if
 there's
 any
 numbers
 on
 this


partnership,
 if
 there's
 any
 amount
 of


revenue
 or
 money,
 but
 regardless,
 the


stock
 is
 getting


a
 ton
 of
 a
 pump.
 And
 then
 TMC,
 again,


TMC
 seems
 to
 just
 be
 following
 US
 AR
 and


uh
 and
 MP,
 and
 that's
 why
 those
 stocks


are
 moving
 higher.


It's
 weird,
 dude.
 Very
 weird
 across
 the


board.
 But
 again,
 like
 I
 also
 think
 you


can't
 fight
 it,
 right?
 I
 mean,
 as
 long


as
 there
 is
 not
 froth
 in
 the
 most


important
 companies
 in
 the
 world,
 and


this
 is,
 I
 think,
 like
 the
 most


objective
 take
 anyone
 can
 have
 on
 this.


As
 long
 as
 there
 is
 not
 froth
 in
 the


Amazons,
 the
 Metas,
 the
 Invidas,
 the


Googles
 of
 the
 world,
 we're
 okay.
 You


might
 think
 there's
 froth
 in
 Big
 Bear.


You
 might
 think
 there's
 froth
 in


Quantum.
 You
 might
 think
 there's
 froth


in
 in
 Oaklo.
 And
 and
 trading
 in
 and
 out


of
 it,
 and
 you
 know,
 retail
 has
 made
 a


killing
 off
 a
 lot
 of
 those
 stocks.
 Even


if
 you
 think
 they're
 frothy,
 I
 don't


know
 if
 you
 can
 go
 far
 enough
 to
 say


that
 that
 level
 of
 frothiness
 means
 that


um
 the
 market
 is
 topped.
 I
 don't
 think


you
 can
 say
 that.
 I
 think
 there's


there's
 too
 much
 earnings
 growth
 in
 the


most
 important
 companies
 along
 with
 a
 a


a
 Fed
 that's
 easing


to
 to
 be
 bearish
 on
 the
 broader
 market


even
 if
 you
 think
 there's
 frothiness
 in


certain
 sectors.


And
 by
 the
 way,
 if
 there
 is
 frothiness


in
 certain
 sectors,
 again,
 if
 those


sectors
 go
 to
 zero,
 who
 cares?
 If
 Big


Bear
 AI
 goes
 to
 zero,
 who
 cares?
 That's


eight
 billion
 dollars
 of
 market
 cap
 gone


to
 zero.
 Like
 that's
 not
 going to
 affect


the
 market.
 Neither
 is
 Ollo.
 So,
 it's


one
 of
 those.
 Now,
 if
 Nvidia
 goes
 to


zero,
 that's
 a
 different
 question.
 But


like
 that
 where
 you
 don't,
 as
 Tom
 Lee


said
 this
 morning,
 Nvidia
 trades
 at
 a


cheaper
 multiple
 than
 freaking
 Walmart


and
 Costco.


And
 Nvidia
 right
 here
 trying
 to
 go
 back


to
 190.
 That's
 at
 up
 3.6%.


It
 doesn't
 feel
 like
 that
 one
 is
 that


expensive


relative
 to
 a
 lot
 of these
 other
 names


in
 the
 market.
 UNH
 right
 here,
 356.


That's
 green
 as
 well.
 That
 broke
 370.


That
 right
 there
 is
 at
 356.


TMQ,
 this
 was
 the
 company
 that
 Trump
 is


taking
 a
 stake
 in
 uh
 based
 on
 that


Alaska
 deal,
 16%.
 That
 one
 also


continuing
 to
 go
 green.
 The
 meme
 stock


ETF
 is
 up.
 I
 would
 imagine
 it's
 up


today.
 Yeah.
 Wow.
 Meme
 stock
 ETF
 up


11.79%
 on
 the
 day.
 This
 one
 has
 the


Oaklows,
 the
 BMRs,
 the
 ESTs's,
 HIMS.
 A


lot
 of
 those
 names
 I
 don't
 think
 are


meme
 stocks,
 but
 they
 have
 a
 ton
 of


those
 names
 in
 there.
 That's
 up
 12.2%


on
 the
 day.
 ABAT,
 is
 this
 the
 Trump


company?
 No,
 no,
 this
 is
 American


Battery
 Tech.
 Wow.
 ABAT
 50%.


American
 battery
 technology
 is
 a


technology
 company
 which
 engages
 in
 the


development
 of
 marketing
 of
 lithium
 ion


batteries.


50%
 move,
 folks.
 Uh
 I
 don't
 know
 if


there
 is
 a


a
 catalyst
 or
 if
 this
 is
 just
 pure
 rare


earth
 metals


that
 are
 moving.
 Uh
 we
 are
 proud
 to


share
 that
 after
 more
 than
 two
 years
 of


dedicated
 work,
 we
 have
 completed
 all


required
 baseline
 studies
 and
 submitted


the
 reports
 to
 the
 US
 Bureau
 of
 Land


Management.
 It
 looks
 like
 they
 completed


some
 phases
 of
 development
 that
 they


needed
 to
 start
 uh
 mining
 more
 lithium.


It
 looks
 like
 that's
 the
 announcement


today.
 And
 that
 along
 with
 the
 general


rare
 earth
 metals
 catalyst


is
 keeping
 the
 stock
 higher.
 49%
 on
 AB.


I
 didn't
 even
 know
 this
 company.
 I
 feel


like
 I
 heard
 of
 it
 a
 couple
 weeks
 ago,


but
 I
 didn't
 know
 too
 much
 about
 it.


ABAT
 right
 there.
 48%


along
 with
 US
 and
 MP.
 That's
 up.
 US
 is


up
 14%.


What
 about
 CRML?
 That
 was
 also
 another


company.
 critical
 rare
 earth
 mineral


metals
 uh
 21%
 that's
 up
 41%
 on
 the
 day.


My
 good.
 This
 one
 is
 not
 even
 getting


the
 Trump
 stake.
 Trump
 was
 supposed
 to


invest
 in
 these
 guys.
 That
 was
 the
 rumor


by
 Reuters
 as
 they
 came
 out
 and
 said


we're
 not
 doing
 it.
 That
 one
 still
 is
 up


41%.


Goodness
 gracious,
 bro.
 This
 is


incredible.
 Grab
 right
 there
 596
 and


then
 Google
 at
 241.
 Gold
 is
 still
 moving


as
 well.
 Gold
 not
 stop.
 Wow.
 4113
 on


gold.


I
 mean,


it's
 not
 slowing.
 It
 is
 simply
 not


slowing
 down.


Um,
 by
 the
 way,
 Palo
 Alto
 got
 an
 upgrade


today
 to
 248
 as
 well.
 So,
 Palo
 Alto


getting
 some
 green
 goodness,
 dude.
 Gold,


rare
 earth
 minerals,
 and
 energy.


Those
 have
 been
 the
 plays
 for
 the
 p
 I


mean
 if
 you
 wanted
 to
 make
 freaking
 30


to
 50%
 on
 your
 money
 if
 not
 much
 more


than
 that
 those
 have
 been
 the
 plays
 for


the
 past
 month
 really
 for
 the
 past


couple
 of
 months
 and
 you're
 continuing


to
 get
 some
 green.
 Yeah,
 I
 think
 I
 mean


obviously
 we're
 going to
 have
 to
 look


into
 rare
 earth
 minerals
 a
 lot
 more.
 I


mean
 it
 the
 market
 is
 telling
 us
 that


these
 are
 the
 stocks
 that
 I
 don't
 think


those
 are
 frothy
 by
 the
 way.
 I
 think


that
 obviously
 quantitatively
 if
 you


look
 at
 the
 market
 caps
 and
 the
 revenues


they
 might
 be
 frothy
 but
 this
 is
 a


sector
 where
 it
 looks
 like
 a
 lot
 of


money
 is
 getting
 ready
 to
 be
 deployed
 in


and
 it
 looks
 like
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 deals


being
 ready
 to
 be
 made
 as
 well.
 Now


granted
 I
 haven't
 gone
 through
 the


financials
 of
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 US
 us
 cap


is
 4
 billion.


I
 mean
 four
 billion
 is
 not
 the
 most
 you


know
 it's
 not
 the
 biggest
 company
 in
 the


world.
 So,
 we're
 going to
 have
 to
 see


what
 their
 financials
 look
 like,
 but


still
 it
 looks
 like
 these
 guys
 are
 small


and
 they're
 getting
 a
 bid
 based
 on
 what


Trump
 is
 trying
 to
 do.
 S&P
 662,


that
 one
 continues
 to
 go
 green.
 Here
 was


uh
 some
 analysis
 from
 the
 Olan
 podcast


on
 kind
 of
 why
 they
 think
 gold
 is


continuing
 to
 run
 important
 net
 new


buyer.
 It's
 Tether.
 Tether
 has
 been


issuing
 a
 stable
 coin
 called
 Tether
 Gold


where
 they'll
 actually
 custody
 the
 gold


on
 your
 behalf
 and
 it's
 the
 amount
 and


volumes
 of
 it
 are
 rising.
 At
 the
 same


time,
 central
 banks
 are
 rebalancing.
 And


then
 yet
 at
 the
 same
 time,
 you
 have
 a


lot
 of
 macro
 funds
 that
 have
 essentially


decided
 that
 central
 banks
 aren't
 to
 be


trusted
 and
 they
 don't
 know
 what
 to
 do


and
 so
 they're
 not
 necessarily
 long


bonds
 and
 they're
 not
 necessarily
 long


currencies
 and
 so
 they're
 long
 gold.
 So


I
 think
 it's
 a
 mixture
 of
 things.


There's
 no
 panacea
 explanation,
 but
 if


you
 had
 to
 put
 it
 into
 a
 couple
 buckets,


it's
 net
 new
 speculation,
 net
 new
 stable


coin
 related
 issuance,
 and
 a
 loss
 of


confidence
 in
 central
 bank
 policy
 around


the
 world.


>> And
 this
 is
 uh
 in
 some
 ways
 a
 good
 backs


stop,
 Brad,
 for
 governments.


>> There
 you
 go.
 That
 could
 be
 at
 least


some
 of
 the
 explanation.
 Also,
 China


buying
 is
 a
 good
 point
 for
 why
 gold's


getting
 green.


If
 we
 end
 out
 the
 day
 S&P
 up
 one
 and
 a


half
 percent,
 I
 think
 all
 of
 us
 will
 be


happy.
 I
 mean,
 we
 were
 down
 3%,


recovering
 50%
 of
 that,
 I
 think
 people


would
 be
 relatively
 happy.
 But
 the
 real


story
 is
 every
 other
 name
 that
 is


getting
 a
 massive
 move
 that
 really
 is


not,
 you
 know,
 part
 of
 the
 S&P
 or
 part


of
 the
 broader
 uh
 market
 index
 of
 like


the
 most
 important
 companies.
 The


Roundill
 meme
 stock
 ETF
 going
 up
 12%


that
 tells
 you
 kind
 of
 where
 the


sentiment
 is
 the
 Monday
 after
 a
 3%
 draw


down.
 Bit
 mine
 right
 there.
 5454
 that's


up
 three
 and
 a
 half
 percent


on
 the
 day
 as
 well.


APLD
 that's
 about
 to
 hit
 alltime
 highs.


They
 had
 a
 great
 earnings.
 They
 had
 a


phenomenal
 earnings.
 That's
 up
 14%
 on


the
 day.
 And
 look,
 if
 companies
 like


Apply
 Digital,
 which
 aren't
 the
 biggest


companies
 in
 the
 world,
 are
 putting
 up


good
 earnings.


Again,
 it's
 like
 you're
 I
 mean,
 I
 don't


think
 Meta
 puts
 up
 crappy
 earnings.
 I


don't
 think
 I
 puts
 up
 crappy
 earnings.


And
 if
 they
 don't,


I
 mean,
 those
 stocks
 are
 probably
 going


a
 bit
 higher.
 Richtech
 Robotics,
 that


stock
 right
 there,
 up
 11%.


All right,
 so
 I
 guess
 I
 guess
 here's
 the


question.
 Let's
 do
 this
 question
 in
 the


chat.
 Let's
 do
 a
 poll
 on
 this.


How
 are
 we
 feeling
 about
 some
 of
 these


names
 that
 are
 running?
 So,
 I
 mean,


let's
 let's
 do
 let's
 do
 this
 as
 a
 gauge.


Uh,
 by
 the
 way,
 five
 I
 think
 about
 80%


of
 you
 said
 we're
 going to
 be
 green
 for


the
 day.
 After
 a
 3%
 draw
 down,


how
 do
 you
 feel
 that
 meme
 is
 up
 11%.


Bullish,
 bearish,


doesn't
 matter.


Aka,
 after
 Froth
 getting
 kicked
 out
 of


the
 system
 on
 Friday,
 the
 meme
 stock
 ETF


being
 up
 12%
 likely
 means
 that
 there's
 a


little
 bit
 more
 froth
 coming
 in.


I
 kind
 of
 lean
 on
 the
 side
 of
 it
 doesn't


matter.
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 you
 can
 go


bearish
 on
 that.
 I
 really
 don't.
 And
 I


think
 I
 think
 the
 bears
 will
 point
 to


this
 being
 the
 the
 bull
 trap
 because
 of,


you
 know,
 entities
 like
 meme
 stock
 ETFs


being
 up
 on
 the
 day
 as
 much
 as
 they
 are.


But
 I
 don't
 think
 that's
 I
 I
 don't
 think


that's
 that's
 necessarily
 bearish.
 I


don't
 think
 that's
 super
 bullish
 either.


But
 it's
 bullish
 in
 terms
 of
 just
 like


more
 market
 momentum.
 I
 think
 it's


almost
 a
 nothing
 burger
 even
 if
 it
 is


hard
 to
 explain
 which
 is
 the
 unique


situation
 and
 the
 differentiated
 situ


situation
 this
 market
 is
 in
 given
 this


AI
 tailwind
 in
 the
 midst
 of
 the
 Fed


cutting.


It's
 hard
 to
 be
 like
 yep
 this
 is


completely
 bearish
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 those


aren't
 true
 meme
 stocks.
 That's
 also


true.


We
 have
 more
 gamblers
 that
 are


continuing
 to
 gamble.


Tes
 says,
 "Well,
 they
 aren't
 meme


stocks,
 so
 it
 doesn't
 matter."


The
 ETF
 is
 just
 an
 attempt
 to
 slander


retail.
 You
 know,
 that's
 actually
 a
 good


point.
 I
 mean,
 a
 lot
 of
 those
 names
 are


not
 meish.
 I
 think
 they
 just
 stuck
 them


in
 there
 because
 they
 see
 people
 on


Twitter
 talking
 about
 them
 in
 retail,


which
 could
 be
 the
 reason.
 S&P
 still


holding
 on
 to
 662.
 EOS,
 that's
 up
 17%


on
 the
 day.


Amazon
 should
 be
 up,
 not
 Oaklo.
 So
 this


I
 I
 I
 can
 totally
 resonate
 with
 this


sentiment.
 And
 this
 is
 the
 that
 sentence


right
 there
 is
 I
 think
 what
 people
 are


upset
 about.
 Amazon
 should
 be,
 you
 know,


maybe
 it
 doesn't
 have
 to
 move
 17%,
 but


Amazon
 should
 be
 up
 way
 more
 than
 a


company
 doing
 no
 revenue
 and
 no


earnings.
 However,
 Amazon's
 also
 a
 $2


trillion
 company.
 Oaklo
 is
 a
 $25
 billion


company.
 Amazon
 has
 way
 more
 shares


outstanding.
 Oaklo
 doesn't.
 Oaklo
 is


more
 shorted
 than
 Amazon.
 But
 you
 get


into
 all
 these
 nuanced


reasons
 for
 why
 a
 stock
 can
 go
 higher


than
 a
 Mac
 7,
 even
 if
 Amazon's
 earnings


are
 a
 lot
 better.
 And
 I
 don't
 think
 you


can
 cry
 about
 it,
 right?
 That's
 the


problem
 for
 the
 bears
 that
 use
 that
 as


their
 bare
 case.
 Well,
 Amazon's
 barely


up
 and
 Oak's
 up
 100%.
 It's
 like,
 well,


that's
 not
 a
 top.
 I
 mean,
 complaining


about
 one
 stock
 being
 up
 and
 another


stock
 being
 down,
 that's
 just
 just
 not


enough,
 I
 think,
 to
 say
 structurally


this
 has
 been
 uh
 indicative
 of
 a
 market


that
 can
 collapse.


It's
 hard
 to
 make
 that
 argument.
 Pounder


right
 there
 going
 green
 as
 well.
 176
 on


the
 day.
 I
 think
 we
 have
 some
 more


analysis
 right
 here
 on
 gold.
 Let's
 see


if
 we
 can
 get
 some
 commentary
 on
 why
 it


continues
 to
 move
 as
 high
 as
 it's


moving.


Uh
 let's
 pull
 this
 up
 right
 here.


To
 play
 out
 in
 one
 way
 or
 another
 given


everything
 that's
 going
 on,
 especially


again
 now
 with
 the
 trade
 war
 coming


back.
 The
 second
 reason
 why
 gold
 is


going
 up
 is
 because
 Chinese
 households


in
 the
 ETF
 data
 are
 buying
 significant


amounts
 of
 gold.
 And
 you
 also
 see
 on
 the


sanction
 side,
 central
 banks
 globally


are
 still
 divesting
 from
 US
 treasuries


and
 buying
 gold
 instead.
 So
 those
 three


tailwinds
 have
 continue
 to
 provide
 very


strong
 growth
 in
 in
 gold
 prices
 and
 we


should
 expect
 that
 to
 continue.


>> So
 those
 are
 going
 to
 be
 price


insensitive
 um
 you
 know
 kind
 of
 buyers


in
 there.
 In
 other
 words,
 they're
 going


to
 keep
 4,100
 an
 ounce.
 We're
 going
 to


keep
 buying.


>> I
 think
 some
 of
 them
 will
 be
 the
 central


banks
 because
 of
 sanctions.
 They're


definitely
 price
 insensitive.
 And
 I


think
 also
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 demand
 from


China
 has
 likely
 also
 been
 price


insensitive
 because
 Chinese
 households


can
 really
 only
 buy
 two
 things
 namely


apartments
 and
 housing
 and
 stock
 prices.


They
 don't
 have
 the
 option
 of
 buying
 US


equities
 the
 same
 way
 that
 we
 have
 here


in
 the
 US
 and
 Europe.
 So
 because
 of
 that


they
 have
 been
 diversifying
 away
 from


their
 traditional
 investments
 more


towards
 buying
 gold.
 The
 ETF
 demand
 in


Chinese
 gold
 has
 been
 very
 very
 strong


in
 China.


>> It
 was
 weird
 to
 see
 the
 stock
 market


sell
 off
 so
 much
 Friday
 and
 then
 gold


sell
 off
 right.
 It
 wasn't
 a
 safe
 haven


and
 now
 for
 a
 while.
 Yeah,
 absolutely.


>> I
 know.


>> So,
 Bitcoin,
 too.
 All right,
 Torson,


great
 to
 see
 you.
 Thank
 you.


>> That
 That
 was
 not
 on
 1.5x.
 That
 guy
 is
 a


yapper.
 That
 guy
 is
 a
 a
 yapper,
 bro.
 He


talks
 faster
 than
 me.
 Oh,
 wow.
 Howard


Marks
 is
 going
 to
 be
 on
 today.
 Oh,


that's
 going
 to
 be
 interesting
 to
 hear


what
 Howard
 Marx
 says.
 You
 guys
 know


Howard
 Marks
 has
 been
 saying
 this
 is
 all


a
 bubble.
 If
 anyone
 has
 not
 kept
 up
 with


his
 thesis,
 well,
 he's
 not
 literally


been
 saying
 it's
 a
 bubble.
 He's
 he's


just
 been
 saying


there's
 no
 need
 to
 buy
 the
 S&P.
 I
 mean,


he
 he
 thinks
 that
 markets
 are
 really


elevated
 and
 he
 started
 saying
 this
 back


in
 August.
 Now,
 obviously,
 he's
 not


necessarily
 been
 correct
 since
 then,
 but


it
 is
 going
 to
 be
 interesting
 to
 see


kind
 of
 how
 he
 thinks
 about
 the
 selloff


that
 we
 had
 on
 Friday


and
 some
 of
 the
 recovery
 that's
 playing


out.
 Pound
 right
 there
 at
 176
 BMR
 54


5402.


is
 what
 we
 have
 on
 BMR.


Um


Howard
 Marks
 only
 said
 investors
 need
 to


be
 cautious.
 Yeah,
 but
 I
 mean
 look,
 he


also,
 if
 you
 watch
 the
 Bloomberg
 piece


he
 did
 back
 in
 August,
 he
 tried
 to
 not


say
 it
 was
 a
 bubble,
 but
 you
 could


pretty
 much
 tell
 through
 the
 tone
 of
 his


voice,
 he
 is
 not
 excited
 about


valuations
 at
 the
 moment.
 But
 I
 think


he's
 on
 right
 now.
 Let's
 let's
 take
 a


look
 at
 him
 and
 see
 what
 he's
 thinking


about
 this
 market.


>> I
 sat
 down
 with
 Markx
 exclusively
 to


talk
 about
 how
 his
 views
 on
 the
 market


have
 developed
 over
 the
 years
 and


whether
 he
 ever
 thought
 when
 he
 first


started
 writing
 these
 memos
 that
 they


would
 become
 what
 they
 have.


>> I
 actually
 can
 say
 that
 it
 was
 not
 uh


premeditated.
 Uh
 I
 wrote
 the
 first
 one


because
 I
 had
 a
 couple
 of
 things
 happen


that
 I
 thought
 the
 juxosition


uh
 would
 be
 interesting
 for
 people
 to


read
 about
 and
 it
 illustrated
 uh
 an


important
 uh
 value
 of
 oak
 trees
 and


that's
 why
 I
 wrote
 it.
 I
 didn't
 have
 a


plan.
 I
 don't
 think
 I
 even
 had
 a
 plan
 to


write
 another.
 Certainly
 not
 with
 any


regularity.
 Certainly
 not
 160
 odd
 memos


over
 35
 years.


>> That
 was
 October
 12th,
 1990.
 You
 wrote


about
 performance.
 I
 went
 back
 and


looked
 at
 looked
 at
 this
 one
 and


essentially
 there
 there's
 always
 a


little
 bit
 of
 a
 a
 lesson
 based
 on
 your


personal
 experience
 and
 that
 was
 don't


swing
 for
 the
 fences.


>> Right.
 Right.
 I
 I
 met
 with
 a
 a
 client
 in


Minneapolis
 who
 explained
 that
 he'd
 been


managing
 a
 pension
 fund
 for
 14
 years
 and


in
 those
 14
 years
 uh
 the
 equities
 had


never
 been
 above
 the
 27th
 percentile
 or


below
 the
 47th
 percentile.
 So
 solidly
 in


the
 second
 quartile
 14
 years
 in
 a
 row


and
 where
 did
 that
 place
 them
 for
 the
 14


years
 overall?


Fourth
 percentile.
 Well,
 how
 just
 how


does
 that
 work?
 If
 you
 if
 you
 fluctuate


between
 27
 and
 47,
 don't
 you
 average
 37?


No,
 you
 get
 up
 to
 the
 top,
 the
 very
 top


of
 the
 universe,
 because
 everybody
 else


eventually
 shoots
 themselves
 in
 the
 foot


>> because
 they
 took
 too
 much
 risk,


>> right,
 at
 the
 wrong
 time.
 So,
 so,


uh,


consistent
 good
 performance
 and
 an


absence
 of
 blowups
 will
 give
 you
 a


terrific
 record
 over
 time.
 You
 don't


have
 to
 be
 a
 hero.


>> So,
 when
 did
 you
 start
 getting
 a


response?


um
 on
 the
 first
 the
 tech
 stocks
 started


to
 decline
 and
 then
 uh
 as
 I
 wrote
 in


some
 place
 after
 10
 years
 I
 became
 an


overnight
 success


>> because
 it
 was
 a
 great
 call.
 You
 had


also
 some
 similar
 warnings
 2007,


>> right?


>> Right
 before
 the
 market
 crash
 about


excessive
 risk-taking.
 So
 that
 that
 that


is
 a
 theme.
 You
 can
 predict
 these


bubbles
 based
 on
 what
 psychology.


>> It
 is
 it
 has
 a
 lot
 to
 do
 with
 psychology


and
 the
 resultant
 behavior.
 So
 if
 you


can
 just
 uh
 be
 sensitive
 to
 the


psychology
 that's
 governing
 the
 markets


and
 the
 behavior
 that
 that's
 directing


uh
 people
 to
 engage
 in.
 I
 think
 you
 can


figure
 out


those
 rare
 occasions
 when
 you're
 at
 an


extreme
 when
 the
 market
 is
 either
 crazy


high
 because
 of
 excessive
 optimism
 or


crazy
 low
 because
 of
 excessive


pessimism.
 And
 when
 you
 can
 find
 those


occasions
 which
 arise
 once
 every
 decade


or
 so,
 uh
 maybe
 you
 can
 make
 hay


>> because
 you
 also
 had
 one
 in
 2008
 around


just
 before
 the
 bottom
 where
 you
 said


it's
 starting
 to
 look
 very
 interesting.


>> Oh
 yes.
 Well,
 again,
 excess.
 That's
 the


key.
 Um


I
 think
 it
 was
 October
 the
 8th
 of
 '08.


Um
 which
 was
 very
 very
 close
 to
 the


bottom
 of
 psychology
 in
 that
 cycle.
 And


I
 wrote
 a
 memo
 called
 the
 the
 uh
 the


limits
 to
 negativism.
 You
 know,
 it's
 our


job
 to
 be
 skeptical.
 What
 I
 said
 in
 the


memo
 is
 that
 I
 was
 detecting
 sentiment


that
 was
 too
 bad
 to
 be
 true.
 I
 could
 not


come
 up
 with
 a
 an
 assumption
 negative


enough
 to
 satisfy
 the
 naysayers.
 And


when
 that
 level
 of
 excessive
 pessimism


is
 prevalent,
 you
 have
 to
 conclude
 that


maybe
 the
 prices
 of
 assets
 are
 just
 too


low
 because
 the
 psychology
 is
 depressing


them.
 And
 so,
 you
 know,
 we
 concluded


that
 we
 had
 a
 great
 opportunity.
 And
 uh


fortunately,
 we
 had
 raised
 a
 lot
 of


money
 in
 in
 advance
 of
 what
 we
 thought


would
 be
 a
 good
 opportunity.
 and
 and
 my


partner
 Bruce
 Gar
 u
 swung
 into
 action


and
 uh
 invested
 at
 a
 at
 a
 very
 uh
 fast


clip
 and
 and
 of
 course
 uh
 in
 the
 in
 the


uh
 aftermath
 of
 the
 Lehman
 meltdown
 etc.


AIG
 and
 so
 forth
 all
 you
 had
 to
 do
 was


buy
 vigorously
 and
 uh
 fortunately
 he
 did


>> and
 that
 was
 a
 that
 was
 a
 winning
 trade.


So
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 look
 at
 the
 the


moment
 that
 we
 are
 in
 right
 now
 and
 they


see
 very
 high
 valuations
 and
 I
 don't


know
 how
 you
 would
 deem
 sentiment
 but


there's
 certainly
 a
 lot
 of
 enthusiasm


around
 technology
 like
 AI.


>> Are
 we
 in
 that
 moment?


>> There's
 enthusiasm.
 There
 are
 high


valuations.


I
 I
 don't
 know
 enough
 about
 tech
 stocks


or
 stocks
 in
 general
 or
 AI
 specifically


to
 know
 whether
 the
 valuations
 are


excessive.
 My
 response
 to
 date
 has
 been


that
 the
 valuations
 are
 not
 crazy,
 high


but
 not
 crazy.
 And
 when
 when
 things
 are


either
 high
 or
 low
 but
 not
 crazy,
 you


can't
 make
 an
 observation
 that
 has
 a


high
 likelihood
 of
 being
 correct.
 And
 um


you
 know
 this
 may
 prove
 to
 have
 been
 a


time
 when
 you
 should
 have
 uh
 become


defensive.
 Um,
 and
 people
 will
 look
 back


and
 say,
 well,
 well,
 why
 didn't
 you?
 But


I
 don't
 think
 you
 can
 say
 that


dependably
 right
 now.
 Expensive.


>> So,
 uh,
 that's
 a
 quite
 interesting


statement
 from
 Markx.
 Valuations
 are


high
 right
 now,
 but
 not
 crazy.
 I
 mean,


it's
 not
 as
 bearish
 as
 he
 kind
 of


sounded
 two
 months
 ago
 when
 he
 was
 a


little
 bit
 more
 around
 sounding
 the


alarm,
 but
 right
 now
 he's
 saying,
 well,


I
 I
 guess
 I
 mean,
 since
 then,
 we've
 had


some
 more
 earnings,
 so
 maybe
 he's
 seen


the
 earnings
 and
 it's
 hard
 to
 deny
 some


of
 the
 momentum
 from
 those
 earnings.


Also,
 the
 Fed
 is
 cutting
 and
 you
 know,


Howard
 Marks
 understands
 the
 macro


really
 well.
 If
 you're
 gonna
 get
 a


Federal
 Reserve
 rate,
 you
 know,
 anywhere


below
 two
 and
 a
 half
 percent,
 valuations


might
 not
 be
 that
 crazy.
 So
 actually


kind
 of
 a
 bullish
 statement
 coming
 from


works


>> and
 going
 down
 tomorrow
 are
 not


synonymous.
 And
 uh
 I
 wrote
 a
 memo


celebrating
 the
 25th
 anniversary
 of
 of


that
 first
 memo
 bubble.com
 that
 got


attention.
 I
 wrote
 it
 a
 memo
 called
 on


bubble
 watch.
 And
 I
 said
 that
 to
 me
 the


main
 ingredient
 in
 bubbles
 is
 uh


psychological
 excess.
 There's
 no
 such


thing
 as
 a
 price
 too
 high.
 And
 I
 don't


detect
 that
 level
 of
 of
 uh
 mania
 at
 this


time.
 So
 I
 have
 not
 uh
 put
 the
 bubble
 uh


label
 on
 this
 on
 this
 incident


>> because
 some
 people
 are
 wondering
 if


there
 are
 echoes
 back
 to
 the
 dot
 bubble


with
 AI


>> transformational
 technology


>> by
 all
 the
 the
 chip
 stocks
 that
 are


playing
 into
 it.


>> Right.
 Right.
 Well,
 uh


I
 think
 there's
 relatively
 little
 doubt


that
 AI
 will
 change
 the
 world


and
 AI
 has
 been
 successful
 as
 an


investment
 and
 people
 are
 piling
 in
 and


there's
 some
 fear
 about
 being
 left
 out.


Um
 but
 to
 me
 it
 just
 hasn't
 this
 is
 a


judgment
 call
 and
 to
 me
 it
 just
 hasn't


reached
 that
 critical
 mass
 of
 mania.


Value
 is
 another
 theme.
 You
 just
 wrote


about
 value
 in
 your
 recent
 August.


>> All
 right.
 So,
 I
 mean,
 pretty
 decent


commentary
 from
 Markx.
 Now,
 remember
 the


headline
 in
 his
 Bloomberg
 interview
 two


months
 ago
 was
 US
 stocks
 quote
 in
 the


early
 days
 for
 a
 bubble.
 That
 was
 the


headline.
 Anyone
 can
 go
 watch
 it.
 Type


in
 Howard
 Marks
 Bloomberg
 on
 YouTube


about
 two
 months
 ago.
 That
 was
 the


headline
 that
 he
 said
 in
 that
 interview.


It
 looks
 like
 his
 tone
 has
 kind
 of


changed.
 I
 mean,
 he
 didn't
 say
 anything


uh
 along
 the
 idea
 of
 we
 are
 in
 the
 quote


unquote
 early
 days
 of
 a
 bubble.
 In
 fact,


he's
 saying
 that
 AI
 can
 change
 the
 world


and
 he's
 not
 seeing
 the
 hype
 and
 sort
 of


uh
 what
 did
 he
 call
 euphoric
 mania
 that


would
 constitute
 the
 bubble
 label.
 So,
 I


guess
 in
 the
 past
 couple
 months,
 maybe


his
 thinking
 has
 shifted
 a
 little
 bit


more
 towards
 potentially
 even


recognizing
 the
 the
 transformational


effects
 of
 AI,
 deflating
 a
 lot
 of
 the


hype
 that
 he
 thought
 existed
 and
 that


could
 be
 a
 tailwind.
 Now,
 Howard
 Marks


is
 not
 invested
 in
 any
 of
 the
 AI


companies.
 Um,
 so
 he
 doesn't
 have


exposure
 to
 it,
 but


doesn't
 look
 like
 it's
 the
 most
 the
 most


bearish.
 S&P
 right
 there,

 getting
 a


bit

 That's


down
 half
 a
 percent.

 holding

 And
 then
 Google

 Silver

 Really?
 Goodness
 gracious,
 bro.


Silver


spot
 52.
 Wow.


This
 is
 incredible,
 bro.
 You
 could
 have


bought
 silver
 and
 gold
 in
 January
 and


just
 sat
 back
 and
 chilled.


Is
 anyone
 buying
 silver
 or
 gold
 right


now?
 Like,
 is
 anyone
 buying
 precious


metal?
 I
 like
 I
 feel
 like
 if
 you
 have
 a


obviously
 like
 a
 10,
 20
 year
 horizon,


buy
 silver
 and
 gold.
 It'll
 be
 fine.
 But


is
 anyone
 buying
 it
 for
 a
 trade?
 kind
 of


feel
 like
 the
 juice
 has
 been
 squeezed,


right?
 Both
 up
 50%.
 But
 then
 again,


I
 mean,
 if
 if
 if
 freaking
 Tether
 and


central
 banks
 and
 these
 crypto
 stable


coins
 are
 going to
 back
 gold
 one
 to
 one,


I
 mean,
 maybe
 it's
 going
 way
 higher.


Maybe
 it's
 going
 way
 higher.


I
 bought
 last
 year.
 I
 bought
 a
 couple


months
 ago.


I
 bought

 in
 2020.


I
 have

Yeah,
 gold

 have
 done
 great

year.
 Even

 as
 well.

Wow.

Goodness
 gracious,
 bro.
 Talk.
 I
 mean,


people
 say
 the
 market's
 led
 by
 tech,
 but


there's
 been
 a
 lot
 of
 diversification
 in


this
 rally
 across
 a
 bunch
 of
 different


names.


Gold
 miners,
 rare
 earth,
 uh,
 metals,
 uh,


energy
 stocks,
 nuclear,
 I
 mean,
 all
 this


stuff
 has
 not
 been
 in
 the
 Broadcoms
 or


Invidas
 of
 the
 world,
 but
 they've
 done


well.
 Energy
 fuels
 today
 up
 18.5%.


Goodness
 gracious,
 bro.
 This
 has
 been


pretty
 wild.


My
 uncle's
 in
 the
 chat.
 He
 says,
 you


know,
 I've
 been
 holding
 silver
 from
 our


India
 trip.
 He
 told
 me
 to
 buy
 it.
 I


didn't
 buy
 it.
 He
 said,
 "Buy
 silver."
 I


was
 just
 like,
 "Bro,
 who
 cares
 about


silver,
 bro?"


He
 gave
 me
 a
 whole
 book.
 It
 was
 like,


"Read
 this
 book
 about
 silver."
 I
 was


like,
 I'm
 buying
 more
 Robin
 Hood.
 I


don't
 give
 a
 [ __ ]
 about
 silver.
 It
 was


technically
 wasn't
 that
 I
 mean,
 Robin


was
 26
 at
 the
 time,
 so
 that
 worked
 out,


but
 I
 should
 have
 probably
 got
 a
 little


bit
 of
 silver.


I
 mean,
 dude,
 it's
 really
 broken
 out.


Silver,
 copper,
 and
 gold.
 It
 really
 has.


And
 usually
 these
 things
 happen
 in


multi-year
 cycles.
 So,
 if
 we're
 in
 one


of those
 multi-year
 cycles,


maybe
 that's


somewhat
 of
 what
 you're
 seeing
 right


now.
 What's
 the
 name
 of
 the
 book?


Okay,
 I
 should
 be
 able
 to
 find
 this


pretty
 easily
 because
 there's
 not
 that


many
 books
 on
 this.
 Um,


my
 uncle
 can
 give
 us
 the
 name
 of
 the


book
 in
 the
 chat.


It
 was
 a
 it
 was
 a
 book
 that
 came
 out
 in


like
 23
 or
 24,
 but
 it
 was
 it
 was
 one
 of


like
 the
 most
 important
 books
 at
 least


that
 he
 said
 to
 read
 in
 silver.
 Yeah.


Silver,
 gold,
 etc.
 also
 used
 in


semiconductors.
 Copper
 is
 used
 in
 data


centers.
 So,
 like
 like
 the
 AI
 uh
 thesis


is
 kind
 of
 synonymous
 with
 a
 lot
 of the


precious
 metals
 that
 are


that
 are
 going
 up.
 Yeah.
 The
 Great


Silver
 Bull.
 That's
 what
 it's
 called.


The
 Great
 Silver
 Bull.


This
 is
 Yeah,
 this
 came
 out
 in
 2022.


This
 is
 the
 name
 of
 the
 book
 for
 those


that
 want
 to
 learn
 more
 about
 silver.


Um
 Okay.
 So,
 crypto's
 going
 red.
 Hood


just
 went
 red.
 Bitcoin
 ETH
 going
 down.


Looks
 like
 there's
 going
 to
 need
 to
 be
 a


little
 bit
 more
 buying
 pressure
 to
 get


people
 excited
 about
 those.
 BMR
 as
 a


result
 will
 probably
 go
 down
 as
 well.


5333
 down
 from
 56,


but
 you're
 getting
 some
 of
 the
 high
 beta


names
 taking
 a
 dip.
 Also,
 S&P
 663
 back


to
 660.
 So,
 not
 really
 a
 trend
 today.
 A


lot
 of
 back
 and
 forth
 price
 action.
 If


you
 were
 assigned
 puts
 on
 Friday,
 I


mean,
 you're
 getting
 liquidity
 today.


you're
 probably
 going
 to
 be
 able
 to
 sell


for
 at least,
 you
 know,
 if
 you
 sold
 puts


on
 Meta
 at
 700
 or
 Nvidia
 at
 180,
 I
 mean,


you're
 getting
 the
 ability
 to
 sell


today.
 Question
 is,
 do
 you
 want
 to
 sell


or
 do
 you
 think
 there's
 a
 lot
 more
 room


going
 higher?
 You
 sold
 puts
 on
 SoFi
 at


25.
 I
 mean,
 there's
 tons
 of


se
 buyers
 that
 are
 stepping
 in.


So,
 the
 question
 now
 is
 how
 do
 you


manage
 some
 of
 the
 puts
 that
 were


assigned
 on
 Friday?
 I
 mean,
 BMR,
 there


were
 people,
 there
 was
 someone
 on


Twitter
 I
 was
 talking
 to,
 she
 got
 signed


20,000
 shares
 of
 BMR
 at
 48
 because
 she


had
 uh
 she
 she
 sold
 puts
 on
 it.
 I
 mean,


dude,
 BMR
 is
 up
 five
 bucks
 today.
 That's


$100,000.
 If
 you
 want
 to
 sell
 the
 entire


position,
 you
 know,
 the
 the
 the
 rebound


has
 been
 quite
 quick,
 at least
 to
 some


extent,


to
 get
 some
 of
 that
 liquidity.


Did
 you
 look
 at
 TAC?
 Chris
 Camila
 likes


this
 one.
 So,
 this
 is
 an
 this
 is
 a


Canadian
 company,
 if
 I'm
 not
 wrong.
 TAC,


it's
 up
 11%
 today.
 Engages
 in
 the


distribution
 of
 electricity
 through


wind,
 hydro
 gas,
 coal
 power
 plants.


Okay,
 so
 this
 is
 an
 energy
 name,
 $5


billion
 company.
 Yeah,
 Alberta,
 Calgary


is
 its
 headquarters.
 I
 have
 not
 looked


into
 this.
 Um,


if
 Dumb
 Money
 did
 an
 episode
 on
 it,
 then


I
 do
 think
 it's
 worth
 looking
 at
 it.
 It


looks
 like
 they're
 looking
 for
 the


energy
 plays
 as
 well.
 Seems
 like


everyone's
 looking
 for
 what's
 the
 next


energy
 play


uh
 given
 the
 run
 we've
 seen
 in
 energy.


So
 yeah,
 it
 would
 be
 worth
 looking
 into.


I'll
 see
 if
 I
 can
 do
 some
 some
 due


diligence
 on
 this.
 Translata,
 how
 much


is
 this
 stock
 up
 year
 to
 date?
 TAC


10:30
 slam.
 All
 right,
 it's
 10:30.
 Let's


see
 if
 we
 get
 slammed.
 It's
 only
 up
 23%.


That's
 good.
 Not
 a
 big
 mover.


So
 maybe
 there
 is
 some
 opportunity,
 but


we're
 gonna
 have
 to
 do
 some
 fundamental


looks
 on
 it.
 Um


Brocky
 said,
 "I
 bought
 300
 shares
 of


BMR."
 Yeah,
 I
 think
 a
 decent
 decent


chunk
 of
 people
 bought
 the
 dip
 on
 that


on
 on
 Friday.
 I
 know
 Steve
 bought
 some


more
 on
 that
 as
 well.
 We
 got
 Amcor
 back


to
 30,
 which
 is
 nice
 to
 see.
 This
 one


fell
 to
 2850.
 I
 did
 buy
 the
 dip
 at


28.50.
 I
 also
 bought
 at
 $30.80
 80
 cents


right
 before
 the
 dip.
 So,
 amazing


timing,
 but
 this
 one
 trying
 to
 get
 back


up
 to
 30
 bucks.
 Pound
 right
 there.
 17622


on
 the
 day.
 All right,
 let's
 finish
 up


with
 Howard
 Marks


and
 then
 we'll
 keep
 going
 from
 there.


Made
 it's
 it's
 harder
 to
 do
 that
 on
 a


value
 basis,
 especially
 for
 startups
 or


companies
 that
 are
 that
 are
 uh
 early
 in


their
 life
 cycle.
 Um
 but
 you
 know
 the


the
 connotation
 of
 uh
 hard
 value


investing
 has
 been
 prosaic
 companies


that
 have
 existed
 for
 a
 long
 time
 that


are
 not
 really
 on
 a
 growth
 curve
 but


rather
 are
 quite
 stable
 but
 have


repeatable
 uh
 cash
 flows
 and
 earnings


and
 so
 forth.
 uh


that's
 kind
 of
 the
 extreme
 of
 value


investing
 with
 a
 capital
 V
 and
 that
 may


be
 too
 restrictive.
 Uh
 so
 uh
 I
 think


something
 in
 between
 I
 think


based
 on
 the
 historic
 numbers


something
 like
 the
 S&P
 500
 is
 expensive


today.
 There's
 no
 question
 about
 it.
 The


PE
 ratio
 on
 the
 S&P
 500
 is
 around
 24
 on


next
 year's
 on
 the
 next
 year's
 earnings


and
 the
 historic
 average
 is
 16.
 So
 you


can't
 say
 it's
 not
 expensive,
 but
 what


you
 have
 to
 engage
 in
 is
 and
 I
 in
 the
 my


last
 memo,
 the
 calculus
 of
 value,
 I
 gave


the
 what
 I
 thought
 was
 part
 of
 the
 bull


case,
 which
 is
 the
 S&P
 now
 is
 better.


They're
 better
 companies.
 Uh
 they
 have


uh
 market
 dominance,
 fabulous
 products,


not
 moes
 uh
 protecting
 against


competition,
 enormous
 incremental


profitability
 and
 and
 and
 great
 growth


potential.
 Um


>> so
 the
 optimism
 is
 warranted.


>> They're
 better
 companies,
 so
 they


warrant
 uh
 higher
 multiples
 and
 the


optimism
 is
 warranted.
 And


>> dude,
 this
 is
 pretty
 bullish
 by
 Markx.


this
 is
 I
 mean
 first
 of
 all
 he's
 saying


he
 doesn't
 see
 euphoria.
 He's
 saying
 yes


the
 S&P
 is
 expensive
 but
 the
 valuations


are
 warranted
 because
 there's
 better


companies


and
 he's
 also
 saying
 that
 it's
 not
 he


he's
 refusing
 to
 put
 the
 bubble
 label
 on


it.
 I
 mean
 from
 a
 val
 from
 a
 traditional


value
 investor
 I
 don't
 think
 you
 can
 ask


for
 anything
 better.
 Seems
 like
 he's


saying
 this
 is
 a
 bull
 market
 that
 has


the
 potential
 to
 continue.
 I'm
 not


knowledgeable
 enough
 to
 say
 that's


wrong.
 But
 you
 you
 but


this
 is
 an
 example
 of
 something
 called


this
 time
 it's
 different


>> which
 you
 must
 that
 must
 worry
 you
 a


little
 this


>> well
 this
 time
 it's
 different
 is
 always


said
 about
 the
 quote
 new
 new
 thing.
 Um


>> it's
 said
 during
 bubbles
 too
 right?


>> It's
 well
 especially
 in
 bubbles
 and
 it's


it
 is
 the
 sentiment
 that
 gives
 rise
 to


bubbles.
 This
 is
 something
 we've
 never


seen
 before.
 There's
 no
 historical


parallel.
 Uh
 this
 thing's
 going
 to
 the


moon.
 Uh
 the
 valuations
 are
 high,
 but


this
 time
 it's
 different.


>> So,
 can
 we
 expect
 35
 more
 years?


>> Uh
 that's
 my
 goal.
 Uh
 will
 you
 still


come
 visit
 me?


>> Of
 course,
 I'll
 come
 visit
 you
 and
 we'll


interview
 you
 every
 time
 because
 we


always
 want
 to
 hear
 what
 you
 have
 to


say.


>> Thank
 you
 very
 much.


>> Thank
 you
 so
 much,
 Howard.
 Really


appreciate
 it,


>> dude.
 Pretty
 bullish
 by
 Howard
 Marks.
 I


did
 not
 expect
 him
 to
 give
 those
 types


of
 quotes.
 just
 given
 kind
 of
 where
 he


was
 leaning
 towards
 a
 couple
 months
 ago.


But,
 uh,
 he's
 not
 necessarily
 that


bearish
 on
 the
 market.
 Again,
 Howard


Marks
 does
 own
 I
 think
 like
 14
 million


shares
 of
 Grab,
 so
 he
 is
 heavy
 in
 that


one.
 Uh,
 but
 he's
 not
 in
 the
 S&P
 or


Nvidia
 or
 anything
 like
 that.
 Um,


but
 it
 doesn't
 seem
 like
 he's


necessarily
 calling
 the
 top
 here
 or


saying
 that
 it's
 a
 bubble.
 So,
 Britney


says
 he
 has
 aura.
 Yes,
 he
 has
 aura.


Dude,
 Howard
 Marks,
 how
 old
 do
 you
 guys


think
 he
 is?
 He
 is
 I
 actually
 I
 actually


studied
 Howard
 Marks
 a
 couple
 months
 ago


because
 he
 bought
 Grab
 and
 Grab's
 a
 big


position.
 So,
 I
 went
 deep
 into
 like
 his


life
 and
 I
 read
 a
 lot
 of
 his
 memos.


Howard
 Marks
 is
 79
 years
 old


and
 he
 seems
 as
 sharp
 as
 ever.
 So,
 it's


quite
 incredible.
 And
 he's
 still


managing
 money
 at
 a
 at
 a
 pretty
 high


level
 as
 well.


And
 it
 doesn't
 seem
 like
 he
 has
 uh
 any


plans
 to
 slow
 down.
 By
 the
 way,
 I


watched
 a
 46-inute
 documentary
 over
 the


weekend
 on
 raising
 Canes.
 Did
 you
 guys


know
 the
 Raising
 Canes
 founder
 is
 worth


$26
 billion.


He
 owns
 92%
 of
 the
 company.


It
 was
 it
 was
 a
 documentary
 on
 Forbes's


YouTube
 channel.
 Like,
 it
 was
 a


fascinating
 story
 of
 what
 this
 guy
 had


to
 do
 to
 start
 the
 first
 Raising
 Canes.


I've
 only
 had
 it
 once
 in
 my
 life
 because


there's
 not
 a
 lot
 of
 Raising
 Canes
 in


New
 York
 or
 New
 Jersey.
 Uh
 it's
 more
 of


a
 down
 south,
 Midwest
 type
 of
 thing.


started
 in
 Louisiana,
 but
 they
 have
 a


simple
 menu.
 Chicken
 fingers,
 fries,


kleslaw,
 and
 bread.
 And
 they
 do
 five


billion
 in
 sales.
 And
 they
 have
 almost
 a


thousand
 locations
 worldwide.
 I
 mean,
 26


billion
 off
 raising
 canes.
 Yeah.


Louisiana
 Icon.


90,
 dude.
 And
 they
 were
 like,
 "Hey,
 when


are
 you
 going
 public?"
 He's
 like, "Bro,


we
 are
 never
 going
 public."
 He's
 like,


"I
 don't
 want
 to
 answer
 to
 quarterly


earnings
 and
 shareholders
 and
 try
 to
 get


our
 numbers
 every
 90
 days."
 He's
 like,


"No,
 we're
 fine
 doing
 what
 we
 do."
 And
 I


mean,
 the
 dude
 the
 worth
 the
 guy's
 worth


26
 billion.
 Why
 would
 he
 even
 want
 to
 go


public?
 Like
 most
 people
 go
 public
 for


liquidity.
 I
 mean,
 he
 has
 plenty
 of


liquidity
 and
 you
 know,
 his
 net
 worth


continues
 to
 increase
 as
 the
 company


continues
 to
 grow.


But
 it's
 quite
 an
 incredible
 American


establishment
 that's
 been
 able
 to
 take


off.
 S&P
 500
 right
 there,
 1.37%.
 That's


green.
 And
 then
 Nvidia
 still
 holding


188.
 I
 bought
 SMCI
 call
 spreads
 6090
 for


2027.
 I
 said
 that
 last
 week.
 SMCI
 call


debit
 spread
 for
 Jan
 2027.
 6090.


Um
 I'm
 probably
 not
 going
 to
 wait
 for
 it


to
 get
 to
 90.
 You
 know,
 if
 it
 makes
 a


nice
 move
 up
 to
 75,
 which
 is
 kind
 of


what
 I
 think
 is
 more
 fair
 value
 based
 on


all
 the
 deals
 we've
 seen
 with
 Nvidia,


AMD,
 all
 of
 these
 are
 going
 to
 need
 more


liquid
 cooling
 technology
 for
 GPUs.
 It's


just
 that
 simple.
 So,
 it's
 a
 very
 simple


trade
 on
 the
 idea
 that
 SMCI
 will


probably
 catch
 up
 with
 a
 lot
 of the


other
 semiconductor
 names.
 the
 stock's


been
 relatively
 flat
 ever
 since
 the


whole
 uh
 the
 whole
 accounting
 fraud


thing.
 And
 so
 I
 don't
 think
 that's


really
 a
 risk
 anymore,
 but
 I
 think


you're
 going
 to
 need
 a
 lot
 more
 of
 their


server
 rack
 technology
 if
 you're
 going


to
 have
 a
 lot
 more
 GPUs
 being


implemented.


So
 6090
 spreads
 for
 SMCI
 2027.
 Broadcom


still
 up
 10%
 on
 the
 day.
 I
 bought
 more


AMCR
 on
 Friday
 on
 the
 dip.
 What's
 my


average?
 Let
 me
 see.
 We're
 above
 30.


Have
 2500
 shares
 of
 it
 now.
 Again,
 this


one's
 also
 a
 trade
 looking
 for
 about
 50


in
 six,
 eight
 months.
 I
 think
 it's


possible
 on
 a
 rerating.
 Company
 trades


at
 1.5
 time
 sales,
 1.15
 time
 sales,


relatively
 cheap
 if


uh
 they
 continue
 to
 make
 progress
 on


their
 FAB
 with
 TSM.
 Yeah,
 my
 average
 is


$30.50.


So,


close
 to
 breaking
 even
 on
 this
 one.


EOSE.
 This
 one
 continues
 to
 move
 21%
 on


the
 day.
 Piper
 Sandler
 from
 Meta.
 Wow.


880
 price
 target.


Dude,
 Meta
 is
 going
 to
 be
 an
 interest.
 I


think
 it's
 going to
 be
 the
 most


interesting
 Max
 Evan
 earnings
 because
 Z


is
 spending
 a
 lot.
 And
 again,
 they
 have


that
 $14
 billion
 investment
 into


freaking
 scale
 AI.
 I
 mean,
 they
 they've


been
 deploying
 cash,
 I
 think,
 at
 a


faster
 pace
 than
 all
 the
 other
 Max


Evans,


but
 their
 earnings
 growth
 shouldn't


dissipate.
 I
 mean,
 it
 was
 23%
 growth


last
 quarter.
 I
 mean,
 that's
 that's


incredible
 for
 a
 company
 of
 their
 size.


So,
 as
 much
 as
 investors
 might
 be
 scared


that
 Zucks
 is
 spending
 too
 much,
 it


might
 not
 matter
 if
 uh
 if
 the
 earnings


continue.


Tesla
 3
 and
 a
 half%
 427.
 That's
 green.


Tesla
 continues
 to
 go
 green.
 428


up
 3.5%
 on
 the
 day.
 Where's
 Delta?
 Delta


had
 a
 good
 earnings
 last
 week.
 United's


going to
 have
 earnings
 tomorrow.
 Delta


right
 there
 58.


That
 is
 up
 1%.
 Uh,
 by
 the
 way,
 City
 Bank


today,
 they
 came
 out
 and
 said
 they're


launching
 a
 service
 for
 the
 custody
 of


crypto
 assets.
 So,
 you're
 going
 to
 see
 a


lot
 more
 uh
 crypto


potential
 mixing
 with
 Tradfi
 in
 2026.


And
 they
 might
 talk
 about
 that
 on
 their


earnings.
 It
 seems
 like
 a
 lot
 more


companies
 are
 going
 for
 that
 in
 the


financial
 space.
 And
 Amazon
 came
 out


today
 and
 they
 said
 they're
 creating


250,000
 jobs
 in
 the
 US
 this
 holiday


season.


So,
 it
 looks
 like
 Amazon
 does
 not
 think


they're
 going
 to
 lack
 the
 demand
 that's


needed
 to
 execute
 on
 a
 successful


holiday
 season.
 They
 did
 have
 their


Prime
 Day.
 I
 think
 we'll
 get
 those


numbers
 this
 week
 on
 how
 the
 Prime
 Day


went,


but
 that
 continues
 to
 show
 some


excitement.
 Also,
 this
 was
 some
 news


from
 Taiwan
 this
 morning,
 which
 was


interesting.
 Taiwan
 is
 considering
 a
 law


to
 classify
 data
 centers
 as
 public


infrastructure
 in
 order
 to
 unlock
 tax


advantages,
 access
 to
 government
 funds,


and
 incentivize
 investment.


I
 mean,
 this
 is
 also
 pretty
 incredible,


dude.
 Taiwan
 is
 considering
 to
 classify


data
 centers
 built
 by
 private
 companies


as
 public
 infrastructure
 because
 they


understand
 that
 their
 entire
 economy
 has


really
 been
 backed
 on
 TSMC
 and
 TSMC
 is


pivotal
 towards
 the
 chip
 market
 to
 build


out
 all
 these
 data
 centers.
 and
 Taiwan's


like,
 you
 know
 what,
 let's
 just
 bet
 the


entire
 country
 on
 data
 centers
 at
 this


point
 given
 that
 is
 like
 our
 main
 source


of
 revenue
 and
 we're
 going
 to
 lean
 into


it.
 It
 is
 really
 incredible.
 But
 when


you
 have
 entire
 countries
 transitioning


to
 to
 to
 to
 change
 public
 law,
 which
 the


big
 beautiful
 bill
 also
 did
 with
 zoning


restrictions
 on
 data
 centers,
 that
 shows


you
 how
 much
 sheer
 amount
 of
 money
 is


coming
 into
 the
 ecosystem.
 Fear
 and


greed,
 by
 the
 way,
 is
 at
 33.
 We
 were
 at


29
 on
 Friday,
 so
 we're
 still
 in
 fear.


We're
 not
 even
 at
 neutral
 yet,
 but
 we


still
 are,
 as
 perfeed


in
 the
 moment
 of
 a
 of
 a
 buying


opportunity.
 And
 then
 you
 got
 this
 chart


right
 here
 from
 uh
 Ryan
 Dietrich.
 The


fourth
 year
 of
 a
 bull
 market
 starts


right
 now.
 Only
 once
 did
 year
 four
 see
 a


bull
 market
 end
 or
 see
 a
 bare
 market
 and


end
 to
 the
 bull
 market,
 which
 was
 1966.


The
 past
 four
 years
 saw
 stocks
 up
 double


digits
 and
 higher
 six
 out
 of
 seven


times.


So,
 this
 is
 just
 a
 general
 argument
 that


the
 fourth
 year
 of
 a
 bull
 market
 tends


to
 continue
 to
 be
 strong.
 And
 uh
 nine


times
 out
 of
 10,
 you
 see
 higher
 momentum


into
 that
 fourth
 year,
 you're
 going
 to


need
 something
 really
 structural
 to
 stop


it.
 And
 it's
 probably
 not
 a
 Trump
 a


Trump
 tweet.
 MP,
 that
 one
 continues
 to


move.
 Look
 at
 that.
 25%
 on
 the
 day.
 My


goodness,
 this
 stock
 year
 to
 date
 500%.


investments
 from
 Apple,
 investments
 from


Congress
 or
 or
 the
 Department
 of
 War.


I
 mean,


and
 rare
 earth
 metals,
 the
 market
 needs


it.
 Better
 is
 down
 9%.


Okay,
 Better.
 This
 is
 the
 uh
 second


Eric
 Jackson
 pick.
 He
 claims
 this


company
 will
 be
 worth
 $12,000
 a
 share
 in


the
 next
 five
 years.


That
 one,
 I
 don't
 know
 why
 it's
 down


10%,
 but
 that's
 down
 10%.
 How
 about
 Open


Door?
 Open
 Door
 is
 also
 down
 half
 a


percent.
 Okay,
 so
 Openoor,
 the
 meme


stock
 thing
 is
 running,
 but
 Open
 Door
 is


not
 really
 running.
 That's
 one
 of
 that's


actually
 the
 highest
 holding
 in
 the
 meme


stock
 ETF.


That
 one
 has
 been
 flat
 after
 it
 lost


1080.
 It's
 kind
 of
 been
 stuck
 in
 the
 low


sevens,


but
 it
 could
 be
 forming
 a
 base
 there,


which
 is
 not
 that
 bad.
 SoFi
 right
 there,


that's
 up


2
 and
 a
 half%
 on
 the
 day
 as
 well.


Yeah,
 Regetti
 is
 up
 seven
 16%.
 I
 don't


know
 why
 the
 quantum
 names
 are
 moving


today,
 but
 they
 are
 rebounding
 pretty


aggressively.
 Regretti
 was
 at
 51
 at
 one


point,
 but
 those
 stocks


not
 slowing
 down
 either.
 IO
 and
 Q


up
 12%.
 Thoughts
 on
 Innodata?
 I
 don't


know
 enough
 about
 that
 company.
 I
 have


heard
 about
 them.
 I
 would
 have
 to
 look


into
 them
 more.
 I
 know
 a
 lot
 of
 people


like
 this
 stock
 for
 a
 variety
 of


verticals
 they're
 in.
 Wow.
 104%
 this


year.
 See,
 there's


Wait,
 no,
 I
 think
 I'm
 on
 the
 wrong
 one.


Id


ticker
 symbol
 in
 OD.
 A
 lot
 of
 people
 are


finding
 different
 verticals.
 This
 one's


Well,
 it's
 up
 117%
 this
 year.


Different
 verticals
 that
 have
 made


triple
 digit
 moves.
 You
 didn't
 just
 need


to
 get
 be
 in
 the
 hood
 or
 the
 Rocket
 Labs


or
 the
 Nvidas.


There's
 a
 ton


of
 diversified
 views
 right
 here.
 Mike


Alfred,
 is
 he
 buying?
 He
 said
 he
 was
 he


tweeted
 that
 he
 might
 buy
 open.
 Did
 he


officially
 buy?


I
 mean,
 he
 did
 say
 no.
 He
 I
 don't
 see


the
 tweet
 that
 he
 would
 buy.
 He
 bought


Open
 Door
 yet,
 but
 last
 night
 he
 said
 if


Open
 Door
 drops
 another
 10
 to
 25%,
 I
 may


take
 a
 position.
 I
 mean,
 we're
 not
 down


10
 to
 25%
 yet
 on
 it.


But
 maybe
 he
 does
 buy.


Um,


today's
 low
 volume,
 the
 real
 test
 of


tomorrow.
 Yeah,
 I
 agree
 on
 that.
 I
 mean,


we're
 definitely
 seeing
 low
 volume


across
 the
 board.
 You're
 not
 seeing


Yeah,
 I
 mean,
 just
 looking
 at
 some
 of


these
 numbers,
 volume
 is
 not
 as
 high
 as


you
 would
 expect.
 The
 Oracle
 CEOs
 are


going
 to
 be
 on
 soon
 as
 well,
 and
 we'll


get
 to
 hear
 from
 them
 around
 what's


going
 on
 with
 all
 this
 potential


circular
 financing
 with
 Nvidia
 or
 with


OpenAI.


But
 the
 rest
 of
 these
 stocks
 holding
 on


to
 green.
 By
 the
 way,
 for
 those
 that


have
 been
 asking
 um
 this
 question,
 which


I
 get
 pretty
 much
 every
 week,
 which
 is


uh
 when
 is
 Andro
 going
 public?
 Here
 is


what
 Palmer
 Lucky
 had
 to
 say
 on
 Friday


about
 their
 plan
 for
 an
 IPO.


>> Look,
 we
 we
 are
 um
 we
 we
 we
 are
 on
 a


path
 to
 IPO.
 Like
 like
 I
 can
 explicitly


say
 that.
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 be
 koi
 about


that.
 We
 are
 running
 the
 company
 as
 if


we
 are
 going
 to
 be
 audited
 by
 uh
 you


know
 the
 the
 the the
 auditors
 that
 are


looking
 at
 at
 public
 company
 traded


companies.
 We're
 running
 the
 company's


financials
 as
 if
 we
 need
 to
 be


accountable
 to
 public
 market
 investors.


You
 need
 to
 be
 a
 certain
 shape
 of


company
 to
 be
 in
 the
 public
 markets.
 You


need
 to
 have
 a
 certain
 level
 of


credibility
 in
 your
 accounting
 process


across
 the
 organization.
 So
 like
 the
 old


school
 and
 stuff
 of
 hey
 you
 know
 toss
 it


in,
 you
 know,
 toss
 it
 in
 the
 bin
 no
 need


to
 do
 any
 paperwork.
 you
 know,
 you


actually
 have
 to
 properly
 account
 for


what's
 on
 the
 shelf,
 what
 you've
 thrown


away,
 what's
 working.
 Um,
 and
 and
 we've


gotten
 into
 that
 swing
 of
 things.
 It's


going
 to
 be
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 it's
 going


to
 be
 in
 the
 in
 low
 singledigit
 years.


And
 by
 the
 way,


>> do
 you
 have
 to
 be
 profitable
 for
 that?


Like
 at
 the
 moment,
 it
 is
 very
 expensive


what
 you
 are
 trying
 to
 build.


>> Agreed.
 So,
 my
 philosophy
 on
 this
 is


that
 if
 you
 are
 going
 to
 be
 in
 the


public
 markets,
 you
 need
 to
 be
 the
 shape


that
 the
 markets
 want
 you
 to
 be.
 I
 think


that's
 not
 a
 very
 unprofitable
 company


that
 has
 a
 trend
 that
 looks
 very


unprofitable.
 So
 my
 personal
 opinion
 and


I'm
 not
 hiding
 the
 date
 from
 you.
 We


genuinely
 don't
 know.
 We're
 not
 going
 to


do
 it
 till
 the
 right
 moment.
 We
 don't


have
 to.
 Private
 capital
 is
 amply


available
 to
 us.


>> But
 what
 we
 want
 to
 do
 is
 either
 be


profitable
 across
 the
 business
 or
 we


want
 to
 be
 on
 very
 close
 to
 it
 with
 a


clear
 trend
 showing
 it's
 certainly
 going


to
 happen.
 And
 I
 don't
 mean
 it's
 going


to
 happen
 someday
 years
 in
 the
 future.
 I


mean
 like
 hey
 we
 have
 these
 contracts


and
 if
 you
 just
 believe
 that
 we
 are


going
 to
 deliver
 the
 things
 that
 we've


already
 sold
 then
 you
 know
 that
 we're


likely
 going
 to
 be
 profitable.


>> So
 the
 question
 is


who's
 buying
 the
 Andre
 IPO?


>> Who's
 buying
 the
 Andre
 IPO?
 Are
 you


buying
 the
 Andre
 IPO?
 By
 the
 way
 Palmer


Lucky
 is
 not
 the
 CEO.
 He's
 the
 I
 think


executive
 chairman
 of
 Andre.
 They
 have
 a


different
 CEO.
 He
 is
 the
 founder
 of


Andre,
 but
 he
 is
 not
 the
 CEO.
 Robin
 Hood


right
 there
 going
 red.
 Losing
 losing
 its


green.
 S&P
 still
 holding
 up.
 I
 think


that's
 probably
 because
 Bitcoin
 and


Ethereum
 are
 going
 red
 as
 well.


Uh,
 but
 it
 looks
 like
 two
 years.
 It


looks
 like
 2027.


It
 doesn't
 look
 like
 a
 2026
 year.
 It
 did


say
 years
 with
 a
 plural.
 So,
 I
 guess


earliest
 is
 uh


is
 2027.


Yeah,
 seems
 a
 decent
 amount
 of
 you


seems
 a
 decent
 amount
 of
 you
 want
 to
 buy


this
 thing.
 68%.


68%


of
 you
 guys
 want
 to
 buy
 it.
 See,
 the


problem
 is
 I
 don't
 think
 there's
 going


to
 be
 like
 I
 don't
 know
 how
 much


allocation
 retail
 is
 going
 to
 get,
 but


even
 if
 you
 don't
 even
 if
 you
 know


Schwab,
 Fidelity,
 Robin
 don't
 give
 you


shares
 because
 it's
 just
 too


oversubscribed.
 I
 think
 that
 the
 the


like
 the
 open
 of
 day
 is
 going
 to
 be
 just


tons
 of
 money
 coming
 into
 Andre.
 People


are
 not
 even
 gonna
 care
 if
 they
 weren't


get
 if
 they
 didn't
 get
 allocated
 in


shares.
 They're
 just
 going
 to
 buy
 them


as
 soon
 as
 it
 opens
 and
 goes
 public.


I
 think
 it'll
 probably
 be
 one
 of the


most
 liquid
 liquidly
 traded
 stocks
 in


the
 market.
 Like
 it's
 probably
 going to


be
 a
 top
 50
 traded
 stock.
 There's
 just


so
 much
 excitement
 around
 the
 company


and
 defense
 tech.


Now
 granted,
 it's
 a
 hardware
 company
 so


I
 don't
 think
 the
 margins
 are
 going
 to


be
 the
 best.
 and
 they're
 hiring
 people


like
 crazy,
 growing
 like
 crazy.
 So,
 I


don't
 know
 if
 it
 has
 that
 massive


trillion
 dollar
 potential
 that
 people


think
 an
 Andre
 can
 get
 because
 it's
 not


a
 software
 company
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the


day.
 Now,
 they
 make
 software,
 but
 are


they
 like
 commercially
 selling
 mass


amounts
 of
 software,
 which
 is
 what


really
 creates
 the
 margins
 for
 a
 company


to
 get
 to
 that
 multiundred
 billion


trillion
 dollar
 level?
 I
 mean,
 not
 that


I've
 seen.
 They're
 they're
 they're


selling
 tanks
 and
 drones
 and
 equipment,


right?
 This
 stuff
 is
 totally
 different


and
 it
 does
 not
 have
 the
 type
 of
 margin


that
 like
 a
 pounder
 would
 have,


but
 I
 still
 think
 there's
 going to
 be
 a


lot
 of
 excitement


and
 people
 will
 probably
 want
 to
 buy
 in.


UC
 uranium
 energy,
 that
 one
 also
 up
 5%


5%
 on
 the
 day.


Um,


Paler
 already
 has
 a
 partnership
 with


Andre.
 I
 mean,
 they
 do
 a
 bunch
 of


different
 things
 with
 Android,
 but
 they


don't
 have
 an
 equity
 stake
 in
 them,


which
 sucks.
 Like,
 it
 would
 have
 been
 so


nice
 for
 them
 to
 have
 an
 equity
 stake,


but
 they
 don't
 have
 an
 equity
 stake
 yet.


Elon
 Musk's
 Boring
 Company
 will
 open
 its


first
 Dubai
 loop
 by
 Q2
 2026.


Huh.
 Has
 anyone
 taken
 the
 Boring
 Tunnel


um
 uh
 uh
 loop
 in
 um
 in
 Las
 Vegas?


Because
 I'm
 not
 going to
 lie,
 when
 I
 did


it,
 it
 was
 pretty
 underwhelming.
 I
 mean,


it
 wasn't
 really
 that
 exciting.


It
 was
 kind
 of
 boring
 to
 be
 honest
 as


the
 name
 suggests,


but
 it
 looks
 like
 expanding
 to
 Dubai
 is


a
 good
 thing.
 Yeah,
 you
 guys
 agree,


right?
 Like
 people
 that
 have
 been
 there,


it's
 like
 not
 that
 I
 thought
 I
 thought


it
 was
 going
 to
 be
 a
 different


experience,
 but


there
 wasn't
 there.
 By
 the
 way,
 Trump's


on
 his
 way
 to
 Egypt
 right
 now.
 He
 he


visited
 Israel
 this
 morning
 after
 the


deal
 was
 signed
 last
 week
 and
 it
 looks


like
 he's
 going
 to
 be
 speaking
 in
 Egypt


this
 morning.
 Um


potentially
 soon
 at
 a
 Egypt
 Peace


Summit,
 I
 think
 is
 what
 it's
 called.


Uh
 yeah,
 Egypt
 Peace
 Summit.


Don't
 know
 exactly
 when,
 but
 Trump
 will


be
 speaking
 there.
 Any
 good
 news
 on


geopolitical
 stability
 could
 also,
 you


know,
 be
 what
 the
 markets
 ultimately


want
 to
 hear
 to
 kind
 of
 calm
 down
 a


little
 bit.
 Palunteer
 that
 slightly
 red


Tesla
 424


AMD
 still
 green
 on
 the
 day.
 Again,
 that


Broadcom
 deal
 was
 the
 biggest
 news
 of


the
 morning.


Speaking
 of
 the
 UAE,
 uh,
 Emirati's


Airlines
 says
 they
 will
 accept
 Ethereum


as
 payments
 in
 Q1
 of
 2026.


So,


I
 mean,
 there
 you
 go.
 You
 got
 more
 and


more


larger
 institutions
 saying
 that
 they
 are


on
 board
 with


Ethereum
 and
 the
 ability
 to
 collect


Ethereum


from
 a
 payment
 perspective.


So
 you're
 getting
 more
 you're
 getting


more
 people
 excited
 about
 about
 ETH


which
 is
 why
 I
 think
 Tom
 Lee
 keeps


buying
 it.
 Applovin
 right
 there
 570


circle
 app
 loven
 below
 or
 not

 but


close
 to

 it
 bottomed
 at

 last

 at

 or
 no
 it
 was
 a

 it
 bottom


and
 phase
 right
 there

 on
 the
 day


bro
 what
 are
 you
 guys
 saying
 in
 the


I
 said
 Emirati's
 wrong


oh
 my
 goodness


did
 I
 say
 it
 Wrong.
 Emiratis.


It's
 freaking
 Emirati.


Wait,
 how
 do
 you
 say
 this
 [ __ ]
 Hold
 on,


hold
 on,
 hold
 on.


Hold
 on.


Hold
 on.
 How
 do
 you
 say
 this
 [ __ ]
 Have


I
 been
 saying
 it
 wrong
 my
 whole
 life?


Hold
 on.
 Hold
 on.
 Hold
 on.


>> United
 Arab
 Emirates.


>> Oh
 [ __ ]
 Oh
 [ __ ]
 Oh
 my
 good.
 Oh
 well.


Wow,
 that's
 a


that's


uh
 I
 can't
 even
 defend
 myself
 on
 that


one.
 I
 can't
 Yeah,
 I
 can't.
 No,
 I
 can't


I
 can't
 defend
 myself
 there.
 That's
 a


Emirates,
 bro.
 Dead
 ass
 Emirates.


Why
 did
 I
 think
 it
 was
 Emiratis?


That
 is
 I
 I
 can't
 even
 defend
 myself


there,
 bro.


>> United
 Arab
 Emirates.
 Emirates.


All right.
 Well,
 it's,
 you
 know,
 you


learn
 something
 new
 every
 day.


You
 learn
 something
 new
 every
 day.


This
 is
 life,
 bro.
 It's
 life.
 We
 need
 to


see
 how
 Trump
 pronounces
 it
 today
 when


he
 speaks
 to
 everybody.


Dude,
 I
 thought
 it
 was
 Emiratis.
 I
 guess


uh
 I
 guess
 it's
 Emirates.
 It
 is
 what
 it


is.
 It's
 life.


You
 learn
 something
 new


every
 day.


Rucker's
 education.
 Dude,
 is
 anyone
 in


the
 Northeast?
 Have
 you
 experienced
 this


uh
 this
 uh
 this
 uh
 nor
 easter?
 Because


I've
 been
 waiting
 for
 this
 rain
 and
 I'm


not
 seeing
 any
 rain.
 Literally
 over
 the


weekend,
 all
 I
 was
 hearing
 were
 reports


that
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 the
 worst
 rain


we've
 had
 in
 like
 10
 years.
 I
 mean,
 we


had
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 drizzle,
 but
 I


don't
 see
 any
 crazy
 rain.
 Maybe
 it's


happening.
 Every
 time
 I
 check
 the


weather
 app,
 it's
 like
 next
 hour
 100%


chance
 of
 rain.
 And
 then
 you
 get
 to
 the


next
 hour
 and
 there's
 no
 rain.
 I
 think


down
 south
 New
 Jersey
 in
 the
 tri-state


area,
 you've
 seen
 a
 little
 bit
 more


pain.
 Robin
 right
 here
 down
 1.2%.


Pounder
 as
 well
 going
 red,


but
 it's
 not
 been
 north.


You
 haven't
 seen
 too
 much.
 Dude,
 they


were
 talking
 about
 the
 power
 is
 going
 to


get
 wiped
 out
 across
 the
 board.
 All
 this


[ __ ]
 like
 I'm
 like
 I
 don't
 see
 any


there's
 like
 there's
 no
 rain,
 bro.
 They


were
 saying
 schools
 were
 going
 to
 shut


down.
 It's
 like
 I
 don't
 see
 any
 of
 that.


in
 Boston.
 It's
 bad.


It
 shifted.
 It
 might
 have
 shifted,
 dude.


I
 feel
 like
 it
 went
 right
 over


the
 north
 part
 of
 New
 Jersey.


Uh
 pounder
 at
 their
 174.
 Now,
 Hood,


look,
 I
 I
 mean,
 one
 of
 the
 one
 thing


that
 people
 are
 talking
 about
 that
 could


be
 a
 bare
 case
 on
 Hood
 was
 the
 lack
 of


buying
 and
 selling
 on
 Ethereum
 and


Bitcoin
 over
 the
 weekend
 on
 Friday.
 Or


it
 wasn't
 literally
 over
 the
 weekend,


but
 it
 was
 on
 Friday.
 I
 I
 talked
 about


this
 last
 night
 at
 the
 market
 futures


show.
 This
 is
 not
 a
 good
 look
 for
 Hood.


10,000%
 it's
 not
 a
 good
 look
 for
 Hood.


And
 I
 can
 understand
 people
 taking
 their


assets
 off
 the
 platform
 because
 they're


annoyed
 at
 what
 Hood
 did
 on
 Friday.


However,
 it
 wasn't
 isolated
 to
 Hood.


When
 there's
 a
 20
 billion
 liquidation


event
 happening
 in
 crypto,
 there
 were
 a


lot
 of
 exchanges
 including
 Coinbase,


Binance,
 Weeble,
 IBKR,
 etc.
 that
 had


issues.
 Hood
 is
 just,
 you
 know,
 the
 one


that
 gets
 publicized
 the
 most.
 So,
 is
 it


a
 good
 look?
 No.
 Should
 Hood
 be
 better


prepared
 for
 these
 types
 of
 volatile


events?
 Yes,
 because
 that
 creates
 trust


in
 people
 with
 the
 platform.
 Is
 this
 a


reason
 Hood's
 stock
 needs
 to
 get


destroyed?
 I
 don't
 think
 so.
 And
 if
 it


does,
 I'm
 a
 buyer.
 If
 Hood
 ends
 up


going,
 you
 know,
 down
 105%
 because
 of


that.
 So,
 I
 don't
 think
 that's
 the


reason
 Hood's
 down
 today.
 I
 think
 the


reason
 Hood
 is
 down
 is
 because
 a


crypto's
 down
 and
 b
 again
 it
 made
 a
 big


move
 from
 120
 up
 to
 150.
 It
 is
 going
 to


take
 some
 time
 to
 consolidate
 and
 I


think
 that's
 pretty
 healthy.


So,
 I
 don't
 think
 it's
 an
 excuse
 for


Hood
 on
 Friday
 and
 they
 really
 do
 have


to
 make
 sure
 during
 these
 volatile


events
 they
 can
 be
 better.
 But
 it's
 not


like
 they
 were
 the
 only
 brokers
 that
 was


stopping
 you
 from
 buying
 or
 selling.


When
 there's
 a
 $20
 billion
 crypto


liquid,
 that's
 10
 times
 higher
 than


COVID.
 I
 mean,
 you're
 going
 to
 have
 a


lot
 of
 systems
 mess
 up.
 And


unfortunately,
 the
 entire
 crypto


ecosystem
 is
 not
 fully
 prepared
 to


handle
 that
 type
 of
 volume.
 But
 that's


what
 happened
 on
 Friday.


And
 I
 think
 that's
 why
 Hood
 took
 a


little
 bit
 of
 a
 hit.
 S&P
 500
 right
 there


660.35


losing
 663


and
 that
 one
 is
 down.
 Shouldn't
 Hood
 be


doing
 better
 than
 the
 others?
 The
 point


is
 we
 want
 them
 to
 be
 the
 best.
 Yes,
 I


agree.
 And
 and
 and
 I'm
 making
 no
 excuse


for
 that.
 I
 mean,
 we
 want
 them
 to
 be


better.
 It's
 just
 when
 you
 have
 that


level
 of
 volatility,
 if
 every
 brokerage


can't
 sustain
 the
 types
 of
 velocity
 of


action
 that's
 happening,
 it's
 a
 problem


with
 the
 broader
 crypto
 ecosystem.
 And


Hood
 hopefully
 is
 able
 to
 be
 one
 of
 the


brokerages
 that
 is
 the
 most
 trustworthy.


But
 on
 Friday,
 they
 did
 have
 some


issues.
 Now
 granted,
 the
 issues
 lasted


for
 about
 30
 minutes
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 people


ended
 up
 getting
 their
 orders
 filled


after
 that,
 but
 there
 was
 that
 30-minute


time
 frame
 where
 it
 got
 stuck.
 And


again,
 Hood
 is
 routing
 orders
 to


different
 exchanges
 as
 well.
 So
 like
 if


the
 other
 exchanges
 weren't
 taking
 their


orders,
 like
 that's
 when
 you
 get
 into
 a


place
 where
 it's
 like,
 what
 more
 can


they
 do?
 But
 obviously,
 we
 want
 them
 to


have
 more
 and
 more
 capacity
 to
 handle


this
 stuff
 when
 it
 becomes
 volatile.


Uh
 AMD
 right
 there,
 217,
 that's
 losing


220.
 So,
 you're
 seeing
 a
 lot
 of
 these


stocks
 lose
 their
 high
 of
 day.
 Pinterest


is
 up
 2%.
 Circle's
 up
 a
 little
 bit.
 App


that's
 flat.
 TLT,
 where's
 the
 10-year?


Well,
 it
 shouldn't
 be
 moving
 today


because
 bond
 markets
 are
 closed,


but
 that
 still
 closed
 under
 4.1
 on


Friday,


which
 was
 really
 good
 to
 see
 it


potentially
 come
 below
 4%.


But


that
 one's
 not
 moving
 higher,
 which
 is


good.
 You
 don't
 want
 to
 see
 you
 don't


want
 to
 see
 the
 bond
 market


selling
 off
 bonds
 if
 the
 market's
 taking


a
 hit.


Um,


the
 bear
 who
 shorted
 700
 million
 of


Bitcoin
 and
 350
 million
 of
 ETH,
 making


200
 million
 total,
 is
 now
 short
 340


million
 of
 Bitcoin.
 Wow.
 Okay.
 Okay,
 so


there
 was
 an
 account
 that
 signed
 up
 on


Hyperlquid,
 which
 is
 this
 platform
 that


allows
 you
 to
 go
 long
 and
 short
 on


perpetual
 futures,
 and
 they
 made
 $200


million
 on
 shorting
 Bitcoin
 and


Ethereum,
 about
 a
 billion.3
 of
 both,
 and


they
 are
 now
 short
 another
 340
 million


of
 Bitcoin.


Okay,
 so
 you've
 got
 that
 account


basically
 saying,


yeah,
 wow,
 look
 at
 this.
 The
 liquidation


price
 is
 130,000.
 So,
 Bitcoin
 moves
 to


130,
 he
 gets
 liquidated.


$345
 million
 Bitcoin
 short
 position.


This
 is
 the
 same
 blockchain
 address
 that


made
 $192
 million
 off
 shorting
 Bitcoin


and
 Ethereum
 30
 minutes
 before
 the
 Trump


tweet
 came
 out,
 which
 is
 why
 a
 lot
 of


people
 think
 this
 is
 obviously
 some
 type


of
 inside
 job
 or
 someone
 definitely
 had


information
 about
 this,


which
 I
 mean,
 come
 on,
 bro.
 hard
 to
 like


again
 I
 don't
 think
 you
 have
 to
 be
 a


conspiracy
 theorist
 to
 be
 like
 really
 a


billion
 dollar
 crypto
 short
 30
 minutes


before
 a
 Trump
 tweet
 like
 I
 mean
 who


wakes
 up
 and
 says
 I'm
 just
 going
 to
 go


short
 a
 billion
 dollars
 worth
 of
 crypto


at
 that
 exact
 time
 like
 it
 it
 it
 feels


suspicious


but
 it
 looks
 like
 they
 are
 continuing
 to


they
 entered
 into
 the
 short
 at
 116
 340


million
 Bitcoin
 right
 now
 is
 at
 114


so
 that
 short
 is
 up


it's
 bearon
 Trump.
 Maybe,
 bro.
 Maybe


it's


Maybe
 it's
 freaking
 Baron
 Trump.
 Dude,


the
 the
 there
 were
 rumors
 over
 the


weekend
 that
 Baron
 Trump
 potentially
 is


going
 to
 get
 a
 highlevel
 role
 in
 Tik


Tok.


Um,
 Bloomberg
 is
 reporting
 that
 Baron


Trump
 potentially
 might
 be
 playing
 a


role
 in
 managing


like
 the
 the
 US
 version
 of
 Tik
 Tok,


which
 is
 this
 new
 subsidiary
 that
 the


government
 owns
 a
 part
 of.


I
 mean,
 maybe
 maybe
 that
 ends
 up


happening.
 Oh,
 Trump's
 speaking.
 Let's


transition
 over
 to
 him.
 He
 is
 at
 the


peace
 summit
 in
 Egypt
 now.


uh
 this
 this
 deal,
 this
 once
 in


a-lifetime
 deal.
 Nobody's
 ever
 seen


anything
 like
 what's
 happening
 today.


And
 countries
 have
 all
 come
 together.


All
 different
 countries.
 Some
 liked
 each


other,
 some
 didn't.
 Most
 didn't.
 And


they've
 all
 come
 together.
 Every
 country


has
 come
 together.
 And
 by
 the
 way,
 Iran


did
 put
 out
 a
 statement,
 you
 know,
 that


they
 support
 this
 deal
 very


wholeheartedly.
 So
 that
 was
 in
 itself


something.
 But
 no,
 I
 I
 think
 they
 want


to
 uh
 that's
 all
 I
 do
 in
 my
 life.
 if
 I


make
 deals
 and
 they
 want
 to
 make
 a
 deal.


>> Now
 that
 the
 living
 hostages
 have
 been


returned,
 can
 you
 please
 tell
 us
 what


the
 next
 steps
 are
 to


>> Well,
 they're
 going
 and
 looking
 for


bodies.
 It's
 a
 pretty
 gruesome
 task
 and


they're
 uh
 they
 know
 where
 numerous
 are


you
 know
 I
 guess
 five
 or
 six
 are
 in
 yet


now.
 But
 they're
 looking
 for
 bodies.


They
 know
 the
 areas
 and
 the
 search


parties
 out
 and
 they're
 doing
 it
 in


conjunction
 with
 Israel
 and
 they'll


they're
 going
 to
 be
 finding
 quite
 a
 few


of
 them.


>> President
 Trump,
 can
 you
 tell
 us
 when


phase
 two
 of
 the
 negotiations
 will


begin?


>> Well,
 it
 started
 I
 mean
 it
 started
 as


far
 as
 we're
 concerned
 phase
 two
 started


>> and
 you
 know
 the
 phases
 are
 all
 a
 little


bit
 mixed
 in
 with
 each
 other.
 They're


going
 to
 start
 cleaning
 up.
 Uh
 you
 look


at
 Gaza
 and
 it's
 needs
 a
 lot
 of
 cleanup.


That's
 why
 when
 I
 talked
 in
 my
 speech,
 I


talked
 about
 the
 debris.
 I
 used
 the
 word


debris.
 That's
 debris
 times
 10.
 So,
 uh,


but
 we're
 going
 to
 they're
 going
 to


really
 do
 a
 job.
 They
 have
 a
 lot
 of


power.
 In
 another
 room,
 you
 have
 the


wealthiest,
 some
 of
 the
 wealthiest


nations
 in
 the
 world.
 All
 leaders,
 the


the
 big
 leaders
 are
 here,
 the
 the
 amirs


and
 the
 kings
 and
 everybody.
 And
 it's


it's
 a
 very
 interesting
 group.
 I
 guess


we
 have
 like
 35


countries.
 And
 that's
 only
 because
 they


were
 the
 35s
 that
 we
 invited.
 Everybody


that
 we
 invited
 came.
 So
 it's
 there's
 a


lot
 of


>> our
 customers
 are
 so
 excited
 about
 AI.


In
 fact,
 that's
 pretty
 much
 all
 you'll


hear
 them
 talk
 about
 here
 this
 week.
 We


decided
 to
 rename
 the
 conference
 AI


world.


>> And
 so
 what
 are
 you
 hoping
 those


customers
 and
 those
 in
 attendance
 here


get
 out
 of
 this?
 What
 is
 the
 object?


>> Well,
 I
 I
 think
 there's
 the
 main
 thing


is
 here.
 I'm


>> feeling
 left
 out.


>> Okay.
 Don't
 don't.
 But
 this
 is
 just
 a


little
 more
 sort
 of
 customer.


>> I'll
 tamp
 down
 my
 insecurity.


>> Okay.
 Good.
 Um
 I
 mean
 we
 all
 wonder
 and


uh
 I
 think
 appropriately
 so
 what's
 going


to
 be
 the
 return
 for
 these
 trillions
 of


dollars
 that
 are
 being
 spent.
 So
 what


I'm
 hearing
 you
 say
 is
 the
 enterprise


those
 of
 us
 who
 say
 well
 we're
 not


really
 seeing
 it
 yet
 in
 the
 enterprise


that
 is
 not
 the
 case.


>> That
 is
 not
 the
 case
 that
 we're
 seeing


in
 fact
 we're
 seeing
 exactly
 opposite


and
 we're
 seeing
 not
 just
 quantitative


return
 in
 hours
 saved
 faster
 time
 to


hire
 faster
 time
 to
 process
 process


transactions
 uh
 better
 in
 place
 but


actually
 qualitative
 qualitative
 as


well.
 I'm
 I'm
 going
 to
 have
 a
 customer


tomorrow
 on
 stage
 with
 me
 that's
 going


to
 talk
 about
 the
 impact
 on
 human
 lives


uh
 when
 it
 when
 it's
 uh
 pertains
 to


using
 AI
 to
 fight
 antibiotic
 resistance.


Actually
 uh
 he's
 going
 to
 share
 how
 many


lives
 they've
 actually
 saved
 by
 using
 uh


Oracle
 applied
 AI
 with
 this
 technology


>> and
 how
 recent
 is
 this
 technology.


>> This
 is
 uh
 this
 is
 in
 the
 last
 two


years.
 This
 is
 in
 the
 last
 two
 years


that
 they've
 been
 leveraging
 the
 Oracle


technology.
 We're
 going
 to
 see
 I
 think


ecosystems
 open
 up.
 So
 we're
 going
 to


see
 uh
 healthcare
 organizations
 have
 a


better
 relationship
 with
 their
 banks
 as


a
 result
 as
 a
 result
 of
 being
 able
 to


look
 at
 all
 the
 qualitative
 metrics
 uh


that
 are
 associated
 their
 receivables.


Uh
 this
 is
 this
 is
 a
 very
 different
 view


than
 just
 just
 looking
 at
 you
 know
 uh


looking
 looking
 at
 the
 past
 and
 looking


at
 a
 spreadsheet
 looking
 at
 static


reports.
 I
 mean
 this
 this
 is
 live
 real


time
 qualitative
 and
 qualitative


insights
 at
 your
 fingertips.
 Hugely


exciting.
 So
 the
 value
 proposition
 is


there
 for
 your
 customer
 base
 and
 they're


seeing
 it
 and
 they
 believe
 it
 and


they're
 just
 going
 to
 keep
 spending


more.


>> They
 will
 well
 they
 they'll
 be
 speaking


about
 it
 here
 this
 week.
 And
 you
 know


what's
 what's
 important
 to
 understand


about
 our
 AI
 strategy
 too
 with
 our


applications
 is
 that
 we're
 not
 charging


extra.
 Our
 applications
 essentially
 are


AI.
 They
 the
 foundation
 of
 our


applications
 is
 AI.
 So
 they'll
 be


spending
 more
 in
 that
 uh
 we
 think
 we
 can


sell
 more
 applications
 as
 a
 result.


>> All
 right,
 we'll
 get
 to
 you
 now.


>> We're
 gonna
 go
 back.
 want
 to
 chime
 in
 on


Mike's
 comment
 though,
 but
 I
 think


something
 that,
 you
 know,
 not
 only
 is


Oracle
 delivering
 applications,
 we're


also
 a
 consumer
 ourselves,
 right?
 So,


we've
 seen
 an
 amazing
 amount
 of


adoption.
 If
 you
 think,
 you
 know,
 we
 we


generate
 more
 than
 uh
 20
 to
 30
 million


lines
 of
 code
 every
 week
 that
 we
 use
 for


developing
 these
 products
 all
 by
 AI,


right?
 The
 the
 the
 success
 that
 we've


had
 with
 our
 support
 products
 and
 and


deflection
 rates
 across
 our
 entire


portfolio,
 uh
 it's
 we
 see
 it
 across
 the


board
 from
 ourselves
 and
 all
 of
 our


customers.


>> So,
 is
 that
 what
 what
 are
 we
 talking


about?
 an
 AI
 application
 generator
 andor


can
 you
 explain
 what
 that
 actually
 is?


>> Sure.
 Well,
 I
 think
 it's
 across
 many


different
 pieces
 of
 technology.
 One
 of


them
 is,
 you
 know,
 and
 you'll
 hear
 Larry


talk
 about
 that
 more
 this
 week
 with
 our


new
 uh
 Apex
 AI
 application
 generator.


One
 of the
 ways
 that
 you
 can
 write


applications
 is
 if
 you
 go
 back
 a
 few


years
 ago,
 it
 started
 off
 with
 you
 kind


of
 get
 a
 blank
 sheet
 of
 paper,
 you
 do


some
 middleware,
 you
 write
 uh
 code
 from


scratch.
 That's
 not
 how
 people
 are


writing
 these
 applications
 these
 days.


One
 of
 the
 ways
 they're
 doing
 it
 is


they're
 using
 AI
 agents
 to
 actually


integrate
 into
 their
 workflows.
 um
 and


we're
 doing
 a
 lot
 of
 that
 ourselves,
 but


you
 can
 actually
 take
 that
 to
 an
 even


higher
 level
 where
 um
 if
 you
 uh
 really


embed
 the
 application
 context
 into
 the


database,
 um
 you
 can
 go
 in
 and
 actually


generate
 the
 application
 uh
 without


having
 to
 code
 uh
 from
 scratch
 at
 all.


>> So
 Oracle
 continuing
 to
 basically
 make


the
 argument
 that
 look
 AI
 is
 real.
 We're


seeing
 use
 cases
 inside
 of
 not
 only
 our


cloud
 uh
 data
 centers,
 which
 is
 the
 deal


they
 have
 with
 OpenAI,
 but
 also
 the


applications
 of
 what
 they're
 offering
 to


the
 market.
 Power
 integrations,
 by
 the


way,
 folks,
 is
 up
 10%
 right
 here.
 Uh


Nvidia
 just
 announced
 they're
 going
 to


be
 collaborating
 with
 Power


Integrations,
 ticker
 symbol
 PWI,


to
 accelerate
 the
 transition
 to
 800
 VDC


power
 and
 megawatt
 scale
 racks.


Power
 integrations
 with
 Nvidia.
 That's


the
 headline.


two
 billion
 dollar
 company.
 The
 fact


that
 Nvidia
 is
 partnering
 with
 these


small
 companies
 just
 shows
 you
 how
 much


demand


is
 out
 there
 that
 they
 have
 to
 go
 find


really
 really
 small
 companies
 that
 do


specialized
 things
 to
 be
 able
 to


collaborate
 with.
 Power
 integrations


designs
 and
 develops
 mixed
 signal


integrated
 circuits
 and
 other
 electronic


components.


There
 you
 go.
 That
 one's
 taking
 off


right
 here.
 Up
 now
 12.5%
 on
 the
 day


based
 on
 this
 Nvidia
 headline.


more
 and
 more
 and
 more


of
 uh


of
 excitement
 on
 this
 data
 center
 trade


not
 slowing
 down.
 By
 the
 way,
 Eaten,


this
 one
 has
 a
 partnership
 with


Palunteer
 ETN.
 They
 also
 did
 a


partnership
 with
 Nvidia.
 Uh
 Eaten


announces
 delivery
 of
 new
 reference


architecture
 designed
 to
 accelerate


adoption
 of
 800
 BDC
 power
 and
 AI
 data


centers


along
 with
 Nvidia.


So
 you
 have
 multiple
 partnerships
 coming


out
 today
 along
 with
 the
 Arista


like
 I
 guess
 bare
 news
 that
 you
 got
 some


companies
 switching
 off
 their
 networking


services.
 Arisa
 right
 here
 recovering
 a


little
 bit
 of
 that
 5%
 drop
 now
 only
 down


2.5%.


Pretty
 incredible
 day.
 I
 mean
 relatively


flat
 across
 the
 board.
 You
 got
 Howard


Marks
 who's
 not
 that
 bearish.
 You
 got


PayPal
 that
 once
 again
 cannot
 hold
 70


after
 getting
 a
 downgrade
 by
 JP
 Morgan.


SMCI
 is
 up.
 Bitcoin
 and
 Ethereum
 trying


to
 hold
 on,
 but
 they're
 likely
 going
 red


or
 they
 are
 red.
 Potentially
 could
 go


down
 more.
 And
 then
 Hood
 and
 Palanteer


not
 holding
 up
 either,
 but
 Nvidia


keeping
 the
 2%
 move.
 And
 some
 of
 the


drone
 companies,
 are
 those
 moving?
 And


is
 up
 15%.
 Okay,
 that
 one
 has
 been


ripping
 dramatically,


but
 it
 continues
 to
 go
 green.
 And
 then


again,
 that
 meme
 stock
 ETF
 also
 up
 12%


on
 the
 day.
 Broadcom
 right
 here.
 That
 is


the
 main
 one
 based
 on
 the
 large
 caps


that's
 up
 10%.


So
 the
 big
 thing
 to
 look
 out
 for
 this


week
 are
 earnings
 and
 that'll
 start


tomorrow.
 And
 that
 is
 what
 we're
 going


to
 have
 to
 really
 see
 if
 we
 can
 justify


a
 lot
 of
 the
 momentum
 we've
 had
 over
 the


past
 couple
 months.
 And
 then
 eventually


hopefully
 we
 get
 back
 above
 alltime


highs
 on
 the
 S&P.
 By
 the
 way,
 gold
 has


added
 10
 trillion
 in
 market
 cap
 in
 12


months.


Goodness
 gracious,
 bro.
 4,100
 all-time


highs
 on
 gold.
 10
 trillion
 in
 market


cap.


What's
 the
 overall
 gold
 market
 cap?
 It's


got
 to
 be
 like
 30
 trillion,
 right?
 27.8


trillion.
 All
 of
 crypto
 is
 barely
 4


trillion.
 Bitcoin,
 I
 think,
 is
 like
 2.2


trillion.
 So,


gold
 is
 vastly
 outpacing
 getting


obviously
 it's
 vastly
 outperforming
 it


this
 year
 as
 they
 continue
 to
 go
 green.


Uh,
 no
 news
 on
 Grabb
 outside
 of
 a
 price


target
 upgrade
 they
 got
 today
 from
 JP


Morgan
 630
 to
 680.
 Uh,
 they're
 expecting


a
 strong
 Q3.
 I'm
 expecting
 a
 strong
 Q3


as
 well.
 So,
 ultimately,
 a
 lot
 of
 these


companies,
 we're
 going to
 have
 to
 see


what
 they
 put
 up
 on
 their
 earnings


and
 the
 market
 will
 decide
 from
 there.


Where
 is
 VG?
 Yeah,
 that's
 a
 good


question.
 VG,
 again,
 they
 got
 that


lawsuit
 by
 BP.
 They're
 basically
 flat
 on


the
 day,
 but
 this
 stock
 got
 pummeled


25%.


I
 think
 the
 reason
 Hood
 is
 down
 is


because
 of
 crypto
 and
 Bitcoin.
 Uh
 but
 in


general,


again,
 dude,
 I
 just
 I
 just
 I
 don't
 care


if
 Hood
 if
 Hood
 goes
 back
 to
 130.
 I


don't
 care.
 And
 I
 say
 this
 as
 someone


who
 has
 a
 lot
 of
 Hood.
 I
 I
 I
 don't
 think


it
 was
 that
 healthy
 for
 Hood
 to
 go
 from


120
 to
 150.
 I
 enjoyed
 it.
 I
 think
 all
 of


us
 enjoyed
 it.
 But
 to
 say
 it's
 the


healthiest
 thing
 in
 the
 world,
 probably


not.
 So,
 I
 don't
 think
 there's
 anything


structurally
 wrong
 with
 the
 business,


but
 I
 do
 think
 the
 market
 got
 really


excited
 and
 bought
 up
 a
 ton
 of
 it.
 And


so
 if
 it
 consolidates
 and
 gives
 back


some
 of
 the
 gains,
 that
 is
 okay
 with
 me.


That
 gives
 it
 a
 lot
 healthier
 of
 a
 room


to
 move
 back
 up
 after
 a
 good
 earnings.


So
 I
 mean,
 I
 think
 Bitcoin,
 Ethereum


being
 down
 is
 the
 reason
 why
 Hood's


taking
 a
 hit,
 but


I
 do
 think
 that's
 not
 the
 worst
 thing
 in


the
 world
 for
 this
 to
 consolidate.
 BMR


as
 well,
 not
 really
 being
 able
 to
 make
 a


massive
 move
 because
 Ethereum's
 also


going
 down.


But
 at least
 it's
 above
 4,000,
 which
 is


good.
 I
 would
 buy
 Hood
 again
 if
 we
 see


125.
 125
 is
 where
 I
 would
 get
 excited
 to


buy
 it
 again.
 Now,
 I
 don't
 think
 we


easily
 get
 that.
 I
 think
 that
 would
 be


wiping
 out
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 momentum.


But,
 you
 know,
 if
 it
 gets
 there,
 I'll
 be


excited
 again.


I
 just
 don't
 think
 if
 we
 get
 there,


Oscar
 making
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 move.


Oscar
 got
 to
 25
 last
 week,
 back
 up
 to


1934,


which
 is
 not
 too
 bad.


Chris,
 thanks
 for
 the
 super
 chat.


Thoughts
 on
 the
 guy
 who
 shorted
 Bitcoin


for
 200
 million.
 He
 added
 80
 million
 the


last
 two
 hours
 to
 his
 position.
 Yeah,
 I


mean
 obviously
 he's
 bearish
 and
 he's


waiting
 for
 some
 type
 of
 catalyst
 to


continue
 wrecking
 crypto
 and
 he's
 been


right
 so
 far.
 Now,
 I
 don't
 know
 if


there's
 another
 Trump
 tweet
 coming
 out.


I
 don't
 think
 so.
 But
 this
 guy
 also


could
 just
 be
 being
 greedy,
 right?
 Maybe


he's
 just
 like,
 "Hey,
 everyone
 thinks


it's
 a
 rally.
 It's
 a
 bull
 trap
 and
 I


want
 to
 continue
 to
 take
 advantage
 of


the
 weakness."


And
 maybe
 that's
 what's
 happening
 as


well.


Um,


James,
 thanks
 for
 the
 super
 chat.
 You


only
 won
 debates
 because
 they
 couldn't


understand
 you.


I
 guess
 that
 was
 the
 reason.
 Jeromi,


thanks
 for
 the
 super
 chat.
 You
 are


right.
 For
 Emirates,
 if
 you
 describe
 the


people,
 it's
 Emiratis.
 The
 country
 is


pronounced
 differently.
 It
 cost
 me
 $5
 to


teach
 you.
 Jeromi,
 thank
 you.
 I


appreciate
 it.
 Maybe
 the
 that's
 the


reason
 I
 was a
 national
 debate
 champion.


Maybe
 people
 just
 couldn't
 understand


me.


And
 that's
 why
 it
 played
 out.
 Qualcomm


got
 an
 anti-
 trust
 probe
 by
 China
 last


week.
 Qualcomm
 right,
 they're
 up
 5%.
 So


maybe
 the
 lack
 of
 the
 China
 pressure


with
 Trump
 and
 the
 pivot
 is
 leading


investors
 to
 think,
 hey,
 Qualcomm's


likely
 not
 going
 to
 be
 investigated
 as


aggressively
 as
 I
 mean,
 China
 did
 this


whole
 thing
 on
 Nvidia
 a
 couple
 weeks
 ago


as
 well,
 and
 it
 was
 a
 nothing
 burger.
 So


I
 think
 that
 could
 be
 why
 Qualcomm


is
 uh
 is
 recovering.


Maybe
 that's
 what
 we're
 seeing
 right


here.


What
 about
 Weeble?
 Yeah,
 Weeble
 took
 a


nasty
 hit
 on
 Friday.


Wow.
 Continues
 to
 go
 down.
 1137.


1137.
 1190
 is
 when
 I
 was
 going
 to
 buy


it.
 I
 would
 have
 sold
 at
 like
 1250.


I
 don't
 know.
 Do
 they
 really
 send
 Weeble


below
 11
 bucks,
 dude?
 Do
 they
 really


send
 it
 below?
 I
 mean,
 you
 would
 think


this
 one
 recovers,
 but
 then
 again,
 if


Hood
 is
 down,
 all
 the
 brokerages
 are


getting
 hit.
 Weo
 is
 getting
 hit


below
 11


would
 be
 kind
 of
 wild
 though.


Be
 kind
 of
 wild.
 All right,
 I
 think


that's
 it
 for
 us.
 I'll
 be
 back
 on
 the


market
 close.
 We'll
 see
 what
 we
 got


going
 on.
 Overall,
 hood
 and
 pounder
 red,


Bitcoin
 crypto
 red,
 S&P
 recovering
 at


least
 1.4,
 which
 is
 nice
 to
 see
 if
 we


close
 anywhere
 above
 660.
 I'd
 be
 pretty


happy
 with
 that.


But
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 wait
 until


the
 end
 of
 the
 day
 to
 see
 how
 this
 ends


up
 playing
 out.
 Sound
 as
 well.
 That
 one


is
 up.


12%
 on
 the
 day.


Um,
 all
 right.
 Word
 of
 the
 day.
 What
 do


we
 got?


Velrome.


>> Velrome.


>> Okay.


Dude,
 there
 like
 there's
 one
 E.
 There's


not
 two
 E's
 there.


And
 who
 who
 has
 anyone
 heard
 of
 this


word?
 A
 sports
 arena
 equipped
 with
 a


track
 for
 cycling.


>> Va
 drrome.


>> I've
 never
 heard
 of
 this
 word
 before,


bro.
 Yeah,
 I
 didn't
 stand
 a
 chance
 with


that.


It's
 not
 as
 bad
 as
 Emirates,
 though.


It's
 not
 as
 bad
 as
 Emirates.
 A
 sports


arena
 equipped
 with
 a
 track
 for
 cycling.


Vlo
 sounds
 like
 a
 cryptocoin,
 right?
 It


sounds
 like
 a
 freaking
 cryptocoin.


Yeah,
 that's
 what
 it
 sounds
 like.
 All


right,
 that's
 it.
 Thank
 everybody.


Appreciate
 it.
 We
 will
 see
 how
 this
 week


turns
 out.
 We
 got
 a
 lot
 of
 earnings


coming
 up
 over
 the
 next
 couple
 days.


We'll
 do
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 preview
 of


the
 bank
 earnings
 on
 the
 market
 close


and
 we'll
 see
 what
 we've
 got
 going
 on.


Uh
 Trump
 is
 not
 talking
 anymore
 in


Egypt,
 so
 we'll
 probably
 get
 some


updates
 from
 that
 later
 in
 the
 week.


Mike
 Johnson
 is
 talking
 about
 the


shutdown.
 Hopefully,
 we
 get
 some
 clarity


on
 that.
 Broadcom
 OpenAI
 deal,
 massive


deal
 this
 morning.
 Uh
 continuing
 to
 fuel


the
 AI
 ecosystem.
 Gold
 and
 silver


continuing
 to
 go
 higher.


And


I
 guess
 over
 the
 coming
 days
 now,
 we
 can


see
 if
 we
 end
 up
 getting
 a
 recovery
 from


this
 Trump
 pivot
 going
 into
 the
 end
 of


the
 week.


All right,
 there
 we
 go.
 Thank
 everybody.


Appreciate
 it.
 We'll
 be
 back
 later
 on


the
 market
 close.
 Thank
 you
 everybody.


Have
 a
 good
 one.
