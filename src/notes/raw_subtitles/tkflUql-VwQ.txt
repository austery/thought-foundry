Hi
 everyone.
 Uh
 welcome
 to
 today's


podcast.
 I
 have
 the
 honor
 to
 invite


Professor
 Ron
 Pun
 and
 Yellan
 Bean
 to


this
 uh
 talk
 show.
 We're
 going
 to


discuss
 about
 the
 Democrat
 candidate
 for


the
 2028
 presidential
 election.
 So
 uh


Yamin,
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 you
 have
 seen
 our


last
 GOP
 rating
 uh
 episode.
 We
 actually


give
 scores
 to
 all
 the
 candidate
 in
 the


GOP
 camp,
 the
 top
 five
 players
 we


believe
 that
 in
 play.
 So
 today
 we're


going
 to
 do
 the
 same
 for
 uh
 Democrat.


Um
 I
 actually
 have
 Yamin
 uh
 did
 a
 few


research
 uh
 we
 actually
 did
 last
 time


and
 the
 result
 is
 quite
 shocking
 to
 me.


So
 it
 turns
 out
 Yilamin
 you
 are
 uh


outsider
 left
 here.


>> Yeah.


>> Are
 are
 you
 surprised
 about
 the
 result


like


>> Yeah.
 I
 thought
 I
 saw
 you
 were
 on
 the


right
 side
 than
 me.
 I
 was
 here,
 you


know.
 I
 was
 involent
 right
 here,
 but
 you


were
 actually
 outside
 or
 left.


>> Yes,
 the
 left
 and
 right
 is
 kind
 of


strange
 because
 last
 time
 I
 was
 using


eight
 dimension
 something
 that
 the
 other


test
 I
 was
 getting
 78%
 li


>> liberal,
 right?
 So
 the
 AD,
 right?
 The
 AD


test.
 Okay.


>> Yeah,
 I
 was
 getting
 78%
 liberal.


>> So
 it
 turns
 out
 you
 are
 a
 lefty.
 You're


you're
 a
 Democrat.
 uh
 supporter.


>> Maybe.


>> Maybe.


>> Still
 learning.
 Still
 learning.


>> Still
 learning.
 But
 you
 But
 you
 don't


vote.
 You
 don't
 vote.


>> I
 don't
 vote.


>> Yeah,
 because
 you


>> He's
 in
 a
 blue
 state,
 so
 it
 doesn't


matter
 like
 if
 you
 vote
 or
 not,
 right?


Like
 your
 your
 state
 is
 already
 decided.


>> Yeah.
 It
 it
 doesn't
 matter
 if
 I
 vote
 or


not.
 Yeah.


>> Yeah.
 All
 right.
 So,
 we're
 going
 to


start
 uh
 with
 our
 candidate
 here.
 So,


Professor
 uh
 the
 first
 one,
 we're
 going


to
 rate
 this
 one.
 uh
 electability
 and
 uh


we're
 going
 to
 read
 this
 five
 candidate


uh
 Governor
 Nuomo
 uh
 the


governor
 of
 California
 uh
 AOC
 Alexander


Okasio
 Cortez.
 Did
 I
 pronounce
 his
 name


correct,
 professor?


>> Yes.
 Yes.


>> Okay.
 Mayor
 Pete
 uh
 I
 don't
 know
 how
 to


pronounce
 his
 uh
 last
 name.
 So,
 yeah.


Okay.
 Kamla
 Harris,
 our
 former
 vice


president,
 our
 last
 Democratic


candidate,
 and
 Josh
 Shapiro,
 the


governor
 of
 uh
 Pennsylvania.


So,
 I'm
 going
 to
 start
 with
 uh
 Governor


Nuome.
 Um,
 professor,
 what
 do
 you
 think


about
 his
 electability?
 Like,
 from
 one


to
 five,
 what
 score
 are
 you
 going
 to


give
 him?


>> Well,
 uh,
 I'm
 going
 to
 give
 him
 a
 four.


I
 I
 think
 that's
 a
 fairly
 generous


rating.
 There's
 not
 been
 a
 strong


history
 in
 the
 Democratic
 party
 of


electing
 senators
 or
 governors
 from


California.


>> It's
 not
 worked
 well.


>> He
 he
 will
 have
 that


>> against
 him.
 The
 liberal
 uh
 from


California
 is
 running.
 But
 what
 he's


doing,
 the
 way
 he
 is
 using
 social
 media,


the
 way
 he
 is
 mirroring
 Trump,
 you
 can


see
 a
 steady
 climb
 in
 the
 favorable


polls
 for
 him.
 He
 is
 his
 popularity
 is


increasing
 among
 Democrats.
 So,
 I
 think


he's
 trending
 right
 now
 uh
 as
 you
 would


hope.


>> Yeah.
 What
 do
 you
 think
 about
 it,
 Eli?


He's
 a
 fire
 to
 me.


>> Oh,
 really?
 Wow.


>> All
 about
 eyeballs.
 I've
 been
 seeing
 all


all
 the
 news
 about
 him.
 I
 haven't
 seen


any
 news
 about
 the
 other
 candidate
 much.


So,
 all
 I
 see
 is
 Gavin
 Newsome.
 For
 me,


you
 get
 the
 eyeball,
 very
 high
 chance


you're
 going
 to
 win.


>> Okay.
 I'm
 actually
 going
 to
 give
 him
 a


three
 here.
 Uh
 the
 reason
 is
 I
 think
 um


he
 is
 definitely
 gaining
 a
 lot
 of
 uh
 you


know
 media
 coverage
 and
 popularity
 among


the
 Democrat
 but
 the
 problem
 is
 I
 don't


think
 him
 you
 know
 you
 know
 the
 the


party
 become
 more
 populist
 and
 I
 I
 think


he's
 still
 you
 know
 the
 typical


uh


the
 elite
 le
 uh
 Democrat
 candidate.
 He's


not
 you
 know
 like
 your
 AOC
 or
 Bernie


Sanders
 wing.
 So,
 I
 just
 don't
 know
 how


he
 would
 uh
 kind
 of
 play
 in
 the
 primary


in
 2028.


It's
 It's
 just
 tough.
 I'll
 give
 him
 a


year.


>> He
 got
 a
 lot
 of
 bad
 news
 like
 cheating


on
 his
 best
 friend.


>> Oh,
 yeah.
 He
 he
 had
 a
 lot
 of
 problem,


you
 know,
 like
 he's
 not
 very
 popular
 in


California,
 you
 know,
 like
 people
 in


California.


>> He
 calls
 in
 California.
 I
 mean,
 when
 you


talk
 to
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 from
 from


California,
 I
 personally
 don't
 know


anyone
 from
 California
 who
 likes
 him.


>> Yeah,
 that's
 the
 saying,
 right?
 Like
 I


heard
 a
 lot
 of
 uh
 bad
 uh
 reviews
 of
 his


performance
 there
 because
 he
 he
 looks


like
 a
 performance
 artist,
 but
 I
 do
 know


like
 uh
 he
 does
 gain
 a
 lot
 of
 uh
 social


media
 coverage
 for
 all
 the
 stuff
 he
 was


doing
 here.
 So,
 yeah,
 I
 understand
 why


you
 guys
 gave
 him
 high
 ratings,
 but
 I


gave
 him
 a
 three.
 AOC
 professor,
 what
 do


you
 think?
 I
 have
 a
 three
 for
 her.
 Uh


I
 think
 she
 is
 very
 bright.
 I
 think
 she


will
 be
 able
 to
 speak
 to
 the
 average


person
 uh
 the
 workers.


I
 think
 she's
 so
 young.
 I
 mean
 she
 will


just
 meet
 the
 legal
 requirement
 to
 run


age
 35.


Uh
 so
 I
 think
 it
 it
 will
 be
 it
 would
 be


difficult
 for
 her
 but
 I
 never
 would


count
 her
 out
 of
 anything.
 I
 just
 think


she's
 uh
 very
 resourceful
 and
 in
 many


ways
 very
 relatable.


>> Mhm.


What
 do
 you
 think?


>> Also
 a
 three
 I
 think
 she's
 very
 popular.


I
 don't
 agree
 with
 her
 logical
 many


things
 like
 one
 time
 I
 was
 hearing
 she


talking
 about
 Ela
 M
 being
 the
 dumbest


billionaire.
 I'm
 like
 this
 is
 not


possible.


>> Okay.


>> And
 I
 also
 heard
 she
 she
 doesn't
 like


the
 prison
 system
 at
 all.
 She
 won't
 do


abolish
 the
 prison.
 I
 don't
 know
 if


that's
 true
 or
 not,
 but
 I
 did
 some


digging.
 So
 pretty
 much
 she's
 leaning


towards
 no
 prison,
 just
 everybody
 be


nice.
 like
 it's
 kind
 of


>> too
 much.


>> Yeah.


>> Not
 going
 to
 work
 kind
 of
 thing.
 So,


three.


>> Yeah,
 I'll
 give
 her
 a
 three
 as
 well.
 The


reason
 is
 I
 think
 she's
 too
 young
 and
 uh


she
 can
 definitely
 excite
 the
 base,
 you


know,
 in
 the
 progressive
 wing,
 but
 I


don't
 think
 she
 can
 get
 buying
 from
 the


middle
 ground
 uh
 voters
 or
 even
 some
 of


the
 leaning
 Republican
 ones.
 they
 will


think
 her
 as
 too
 crazy
 or
 her
 policy
 too


progressive.
 And
 also
 I
 think
 she
 just


lack
 the
 experience
 to
 become
 the


president.
 You
 know
 she
 she
 probably


should
 run
 for
 senate
 or
 like
 other


higher
 ranked
 officer
 uh
 than
 the


president.
 President
 stage
 is
 too
 big


for
 him
 for
 her.
 I
 think


Mayor
 Pit
 professor


>> uh
 I
 would
 give
 Mayor
 Pete
 a
 three.
 I
 I


think
 that


he
 clearly
 has
 a
 problem
 with
 people
 of


color.


>> Mhm.


>> Did
 not
 have
 strong
 support
 when
 he
 was


mayor
 in
 South
 Bend.
 And
 that
 has


maintained
 throughout
 all
 polling.
 And


you
 know,
 rightly
 or
 wrongly,
 I
 I
 think


it's
 myself
 personally
 sad,
 but
 I
 think


that
 his
 sexual
 sexuality
 will
 become
 an


issue,
 too.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 and
 it's
 it's
 there.
 It's
 it's


unfortunate,
 but
 it's
 the
 reality
 as
 to


whether
 or
 not
 he
 is
 electable.
 Uh,
 I


think
 these
 these
 last
 two
 we've
 talked


about,
 AOC
 and
 Mayor
 Pete,
 I
 think


there's
 a
 greater
 likelihood
 they
 could


run
 for
 vice
 president
 than
 president.


>> I
 agree


on
 being
 what
 do
 you
 think?


>> I
 would
 give
 one
 the
 same
 reason
 with


Governor
 N.
 Seems
 like
 he
 doesn't
 get


any
 coverage
 to
 me
 at least.
 I
 only
 hear


about
 his
 name.
 I
 haven't
 heard
 anything


exciting
 or
 interesting
 or
 drama.
 I


haven't
 heard
 anything
 about
 this


person.
 So,
 from
 my
 experience,
 one,


>> yeah,
 I'll
 give
 him
 a
 two.
 Um,
 a
 lot
 of


reasons.
 So,
 first
 of
 all,
 I
 think


inside
 the
 Democrat
 party,
 he
 looks
 too


elite.
 He
 cannot
 speak,
 you
 know,
 the


progressive
 language
 and
 he
 will
 not
 be


regarded
 as
 a
 genuine
 progressive


player.
 So
 the
 progressive
 wing
 won't


support
 him.
 Also
 he
 lacks
 the
 you
 know


people
 with
 colors
 support.
 You
 know


when
 he
 was
 a
 mayor
 he
 had
 a
 lot
 of


controversies
 for
 the
 you
 know
 police


office


>> uh
 drama
 there.
 So
 that's
 a
 problem.
 And


also
 for
 GOP
 uh
 voters


his
 uh
 you
 know
 his
 uh
 identity
 as
 a
 as


a
 gay
 will
 be
 a
 problem.
 Like
 I
 think


there's
 a
 lot
 of


>> there's
 a
 lot
 of
 voters
 on
 the
 GOB
 side.


They
 take
 that
 as
 a
 big
 issue.
 So
 for


that
 reason,
 I
 don't
 think
 he
 is


electable
 like
 compared
 to
 the
 other
 two


candidate.


Yeah.
 All
 right.
 Camela
 Harris,


professor.


>> I'm
 gonna
 say
 and
 this
 is
 the
 same
 as


Newsome
 and
 it's
 a
 very
 generous
 four.


>> Yeah.
 The
 main
 reason
 is
 that
 she
 has


run
 and
 I
 think
 she
 learned
 from
 what


she
 did
 wrong
 and
 her
 mistakes
 were
 were


many.
 Uh
 so
 I
 think
 in
 in
 that
 regard


she
 will
 understand
 the
 structure.
 She


would
 try
 to
 correct
 errors
 from
 last


time.
 Uh
 certainly
 her
 name
 is
 well


known.
 So,
 it's
 a
 it's
 a
 generous
 four.


It's
 similar
 to
 Newsome.
 I
 think
 she


still
 has
 a
 lot
 of
 liabilities
 like


Nuome,
 including
 for
 her,
 she's
 a
 loser.


She
 lost.


>> Yeah.


>> Yellow.
 What
 do
 you
 think?


>> I'll
 do
 a
 three.
 If
 Aoz
 got
 three,
 Camo


Harris
 can
 get
 a
 three.


>> They
 are
 very
 similar.


>> Very
 similar.
 I'm
 going
 to
 give
 her
 a


two.
 I
 just
 don't
 think
 she
 should
 run.


I
 mean,
 I
 think
 she


>> she
 is
 uh
 she
 is
 a
 weak
 candidate
 to


begin
 with.
 The
 only
 reason
 she
 was


running
 in
 2024
 is
 because
 Biden
 want
 to


play
 identity
 politics
 and
 pick
 her
 as
 a


vice
 president.


>> Even
 for
 that
 job,
 she
 did
 a
 terrible


job.
 I
 still
 voted
 for
 her
 in
 2024


because
 I
 don't
 like
 Trump
 more.
 So
 like


that's
 the
 only
 reason
 I
 vote
 for
 her.


But
 if
 it's
 in
 primary,
 I
 would
 be
 have


a
 hard
 time
 voting
 for
 her.
 I
 would
 not


be
 excited
 for
 her
 to
 run.


>> Josh
 Shapiro,
 professor,


>> I'm
 gonna
 give
 Shapiro
 a
 three.
 Um,


>> I
 think
 he
 has
 a
 lot
 going
 for
 him
 and


we'll
 talk
 about
 it
 in
 in
 some
 of
 the


subsequent
 uh
 dimensions,


but
 I
 think


the
 Israel
 issue
 is
 going
 to
 be


difficult
 for
 him.
 Mhm.


>> You
 look
 at
 the
 the
 numbers
 in
 the


Democratic
 Party,


uh
 you
 have
 a
 large
 portion
 of
 that


party
 who
 still
 supports
 Israel


>> but
 doesn't
 support
 Netanyahu


and
 what's
 going
 on
 right
 now
 in
 Gaza.


>> Yeah,


>> I
 think
 Shapiro
 will
 have
 a
 hard
 time
 if


that
 war
 continues.
 I
 think
 this
 will
 be


a
 very
 delicate
 issue
 for
 him.
 um
 as
 as


rightly
 so.
 He's
 very
 proud
 of
 of
 of


being
 Jewish,
 but
 it
 also
 kind
 of
 puts


him
 on
 a
 spot
 in
 discussing


uh
 the
 Israel
 issues
 and
 uh
 he
 may
 be


viewed
 as
 out
 of
 step
 with
 the
 majority


of
 the
 Democratic
 party
 there.


>> You
 know what
 I
 mean?
 What
 do
 you
 think?


also
 three
 should
 be
 higher
 but
 similar


issue
 the
 professor
 was
 mentioning
 I
 I


heard
 one
 one
 story
 during
 the
 PB
 PBD


podcast
 he
 was
 covering
 a
 murder
 for
 a
 a


person
 from
 Israel
 something
 like
 that


but
 I
 don't
 know


>> oh
 yeah
 I
 heard
 there's
 a
 there's
 a


controversy
 uh
 is
 that
 murder
 or
 uh
 rape


>> murder
 or
 some
 kind
 of
 criminal


>> yeah
 criminal
 yeah
 I
 don't
 know
 Like


there's
 some
 there's
 some
 I
 think
 like


the
 US
 Israel
 policy
 is
 kind
 of


completely
 messed
 up
 like
 both
 party
 are


kind
 of
 you
 know


>> um
 the
 Jewish
 descent
 has
 never
 been
 a


US
 president
 yet.


>> Yeah.


>> Yeah.


>> Yeah.
 I'll
 give
 him
 a
 three.
 uh
 for
 a


lot
 of
 the
 reason
 you
 guys
 mentioned
 um


I
 just
 think
 like
 for
 him
 his
 capability


is
 definitely
 presidential
 like
 he
 he


could
 be
 a
 good
 president
 if
 he
 really


got
 elected
 but
 the
 problem
 is
 like


inside
 the
 Democrat
 party
 there's
 a
 huge


wing
 supporting
 the


>> Palestinian
 people
 and
 they
 do
 not


support
 anyone
 who
 stand
 with
 Netanyahu


but
 Josh
 Shapiro


>> made
 it
 clear
 he
 want
 to
 you
 support


Israel.
 So
 that
 could
 be
 a
 problem.
 Uh


even
 though
 that
 problem
 is
 still


evolving,
 but
 like
 uh
 I
 don't
 know
 like


when
 it
 comes
 to
 2028,


would
 Israel
 still
 have
 a
 war
 in
 Gaza?


Like
 would
 that
 be
 settled?
 I
 mean
 that


could
 be
 a
 big
 variable
 here.
 So
 I'll


give
 him
 a
 three
 here.
 Okay.
 Now
 ma
 move


on
 to
 the
 message
 clarity.
 Professor
 for


Governs.


>> Well,
 I
 think
 I
 I
 would
 give
 Newsome
 a


four
 here.
 I
 I
 think
 that
 he
 um
 I
 think


he's
 a
 bright
 guy
 and
 I
 think
 that
 he
 is


able
 to
 cut
 to
 the
 heart
 of
 things
 and
 I


personally
 think
 what
 he's
 what
 he's


doing
 by
 putting
 a
 mirror
 to
 Trump
 is


very
 smart.
 I
 think
 it
 is
 calling
 out


how
 ridiculous
 some
 of
 the
 things
 Trump


>> Yeah.
 car
 and
 and
 it's
 saying
 is
 this


what
 we
 want
 is
 this
 the
 kind
 of


behavior
 we
 want
 from
 our
 president


>> as
 he's
 selling
 merchandise
 so
 I
 I I


think
 he
 is
 making
 some
 very
 strong
 I


think
 he
 has
 a
 good
 staff
 a
 very
 smart


staff
 who
 can
 help
 him
 craft
 uh
 very


crisp
 messages
 that
 will
 be
 uh
 generally


received
 well


>> yeah
 I
 mean
 what
 do
 you
 think


>> I
 I'll
 give
 a
 three


cuz
 sometime
 when
 I
 hear
 his
 message


it's
 kind
 of
 kind
 of
 weird.


Yesterday
 I
 was
 I
 was
 listening
 to
 a


video
 about
 him
 talking
 about
 ICE
 in
 the


voting
 booth
 by
 saying
 Toronto
 Trump's
 a


bad
 guy.
 He
 was
 saying
 ICE
 to
 the
 voting


voting
 place
 but
 it's
 voting
 place
 you


should
 be
 a
 citizen
 already.
 So


>> why
 are
 you
 worrying
 about
 that?
 So


>> yeah,


>> three.


>> Three.
 Um
 I'm
 going
 to
 give
 him
 a
 three


as
 well.
 Uh
 the
 reason
 is
 like
 I
 kind
 of


see
 right
 now
 he's
 kind
 of
 mimicking


Trump.
 He's
 trolling
 Trump
 by
 like
 uh


behaving
 like
 a
 Democrat
 version
 of


Trump.
 The
 problem
 is
 Trump
 is
 authentic


and
 he
 is
 uh
 acting.
 So
 I
 don't
 know
 how


much
 for
 the
 voters
 like
 particular


voter
 who
 are
 not
 either
 Trump
 strong


Trump
 supporter
 or
 Trump
 haters
 how
 much


of
 those
 voters
 would
 appreciate
 uh


nuisance
 behavior
 because
 eventually
 you


want
 to
 come
 across
 as
 a
 very
 how
 to
 say


authentic
 person
 to
 the
 voters.
 I
 think


right
 now
 he
 looks
 very
 performative
 and


looks
 like
 a
 actor
 to
 me
 right
 now.
 So


for
 me,
 I
 just
 don't
 feel
 uh
 he's


connected
 with
 me.
 Yeah.


>> Let
 me
 let
 me
 just
 add
 one
 more
 point.
 I


know
 our
 purpose
 isn't
 to
 debate
 here


because
 I
 think
 everyone's
 making
 great


points,
 but
 I
 think
 if
 if
 you
 just
 stick


to
 the
 Democratic
 party,
 I
 think
 there's


a
 huge
 number
 of
 Democrats
 who
 just
 see


Trump
 as
 a
 schoolyard
 bully.


>> Yeah.
 Just
 as
 we
 tell
 our
 children,
 when


you're
 faced
 with
 a
 school
 schoolyard


bully,
 you
 can
 expose
 them
 by
 calling


them
 out
 because
 that's
 the
 last
 thing


they
 want
 to
 have
 happen.


>> So
 many
 Democrats
 have
 been
 waiting
 for


somebody
 to
 take
 the
 bully
 on.
 Yeah.
 And


all
 they
 found
 is
 a
 lot
 of
 spineless


politicians
 in
 both
 parties.
 Yeah,


>> I
 give
 Nome
 a
 lot
 of
 credit
 for
 what


he's
 doing
 right
 now.
 It
 may
 or
 may
 not


be
 authentic
 authentic,
 but
 what
 he
 is


doing
 is
 putting
 a
 mirror
 up
 to
 Trump


and
 his
 behavior
 for
 everyone
 to
 see
 how


ridiculous
 it
 is.
 And
 when
 you
 look
 at


his
 polling
 numbers
 over
 the
 last
 two


months,
 they
 have
 gone
 up
 dramatically.


I
 mean,
 maybe
 a
 multiple
 of
 three.
 That


to
 me
 says
 what
 he
 is
 doing
 is


resonating.
 That's
 obviously
 not
 going


to
 be
 enough
 by
 any
 means.
 But
 what
 it


says
 to
 me
 is
 he
 is
 demonstrating
 he's


willing
 to
 take
 on
 a
 bully
 and
 he
 has
 a


good
 staff
 working
 with
 him
 coming
 up


with
 very
 clever
 ways
 to
 do
 that.
 That's


why
 I
 score
 him
 as
 I
 do.


>> Got
 it.
 Yeah,
 I
 agree.
 I
 think
 for
 a


certain
 group,
 they
 definitely
 want
 to


see,
 you
 know,
 someone


stand
 up
 to
 Trump.
 The
 only
 problem
 is


like
 Trump
 is
 not
 running
 in
 2028,
 so


it's
 going
 to
 be
 like
 a


>> Bruce,
 Bruce,
 it's
 way
 too
 early
 to
 say


that,
 bro.


>> Yeah.
 Okay.


>> Just
 yesterday,
 just
 yesterday,
 a
 guy


walked
 up
 on
 my
 street
 with
 a
 Trump


2028.
 Just
 yesterday.


>> Okay.
 that
 that
 is
 uh
 I
 mean
 if
 Trump


can
 run,
 we
 can
 get
 Obama
 wrong
 again,


you
 know.


>> Yeah,
 it's
 Yeah,
 it's
 it's
 over
 if
 that


>> Okay,
 for
 AOC
 professor,
 what
 do
 you


think?


>> I
 give
 her
 a
 four.


>> Like
 her
 or
 not
 like
 her,
 I
 think
 she


does
 the
 best
 job
 saying
 let's
 get
 away


from
 labels.
 Let's
 get
 away
 from
 calling


people
 liberals
 and
 conservatives
 and


right
 and
 left.
 I
 want
 to
 tell
 you
 what


I'm
 for
 and
 let
 me
 know
 if
 you
 think


it's
 reasonable
 right
 now.
 And
 he
 she's


echoing
 a
 lot
 of
 Sanders
 comments
 and


I've
 watched
 a
 number
 of
 Sanders
 recent


speeches


>> and
 there
 he's
 hitting
 it.
 He
 he
 is


connecting
 with


do
 regardless
 of
 party.
 Do
 you
 think


it's
 right
 that
 one
 person
 spent
 27
 or


$270
 million
 to
 elect
 a
 president
 this


year?
 Do
 you
 think
 it's
 right
 that
 that


same
 person's
 wealth
 is
 equal
 to
 52%


of
 the
 US
 population
 combined?
 So
 the


way
 they're
 using
 numbers
 in
 comparative


fashion,
 she's
 she
 can
 mimic
 a
 lot
 of


what
 what
 Sanders
 has
 been
 saying.


>> If
 she
 can
 keep
 on
 the
 argument
 of
 don't


label,
 just
 think
 about
 this.
 Are
 you


satisfied
 with
 the
 way
 this
 country
 has


evolved?
 I
 think
 those
 messages
 are


going
 to
 score
 some
 points.


>> Mhm.
 Yeah,
 I
 agree.
 You
 know what
 I


mean?
 What
 do
 you
 think?
 as
 four.
 I


understand
 her
 message.
 Sometimes
 she


has
 to
 be
 not
 so
 not
 so
 obvious.
 Like
 if


you
 ask
 her
 about
 illegal
 immigrant,


she'll
 be
 like,
 "No,
 nobody's
 illegal


yet
 kind
 of
 thing."
 Cuz
 you
 can't
 really


use
 the
 obvious
 word.
 It'll
 be
 like


sound
 like
 a
 trumper.
 So
 four
 because
 I


get
 her
 message


>> most
 of the
 time.


>> I'm
 gonna
 give
 her
 a
 four.
 I
 think
 she


can
 use
 a
 lot
 of
 rhetorics
 uh
 Bernie


Sanders
 have
 been
 using.
 I
 think
 Bernie


Sanders
 is
 like
 the
 mentor
 for
 her.
 Yes.


>> And
 try
 to
 pass
 on
 the
 torch
 to
 her.
 So


I
 think
 she
 can
 definitely
 build
 a


strong
 message
 for
 the
 progressive


agenda.
 And
 I
 think


>> Zoran
 Mandani
 was
 doing
 a
 great


demonstration
 in
 New
 York
 City.


progressive
 left
 could
 win
 elections
 at


least
 win
 like
 primaries
 in
 Democrat


party
 bigly.
 So
 I
 think
 she
 can


definitely
 pick
 up
 a
 lot
 of
 that
 play


girl
 and
 also
 she
 she's
 very
 good
 on


social
 media.
 She
 has
 a
 lot
 of
 following


on
 Twitter
 and
 she
 can
 do
 Tik
 Tok
 pretty


well.
 She
 is
 um
 has
 good-looking
 uh
 is


very
 presentable
 in
 the
 video.
 So
 I


think
 she
 can
 use
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 skills
 uh


Zola
 Madani
 was
 been
 doing
 in
 the
 Tik


Tok.


>> And
 I
 think
 that
 the
 test
 for
 her
 is


going
 to
 be
 you
 in
 most
 of
 these


elections
 there's
 a
 push
 toward
 the


middle.


>> You
 have
 to
 accept
 some
 of
 that
 and


still
 do
 you
 your
 best
 to
 hold
 on
 to


your
 base.


>> Yes,


>> I
 think
 she's
 going
 to
 be
 skilled
 enough


to
 go
 a
 bit
 toward
 the
 middle
 but
 still


hold
 on
 to
 her
 base.
 I
 really
 do.


>> She's
 going
 to
 understand
 to
 be
 elected,


she's
 going
 to
 have
 to
 do
 that.
 A


straight
 progressive
 candidate
 is
 not


going
 to
 win.


>> That's
 the
 exact
 point
 I
 heard
 from
 PBD


podcast.
 If
 she
 goes
 to
 middle,
 she
 will


probably
 be
 the
 number
 one
 candidate.


>> Well,
 I
 think
 she's
 going
 to
 have
 to.
 I


I
 I
 think
 any
 of
 them,
 you
 know,
 if
 if


if
 the
 far
 left
 wants
 to
 make
 an
 issue


over
 Sydney
 Sweeny's
 jeans,
 the


Democrats
 are
 going
 to
 have
 a
 problem
 in


2028.


>> Oh,
 yeah.


>> But
 I
 don't
 think
 I
 don't
 think
 she'll


go
 to
 the
 middle.


>> Once
 you
 go
 left,
 you
 got
 to
 go
 far.


>> Subtle
 moves.
 It
 It
 doesn't
 have
 to
 be
 a


huge
 leap.
 And
 and
 again,
 I
 think
 she's


very
 skilled
 at
 how
 she
 tries
 to
 define


things
 and
 diffuse
 arguments
 that
 are


all
 based
 on
 ideology
 and
 labeling


people.
 I
 think
 she
 is
 the
 best
 at
 that


and
 I
 think
 she
 could
 only
 get
 better.
 I


I
 still
 think
 the
 age
 issue
 is
 huge
 for


her.


>> Yeah.
 Mayor
 Pitt,
 Professor


>> uh
 I'm
 going
 to
 give
 Mayor
 Pete
 a
 three


here.
 It
 just


I
 I
 think
 he
 did
 a
 very
 good
 job
 as


transportation
 secretary.
 I
 think
 he
 got


a
 lot
 of
 uh
 national
 play


uh
 through
 the
 infrastructure
 bill.
 Uh
 I


think
 he's
 very
 smart
 uh
 of
 this
 group.


He
 and
 AOC
 would
 be
 the
 two
 that
 I
 would


least
 want
 to
 debate.


>> Mhm.
 Um,
 but
 I
 think
 that
 just
 his


ability
 to
 connect
 with
 uh
 multiple


constituencies
 seems
 uh
 seems
 limited.


And
 he
 does
 have
 a
 record
 in
 South
 Bend


that
 he's
 going
 to
 be
 forced
 to
 explain


in
 some
 cases.


>> Mhm.
 You
 know,
 what
 do
 you
 think?


>> I
 have
 to
 uh
 copy
 Professor's
 answer
 on


this
 one
 because
 I
 don't
 know
 him
 much.


I
 haven't
 heard
 any
 message
 from
 him.


I
 thought
 he
 go
 on
 to
 Fox
 News
 a
 lot.


You
 know,
 he
 debate
 with
 right-wing


commentator.
 Yeah.


>> Does
 he
 do
 any
 podcast?


>> I
 think
 he
 did.
 He's
 a
 He's
 a
 very


articulate
 person.
 He
 he
 debates.
 He's


well
 educated.
 He
 is
 your
 typical
 elite


politician,
 you
 know.


>> Okay.
 I'll
 try
 a
 couple
 video.


>> Yeah.
 No,
 I
 think
 you
 might
 find
 it


worthwhile.
 I
 I
 agree
 with
 what
 Bruce


just
 said.
 How
 you


>> You
 gave
 him
 a
 three,
 right?
 Message


clarity.


>> Yeah.


>> Um
 I'll
 give
 him
 a
 four.
 I
 think
 he
 is


wellspoken
 and
 he
 can
 definitely
 go
 on


all
 kinds
 of
 podcasts.
 Like
 I
 definitely


I
 definitely
 can
 see
 him
 going
 on,
 you


know,
 Joe
 Rogan
 show,
 all
 the
 right-wing


podcaster.
 He
 he
 could
 be
 sitting
 there


talking
 about
 policies
 and
 debating
 for


three
 hours,
 no
 problem.
 uh
 for
 that


part
 I
 think
 he
 should
 be
 good.
 Um
 I


think
 he
 probably
 shares
 some
 of
 the
 uh


issues
 with
 Gavin
 New
 they
 just
 looks


very
 elite
 and
 u
 less
 authentic.
 That's


I
 think
 that's
 a
 problem.
 They
 they
 have


to
 figure
 out
 how
 to
 communicate
 better.


It's
 it's
 funny
 because
 Trump
 lies
 a
 lot


but
 his
 base
 view
 him
 very
 authentic


because
 he
 tell
 them
 like
 yeah
 I
 just


lie
 like
 I
 just
 this
 is
 just
 me.
 So


>> it's
 interesting
 though
 he's
 losing


support
 among
 the
 uh
 high
 school


educated
 supporters.
 You
 know
 what
 was


such
 a
 strong
 part
 of
 his
 base
 I
 think


he's
 down
 about
 7
 percentage
 points


there.
 So,
 I
 think
 there's
 going
 to
 be


opportunity
 for
 the
 Democrats
 to
 connect


with
 working
 voters
 who
 have
 become


disillusioned
 with
 Trump.
 I
 think
 there


enough


>> enough
 room
 there
 that
 the
 Democrats
 can


seize
 on
 that.
 Could
 Mayor
 Pete
 do
 it?
 I


agree
 with
 all
 you
 said.
 He
 he
 he
 is


very
 articulate.
 he
 doesn't
 get
 rattled


and
 he
 will
 stick
 to
 his
 talking
 points


and
 if
 he's


>> if
 he's
 well
 coached
 and
 hitting
 the


right
 points,
 he
 could
 be
 a
 force.


>> Yeah.


>> Oh,
 I
 found
 a
 couple
 video.
 He's
 he's
 on


Julie
 B
 and
 Flag.


>> Oh,
 yeah.
 He
 is
 He's
 very
 good
 at


debating
 and
 uh
 he
 speaks
 really
 well,


>> but
 his
 se
 sexual
 orientation
 is
 going


to
 be
 a
 big
 problem.


>> Oh,
 yeah.
 That's
 that's
 going
 to
 be
 a


problem.
 But
 like,
 you
 know,
 come
 on.


Uh,
 Besson
 can
 be
 our
 uh
 uh
 secretary
 of


treasury.
 You
 know,
 he
 could
 be
 a
 MAGA


as
 well.
 So,


>> maybe
 MAGA
 is
 over
 that
 part.


>> Kamla
 Harris,
 professor.


>> Well,
 I
 I
 can't
 give
 her
 after
 this
 last


campaign.
 I
 can't
 give
 her
 more
 than
 the


three.


>> Okay.
 Anyone
 that
 would
 be
 asked
 a


question,
 you
 know,
 what
 would
 you
 do


differently
 than
 Biden
 who
 says
 nothing


comes
 to
 mind?
 I
 I
 can't,
 you
 know,
 but


when
 you
 look
 at
 the
 debate,


she
 did
 very
 good
 and
 that's
 why
 Trump


wouldn't
 debate
 her
 a
 second
 time,
 you


know.
 I
 think
 I
 don't
 agree
 with
 people


who
 say
 she's
 not
 bright.
 I
 think
 she
 is


bright
 and
 I
 just
 think


>> uh
 that
 moment
 was
 too
 big
 for
 her.


>> Maybe
 next
 time
 it
 it
 will
 be
 a
 little


bit
 more
 reachable.
 I
 don't
 know.
 Most


often
 you
 don't
 get
 a
 second
 chance.
 You


know,
 Richard
 Nixon
 was
 an
 exception.
 We


do
 have
 some
 exceptions
 to
 it.


>> U
 but
 uh
 I
 just
 don't


you
 know
 I
 I
 I
 would
 give
 her
 a
 three


with
 message
 clarity.
 Hopefully
 she's


better
 coached
 next
 time.


>> Yeah.
 You
 know what
 I
 mean?
 What
 do
 you


think?


>> A
 poor
 one.


>> What


clarity?


>> If
 you
 a
 like
 a
 student
 try
 to
 learn


English
 and
 you
 just
 watch
 your
 all
 her


speech
 like
 what's
 coconut
 falling
 on


the
 tree.
 You
 got
 to
 put
 what's
 behind


the
 idea,
 the
 path,
 the
 way
 you
 just
 you


put
 all
 the
 word
 together.
 It's
 like
 I


understand
 all
 the
 English
 and
 I
 just


don't
 understand
 the
 message.
 Okay.


>> No
 message
 there.
 Just
 words
 together.


>> Yeah,
 I'll
 give
 her
 a
 two.
 Uh
 I
 think


same
 was
 what
 you
 guys
 just
 mentioned.
 I


think
 like
 if
 she
 couldn't
 go
 on
 a
 Joe


Rogan
 show
 and
 she
 just
 have
 problem,


you
 know,
 sitting
 interview
 for
 longer


than
 an
 hour,
 that
 going
 to
 be
 a


problem.
 So


I'll
 give
 her
 a
 two
 message
 clarity
 for


Josh
 Shapiro.


I
 would
 give
 Shapiro
 a
 four.
 I
 think


he's
 very
 articulate.
 I
 I
 still
 am
 one


who
 wonders
 what
 would
 have
 happened.
 I


think
 he
 would
 have
 had
 some
 of
 the
 same


issues
 that
 we
 talked
 about
 uh
 earlier


uh
 about
 his
 electability.
 I
 I
 think


that
 may
 have
 been
 a
 factor
 of
 why
 he


wasn't
 selected
 for
 uh
 the
 vice


presidential
 slot,
 but
 he
 is
 a
 very


bright,
 articulate
 person
 who
 can
 uh
 he


can
 speak
 in
 ways
 that
 resonate.
 When


you
 look
 at
 his
 approval
 rating
 in


Pennsylvania,
 uh
 it's
 very
 high.


>> Yeah,
 there's
 something
 about
 his
 style


that
 resonates
 with
 people.


>> Yeah.
 I'll
 just
 mention
 that
 one
 story
 I


read
 from
 a
 book
 uh
 recently
 published


Josh
 Shapiro
 act
 very
 aggressive
 during


the
 interview
 and
 he
 was
 talking
 about


okay
 here's
 what
 I
 want
 to
 do
 if
 I


become
 the
 VP
 and
 the
 Kamala
 team
 was


like
 hold
 on
 hold
 on
 hold
 on
 we're


interviewing
 you
 like
 we're
 not
 saying


that
 you're
 already
 the
 VP
 so
 like
 you


just
 act
 like
 a
 dick
 you
 know
 like
 an


[ __ ]


>> and
 someone
 speculated
 that
 he


intentionally
 did
 that
 so
 he
 just
 He


just
 doesn't
 want
 to
 be
 the
 second


banana
 because
 think
 about
 it.
 If
 he


become
 the
 vice
 president
 and
 he
 won,


the
 earliest
 he
 can
 run
 for
 president


will
 be
 like
 80
 years
 later,
 right?
 Like


in
 uh
 in
 uh
 2032.


>> Yeah.


>> If
 they
 lost,
 that's
 going
 to
 be
 on
 him.


He
 will
 be
 viewed
 as
 a
 loser.
 So,
 it's


like
 a
 lose-lose
 situation.
 So,
 he
 would


rather
 staying
 out
 of
 that.
 And
 also
 I


think
 he
 probably
 saw
 some
 of
 the


internal
 pollings
 in
 Pennsylvania.


>> Kla
 Harris
 was
 like
 lagging
 behind.
 So


>> I
 guess
 that's
 probably
 the
 reason
 he
 he


just
 like
 did
 that.


>> He's
 very
 ambitious
 and
 sometimes
 the


way
 he
 takes
 credit
 for
 things.
 I
 mean


take
 the
 NFL
 draft
 for
 instance.


>> I
 don't
 know
 if
 you
 guys
 follow
 American


football,
 but
 that's
 a
 big
 deal
 to
 land


the
 draft.
 The
 Steeler
 organization
 has


been
 trying
 to
 get
 it
 in
 Pittsburgh
 for


many,
 many
 years.
 There
 were
 a
 lot
 of


folks
 that
 were
 involved,
 but
 Shapiro


tried
 to
 take
 all
 the
 credit
 for
 it.


Soon
 as
 that
 announced,
 he
 said,
 "Oh,


>> Roger
 Goodell,
 the
 commissioner
 of


football,
 was
 probably
 tired
 of
 getting


my
 phone
 calls."
 essentially
 saying,


"You
 have
 to
 thank."
 I
 wrote
 him
 a


letter
 about
 that.
 I
 didn't
 get
 a


response.


>> Yeah.
 I
 wrote
 him
 a
 letter
 saying,
 "I


expect
 a
 little
 better
 from
 you.
 I
 don't


expect
 to
 see
 this
 kind
 of
 grandstanding


and
 taking
 credit
 for
 something
 you
 at


best
 were
 a
 marginal
 player
 in."


>> Mhm.
 Yeah.


All
 right.
 What
 do
 you
 think?


>> I
 think
 it's
 a
 four.
 I
 I
 only
 hear
 him


talking
 maybe
 a
 couple
 time.
 He
 sounds


very
 intentional,
 very
 deliberate.


Everything
 he
 wants
 to
 say,
 I
 get
 it.
 So


four
 maybe
 the
 one
 is
 no
 is
 real
 stuff


kind
 of
 yeah
 maybe
 can't
 be
 too
 obvious


or
 something.


>> Yeah
 I'll
 give
 him
 a
 four
 as
 well.
 I


think
 he
 is
 really
 good
 at
 uh
 crafting


his
 message
 and
 you
 know
 he's
 he's
 very


well
 spoken
 and
 when
 he
 give
 a
 speech


you're
 going
 to
 feel
 like
 you
 know
 he's


like
 u
 performing
 some
 sometimes
 looks


like
 Obama
 you
 know.
 Mhm.


>> All
 right.
 For
 coalition
 growth,
 uh,


Governor
 Newsome.


>> Well,
 here,
 you
 know,
 I
 don't
 I
 don't


see
 Newsome
 really
 growing
 the


coalition.
 I
 think
 if
 I
 were
 to
 redo


this
 dimension
 for
 the
 Democrats,
 it's


regaining
 the
 coalitions
 they've
 had
 in


the
 past.


>> I
 I
 would
 give
 Newsome
 a
 three
 here.
 I
 I


think
 I
 don't
 see
 I
 think
 it's
 going
 to


be
 difficult
 for
 him
 to
 reach
 groups


that
 have
 not
 been
 traditionally
 part
 of


uh
 the
 Democratic
 circle.
 So
 if
 we
 if


that's
 how
 we're
 defining
 coalition


growth,
 I
 don't
 think
 he
 would
 be
 the


best
 in
 this
 category.


>> Do
 you
 think
 he
 can
 win
 the
 blue
 wall?


Because
 like
 that's
 Biden's
 coalition,


you
 know,
 in
 2020.
 Biden
 win


>> Yes.
 and
 he
 would
 have
 to
 win
 the
 blue


wall.
 He
 He's
 going
 to
 have
 to
 shed
 a


little
 of
 the
 leftist
 California


image
 and
 and
 and


get
 down
 to
 where
 people
 are
 and
 talking


about,
 you
 know,
 I
 you
 I've
 studied
 a


lot
 of
 presidential
 elections.
 I've


taught
 courses
 on


>> presidential
 elections
 and
 I
 see
 a
 lot


of
 I
 I
 wasn't
 alive
 at
 that
 time.
 I'm


old,
 but
 not
 this
 old.
 I
 see
 a
 lot
 of


1948


here
 where
 the
 Democrats
 have
 to
 go
 back


to
 their
 roots


>> to
 farmers,


to
 labor,
 to
 Catholics,
 to
 Jews,
 and
 and


now,
 you
 know,
 you
 have
 the
 LGBTQ


community
 that
 they
 need
 to
 maintain.


You
 have
 to
 have
 messaging
 that


recaptures


those
 uh
 constituencies
 that
 by
 and


large
 the
 Democrats
 have
 been
 losing
 as


the
 Republicans
 have
 branded
 themselves


the
 party
 of
 the
 common
 person.


>> Yeah,
 I
 totally
 agree.
 I
 think
 the


problem
 for
 Democrat
 is
 like
 they
 play


so
 much
 with
 the
 identity
 politics
 and


they
 forgot
 all
 the
 you
 know


>> the
 union
 the
 labor
 the
 farmers
 the
 the


blue
 collar
 workers
 who
 really
 like


support
 Democrat
 in
 the
 past


>> right


>> yeah
 I
 mean
 what
 do
 you
 think


>> I
 think
 it's
 for
 same
 reason
 for
 the


number
 number
 one
 category
 it's
 all


about
 eyeball
 he's
 doing
 a
 lot
 of


eyeballing
 and
 got
 a
 lot
 of
 coverage
 and


just
 all
 about
 fighting
 in
 fighting


fighting
 and
 when
 people
 see
 someone
 who


willing
 to
 fight
 just
 like
 okay
 maybe


he's
 fighting
 for
 something
 good
 you


know
 for
 the
 for
 the
 lower


like
 lower
 information
 people
 were
 like


oh
 he's
 fighting
 must
 be
 something
 good


kind
 of
 thing


>> yeah
 I
 think
 that
 that
 could
 be
 that's


an
 interesting
 argument
 because
 like
 if


you
 think
 about
 a
 lot
 of
 uh
 low


information
 voter
 right
 so
 they
 just


like
 doesn't
 pay
 attention
 to
 politics


and
 when
 they
 turn
 on
 some
 podcast
 it's


and
 Gavin
 Newsome
 was
 there.
 Oh,
 that


that's
 a
 guy
 I
 heard
 about
 him
 talking.


He
 seems
 smart.
 Like
 I'll
 just
 like
 vote


him.
 That
 could
 happen.


>> He
 also
 predict
 that
 2028
 Trump
 if
 Trump


running
 for
 2028,
 he
 will
 be
 the
 best


one
 to
 fight
 because
 he
 already
 say


fight
 that
 that
 very
 idea.
 Now
 Obama


because
 Obama
 doesn't
 say
 anything
 about


fighting
 right
 now.


>> Okay.


>> Yeah.


>> Yeah.


>> So
 four
 you
 get
 bigger.


>> Yeah.
 Um,
 I
 I'm
 kind
 of
 torn
 about
 this


score.
 I'll
 give
 him
 a
 three.
 I
 think
 uh


I
 definitely
 see
 the
 argument
 Yellow


Bane
 is
 making,
 but
 I
 just
 still
 don't


know
 if
 a
 governor
 from
 California
 could


win
 the
 blue
 wall.
 Like
 the
 he
 just


looked
 too
 elite,
 you
 know?
 Yeah,


>> Biden
 was
 the
 last
 Democrat
 candidate


who
 win
 the
 blue
 war.
 You
 know,
 Hillary


lost,
 Kamla
 lost,
 right?
 So,
 um,
 yeah,
 I


give
 him
 a
 three
 here.


forc
 professor.


>> Yeah,
 this
 is
 tough.
 I
 I'll
 probably


give
 her
 a
 three
 as
 well.
 I
 I
 see
 most


of
 the
 Democrats
 similar
 as
 well
 in


coalition
 growth.
 Although


with
 AOC,
 I
 think
 she
 has
 one
 of
 the


better
 chances
 of
 crafting
 arguments


that
 are
 going
 to
 reach
 rank
 and
 file


workers.
 I
 I
 think
 that
 she
 just
 has
 a


nice
 way
 of
 positioning
 her
 arguments


that
 can
 break
 through
 some
 of
 the


labeling
 and
 say,
 "Does
 this
 make
 sense


to
 you?"


>> And,
 you
 know,
 hit
 people
 with


statistics
 on
 income
 inequality,
 hit


people
 with
 statistics
 on
 healthcare,


and
 and
 say,
 you
 know,
 we
 need
 you
 back.


We
 want
 you
 to
 return
 cuz
 traditionally


this
 has
 been
 your
 home.


I
 I
 I
 see
 her
 between
 a
 three
 and
 a
 four


here.


>> Mhm.
 You
 know what
 I
 mean?
 What
 do
 you


think?


>> I
 say
 two.


I
 I
 don't
 see
 a
 lot
 of
 message
 change.


If
 you
 like
 AOC
 before,
 you
 still
 like


her.
 If
 you
 don't
 like
 AOC,
 you
 won't


change
 for
 Gavin
 News
 is
 fighting


harder.
 AOC
 from
 the
 beginning
 was


hiding
 at
 the
 maximum
 like
 all
 the
 words


all
 the
 saying
 you
 cannot
 go
 any
 worse


to
 fight
 Trump.
 So
 you
 just
 not
 gonna


join
 AOC
 if
 you
 didn't
 join
 her
 before


>> too.


>> I'm
 going
 to
 give
 her
 a
 four.
 The
 reason


is
 I
 see
 the
 populist
 movement
 in


America
 is
 getting
 bigger
 and
 bigger.


the
 tide.


>> I
 think
 uh
 you
 know
 GOP
 has
 been
 taken


over
 by
 the
 populist
 movement.
 It's
 time


for
 the
 Democrat
 party
 been
 taken
 over.


Uh
 Zar
 Mandani
 is
 your
 signal
 there.
 So


I
 think
 DOC


if
 she
 can
 build
 a
 strong
 coalition


across
 the
 blue
 collar
 group,
 the


progressive
 and
 she
 can
 win
 some
 of
 the


senators
 voter
 who
 voted
 for
 Trump
 in
 uh


you
 know
 2016
 or
 uh
 2024
 and
 who
 voted


for
 Biden
 in
 2020.
 So
 I
 think
 that's


that's
 a
 group
 she
 can
 win
 back
 for
 the


Democrat
 party
 unlike
 Newsome.
 You
 know,


I
 think
 AOCC's
 message
 could
 connect


with
 them
 particularly
 when
 they
 become


disillusioned
 with
 Trump's
 policy
 like


with
 the
 big
 beautiful
 bill
 take
 away


their
 health
 care
 and
 take
 away
 their


food
 stamps.


>> That
 could
 be
 a
 problem.


>> Well
 said.
 Well
 said.


>> May
 I
 pit
 professor?


>> Uh


I
 probably
 will
 go
 through
 here
 as
 well.


>> I
 I
 think
 there's
 potential
 there.
 Uh


we've
 already
 talked
 about
 some
 of
 his


liabilities.


Um
 but
 he
 he
 can
 craft


I
 think
 the
 possibility


of
 him
 getting
 on
 the
 stages


that
 could
 give
 him
 the
 opportunity
 to


connect
 with
 people
 he
 hasn't
 quite


connected
 with
 in
 the
 past.
 I
 think
 that


possibility
 exists.
 I
 think
 he
 would


take
 advantage
 of
 those
 opportunities,


but
 I
 still
 would
 rate
 him
 a
 three.


>> Yam,
 what
 do
 you
 think?


>> Have
 to
 copy
 professor's
 answer.


Don't
 know
 much
 about
 him.


>> So,
 watch
 video.
 Yeah.


>> Okay.
 I'll
 give
 him
 a
 two.
 I
 think
 he


will
 be
 really
 struggling
 with
 people


with
 color
 and
 the
 working
 class


unlike.
 Actually,
 I
 forgot
 to
 mention


like
 ALC
 is
 very
 popular
 with
 Latinos,


you
 know.
 Uh
 so
 that's
 another
 thing


Maya
 Pete
 doesn't
 have.
 I
 just
 think


like


>> right


>> he
 had
 he
 will
 be
 having
 a
 lot
 of


trouble
 trying
 to
 convince
 the


African-Americans
 voter
 to
 come
 out
 and


vote
 for
 him
 getting
 excited
 for
 him.


That's
 going
 to
 be
 tough.
 So
 I
 give
 him


a
 two.
 Kla
 Harris.
 Uh,


I
 would
 give
 her
 a
 three
 as
 well.
 Uh,


and
 that's
 a
 generous
 three.
 I
 just
 feel


like
 she
 had
 her
 shot.
 It
 didn't
 work.


She
 may
 be
 a
 better
 candidate
 next
 time.


Um,
 but
 her
 ability
 I
 I
 think
 that
 she's


a
 bit
 polarizing


and
 I
 think
 that
 she
 was,
 you
 know,
 she


was
 muddied
 a
 lot
 with,
 you
 know,
 the


the
 60
 Minutes
 issue
 and
 just
 her


ability
 to
 craft
 uh
 messages
 and
 and
 I


just
 think
 she's
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 damaged


goods
 here


>> and
 that's
 going
 to
 be
 tough
 for
 her
 to


grow
 a
 coalition.


Yan
 Bing,


>> I'll
 give
 her
 one.


Number
 one
 reason
 I
 don't
 think
 she


wants
 to
 glow
 the
 coalition
 cuz
 during


the
 presidency
 she
 doesn't
 even
 try


much.
 I
 think
 if
 if
 you
 give
 you
 give


her


>> that
 I
 don't
 I
 don't
 agree
 because
 she


apparently
 tried
 to
 reach
 out
 to
 the


Republican
 voter.
 She
 has
 like


>> Dick
 Cheny's
 daughter,
 right?
 like
 try


to
 kind
 of
 go
 on
 a
 tour,
 give
 speech
 and


show.
 Yeah,
 she's
 trying
 to
 build
 a


bigger
 corers.


>> That's
 kind
 of
 force
 because
 you
 have
 no


option
 to
 quit.
 If
 she
 get
 offer
 option


to
 quit,
 I
 think
 she
 will
 quit.


>> That's
 my
 opinion.
 So,
 she
 doesn't
 want


to
 grow
 and
 she
 doesn't
 work
 hard


enough.
 So,
 she
 just
 A
 and
 B
 together.


Just
 one.
 She's
 not
 gonna
 get
 any
 bigger


>> unless
 she
 try


>> and
 I
 change
 my
 opinion.


>> Yeah,
 I'll
 give
 her
 a
 three.
 I
 think
 she


uh
 have
 a
 certain,
 you
 know,


um
 exposure
 to
 the
 African-American


voters
 and
 uh
 people
 with
 color.
 So,


that
 coalition
 will
 still
 come
 and
 vote


for
 her.
 Uh
 I
 do
 agree
 with
 Yan
 Bing


like
 she
 had
 a
 hard
 time
 uh
 you
 know


even
 winning
 the
 Biden's
 coalition
 you


know
 apparently
 she
 lost
 to
 those
 seven


swing
 state.
 So


Josh
 Shapiro
 professor


>> uh
 I
 will
 give
 him
 a
 three
 because
 I


don't
 think
 he
 gets
 out
 of
 the


Democratic


uh
 primaries.
 if
 he
 would
 get
 out
 of
 the


Democratic
 primaries
 and
 become
 the


candidate,


>> he
 might
 have
 the
 best
 chance
 of
 all
 of


them
 to
 broaden
 the
 coalition
 and
 to


Trump
 voters.


>> So,
 if
 he
 I
 I
 give
 him
 a
 three
 because
 I


think
 he
 will
 have
 a
 hard
 time
 getting


out
 of
 the
 Democratic
 primaries.
 If
 he


does,
 he's
 going
 to
 grow
 the
 coalition.


>> Yeah.


I'll
 give
 him
 a
 three
 because
 he
 talk


very
 good.
 I
 think
 the
 biggest
 problem


just
 is
 real.


The
 biggest
 problem
 if
 somehow
 he
 can


figure
 it
 out
 then
 the
 number
 will
 get


bigger.


>> Yeah.
 Um
 I'm
 going
 to
 give
 him
 a
 four.
 I


think
 he
 is
 actually
 quite
 attractive
 to


the
 middle
 voters
 like
 uh


>> whoever
 I'm
 not
 I'm
 not
 just
 thinking


about
 like
 you
 know
 he
 is
 definitely
 in


the
 Democrat
 party
 he
 will
 have
 some


trouble
 with
 a
 progressive
 because
 of


the
 uh
 Israel
 Palestinian
 issue
 but
 I


think
 he
 definitely
 shows
 people
 the


possibility
 of
 finding
 someone
 who
 care


about
 policy
 instead
 of
 all
 the
 drama


and
 the
 name
 calling
 and
 personal


attack.
 I
 think
 he
 could
 become
 uh
 you


know
 stable
 for
 those
 voters
 like
 to


vote
 for
 uh
 in
 2028.


All
 right.
 Money
 and
 machinery
 for
 Gavin


Newsome.


>> Oh,
 I
 think
 he
 would
 have
 to
 be
 a
 four.


I
 think
 he
 will
 have
 big
 donors
 in


support
 of
 him.
 I
 think
 he
 has
 a
 strong


staff.
 I
 think
 he
 would
 he
 would
 tap


into
 sort
 of
 the
 Democratic
 machine


quite
 well.
 I
 think
 I
 would
 say
 four.


>> You
 know what
 I
 mean?
 What
 do
 you
 think?


>> Yeah.
 The
 same
 reason
 four.
 There's
 no


question
 about
 it.


>> Mhm.


>> I'm
 going
 him
 give
 him
 a
 five.
 I
 think


he
 is
 going
 to
 raise
 a
 lot
 of
 money.


He's
 from
 California.
 He
 very
 rich.
 He


have
 very
 rich
 donors
 in
 Democrat
 party


and
 uh
 he
 also
 have
 a
 strong
 network.
 So


I
 think
 he
 will
 be
 raising
 a
 lot
 of


money
 in
 uh
 2028.


>> Yeah.


>> Accessor


>> I
 think
 I
 would
 give
 her
 a
 three.
 I


think
 if
 you
 compare
 her
 to
 someone
 like


Newsome
 it's
 just
 uh
 not
 as
 strong.
 I


think
 she
 would
 have


the
 support
 she
 would
 get
 though,
 these


would
 be
 passionate
 supporters.
 So,
 I


think
 her
 machinery
 could
 be
 the
 most


aggressive
 and
 and
 the
 most
 loyal


uh
 group
 maybe
 we've
 ever
 seen.
 But
 it's


the
 money
 I
 don't
 think
 she
 would
 get
 on


par
 with
 say
 a
 news.


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 what
 do
 you
 think?
 three


cuz
 she
 always
 talking
 about
 hating


billionaires.
 So,
 she
 probably
 can't
 get


too
 much
 billionaires.


That's
 why
 she
 gets
 a
 three.


>> Actually,
 I
 don't
 agree
 with
 you
 guys.
 I


think
 AOC
 is
 at
 least
 a
 four.
 The
 reason


is
 like
 I
 I
 don't
 know if
 you
 guys
 track


her
 numbers.
 She
 raised
 a
 lot
 of
 money


as
 a
 a
 house
 member
 as
 a
 you
 know
 uh
 as


her
 current
 stage
 she
 raised
 more
 than


the
 person
 who
 are
 ranked
 much
 higher


than
 her
 in
 the
 Democrat
 party.
 That


shows
 her
 capability
 of
 raising
 money.


You
 know
 as
 mid
 of
 2025
 she
 already


raised
 15


million
 dollars.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 That's
 a
 wonderful
 point.
 I


guess
 what
 I'm
 thinking
 is
 the
 bigger


donors
 are
 going
 to
 have
 to
 make


choices.
 They're
 going
 to
 spread
 it


around
 some,
 but
 there's
 I
 mean,
 they'll


hedge
 their
 bets,
 but
 they're
 still


going
 to
 go
 all
 in
 for
 some
 candidates,


and
 I'm
 not
 sure
 she
 would
 be
 perceived


as
 electable


to
 get
 the
 kind
 of
 money
 that
 say
 a


Newsome
 would
 get.
 I
 mean,
 that
 that's


my
 rationale
 there.
 You're
 right.
 She's


very
 good
 at
 raising
 money.
 I
 think
 for


me,
 uh,
 she's
 the
 Democratic
 VP


candidate.
 That
 that
 that's
 where
 I
 see


her.


>> Mhm.


For
 Mayor
 Pete,


>> I
 think
 Mayor
 Pete
 would
 be
 maybe
 a
 two


here.
 I
 just
 don't
 know.


You
 know,
 maybe
 that's
 a
 little
 harsh,


but
 I'm
 not
 sure
 he
 would.


I
 don't
 know.
 I
 I
 I
 think
 he's
 a
 good


candidate.
 Uh,
 two,
 maybe
 a
 little


harsh,
 but
 again,
 I
 think
 there's
 a


comparative
 process
 here.
 This
 one
 more


than
 any
 is
 about
 comparing
 the


candidates
 and
 where
 he
 would
 rank
 in


terms
 of
 uh
 and
 I
 the
 the
 point
 you
 made


about
 Newsome
 was
 very
 very
 strong.
 Uh


there's
 only
 so
 much
 of
 the
 big
 money
 to


go
 around
 and
 uh
 I'm
 not
 sure
 he
 would


be
 getting
 the
 biggest
 chunk
 of
 it.
 I


guess
 I
 would
 say


>> yeah,
 what
 do
 you
 think?
 I'll
 give
 a


three
 with
 my
 limited
 knowledge
 about


him
 is
 based
 on
 my
 research
 research


right
 now
 I
 saw
 him
 attending
 podcast


quite
 a
 lot
 compared
 all
 the
 other


candidate
 I
 know
 Gavin
 News
 started
 a


podcast
 but
 he
 didn't
 do
 it
 well
 I
 think


uh
 if
 this
 mayor
 P
 can
 do
 a
 lot
 more


podcast
 you
 raise
 a
 lot
 of
 money


>> okay


>> maybe


>> yeah
 uh
 I
 think
 I
 think
 mayor
 P
 is
 a


three
 uh
 I
 think
 like
 Gavin
 News
 and
 him


Kevin
 a
 lot
 of
 more
 money
 so
 those
 voter


yeah
 I
 agree
 with
 professor
 I
 think
 he


or
 AOC
 are
 really
 good
 vice
 president


candidate
 to
 you
 know
 to
 unite
 the
 group


that
 you
 did
 not
 cover
 like
 those


particular
 identity
 politics
 or
 certain


progressive
 wing
 you
 try
 to
 kind
 of
 lure


them
 into
 your
 coalition
 that's
 the
 way


to
 go.
 Uh,
 but
 as
 a
 main
 candidate,


that's
 going
 to
 be
 tough.
 Camela
 Harris.


>> Um,
 I
 would
 give
 her
 a
 three.
 I
 I
 think


she
 will
 still
 have
 a
 fair
 number
 of


supporters.
 She
 is


the
 person
 who
 has
 run
 a
 national


campaign
 and
 did
 it
 recently.


She
 would
 have
 all
 the
 ties
 into
 the


various
 states
 that
 is
 not
 to
 be


undersold.
 I
 mean,
 that's
 significant.


Um,
 but
 and
 and
 let's
 not
 let's
 keep
 in


mind,
 too,
 that
 in
 some
 ways,
 we're


talking
 about
 how
 things
 start.


People
 are
 going
 to
 start
 to
 go
 with


front
 runners.
 So,
 what
 it
 might
 look


like
 at
 the
 beginning
 is
 not
 necessarily


going
 to
 be
 how
 it
 plays
 out.
 People


will
 jump
 on
 a
 bandwagon.
 I
 also
 am
 not


convinced
 that
 the
 Democratic
 candidate


is
 one
 of
 our
 five
 here.
 Uh
 I
 I
 think


there's
 a
 good
 chance
 that
 it's
 going
 to


be
 a
 governor
 from
 one
 of
 the
 other


states.
 Uh
 not
 Shapiro,
 but
 someone


else.
 Maybe
 Kentucky,
 maybe
 North


Carolina.
 Um
 maybe
 Michigan.
 I
 I
 just


feel
 that
 it's
 probably
 going
 to
 be
 a


governor.
 I
 think
 it's
 going
 to
 be


someone
 without
 a
 whole
 lot
 of
 baggage


that
 appeal
 to
 broad
 constituencies.


So
 I
 think
 all
 you
 know
 what
 we're
 doing


is
 and
 I
 think
 we're
 doing
 I
 think
 right


now
 if
 you
 say
 who
 are
 the
 top
 five


candidates
 I
 would
 say
 this
 is
 is
 a
 very


good
 list.
 I'm
 not
 convinced
 though
 of


the
 Democratic
 candidates
 one
 of
 these


five.


>> Yeah
 I
 agree.
 I
 think
 right
 now
 I'm
 just


picking
 the
 front
 runners
 but
 like
 again


this
 is
 like
 way
 too
 early
 right?
 It's


like
 three
 years
 ahead.
 A
 lot
 of
 things


can
 change.


>> Barack
 Obama
 came
 out
 of
 nowhere
 in
 2008


right?


Yeah.


>> Yeah.
 So,
 I
 agree.
 Yellowing,
 what do


you
 think?


>> If
 this
 based
 on
 2024,
 I'll
 give
 her
 a


five.


>> Yeah.


>> I
 was
 watching
 Trump's
 video
 and
 I
 got


Camaro
 Harris
 ad
 about
 donating.


>> But


it's
 going
 to
 be
 one.
 I
 don't
 think


anybody
 will
 give
 her
 money.


>> Yeah.


>> All
 the
 money
 is
 gone
 and
 she's
 even


owning
 some
 money.
 So,


>> well,
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 wonder
 how
 she


spent
 the
 last
 money.


>> Yeah.
 For
 this
 one,
 it'll
 be
 nobody


waiting
 to
 give
 her
 money.
 It's
 like
 you


owe
 money
 and
 you
 don't
 pay
 back.
 No


result.
 It's
 over.


>> Yeah,
 I
 agree.
 I'll
 give
 her
 two.
 I
 just


have
 a
 hard
 time
 like
 for
 those
 big


donor
 who
 gave
 her
 a
 lot
 of
 money
 in


2024,
 open
 up
 the
 wallet
 and
 donate
 to


her
 again.
 That's
 going
 to
 be
 tough.
 Uh


Josh
 Shapiro,
 professor.


>> I
 I
 think
 he
 will
 have
 the
 ability
 to
 to


get
 some
 money
 going.
 I'm
 I'm
 gonna
 give


him
 a
 four.
 I
 think
 Shapiro
 will
 have


some
 big
 hitters
 backing
 him


>> and
 u
 he's
 he's
 streetwise.


He's
 an
 astute
 politician.


He
 will
 be
 able
 to
 tap
 into
 the


Democratic
 machine
 effectively.


>> Yeah.
 You
 know
 what
 I
 mean?
 What
 do
 you


think?


>> Oh,
 he
 automatically
 get
 the
 AP
 pack


money,
 right?


Not
 how
 it
 works.
 Pretty
 sure
 he
 can
 get


money.


>> Yeah,
 I
 I'll
 give
 him
 a
 four
 as
 well.
 I


think
 he
 will
 he'll
 build
 a
 strong
 uh


money
 machine,
 you
 know.
 He


>> he
 elect
 for
 the
 governor
 twice,
 right?


Like,
 so
 he
 is
 that
 twice?
 I
 think
 he


already
 did.


>> No,
 he
 he
 was
 elected
 once.
 Oh,
 he
 will


be
 running
 for
 re-election
 sometime.


>> Yeah,
 that's
 correct.
 That's
 correct.


>> Yeah.


>> He
 was
 attorney
 general
 in
 the
 state


prior
 to
 that.


>> Oh,
 yeah.
 Okay.
 Yeah.
 But
 I
 do
 think
 he


can
 uh
 connect
 well
 with
 all
 the
 big


donors.
 So,
 because
 he
 is
 viewed
 as,
 you


know,
 your
 Democrat
 establishment.


Uh
 debate
 skills.
 Professor,


>> I
 would
 give
 Nome
 a
 four.
 I
 think
 he's


uh
 media
 savvy.


I
 think
 he
 will
 be
 well
 rehearsed
 and


well
 coached


>> and
 I
 think
 he
 will
 handle
 the
 media


effectively.


>> Yeah,


hit
 on
 me.


>> I'll
 give
 him
 a
 three.
 I
 don't
 think
 he


can
 handle
 the
 the
 news
 about
 his
 he


cheated
 on
 his
 best
 friend
 because
 he's


like
 I
 have
 no
 good
 response.
 And
 the


other
 the
 other
 time
 he
 was
 debating
 the


desentes
 desentes
 was
 showing
 a
 poop
 map


of
 San
 Francisco.
 He
 didn't
 say


anything.
 He's
 like,
 "Oh,
 I
 don't
 know


what
 to
 say."
 He
 He
 need
 to
 be
 a
 a


little
 bit
 more
 like
 Trump,
 like
 a


little
 bit
 shameless,
 I
 guess,
 or
 appear


to
 be
 reformed.
 Like,
 I'm
 complete


change,
 man.
 That's
 that's
 not
 me.
 I
 I


don't
 I
 don't
 cheat
 anymore
 kind
 of


deal.
 I
 guess


>> if
 he
 doesn't
 do
 that,
 he
 probably
 not


going
 to
 win
 any
 debate.


>> I'll
 give
 him
 a
 four.
 I
 think
 he
 speak


pretty
 well.
 He's
 sharp
 and
 uh
 I
 think


he
 could
 put
 on
 a
 show.
 He's
 still


relative
 younger,
 you
 know,
 than
 the


last
 round
 of
 the
 candidate.
 You
 have


like
 a
 70
 years
 old
 debating
 80
 years


old,
 right?
 It's
 going
 to
 be
 quite
 a


different
 situation
 in
 the
 2028.
 I
 give


him
 four.


>> I
 think
 that's
 kind
 of
 good
 thing
 though


because
 when
 when
 the
 other
 guy


mentioned
 he
 cheated
 on
 his
 best
 best


friend,
 he
 just
 looked
 very
 guilty.
 It's


not
 like,
 oh,
 it's
 okay.
 No,
 no
 big


deal.
 He
 look
 he
 look
 guilty.
 He
 look


like
 just
 regretting
 in
 front
 of


everybody.
 So
 I
 kind
 of
 like
 that
 kind


of.


>> Okay.


>> So
 you
 think
 that
 shows
 some
 of
 the


humanity?


>> Yeah.


>> Yeah.


>> She's
 like
 maybe
 maybe
 a
 good
 guy,
 you


know.


>> Yeah.


AOC
 professor.


>> I'm
 going
 to
 give
 my
 first
 five
 of
 the


evening.


>> I
 think
 she's
 very
 skilled.
 I
 think
 she


I
 just
 love
 how
 she
 rebutts
 arguments.
 I


think
 she
 can
 come
 back


uh
 she's
 um
 well-versed,
 I
 mean
 well


informed
 and
 I
 just
 think
 she
 has
 a
 way


of
 getting
 to
 root
 arguments
 and


refuting
 attacks
 and
 other
 positions.


She's
 a
 skilled
 debater.


>> Mhm.


You
 know what
 I
 mean?


>> I
 give
 her
 a
 four.


I
 I
 think
 uh
 it's
 kind
 of
 like
 strong


when
 she
 when
 she's
 debating
 cuz
 like


avoid
 the
 topic
 that's
 not
 good
 for
 her


and
 just
 keep
 going
 at
 whatever
 she


think
 is
 right.


>> Mhm.


>> It
 works,
 I
 think.


>> Yeah,
 I'll
 give
 her
 a
 five
 as
 well.
 I


watched
 the
 Netflix
 documentary
 about


her.
 she
 was
 like
 debating
 uh
 a
 top


ranked
 Democrat
 um
 incumbent
 and
 she
 did


very
 well
 in
 that
 debate.
 So
 apparently


she
 put
 a
 lot
 of
 work
 and
 she's
 very


young
 so
 your
 brain
 functions
 much


faster
 than
 you
 know
 older
 people.


>> Yes.


>> Yeah.
 So
 I
 give
 him
 a
 Yeah.
 You
 know,
 I


feel
 I
 feel
 the
 age
 burden
 as
 well,


professor.
 Like,
 don't
 don't
 get
 me


wrong,
 you
 know.


May
 I
 pit
 professor?


>> Well,
 given
 that
 I
 I
 lumped
 him
 with
 AOC


earlier,
 I
 think
 I
 have
 to
 give
 him
 a


five
 as
 well.
 I
 I
 see
 I
 I
 even
 think


back
 to
 when
 he
 ran
 for
 president
 last


time
 in
 the
 debate
 format.


He's
 very
 good.
 Mhm.


>> He
 has


media
 savvy.


He
 He
 maintains
 his
 composure.
 He's
 not


one
 that
 gets
 rattled.
 And
 I
 think
 that


whole
 grace
 under
 fire
 is
 part
 of
 how


we're
 going
 to
 be
 judging
 all
 these


candidates.
 And
 I
 think
 that's
 something


he
 has.


>> I
 agree.
 Yan
 Bing,
 what
 do
 you
 think?


>> KBY,
 Professor
 Asar
 also
 look
 at
 the


podcast.
 He
 did
 a
 threehour
 podcast
 with


the
 flagrant.
 I
 I
 think
 in
 the
 future
 if


you
 run
 for
 president
 you
 have
 to
 do
 a


threehour
 conversation


then
 I
 can
 see
 who
 you
 are.
 You
 can't


really
 hide
 for
 three
 hours.


>> Yeah,
 I'll
 give
 him
 a
 five
 as
 well.
 He


is
 really
 good
 debater.
 He
 went
 on
 Fox


and
 debating
 all
 the
 conservative
 uh


talking
 hats.
 That's
 uh
 impressive.
 I


don't
 think
 Camel
 Harris
 can
 do
 that.


So,


>> what
 do
 you
 think
 about
 Cameron
 Harris


for
 this
 uh
 part?


>> It's
 hard.
 I'm
 between
 a
 three
 and
 a


four
 with
 her.
 I
 think
 of
 her
 debate


performance
 against
 Trump,
 which
 I


thought
 was
 very
 strong.
 Uh
 but
 it
 was,


you
 know,
 it
 was
 it
 wasn't
 the


predictive
 of
 what
 was
 going
 to
 happen


in
 the
 campaign
 and
 how
 she
 used
 the


media.
 So,
 I
 guess
 if
 I'm
 pushed
 to
 it,


I'd
 probably
 give
 her
 the
 three
 rather


than
 the
 four.


>> Uh
 just
 because
 I
 think
 I
 I
 would
 hope


she
 would
 have
 learned
 from
 last
 time,


>> but
 uh
 that
 was
 certainly
 um


disappointing
 in
 many
 ways
 last
 time.


>> Oh,
 yeah.
 I
 agree.
 You
 know,
 I
 mean,


what
 do
 you
 think?


>> I
 think
 it's
 three.
 I
 don't
 think
 she's


a
 bad
 debater.


>> She
 just
 need
 to
 be
 scripted.


>> Oh,
 yeah.


>> Need
 to
 be
 super
 prepared.
 If
 you
 call


her
 off
 guard,
 she's
 going
 to
 be
 like


talking
 nonsense.


>> Yeah,
 I
 agree
 with
 you
 guys.
 I'll
 give


her
 a
 three
 as
 well.
 I
 think
 she
 did


well
 in
 the
 Trump
 debate,
 but
 the


problem
 is
 like
 she
 her
 media
 uh
 media


skill
 is
 not
 that
 great.
 She
 fumbled


that
 easy
 question
 and
 she
 doesn't
 want


to
 be
 on
 those
 uh
 podcasts
 for
 like
 uh


you
 know
 those
 right-wing
 ones.
 She
 only


go
 to
 the
 friendly
 ones.
 So
 that
 could


be
 a
 be
 a
 problem,
 you
 know.


Uh
 Josh
 Shapiro,
 professor,


>> I'm
 between
 a
 four
 and
 a
 five
 here.
 I


would
 probably
 give
 him
 a
 five.
 And
 why


it's
 not
 a
 resounding
 five
 is
 I
 think
 he


has
 to
 temper
 the
 ambition
 part
 of
 who


he
 is
 a
 bit
 and
 add
 a
 little
 bit
 more


the
 humility
 that
 comes
 from
 the
 heart.


I
 think
 he
 can
 be


too
 much
 of
 a
 grandstander
 at
 times,


perceived
 as
 too
 ambitious,


and
 that,
 you
 know,
 while
 he
 may
 have


just
 played,
 I
 personally
 think
 he
 would


have
 taken
 that
 vice
 presidential
 slot


if
 offered.
 Um,


so
 I
 think
 he's
 going
 to
 have
 to
 temper


some
 of
 his,
 uh,
 natural
 tendencies.


>> Mhm.


You
 know
 what
 I
 mean?
 What
 do
 you
 think?


I'll
 give
 him
 a
 four.
 I
 think
 he's
 very


good
 at
 talking
 whatever
 topic,
 but
 I


just
 got
 this
 feeling
 that
 he's
 kind
 of


fake
 and
 it's
 like
 I
 don't
 know
 how
 you


get
 the
 feeling
 out
 of
 people.
 So,
 just


my
 personal
 feeling.


>> So,
 four
 because
 that
 feeling.


>> Yeah,
 I'm
 going
 to
 give
 him
 a
 five.
 I


think
 he


did
 very
 well
 in
 debate
 and
 uh
 he
 could


definitely
 go
 on
 those
 podcast.
 So
 uh


also
 I
 think
 he
 want
 to
 adopt
 the
 new


media
 format
 like
 Tik
 Tok.
 I
 think
 he


could
 be
 relatable
 as
 well.
 So
 I
 give


him
 a
 five.
 Uh
 liability
 professor
 for


Gavin
 Newsome.


>> Yeah.
 Before
 I
 say
 that,
 I'm
 gonna
 do
 a


little
 plug
 for
 something
 I
 have
 coming


up.
 So
 I
 have
 my
 own
 YouTube
 channel.


It's
 Professor
 RJ
 Plleone.


>> Yeah.


>> Communication
 Excellence.
 And
 I
 hope


people
 would
 consider
 a
 free


subscription
 to
 that.


>> I've
 done
 uh
 20
 or
 21
 videos
 so
 far


political.
 Some
 of
 them
 I'm
 doing
 and


I'm
 going
 to
 be
 doing
 one
 in
 the
 next


couple
 of
 days
 on
 how
 to
 rebrand
 the


Democratic
 party
 and
 how
 to
 limit
 sort


of
 the
 risk
 that
 may
 be
 uh
 present
 in
 in


the
 party
 in
 general
 as
 the
 brand
 seems


to
 be
 on
 the
 downward
 slope
 and
 how
 to


recapture
 some
 of
 it.
 So
 enough
 of
 the


plug
 uh
 let
 me
 uh
 answer
 your
 question.


I
 don't
 see
 uh
 there's
 some
 risk
 with


news
 and
 there's
 some
 risk
 with
 all
 I
 I


would
 say
 so


so
 is
 a
 high
 here
 remind
 me
 is
 a
 high
 a


poor
 rating
 what
 is
 is
 it
 still
 the
 same


one
 to
 five
 scale
 or
 have
 we
 flipped
 the


one
 to
 five
 meaning
 at
 this
 point


>> so
 here
 liability
 five
 is
 very
 high
 risk


>> that's
 what
 I
 thought
 yeah


>> all
 right
 so
 for
 for
 Newsome
 I
 would
 put


him
 at
 a
 three


>> I
 think
 there's
 risk
 here
 I
 think
 we


kind
 of
 know
 who
 he
 is
 and
 rightly
 we've


been
 pointing
 out
 some
 of
 his


communication
 challenges
 or
 his
 sort
 of


rhetorical
 pressure
 points
 he's
 going
 to


have
 to
 have
 well-crafted
 responses
 for


but
 I
 would
 see
 his
 liability
 to
 be
 sort


of
 mid-range.


>> Mhm.


Yam,
 what
 do
 you
 think?


>> Yeah,
 same thing.
 Three
 I
 all
 I
 hear
 is


he's
 not
 faithful
 to
 his
 wife.
 He
 didn't


manage
 California
 too
 good.
 And
 I
 guess


that's
 not
 super
 bad.


I
 mean,
 it's
 bad,
 but
 it's
 not
 super


bad,
 I
 guess.


>> Yeah,
 I'll
 give
 him
 a
 three
 as
 well.
 I


think
 he
 going
 to
 get
 some
 uh,
 you
 know,


criticism
 of
 how
 he
 handled
 the
 fire
 in


California
 and
 how
 he
 use
 all
 the
 money


there.
 There's
 definitely
 like
 people


complaining
 about
 his
 uh,
 governing
 in


California.
 So,
 uh,
 it
 definitely
 has


some
 liability.
 Well,


>> very
 good
 point
 about
 the
 fire
 though


and
 how
 that
 money
 was
 handled
 there.


There
 a
 lot
 of
 Californians
 are
 outraged


and
 that
 would
 become
 a
 major
 story.


You're
 you're
 absolutely
 right.


>> Exactly.


>> Um,
 I
 would
 say
 four
 here
 just
 because


of
 her
 youth,
 uh,
 somewhat
 inexperience.


See,
 that's
 why
 I
 I'm
 leaning
 toward
 a


governor
 here.
 You
 know,
 a
 lot
 of
 people


see


the
 Senate
 as
 just
 a
 a
 staging
 ground


for
 all
 those
 who
 aspire
 to
 be


president.


Congress
 is
 so,


you
 know,
 performative.
 It's
 just
 almost


a
 joke
 now.
 Um,
 so
 I
 think
 AOC
 would


have
 there
 there'd
 be
 a
 certain
 risk
 to


her
 candidacy.
 Yes.


>> You
 know,
 I
 mean,
 what
 do
 you
 think?


>> I
 would
 say
 two.


>> Mhm.
 So,
 I
 don't
 see
 any
 really
 like


horrible
 news
 about
 her.
 Just
 she's
 not


very
 experienced.
 She's
 not
 very


political
 savvy,
 I
 guess,
 compared
 to


other
 candidate.
 But
 I
 don't
 hear
 any


really
 bad
 news
 about
 her.


>> Mhm.


>> Well,
 she
 would
 be
 uh
 not
 to
 she
 would


be
 by
 far
 the
 youngest
 person
 ever


elected.
 I
 don't
 think
 we've
 had
 anyone


in
 their
 30s


ever.
 and
 she
 would
 just
 turn
 35.
 So
 I


do
 think
 the
 risk
 in
 itself
 is
 an
 issue


for
 me.
 The
 age
 the
 age.


>> Okay.
 Yeah.
 For
 me
 I
 think
 the
 liability


I'll
 give
 her
 a
 two
 as
 well.
 The
 reason


I
 say
 that
 is
 like
 you
 know
 she
 does
 not


take
 the
 big
 corporations
 money.
 I
 don't


think
 she
 going
 to
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 scandal


the
 other
 candidate
 may
 have
 like
 you


know
 go
 to
 those
 paid
 speeches
 and
 like


what
 Hillary
 Clinton
 uh
 was
 facing
 at


that
 time.
 So
 I
 think
 from
 that


perspective
 um
 he
 she
 would
 have
 less


risk
 of
 those
 liabilities.


Uh
 professor
 for
 pit
 what
 do
 you
 think?


>> I
 would
 say
 a
 three.
 I
 see
 him
 similar


to
 to
 Newsome
 where
 we
 pretty
 much
 know


who
 he
 is.
 There's
 risk
 in
 diving
 deep


into
 his
 record
 in
 South
 Bend.
 There's


risk
 because
 of
 who
 he
 is,
 which
 is
 I


think
 unfortunate.
 Uh
 I
 don't
 share
 that


perspective
 that
 that
 should
 be
 a
 major


issue,
 but
 I
 I
 think
 it
 will
 be
 one.


It's
 almost
 like,
 you
 know,
 one
 of
 my


all-time
 favorite
 politicians
 was
 Adlay


Stevenson,
 and
 back
 then
 a
 major
 reason


why
 he
 didn't
 get
 elected
 was
 he
 was


divorced.
 So
 these
 kind
 of
 things
 about


one's
 personal
 life
 of
 have
 often


cropped
 in
 and
 uh
 I
 think
 there's
 risk


with
 Mayor
 Pete,
 too.


>> Wow.
 Look
 at
 that
 age.
 Like
 you
 have
 a


candidate
 who
 didn't
 got
 elected
 because


he's
 divorced


>> and
 now
 you
 have
 the
 president
 who
 have


all


>> how
 times
 have
 changed.


>> Yeah.
 Uh
 that's
 fascinating.
 Uh
 Elami,


what
 do
 you
 think?


>> Um
 based
 on
 what
 I
 heard
 so
 far,
 I
 say


four.
 I
 think
 being
 a
 homosexual


probably
 a
 very
 big
 liability.


Meaning
 I
 I
 I
 can
 understand
 it's


totally
 okay
 for
 someone
 like
 pay
 to
 be


president
 but
 probably
 not
 according
 to


a
 lot
 of
 right
 leaning
 person.


>> Yeah.


>> So
 that's
 a
 huge
 liability
 I
 guess.


>> Yeah.
 Uh
 I
 give
 him
 a
 three
 as
 well.
 I


think
 just
 like
 you
 guys
 what
 what
 you


just
 mentioned
 um
 his
 identity
 politics


could
 be
 a
 problem
 and
 uh
 you
 know
 uh


there
 once
 he
 become
 the
 target
 like


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 opposition
 research
 and


something
 could
 come
 out
 you
 know
 he's


you
 know
 a
 typical
 elite
 candidate
 and


he
 could
 have
 problems
 come
 Harris


uh


>> I
 would
 say


I
 would
 say
 three.
 I
 I
 um


you
 know
 I
 just
 don't
 know
 if
 she's


going
 to
 generate
 I
 I
 think
 the
 comments


we
 made
 about
 uh
 fundraising
 are
 real.


Uh
 she
 had
 such


a
 a
 campaign
 war
 chest
 that
 just


they
 they
 had
 campaign
 strategies
 that


were
 never
 implemented.
 I
 just
 I'm
 just


not
 sure.


I'm
 not
 I
 I
 think
 she's
 been
 scrutinized


uh
 fairly
 closely.
 I
 don't
 think
 there


are
 going
 to
 be
 any
 surprises,


but
 I
 do
 think
 there
 would
 be
 a
 certain


amount
 of
 risk
 to
 her
 candidacy.


>> Mhm.


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 what
 do
 you
 think?


>> I
 guess
 I
 have
 to
 uh
 stay
 consistent.


Five.


>> Five.
 Okay.
 because
 everything
 she
 did


in
 the
 past
 becomes
 a
 liability
 because


when
 you
 hire
 somebody
 you
 look
 at
 the


past
 performance


she
 failed
 very
 badly.
 Would
 you
 would


you
 pick
 someone
 like
 that
 to
 have
 a


second
 chance?
 It's
 very
 hard.
 So
 for


that
 alone
 it's
 a
 five
 level
 liability.


>> Yeah
 I
 think
 I
 have
 a
 different
 inter


interpretation
 of
 the
 liability
 uh
 than


you
 guys.
 I
 I
 think
 more
 about
 like
 do


you
 have
 any
 political
 scandal?
 Do
 you


have
 any
 major
 issues
 that
 going
 to


cause
 a
 certain
 block
 of
 the
 voters
 like


not
 coming
 out
 to
 vote
 for
 you?
 For
 that


part,
 I
 I
 will
 give
 her
 a
 two
 because


from
 last
 cycle,
 the
 Trump


administration
 was
 like
 the
 Trump
 team


was
 uh
 attacking
 her
 on
 some
 of
 the


issues.
 I
 don't
 see
 those
 are
 big


liabilities.
 I
 think
 the
 reason
 she
 lost


is
 not
 because
 of
 the
 liability
 she
 has.


Like
 it's
 all
 because
 of
 the
 other
 stuff


she
 didn't
 do
 well.
 She
 did
 not
 cut


clean
 from
 Biden
 and
 she
 inherited
 a
 lot


of
 u
 you
 know
 the
 baggage
 from
 the
 the


incumbent
 administration
 because
 that


current
 president
 is
 not
 popular.
 So


um


>> see
 I
 view
 it
 in
 part
 that
 is
 what
 what


is
 the
 risk
 to
 the
 down
 ticket
 in
 the


party
 too.


>> So
 I
 think
 some
 of
 you
 know
 sometime
 the


head
 of
 the
 ticket
 can
 really
 cause


senators
 to
 lose
 congressmen
 to


>> Oh
 yeah.
 Yeah.


>> And
 so
 I
 see
 that
 I
 in
 this
 risk


question.
 That's
 part
 of
 how
 I'm
 I'm


interpreting
 it
 too.
 Mhm.


>> Um


>> I
 I
 understand
 as
 something
 that
 will


affect
 your
 election.
 It's
 not
 something


you
 do
 right
 now.
 It's
 something
 in
 the


past
 or
 something
 you
 cannot
 change
 your


sexual
 orientation,
 your
 your
 inity,


that
 kind
 of
 liability.


>> I
 guess


>> so
 Josh
 Shapiro
 professor


>> I
 would
 say
 it
 too.
 I
 think
 there's


um


I
 don't


if
 Shapiro
 would
 be
 able
 to
 get
 through


the
 primary
 process,
 I
 don't
 think
 there


going
 to
 be
 many
 surprises
 with
 him.
 I


think
 he
 would
 be
 well
 positioned
 as
 a


leader
 of
 the
 ticket
 uh
 to
 carry
 it


through.
 I
 think
 he
 could
 uh
 appeal
 to


independent
 voters.
 Um
 but
 there's


there's
 certainly
 some
 risk
 in
 in
 him
 in


this
 process,
 you
 know.
 Yeah,
 for
 sure.


>> Okay.
 You
 know
 what
 I
 mean?
 What
 do
 you


think?


>> I'll
 say
 a
 four.
 So
 when
 I
 think
 about


this
 person,
 it's
 automatically
 comes
 to


Israel.
 So
 that
 alone
 is
 like
 a
 very


very
 big
 liability.
 I
 don't
 know
 how
 you


going
 to
 change
 that.


Okay.
 Uh
 I'll
 give
 him
 a
 two
 as
 well.
 Uh


I
 just
 don't
 think
 there
 will
 be
 a
 lot


of
 uh
 political
 scandal
 against
 him.
 He


seems
 like
 your
 uh
 typical
 u
 midway


>> mhm


>> politician
 who
 have
 a
 big
 exposure
 to


the
 middle
 ground
 uh
 voters
 who
 doesn't


like
 the
 extremist
 part
 candidate
 from


both
 parties.
 So


>> yeah,
 I
 gave
 him
 a
 two.
 All
 right,
 I


think
 we
 finished
 all
 the
 voting
 here.


Let's
 look
 at
 the
 weighted
 basis
 like


the
 final
 score
 uh
 normalized
 scoring.


Uh
 the
 top
 one
 is
 Gavin
 Newsome
 72


average
 score.
 The
 next
 is
 Josh
 Shapiro.


The
 third
 is
 AOC
 Maya
 Pit
 and
 Kamela


Harris.


So
 yeah,


>> that's
 a
 pretty
 good
 ranking
 actually


for
 me.
 I
 you
 know


>> do
 you
 think
 we
 see
 a
 Gavin
 Newsome
 and


J
 Shapiro
 like
 ticket?
 That
 would
 be


like
 two
 alpha
 males,
 right?
 Like


>> Yeah,
 I
 I
 don't
 see
 that.
 I
 don't
 see


that.


>> Yeah,


>> that
 that
 would
 be
 they
 they
 wouldn't


jive
 together.
 That
 that
 I
 just
 don't


think
 so.
 And
 I
 I
 I
 think
 two
 two
 white


males
 for
 the
 Democrats
 would
 be
 very


difficult.


>> I
 think
 uh
 Gavin
 Newsen
 Acc


Shapiro
 Acc.


>> Yeah.


>> Yeah.
 Shapiro
 AOC.
 I
 could
 see
 Gavin


Newsome.
 I
 don't
 know
 with
 a
 It
 could
 be


seen
 as
 just
 two
 left.


Oh,
 maybe
 Gavin
 Newsome
 was
 Mayor
 Pit
 or


other
 candidate,
 right?
 Like
 we
 have
 a


second
 tier
 candidate.


>> There's
 a
 lot
 of
 folks
 that
 could,
 you


know,
 I
 I
 also
 think
 of
 this
 time
 as
 I


think
 I
 mentioned
 our
 last
 one,
 we
 got


Jimmy
 Carter
 after
 Richard
 Nixon.
 Carter


had
 4%
 name
 recognition
 at
 the
 beginning


of
 that
 campaign.
 I
 think
 some
 of
 these


governors
 that
 are
 getting
 in
 the
 news


primarily
 because
 of
 threats
 to
 go
 into


their
 states
 with
 National
 Guard.
 I


think
 one
 of
 them
 could
 emerge
 as
 a


player
 here
 and
 then
 you
 see
 who
 goes


through
 the
 process.
 I
 mean,
 at least


the
 Democrats
 will
 have
 a
 process
 this


go
 around.
 They're
 going
 to
 vet
 the


candidates
 and
 you
 know
 we're
 going
 to


have
 a
 more
 in
 some
 ways
 legitimate


candidate
 because
 they've
 come
 through


the
 primary
 process
 and
 have
 won
 the


votes
 through
 the
 primary
 process.
 So
 I


think
 there'd
 be
 more
 support
 for


whoever
 it
 is.


>> I
 agree.
 I
 think
 u
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 like


really
 strong
 governors
 there
 but


they're
 just
 not
 well
 known,
 you
 know,


like
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 media
 coverage.
 But


maybe
 in
 uh
 2028
 uh
 primary,
 you
 could


have
 a
 very
 different
 playground.


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 I
 I
 I
 don't
 think
 I
 could


have
 named
 the
 governor
 of
 Illinois.
 Uh


>> yeah,


>> he's
 certainly
 been
 in
 the
 news
 a
 lot.
 I


didn't
 know
 much
 about
 Wes
 Moore


>> until
 a
 few
 months
 ago.


>> Sometimes
 these
 people
 and
 like
 you


pointed
 out
 earlier,
 it's
 a
 long
 way


off.
 I
 mean,
 we've
 got
 a
 lot
 of
 years


here
 to
 go.


>> Yeah.
 So,
 right
 now,
 I
 think
 uh
 last


time
 I
 checked,
 uh
 those
 betting
 market


uh
 the
 news
 uh
 is
 like
 32%
 of
 all
 the


probabilities.
 So,
 that's
 a
 huge
 bump


from
 a
 few
 months
 ago.


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 all
 the
 polling
 is
 showing


what
 he
 is
 doing
 is
 is
 getting


attention,
 and
 for
 many
 folks,
 uh,


they're
 happy
 he's
 doing
 it.
 Not


everyone,
 for
 sure.
 Um,


you
 know,
 the
 MAGA
 crowd
 is
 very
 enraged


by
 it.


>> Yeah.


>> For
 the
 Democrats,
 by
 and
 large,
 it's


viewed
 favorably.


>> Yeah.
 I
 see
 uh
 Gavin
 Newsome
 35%


10%
 for
 AOC


6%
 for
 Westmore


uh
 6%
 for
 Mayor
 Pit


Andy
 5%
 and
 Kla
 Harris
 5%.
 Yeah.


>> See,
 some
 of
 those
 governors
 have
 shown


up.
 Even
 Whitmer,
 we
 didn't
 talk
 about


her
 from
 Michigan.
 Yeah.
 John
 Stewart.


Yes.
 People
 want
 John
 Stewart
 to
 run.


>> Oh,
 I
 really
 want
 John
 Stewart.
 David
 A.


Smith
 to
 run.
 Yeah,


>> I
 think
 John
 Stew
 John
 Stewart
 could
 be


a
 good
 candidate,
 you
 know.


>> I
 think
 he's
 very
 bright,
 man.


>> Uhhuh.


>> Steven
 Smith
 2%
 here.
 Steven,


>> I
 see
 The
 Rock
 on
 there,
 huh?


>> That's
 a
 little
 bit
 too
 much.
 The
 Rock.


>> Yeah,
 we
 had
 Ronald
 Reagan
 at
 one
 point.


So,
 yeah.


>> Yeah,


>> that
 was


>> so
 Yeah.
 Uh
 yeah,
 I
 think
 it
 could
 be


interesting.
 Uh
 I
 would
 love
 to
 see
 the


primary
 debate
 like
 when
 those
 guys
 got


on
 the
 stage.


So
 the
 Republican
 Republican
 side
 uh
 the


other
 I
 don't
 know if
 you
 watch
 the
 news


like
 uh
 JD
 Vance
 was
 talking
 about
 uh


he's
 ready
 to
 become
 the
 president
 if


there's
 something
 happened
 to
 Trump
 and


then
 there's
 speculation
 that
 Trump
 is


dying
 which
 is
 like
 a
 kind
 of
 rumor


going
 on.


>> I
 don't
 think
 there's
 much
 to
 it.
 He's


probably
 has
 his
 health
 issues.
 I
 mean


he's
 an
 overweight
 79year-old.
 Every


overweight
 79
 year old
 has
 science


issues.


>> Yeah.


>> But
 I
 I I
 I
 don't
 know.
 I
 think
 he's
 I


think
 he's
 gonna
 be
 around.


>> Okay.
 Yeah.
 You
 see
 JD
 Vans
 is
 like
 53%


and
 uh


Yeah.
 Tiger
 Carlson
 3%.


Ronda
 Sanders
 3%.
 Steven
 Bannon
 4%.
 Wow.


>> There.
 Okay.
 I'm
 not
 even
 going
 to


comment
 on
 those
 numbers.


straight
 for
 your
 favorite
 candidate,


Donald
 Trump
 Jr.


>> I
 think
 Vance,
 again,
 as
 we
 talked
 about


last
 time,


>> it
 all
 depends
 on
 how
 the
 Trump


administration
 plays
 out.


>> If
 the
 Trump
 administration


internationally
 and
 for
 pocketbook
 turns


out
 to
 be
 a
 successful
 administration,


Vance
 is
 going
 to
 be
 the
 front
 runner


and
 is
 going
 to
 be
 a
 formidable


candidate.
 Oh
 yeah.
 If
 if
 it's
 like
 uh


if
 it's
 like
 2008


uh
 Judge
 W.
 Bush
 GOP,
 then


JD
 M
 will
 be
 probably
 buried
 like


>> That's
 right.


>> Yeah.


All
 right.
 So,
 I
 think
 we
 had
 the
 part


done.
 We
 have
 a
 good
 ranking
 of
 all
 the


candidates.
