Success
 teaches
 you
 nothing,
 but
 failure


sure
 teaches
 you
 a
 lot.
 You've
 worked


with
 some
 of
 the
 biggest
 egos
 in


Hollywood
 and
 some
 of
 the
 most
 ruthless


tycoons.
 I'm
 wondering
 if
 you
 can
 spend


a
 few
 minutes
 on
 the
 lessons
 you've


learned
 about
 ego
 and
 power.
 Barry


Diller
 is
 a
 legendary
 media
 mogul,


businessman,
 and
 investor.
 He
 is
 the


chairman
 and
 senior
 executive
 of
 IA
 and


is
 best
 known
 for
 co-founding
 the
 Fox


Broadcasting
 Company
 with
 Rupert
 Murdoch


and
 leading
 Paramount
 Pictures.
 Over
 his


career,
 he
 has
 reshaped
 television,


film,
 and
 online
 media.
 He
 remains
 one


of
 the
 most
 influential
 figures
 in


business
 and
 entertainment
 today.


We're
 certainly
 at
 the
 brink
 of
 the
 next


revolution.
 If
 you
 were
 sitting
 in
 1995


or
 2000
 at
 the
 beginning
 of
 the
 things


you
 did
 not
 know,
 and
 there
 were
 plenty


of
 those,
 there
 was
 nothing
 that
 cracked


your
 mind
 and
 astounded
 you
 and
 said,


"Oh
 my
 god,
 this
 is
 beyond
 me.
 This
 is


magic."
 Google
 over
 the
 years
 was


consistently
 as
 it
 monopoly
 grew
 was


squeezing
 the
 people
 who
 kind
 of
 lived


on
 as
 a
 surf
 on
 its
 uh
 land.
 But
 when
 I


found
 an
 asset
 that
 couldn't
 be


disintermediated
 by
 search,


I
 thought,
 "Wow,
 that
 wasn't
 AI.
 That


was
 just
 the
 characteristics
 of
 the


internet
 environment."
 The
 only
 thing


that
 will
 save
 us
 is
 our
 brands
 and


whether
 our
 brands
 and
 the
 content
 we


make
 resonates
 enough
 directly
 for


people
 to
 recognize
 our
 brand
 and
 want


to
 be
 brand
 involved
 rather
 than


agnostic.
 I've
 I
 believe


until
 the
 last
 breath
 that


[Music]


at
 83
 you
 chose
 to
 reveal
 some
 of
 the


most
 private
 parts
 of
 your
 life
 and


you're
 a
 super
 private
 person.
 Why
 now?


I
 can't
 do
 the
 why
 now.
 It
 wasn't
 like
 I


chose
 this
 date
 or
 that
 date.
 it's
 that


I
 had
 thought
 uh
 that
 my
 life
 was
 a
 good


story
 and
 if
 I
 could
 tell
 it
 true
 then
 I


wanted
 to
 try
 and
 do
 it.
 So
 it
 took
 me


an
 endless
 amount
 of
 time
 basically


because
 I
 put
 it
 away
 for
 a
 year
 and


come
 back
 to
 it
 and
 put
 it
 away
 for
 6


months
 and
 then
 come
 back
 to
 it.
 It
 was


only
 really
 in
 the
 last
 couple
 of
 years


that
 I
 was
 I
 wouldn't
 call
 it
 dedicated


but
 that
 I
 had
 more
 discipline.
 I
 never


was
 sure
 I
 would
 publish
 it.
 And
 then
 I


got
 to
 a
 point
 where
 I
 said,
 you
 know,


I've
 done
 it.
 I've
 kind
 of
 told
 it.
 I


got
 it
 down.
 So,
 let
 it
 go.
 My
 friends


told
 me,
 uh,
 publish
 it
 after
 you're


gone,
 after
 you
 die.
 And
 I
 thought,


well,
 I
 ain't
 going
 to
 have
 anything
 to


do
 with
 that,
 so
 I'd
 rather
 have
 agency


of
 my
 own.


How
 does
 it
 feel
 to
 release
 it
 out
 loud


into
 the
 world?


It
 feels
 exposing
 now.
 I
 it's
 now
 been


like
 I
 think
 3
 weeks
 or
 so,
 so
 I've


gotten
 a
 bit
 used
 to
 it.
 But
 in
 the


first
 days,
 I
 thought,
 "Oh
 my
 god,
 what


the
 hell
 have
 I
 done
 here?"
 I
 think
 the


first
 day
 or
 the
 second
 day
 I
 did
 a
 I


think
 it
 was
 a
 live
 interview
 on
 CBS


Sunday
 morning.
 And
 I
 know
 it
 wasn't


live.
 It
 was
 taped,
 but
 it
 was
 it
 went


out
 like
 right
 away.
 And
 and
 I
 thought


and
 I'm
 being
 asked
 all
 these
 very


personal
 questions
 and
 I
 thought,
 you


know,
 do
 I
 throw
 down
 this
 little


microphone
 and
 stalk
 out?
 What
 do
 I
 do?


And
 I
 thought,
 you
 know
 what?
 I've
 done


it.
 So
 just
 go
 answer
 the
 questions
 and


get
 on
 with
 it.
 And
 kind
 of
 once
 I
 did


that,
 I
 relaxed
 in
 it
 a
 bit.
 Now
 I'm


kind
 of
 used
 to
 the
 exposure.
 But
 yeah,


I
 I
 wrote
 a
 personal
 book.
 One
 of
 the


stories
 that
 really
 stood
 out
 for
 me
 was


as
 a
 child
 you
 gave
 up
 on
 your
 mother


while
 you
 were
 at
 sleepa
 away
 camp
 and


you
 were
 sitting
 waiting
 for
 her
 to
 pick


you
 up.
 That
 seemed
 to
 be
 such
 a


defining
 moment
 for
 you
 and
 it
 led
 to


this
 craving
 of
 independence
 and


non-reliance
 on
 other
 people.
 Can
 you


talk
 to
 me
 a
 little
 bit
 about
 that?


Yeah,
 I
 don't
 think
 it
 was
 a
 craving.
 It


was
 a
 necessity.
 I
 knew
 at
 that
 moment


and
 it
 was
 a
 a
 stark
 flash.
 are
 those


snapshots
 you
 have
 that
 you
 capture
 and


they're
 always
 with
 you
 for
 the
 rest
 of


your
 life
 and
 I
 have
 that
 snapshot
 of
 me


in
 that
 moment
 and
 I
 thought
 I'm
 the


only
 one
 to
 protect
 me
 so
 I
 have
 no


choice.
 That's
 that's
 what
 I
 felt.
 How


old
 were
 you?
 Can
 you
 recount
 this


story?
 I
 was
 eight
 and
 I
 went
 to
 camp


and
 I
 was
 not
 very
 happy
 there.
 I
 mean,


a
 lot
 of
 children
 go
 to
 camp
 and
 have


this,
 but
 mine
 was
 kind
 of
 acute,
 and
 my


mother
 promised
 she
 would
 come,
 and
 she


didn't.
 This
 was
 not
 horrendous
 child


neglect
 or
 anything
 of
 that
 sort.
 My


parents
 were
 perfectly
 nice.
 They
 just


were
 clueless
 about
 children.
 They


really,
 they'd
 never
 been
 parented.


Their
 parents
 had
 never
 been
 parented.


And
 so,
 they
 had
 no
 vocabulary
 for
 it.


And
 so,
 she
 wasn't
 really
 there
 to


protect
 me.
 And
 that
 scared
 me.


I
 can
 relate
 to
 that
 a
 lot.
 And
 then
 you


you
 sort
 of
 had
 to
 develop
 your
 own


independence
 from
 that
 moment
 on.


I
 had
 no
 choice.
 I
 don't know.
 I
 think


it's
 in
 biology.
 My
 biology
 is
 very


strong
 and
 my
 biology
 saved
 me.
 I
 had
 to


be
 independent
 and
 so
 I
 was.
 I
 don't


claim
 it
 as,
 you
 know,
 some
 something
 to


be
 prideful
 about.
 It
 just
 uh
 I'm
 I
 was


lucky.
 One
 of the
 ideas
 that
 stood
 out


in
 your
 book
 as
 well
 was
 fake
 it
 until


you
 make
 it
 and
 how
 that
 was
 crucial
 to


your
 success.
 You've
 had
 these
 moments


in
 your
 career
 where
 you
 sort
 of


believed
 in
 yourself
 almost
 despite
 the


any
 tangible
 evidence
 to
 indicate
 that


you
 could
 do
 something
 and
 one
 of
 the


first
 moments
 was
 at
 ABC
 and
 convincing


Mr.
 Golden
 to
 let
 you
 create
 original


programming
 for
 TV.
 I'd
 love
 for
 you
 to


explore
 this
 idea,
 especially


considering
 I
 I've
 also
 heard
 you
 in


interviews
 say
 that
 you
 never
 had
 any


confidence.


I
 never
 had
 a
 sense
 of
 self
 because
 I


didn't
 think
 I
 deserved
 a
 sense
 of
 self


and
 so
 I
 never
 could
 claim
 that.
 I
 never


thought
 of
 that
 and
 I
 and
 I
 didn't
 have


uh
 the
 kind
 of
 early
 buoyant
 confidence


that
 that
 I
 saw
 around
 me
 and
 that
 has


always
 attracted
 me.
 I'm
 always


attracted
 to
 people
 who
 are
 natively


confident.
 I
 don't
 know
 how
 the
 hell
 the


stars
 or
 the
 or
 their
 biology
 or
 their


environment
 put
 that
 together
 for
 them.


And
 I
 see
 people
 walking
 down
 the
 street


and
 I
 can
 see
 their
 confidence
 and
 I


like
 think,
 "Oh
 my
 god,
 I
 wish
 I
 had


ever
 had
 that."
 But
 then
 if
 I
 had
 had


that,
 I'd
 probably
 end
 up
 being
 a
 shoe


clerk
 at
 Macy's.
 So
 I
 think
 that
 that


lack
 of
 a
 sense
 of
 self.
 Oddly,
 it


enabled
 me
 in
 the
 earliest
 part
 of
 my


career
 to
 please
 others
 to
 such
 an


extent
 that
 it
 got
 me
 going.
 And
 once
 I


got
 going,
 I
 just
 kept
 going.
 And
 I


think
 that
 that
 in
 a
 sense
 lack
 of


confidence
 or
 lack
 of
 sense
 of
 self


wanted
 propelled
 me
 to
 count
 as
 much
 as


I
 could
 in
 the
 eyes
 of
 others.


You
 said
 that
 you
 were
 sort
 of
 an


unambitious
 keen.
 What
 changed?
 Was


there
 a
 defining
 moment
 where
 you
 sort


of
 like


I
 had
 no
 ambition.
 My
 family
 didn't


think
 much
 but
 they
 whatever
 they


thought
 uh
 somewhat
 unexpressed
 but


coming
 out
 from
 them
 uh
 as
 an


environment
 my
 family
 had
 resources
 and


so
 I
 think
 they
 thought
 well
 they'd
 be


supporting
 me.
 I
 never
 really
 have
 a


job.
 I
 didn't
 want
 to
 go
 to
 school.
 I


didn't
 want
 to
 go
 to
 college.
 I
 didn't


want
 to
 do
 much
 of
 anything.
 I
 was


hibernating
 for
 a
 good
 long
 time.
 But


I'd
 always
 had
 this
 interest
 in
 the


entertainment
 in
 the
 world
 of


entertainment.
 I
 grew
 up
 around
 it.
 Most


of
 my
 friends
 parents
 were
 in
 the


entertainment
 business
 in
 one
 form
 or


the
 other.
 And
 so
 I
 I
 was
 just
 pulled
 by


it.
 It
 was
 a
 a
 tractor
 beam
 that
 always


drove
 me
 and
 or
 intrigued
 me.
 And
 when
 I


finally
 thought,
 you
 know,
 I
 really
 I'm


19.
 I
 want
 to
 go
 to
 school,
 but
 I
 got
 to


do
 something.
 I
 mean
 I
 I
 was
 basically


staying
 up
 nights
 and
 sleeping
 most
 days


and
 I
 thought
 well
 you
 know
 I
 would
 like


to
 learn
 about
 the
 entertainment


business
 and
 I
 thought
 there
 these


talent
 agencies
 William
 Morris
 the


probably
 at
 that
 time
 the
 most
 famous


number
 one
 agency
 and
 they
 had
 a
 mail


room
 where
 they
 so
 to
 speak
 trained


people
 to
 be
 agents.
 I
 didn't
 want
 to
 be


an
 agent.
 I
 thought
 I'd
 never
 be
 an


agent.
 That
 was
 ridiculous.
 uh
 talk


about
 if
 you
 don't
 have
 a
 sense
 of
 self,


how
 can
 you
 represent
 others?
 How
 can


you
 ever
 have
 the
 confidence
 to
 go
 sell


somebody
 that
 you're
 going
 to
 take
 care


of
 their
 lives?
 But
 I
 thought
 I
 could
 go


and
 learn
 and
 I
 essentially
 went
 there


and
 at
 that
 time
 there
 were
 big
 file


rooms,
 paper
 file
 rooms
 and
 I
 read
 the


entire
 firearm
 and
 they
 had
 had
 the


history
 of
 the
 entertainment
 business


for
 70
 years.
 And
 so
 what
 incredible


luck
 for
 someone
 who
 wanted
 to
 learn


stuff
 and
 I
 did.
 I
 was
 insatiable
 about


learning
 and
 that


literally
 from
 one
 day
 to
 the
 next
 lit
 a


fire
 of
 ambition
 and
 purposefulness.
 I


love
 the
 idea
 of
 sort
 of
 dark
 hours
 and


sort
 of
 hours
 learning
 and
 preparing
 uh


that
 other
 people
 could
 do
 but
 didn't


do.
 And
 you
 sort
 of
 alluded
 to
 the
 fact


that
 nobody
 wanted
 that
 job
 downstairs


in
 the
 room.
 It
 was
 just
 you.


Yep.
 I
 was
 really
 lucky
 because
 all
 the


people
 who
 were
 in
 the
 mail
 room
 were


well,
 they
 just
 wanted
 to
 get
 to
 be


agents
 since
 I
 didn't
 want
 to
 be
 an


agent.
 I
 took
 the
 job
 no
 one
 else


wanted.
 They
 all
 wanted
 to
 go
 in
 and


that
 horrible
 word
 network
 around,
 meet


people,
 press
 people,
 do
 whatever.
 I


went
 to
 the
 dungeon
 and
 and
 had
 this
 job


that
 allowed
 me
 basically
 almost
 the


entire
 day
 to
 read.
 And
 that's
 what
 I


did
 for
 three
 years
 until
 I
 think
 they


were
 on
 the
 verge
 of
 throwing
 me
 out.


You
 said
 you
 never
 had
 a
 goal
 and
 that


that's
 sort
 of
 what
 allowed
 you
 to
 do


that.
 They
 all
 wanted
 to
 be
 agents.
 So


they
 were
 working
 towards
 that.
 Can
 you


go
 a
 little
 bit
 deeper
 on
 that?


Look,
 if
 you
 want
 to
 be
 a
 doctor,
 yes,


that's
 a
 goal
 and
 you've
 got
 to
 go
 do


step
 step
 step
 to
 get
 there.
 There
 are


roles
 like
 that.
 But
 if
 you
 have
 a


specific
 craft
 or
 something,
 you
 can


name
 that
 craft
 as
 a
 goal
 and
 train
 for


it
 or
 do
 whatever
 you
 have
 to
 do
 for
 it.


I've
 never
 had
 any
 goals.
 I
 had
 the
 goal


that
 I
 wanted
 to
 count
 and
 I
 had
 the


goal
 that
 I
 was
 fascinated
 by
 the


entertainment
 business.
 I
 don't
 like
 it


when
 people
 come
 in
 to
 the
 early
 stages


of
 a
 broad
 general
 entertainment
 career


and
 say
 I
 want
 to
 run
 a
 studio
 or
 things


like
 that.
 I
 think
 whatever
 your


interest
 is,
 you
 just
 get
 on
 the
 broad


path.
 Whatever
 door
 you
 got
 to
 bang
 to


get
 in
 there,
 you
 get
 on
 the
 broad
 path


and
 everything
 else
 takes
 care
 of


itself.
 You
 don't
 have
 to
 say
 I
 want
 to


be
 this
 or
 I
 want
 to
 be
 that.
 And
 I've


always
 mistrusted
 that.
 I
 was
 thinking


about
 this
 as
 I
 was
 reading
 that
 in
 your


book
 and
 the
 thing
 that
 came
 to
 me
 was


sort
 of
 people
 look
 at
 jobs
 as
 stepping


stones.


Um
 sort
 of
 uh
 you
 know
 this
 is
 temporary


until
 I
 get
 the
 job
 I
 want.
 I
 want
 to
 be


an
 agent's
 assistant
 until
 I'm
 the


agent.
 But
 then
 they're
 never
 fully


present
 in
 the
 job.
 They're
 never
 just


Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 listen,
 maybe
 it
 might


work
 for
 some.
 I
 guess
 my
 observation
 is


that
 doesn't
 really
 work.
 What
 works
 is


if
 you
 get
 lucky
 enough
 to
 get
 a


position
 that
 you
 don't
 have
 experience


for,
 that
 you
 haven't
 mastered,
 and
 then


you
 just
 go
 about
 doing
 it.
 The
 sparks


you
 set
 off
 naturally


impress
 others
 and
 lead.
 They
 they
 drag


you
 to
 the
 next
 step.
 You
 don't
 have
 to


do
 much
 of
 anything.
 And
 and
 I
 think


when
 you
 do
 too
 many
 things,
 you
 know,


you
 see
 people
 whose
 naked
 ambition
 is


so
 structured
 and
 so
 people
 who
 say,


well,
 I
 need
 to
 go
 out
 and
 network.
 And


I
 hear
 that
 and
 I
 think,
 oh,
 you
 fools.


I
 mean,
 what
 are
 you
 talking
 about?
 You


don't
 really
 need
 to
 do
 that.
 It's
 this


kind
 of
 pro-former
 thinking
 of
 the


things
 you
 should
 do,
 the
 steps
 you


should
 take.
 It
 really
 is
 far
 more


naturalistic
 than
 that.


Do
 you
 remember
 the
 first
 person
 who
 had


expectations
 of
 you?


Yes.
 At
 one
 point,
 one
 of
 the
 things
 of


progress
 in
 uh
 in
 that
 mail
 room


environment
 is
 you
 work
 on
 an
 agent's


desk
 as
 his
 assistant,
 secretary
 at
 that


time,
 an
 assistant.
 I
 was
 very
 lucky


that
 the
 person
 my
 second
 time
 I
 did
 it


was
 for
 someone
 who
 did
 take
 an
 interest


in
 me
 and
 was
 kind
 of
 the
 first
 person


where
 I
 could
 see
 you
 know
 I
 know
 what


I'm
 doing
 for
 him
 and
 I
 know
 how


effective
 I
 am
 for
 him
 by
 the
 way
 it's


not
 like
 he
 ever
 said
 it
 to
 me


particularly
 but
 I
 could
 feel
 it
 and


know
 it
 and
 that
 that
 he
 had
 confidence


in
 me
 gave
 me
 the
 imagery
 of
 confidence


in
 myself
 and
 that
 was
 probably
 the


first
 time.


So
 he
 believed
 in
 you
 more
 than
 you


believed
 in
 yourself.


Well,
 I
 had
 no
 belief
 in
 myself.
 So
 I


mean
 and
 I'm
 not
 exaggerating
 this
 just


for
 whatever
 for
 drama
 purposes,
 but
 I


didn't
 have
 any
 belief
 in
 myself.
 But
 I


don't
 even
 know
 if
 I
 now
 have
 much


belief
 in
 myself.
 I
 know
 how
 absurd
 that


probably
 is
 to
 say,
 but
 it's
 but
 I
 can


only
 reflect
 on
 my
 own
 dim
 uh
 innerings.


I
 think
 that
 there's
 no
 doubt
 that
 his


confidence
 in
 me
 spurred
 me
 on
 for
 sure.


I
 don't know
 that
 ever
 made
 me
 feel


confident,
 but
 it
 sure
 spurred
 me
 on.
 I


just
 wanted
 to
 please
 him
 more,
 and
 I


did.
 I
 was
 the
 best
 little
 assistant
 the


world
 had
 ever
 created.
 You've
 worked


with
 some
 of
 the
 biggest
 egos
 in


Hollywood
 and
 some
 of
 the
 most
 ruthless


tycoons.
 I'm
 wondering
 if
 you
 can
 spend


a
 few
 minutes
 on
 the
 lessons
 you've


learned
 about
 ego
 and
 power.
 I'm
 direct


and
 I'm
 sincere


and
 often
 quite
 blunt.
 That


in
 a
 way
 does
 make
 people
 maybe
 trust


you.
 I'm
 generally
 very
 trusting.
 I


don't
 start
 out
 untrusting.
 I
 start
 out


trusting
 and
 you
 have
 to
 do
 a
 lot
 to


break
 that
 trust.
 So
 I
 think
 that
 that


ability
 to
 initially
 trust
 and
 people


realize
 that
 I
 am
 trusting
 them
 and
 I
 I


don't
 say,
 "Oh,
 this
 is
 a
 very
 precious


thing.
 Please
 don't
 screw
 this
 up."
 Of


course,
 I've
 been
 in
 situations
 where


it's
 been
 misplaced
 to
 say
 the
 least.


You
 can't
 be
 in
 business
 as
 long
 as
 I


have
 to
 not
 have
 your
 trust
 broken
 a
 lot


of
 times.
 The
 great
 thing
 is
 I
 can't


really
 remember
 and
 I
 don't
 have
 any


vengeance
 and
 that's
 again
 just
 luck.


It's
 not
 not
 something
 I
 would
 take


pride
 in.
 The
 one
 great
 thing
 about
 the


entertainment
 business
 has
 been
 in
 many


ways
 demonstrations
 of
 various
 excessive


personality
 in
 order
 to
 get
 something


done
 or
 to
 be
 distinguishable
 from
 the


next
 person.


Excessiveness
 is
 not
 a
 bad
 quality.
 And


also,
 if
 you're
 trying
 to
 convince


people
 of
 things,
 you
 probably
 got
 to


have
 either
 forceful
 personality,


forceful
 something.
 Uh
 that's
 just


whether
 you
 got
 it
 or
 you
 don't
 got
 it.


And
 today
 there
 is
 less
 of
 it
 than
 there


was
 when
 I
 was
 kind
 of
 growing
 up
 in
 it


where
 there
 was
 this
 outsized


personalities
 that
 if
 you're
 interested


in
 entertainment
 businesses
 you've
 read


about
 for
 100
 years
 uh
 that
 kind
 of


created
 the
 business
 the
 motion
 picture


business
 in
 particular.
 Uh
 it's
 it's
 now


a
 completely
 different
 dynamic,
 but
 but


those
 outsized
 personalities
 were
 were


thrilling
 to
 be
 around.

 What's
 changed,
 do
 you


think?
 Well,
 I
 think
 the
 most
 dramatic


change
 is
 that
 the
 entertainment


business,
 let's
 let's
 say
 the
 motion


picture
 business
 was
 kind
 of
 encased
 in


its
 own
 world
 during
 its
 greatest
 years


of
 development.
 That
 was
 what
 these


companies
 did.
 They
 just
 made
 movies,


the
 great
 movies
 of
 the
 30s,
 40s,
 50s,


60s,7s,
 80s,
 and
 some
 in
 the
 '9s.
 And


there's
 still
 some
 good
 movies
 made.
 I'm


not
 saying
 that.
 But
 they
 were
 worlds


unto
 themselves.
 They
 were
 important


worlds
 cuz
 those
 movies
 were
 exported
 to


the
 world
 and
 became
 the
 export
 of


American
 culture
 to
 the
 world
 in
 movies.


Uh
 is
 probably
 the
 most
 extraordinary


movement
 dominating
 almost
 every
 country


in
 the
 world
 from
 the
 inception
 of
 the


motion
 picture
 business.
 And


as
 time
 went
 on
 they
 started
 doing


television
 and
 then
 they
 owned
 cable


networks
 and
 television
 networks
 etc.


And
 as
 they
 diversified
 movies
 notch


kind
 of
 somewhat
 down
 the
 ladder
 of


importance
 to
 these
 places.
 I
 think
 that


has
 an
 effect
 on
 the
 work
 itself.
 when


the
 seniormost
 person
 wakes
 up
 every


morning
 and
 worries
 about
 what's
 going


to
 happen
 with
 the
 movie
 they're
 making


and
 how
 how
 it's
 doing
 and
 all
 of
 that


care
 and
 feeding
 of
 it
 uh
 is
 far


different
 than
 it
 being
 number
 87
 in
 the


priorities
 of
 a
 large
 conglomerated


company.
 But
 the
 most
 profound


uh
 took
 place
 with
 streaming
 when


technology
 essentially


overtook
 the
 entire
 ecosystem
 of
 the


manufacturer
 of
 television
 and
 movies.


And
 so
 where
 these
 pure
 entertainment


companies,
 by
 the
 way,
 to
 some
 degree,


it's
 the
 furthest
 you
 could
 ever
 go
 to


say
 the
 difference
 between
 instinct
 and


ones
 and
 zeros
 or
 technology,
 which
 is,


as
 we
 know,
 quite
 fact-based
 and


numerical
 as
 to
 making
 any
 content
 is


instinctive.
 And
 those
 tech
 companies


essentially
 have
 now
 taken
 over
 the
 old


hedgeimony
 of
 uh
 quote
 Hollywood
 and
 now


Netflix
 and
 Apple
 and
 Amazon.
 I
 mean


just
 take
 one
 part
 of
 it
 if
 you
 want
 to


know
 the
 distinction
 where
 if
 you
 make


content
 the
 test
 of
 it
 is
 how
 many


people
 watch
 it,
 want
 it,
 go
 to
 a
 movie


theater,
 buy
 a
 ticket,
 do
 whatever.
 So,


you're
 in
 direct
 relationship
 to
 the


reaction
 to
 that
 thing
 that
 you
 made.
 If


you're
 Amazon
 and
 your
 main
 business
 is


subscriptions
 in
 Prime
 and
 you
 offer


content
 as
 kind
 of
 the
 thing
 in
 the


front
 of
 the
 store
 to
 get
 people
 to
 come


in,
 you're
 so
 far
 away.
 It's
 a
 different


business
 model.
 It's
 no
 longer
 based


upon,
 oh,
 I
 love
 that
 program.
 I
 love


that
 movie.
 I
 pay
 my
 money.
 I
 react
 to


it
 and
 the
 reaction
 is
 to
 the
 people
 who


made
 it.
 In
 this
 case,
 that's
 not
 the


business
 model.
 So,
 it's
 it's
 a


completely
 different
 environment
 than
 it


than
 it
 was.
 Now,
 not
 saying
 it
 can't


produce
 good
 things.
 Good
 things
 do
 get


produced
 and
 they
 will
 continue
 to
 be.


But
 the
 environment
 and
 the
 process
 is


different.
 And
 I
 think
 probably
 just


pound
 for
 pound.
 Well,
 I
 can
 say
 this


about
 it.
 I
 because
 I
 can't.


Yes,
 I
 can,
 but
 it's
 boring
 to
 save.


God,
 it
 was
 so
 much
 better
 eight
 years,


10
 years,
 20,
 30
 years
 ago
 in
 terms
 of


making
 stuff.
 It
 used
 to
 be
 for
 sure
 up


until
 recently.
 It
 was
 fun.
 You
 had
 fun


doing
 it.
 You
 You
 did
 it.
 You
 set
 up


your
 tent
 uh
 every
 couple
 of
 month
 or


month
 or
 two,
 you'd
 have
 a
 movie
 come


out
 and
 you
 all
 run
 towards
 figuring
 out


how
 to
 make
 it
 make
 it
 work,
 etc.,
 etc.,


etc.,
 and
 then
 your
 next
 excitement
 was


the
 next
 movie,
 and
 you
 lived
 in
 that


environment.
 And
 if
 the
 movie
 was
 good,


it
 lasted
 for
 a
 while.
 Things
 now
 go
 so


quickly.
 So,
 it
 is
 not
 a
 process
 today


where
 most
 people
 in
 it
 will
 say
 they're


having
 a
 good
 time.
 It's
 just
 so


fractionated
 now
 that
 that
 and
 it
 goes


so
 quickly
 that
 the
 great
 thrills
 of


making
 great
 programs
 is
 kind
 of
 gone.


Do
 you
 think
 it's
 too
 numbers
 driven?
 I


I
 mean
 you
 mentioned
 instinct
 as
 a


deciding
 factor.
 You
 used
 to
 decide
 on


instinct
 and
 you
 know
 other
 people
 would


bring
 numbers
 and
 I
 think
 one
 of
 your


quotes
 if
 I
 remember
 correctly
 was


numbers
 can
 tell
 you
 what
 has
 happened


in
 the
 past
 but
 they
 won't
 tell
 you


what's
 happened
 in
 the
 future
 but


everything
 is
 sort
 of
 analytical
 these


days.
 Netflix
 can
 see
 the
 exact
 moment


somebody
 stopped
 watching
 a
 show.
 So


when
 they're
 doing
 programming
 they


think
 about
 this
 and
 do
 you
 think
 it's


getting
 too
 formulaic
 and
 too
 data


driven
 or
 I
 I
 I
 don't
 think
 algorithms


can
 help
 here.
 None
 of
 us
 know
 what's


going
 to
 happen
 with
 the
 dread
 and


wonderful
 word
 AI,
 but
 I
 don't
 think


that
 that
 predictive
 research


is
 uh
 certainly
 in
 the
 arena
 of
 content


worthless.
 It
 cannot
 tell
 you
 anything


of
 real
 value
 in
 making
 a
 forward


decision
 that
 it's
 just
 not
 possible.


And
 yet
 everybody
 wants
 it
 to
 be


possible.
 Why?
 Because
 making


instinctive
 decisions
 is
 living
 with


great
 insecurity.
 There's
 no
 way
 to
 be


secure
 uh
 when
 you're
 making
 decisions


based
 on
 instinct.
 If
 I
 can
 get
 more


comfort
 by
 using
 this
 piece
 of
 data
 or


that
 piece
 of
 data
 to
 quote
 help
 me,


lovely.
 But
 it's
 a
 delusion.


It's
 almost
 like
 hiding,
 you
 know,
 the


safety
 and
 the
 numbers.
 I
 wasn't
 wrong.


The
 numbers
 were
 wrong.
 And
 you
 can


absolve
 yourself
 from
 responsibility
 in


a
 way.
 You
 can
 only
 do
 that
 for
 so
 long


because
 in
 the
 end
 uh


your
 work
 will
 get
 you
 good
 or
 bad
 and


there's
 nothing
 you
 could
 you
 can't


hide.
 That's
 the
 the
 thing
 that
 I
 will


always
 love
 about
 that
 world
 is
 you're


you're
 out
 there
 with
 whatever
 you've


made
 you've
 put
 together
 whatever
 role


you
 played
 in
 it
 and
 there's
 no
 hiding.


It's
 there
 for
 people
 to
 see
 and
 react


to
 and
 they
 will
 react.


Is
 there
 any
 particular
 failure
 that


stands
 out
 in
 your
 mind
 is
 like,
 "Oh,
 I


learned
 a
 lot
 from
 that
 one
 or
 it
 was


more
 impactful
 than
 the
 other
 ones."


If
 you
 are
 in
 the
 work
 of
 making


things,
 content,


you're
 going
 to
 have
 a
 good
 amount
 of


failure.
 It's
 not
 possible
 otherwise.


Now,
 I've
 I've
 been
 lucky.
 Well,
 I
 won't


say
 it's
 luck.
 It
 is.
 That
 isn't
 luck.


But
 I've
 had
 enough
 successes
 to
 balance


the
 failures
 and
 probably
 have
 have
 had


a
 better
 average,
 let's
 call
 it,
 of


that.
 But
 every
 failure
 in
 some
 way


ought
 to
 teach
 you
 something.
 And


success
 teaches
 you
 nothing.
 But
 failure


sure
 teaches
 you
 a
 lot.
 Are
 there


lessons
 that
 you've
 sort
 of
 been
 taught


multiple
 times
 from
 failure
 that
 you're


sort
 of
 like
 I
 keep
 running
 into
 that


but
 it's
 a
 different
 version
 of
 the
 same


problem.


The
 most
 important
 thing
 and
 the
 thing


that
 I
 have
 been
 reminded
 of


continuously
 is
 to
 keep
 scrubbing
 my


instincts
 clean
 as
 it
 were.
 Every
 time


I've
 made
 a
 decision
 out
 of
 cynicism,
 I


wouldn't
 say
 every
 time
 cuz
 sometimes


probably
 it
 has
 worked,
 but
 there's
 a


continual
 theme
 of
 cynical


decisionmaking
 that
 is
 poor.
 So
 being


naive,
 not
 being
 cynical,


being
 able
 to
 not
 let
 life
 experience,


so
 to
 speak,
 infect
 your
 basic
 instinct,


your
 ability
 to
 know
 a
 good
 idea
 from
 a


bad
 idea.
 That
 has
 been
 if
 anything
 the


thing
 that
 constantly


I've
 had
 to
 work
 at
 cuz
 as
 you
 gain


experience
 the
 natural
 tendency
 is
 to
 be


cynical
 or
 is
 is
 to
 be
 sophisticated


is
 to
 know
 things
 and
 it's
 something


that
 I've
 just
 learned
 to
 fight
 against


not
 always
 successfully.


How
 do
 you
 maintain
 that
 beginner's


mindset
 though?
 Like
 what
 are
 the
 things


that
 you
 do
 to
 approach
 things
 that
 way?


I
 wish
 I
 could
 give
 you
 a
 prescription


for
 this.
 I
 think
 probably
 the
 best
 way


I
 can
 say
 it
 is
 hold
 on
 to
 navvete.
 Do


not
 let
 the
 fact
 that
 you
 are
 of
 course


learning
 things
 and
 learning
 is
 of


course
 how
 could
 you
 say
 it's
 anything


but
 good.
 But
 living
 in
 an
 environment


where
 the
 corrosiveness
 of
 the
 day


grinds
 at
 you
 and
 makes
 you


worriedly
 cynical
 and
 all
 of
 that
 is


just
 something
 you
 got
 to
 fight
 against.


It
 that's
 ain't
 the
 best
 prescription


but
 that's
 all
 I
 got.
 You
 mentioned
 AI.


I
 want
 to
 come
 back
 to
 that
 in
 a
 second.


You've
 lived
 through
 major
 technological


disruptions
 from
 cable
 to
 TV
 to
 home


video
 to
 theaters
 becoming
 less


important
 and
 now
 we
 have
 the
 internet


and
 we
 have
 AI
 here.
 I'm
 wondering
 if


you
 can
 spend
 a
 few
 beats
 on
 AI
 and
 tell


me
 about
 how
 you
 see
 that
 not
 only


impacting
 the
 media
 and
 film
 business,


but
 also
 maybe
 double
 click
 on
 how
 you


think
 it's
 going
 to
 impact
 the
 website


and
 travel
 and
 all
 of
 these
 other
 things


that
 you're
 involved
 in


off
 the
 content
 business
 into
 the
 worlds


that
 I've
 been
 in
 for
 the
 last
 25
 or
 so


years,
 which
 is
 the
 worlds
 of
 internet


tech
 life
 with
 Expedia
 and
 dozens
 and


dozens
 of
 other
 websites,
 commerce


sites,
 etc.
 And
 I
 was
 very
 lucky.
 I
 got


to
 participate
 in
 that
 revolution
 which


started
 really
 around
 95
 when
 the


internet
 started
 to
 get
 used
 by
 ordinary


folk.
 And
 I
 was
 there
 in
 that
 period
 and


able
 to
 have
 this
 wonderful
 field
 kind


of
 open
 there
 just
 for
 the
 so
 to
 speak


grabbing
 and
 learning
 and
 that
 was


definitely
 a
 radical
 transformation.


We're
 certainly
 at
 the
 brink
 of
 the
 next


revolution.
 If
 you
 were
 sitting
 in
 1995


or
 2000,
 at
 the
 beginning
 of
 the
 things


you
 did
 not
 know,
 and
 there
 were
 plenty


of
 those,
 there
 was
 nothing
 that


cracked
 your
 mind
 and
 astounded
 you
 and


said,
 "Oh
 my
 god,
 this
 is
 beyond
 me.


This
 is
 magic."
 You
 could
 master
 it.
 It


wasn't
 hard
 to
 master.
 AI,
 will
 it


master
 us?
 Certainly
 in
 some
 cases
 it


probably
 will.
 The
 first
 time
 I
 used


chat
 GPT
 which
 was
 before
 it
 was


released
 and
 I
 thought
 well
 this
 is


faking
 magic
 and
 we're
 past
 that
 very


early
 stage.
 We're
 into
 the
 great


unknown
 here.
 It's
 going
 to
 have


profound
 effect.
 I
 don't
 know
 to
 what


exact
 extent.
 I
 know
 that
 for
 my


businesses,


we
 are
 racing
 and
 we've
 been
 doing
 this


for
 years.
 We
 go
 and
 anyone
 in
 business


has
 been
 using
 machine
 learning
 for
 a


decade
 or
 more.
 We're
 so
 far
 past
 that


now
 in
 so
 many
 different
 areas


that
 I
 can't
 by
 any
 stretch
 tell
 you
 the


extent
 of
 these
 changes
 except
 I
 know


they're
 profound.


How
 do
 you
 think
 it's
 going
 to
 impact


the
 travel
 business?
 Well,
 it's
 already


impacted
 the
 travel
 business.
 You
 are


able
 now,
 I
 mean,
 Expedia,
 which
 is
 a


large
 entity.
 I
 mean,


15
 or
 20
 billion
 dollars
 of
 sales,
 you


it's
 a
 large
 enterprise
 and
 it
 is
 a
 tech


company.
 The
 things
 we
 are
 using
 AI
 to


do
 now,
 which
 did
 not
 exist,
 is
 profound


in
 every
 area
 of
 our
 service.
 It
 is
 more


than
 likely
 that
 within
 a
 year,
 but
 I


won't
 say
 that
 and
 I
 think
 it
 really
 is


probably
 truly
 within
 a
 year
 or
 so,
 you


really
 will
 be
 able
 to
 have
 a


conversation.


Agentic,
 this
 new
 word
 where
 an
 agent


does
 work
 for
 you
 will
 know
 so
 much


about
 you.
 It's
 not
 like
 they
 will
 have


known
 that
 your
 calendar
 says
 you
 have


to
 be
 in
 Las
 Vegas
 on
 Thursday
 the
 20th


of
 September


and
 we'll
 just
 take
 care
 of
 everything


for
 you.
 Eventually
 that
 may
 happen
 but


the
 dialogue
 that
 you
 will
 have
 very


soon
 where
 the
 agent
 will
 know
 so
 much


and
 have
 such
 agency


with
 the
 ability
 to
 actually
 complete
 a


transaction


in
 all
 its
 respects
 is
 not
 far
 off.


That's
 that's
 an
 extraordinary
 change.


If
 you're
 a
 founder,
 you
 know
 naming


your
 startup
 takes
 forever.
 You
 finally


land
 on
 the
 perfect
 name
 only
 to
 find


out
 that
 Peter
 from
 Delaware
 got
 to


the.com
 first.
 So,
 you're
 stuck
 with
 two


bad
 options.
 Pay
 up
 and
 fund
 Peter's


retirement
 or
 tack
 on
 random
 words
 until


your
 domain
 looks
 like
 a
 Wi-Fi
 password.


But
 after
 all
 the
 time
 and
 money
 spent


on
 naming,
 you
 don't
 want
 that.
 And


thanks
 to
 tech
 domains,
 you
 don't
 have


to.
 Withte,
 you
 get
 the
 name
 you


actually
 want.
 It's
 clean,
 sharp,
 no


compromises.
 It
 instantly
 tells


investors
 and
 customers
 that
 you're


building
 technology.

Sounds
 like
 there's
 opportunities
 for


you
 from
 uh
 travel
 planning,
 knowing


your
 customer
 and
 and
 there's
 a
 lot


there,
 but
 there's
 also
 this
 sort
 of


disiniary


uh
 threat,
 I
 would
 imagine,
 where
 people


are
 purchasing
 their
 travel
 or
 planning


their
 travel
 in
 a
 completely
 different


way
 that
 doesn't
 involve
 something
 like


Expedia.
 How
 do
 you
 think
 about
 that?


They
 will
 unless
 we
 plan
 it
 better
 than


the
 next
 dope
 or
 the
 or
 a
 competitor
 of


ours.
 We
 have
 more
 information
 now
 than


anybody
 else
 has.
 So
 if
 we
 screw
 that


up,
 it's
 you
 know
 it's
 on
 us
 as
 they
 say


and
 we
 deserve
 to
 fail.
 But
 presumably


if
 we
 are
 satisfying
 the
 consumer


because
 of
 the
 data
 that
 we
 have
 which


is
 deep
 and
 vast


then
 I
 think
 they'll
 continue
 to
 engage


us.
 They'll
 continue
 to
 want
 us
 to
 do


that
 for
 them.
 I
 think
 from
 what
 I
 know


now
 it
 is
 not
 easy
 today
 for
 anyone
 else


to
 do
 that
 uh
 other
 than
 our
 competitors


can
 do
 that
 today
 but
 it's
 not
 easy
 for


any
 large
 language
 model
 or
 any
 modality


that
 that
 I
 know
 of
 so
 it's
 up
 to
 us
 to


do
 it
 it's
 a
 it's
 always
 listen
 one
 of


our
 we're
 the
 largest
 publisher
 that's


another
 business
 of
 ours
 called
 do-m


where
 we're
 with
 people
 magazine
 in


Better
 Homes
 and
 Gardens,
 Travel


Leisure,
 et
 60
 some
 odd
 magazines
 that


we
 publish
 digitally
 and
 also
 hugely


still
 in
 print.
 Obviously,
 that
 is
 a


business
 that's
 supported
 by


advertising.


And
 with
 the
 changes
 in
 search
 that


could
 disintermediate


those
 advertising
 opportunities.


The
 only
 thing
 that
 will
 save
 us
 is
 our


brands
 and
 whether
 our
 brands
 and
 what


we
 the
 content
 we
 make
 resonates
 enough


directly
 for
 people
 to
 recognize
 our


brand
 and
 want
 to
 be
 brand
 involved


rather
 than
 agnostic.
 I've
 I
 believe


until
 the
 last
 breath
 that
 brand
 value


is
 enduring,
 but
 it's
 got
 to
 be


differentiated.
 It's
 got
 to
 be
 clearly


leadly
 differentiated


and
 it's
 got
 to
 be
 of
 its
 own
 unique


value.
 If
 it
 is,
 I
 don't
 worry
 so
 much.


One
 way
 or
 the
 other,
 it'll
 get
 it
 it'll


get
 recognized.
 What
 opportunities
 do


you
 see
 in
 new
 business
 lines
 that
 maybe


you
 could
 acquire
 or
 data
 sets
 or


anything
 on
 the
 horizon
 where
 you're


like,
 "Oh,
 we
 can
 take
 advantage
 of
 AI


wave
 by
 doing
 something
 different
 versus


a
 legacy
 business."


Our
 company
 owns
 a
 large
 interest
 in
 MGM


resorts,
 which
 has
 nine
 resorts
 in
 Las


Vegas.


There's
 no
 way
 to
 disintermediate
 the


experience.


I
 mean,
 again,
 if
 we're
 in
 a
 simulation,


we
 can
 go
 into
 that
 route,
 but
 there's


no
 way
 as
 humans
 you
 can
 find
 an


experience
 that's
 going
 to
 divert
 you


from
 all
 the
 entertainment
 offerings


that
 a
 Las
 Vegas
 has
 to
 offer.
 It's


impervious
 to
 AI
 or
 to
 anything
 other


than
 whether
 or
 not
 you
 got
 something


that's
 pleasurable
 for
 a
 family
 and


exciting
 for
 people
 to
 come
 and
 see


concerts
 and
 all
 of
 the
 things
 that
 take


place
 at
 the
 kind
 of
 scale
 that
 takes


place
 in
 Las
 Vegas.
 What
 impressed
 me


about
 that
 in
 the
 very
 beginning
 was
 I


said
 nobody's
 ever
 going
 to
 make
 another


one
 of
 those.
 No
 matter
 how
 much
 anyone


tries,
 Las
 Vegas


is
 on
 its
 own.
 It's
 not
 necessarily
 for


everybody,
 but
 no
 one
 is
 going
 to


recreate
 the
 the
 infrastructure
 that


exists
 in
 that
 particular
 place.
 That's


unique
 and
 of
 I
 think
 enduring
 value.


And
 I'm
 fascinated
 by
 it
 because
 I
 just


think
 it
 is
 again
 an
 example
 of
 a
 place


where
 you
 can
 make
 something
 up
 today


and
 it
 comes
 out
 tomorrow.
 Meaning


there's
 nothing
 that
 stands
 in
 your
 way.


We
 just
 created
 a
 beach
 club
 with
 Cairo


at
 one
 of
 our
 properties
 that
 is
 just


it's
 just
 original
 and
 anything
 you
 can


think
 of.
 There's
 nothing
 to
 stand
 in


your
 way
 of
 making
 it
 up
 there.
 When
 did


you
 get
 involved
 with
 MGM?
 It
 was
 during


latter
 stage
 co
 now
 MGM
 was
 out
 of


business
 just
 like
 for
 a
 long
 time


Expedia
 was
 out
 of
 business.
 I
 mean


nobody
 could
 travel.
 Nobody
 could
 go.


Nobody
 with
 the
 entire
 city
 was
 shut


down.
 But
 I
 looked
 at
 it
 and
 I
 thought


just
 like
 I
 thought
 about
 travel.
 If


there's
 life,
 there's
 travel.
 Well,
 if


there's
 life
 and
 there's
 going
 to
 be


life,
 there's
 going
 to
 be
 Las
 Vegas.
 And


so
 MGM,
 its
 value
 had
 decreased


enormously.
 So
 we
 were
 able
 to
 purchase


a
 large
 percentage
 of
 it
 inexpensively


at
 the
 time
 because
 we
 believed
 that


once
 you
 reopened


it
 would
 be
 fine
 and
 uh
 we
 picked
 I


think
 the
 best
 entity
 to
 do
 it.
 all
 the


entities
 suffered
 the
 same
 situation.


But
 that's
 what
 intrigued
 me
 and
 and
 its


infrastructure,
 the
 fact
 that
 it
 had
 480


restaurants
 in
 one
 place,
 uh
 125


performance
 venues,


9
 million,
 I
 think
 it's
 9
 million
 feet


of
 convention.
 I
 mean,
 it
 just
 was
 so


once
 we
 learned
 about
 it,
 it
 was
 so
 vast


and
 deep.
 said,
 "How
 do
 you,
 you
 know,


how
 do
 you
 not
 do
 this?"
 That's
 one
 of


the
 things
 that
 motivated
 us.


Were
 you
 thinking
 about
 that
 through
 a


lens
 of
 AI
 at
 the
 time?


Well,
 to
 a
 to
 a
 degree
 for
 sure,
 the


internet
 world
 I
 think
 that
 everybody


participated
 in
 up
 until
 still
 true
 to


some
 degree
 today
 was
 so
 dominated
 by


Google.
 Uh
 Google
 absolute
 monopoly
 on


search
 and
 all
 your
 traffic,
 I
 mean
 at


least
 half
 your
 traffic
 if
 you
 were


healthy
 would
 come
 from
 people
 coming


directly
 to
 you.
 But
 the
 other
 half


without
 which
 you
 wouldn't
 be
 able
 to


survive
 came
 from
 Google
 and
 Google
 over


the
 years
 was
 consistently
 as
 it


monopoly
 grew
 was
 squeezing
 the
 people


who
 kind
 of
 lived
 on
 as
 a
 surf
 on
 its
 uh


land.


Yeah.
 And
 uh
 so
 I
 was
 always


I
 mean
 we
 were
 fighting
 that
 good
 fight


for
 20
 plus
 years
 and
 succeeding
 and


building
 some
 considerable
 assets.


But
 when
 I
 found
 an
 asset
 that
 couldn't


be
 disintermediated
 by
 search


I
 thought
 wow
 that
 wasn't
 AI
 that
 was


just
 the
 characteristics
 of
 the
 internet


environment.
 I
 want
 to
 come
 back
 to
 the


fact
 that
 you
 said
 sort
 of
 you
 were


direct
 and
 blunt
 as
 two
 of
 your
 your


sort
 of
 things
 that
 define
 you
 in
 a
 way


and
 most
 people
 shy
 away
 from


confrontation
 and
 you
 love
 it.
 Can
 you


tell
 me
 more
 about
 that?


I'm
 not
 really
 very
 good
 on
 my
 very
 own


staring
 at
 a
 wall
 or
 at
 a
 screen
 or
 at


something.
 I
 need
 the
 convulsive
 arguing


of
 ideas
 of
 people
 who
 have
 passion
 and


that's
 often
 got
 a
 lot
 of
 voices
 and
 a


lot
 of
 voices
 saying
 okay
 it's
 okay
 but


a
 lot
 of
 voices
 saying
 that's
 stupid
 or


whatever
 opinion
 trying
 to
 listen
 for


what
 rings
 your
 instinct
 is
 a
 process


that
 I
 think
 is
 best
 conducted
 in


extreme
 At


least
 for
 me
 and
 those
 that
 like
 being


around
 me
 and
 doing
 it
 and
 some
 do.
 I


love
 confrontation
 because
 in


confrontation
 out
 comes
 stuff
 that
 if


you're
 listening,


no
 matter
 how
 noisy
 that
 confrontation


gets,
 if
 your
 ear
 is
 open,
 you're


listening
 and
 you'll
 hear
 something.
 and


the
 thing
 you
 hear
 will
 be
 a
 better


truth,
 at least
 for
 me,
 than
 in
 any


other
 process.
 So,
 I
 do
 love
 it
 and
 I've


always
 prized
 it
 and
 if
 I'm
 not
 in
 an


environment
 where
 it's
 happening,
 I


think
 it's
 kind
 of
 dull
 outside,
 inside


or
 wherever.


Why
 do
 you
 think
 people
 aren't
 always


direct?
 Like,
 where
 does
 that
 come
 from?


Where
 does
 your
 directness
 come
 from?


Was
 that
 a
 learned
 thing
 or
 were
 you


always
 direct?


No,
 I
 always
 was.
 I
 don't
 know,
 Lon.
 My


interior
 thinking
 like
 many
 things
 with


me
 is
 I
 think
 it's
 a
 biological.
 I
 I


can't
 I
 can't
 do
 it
 any
 other
 way.
 It's


not
 like
 I
 made
 a
 choice.
 It's
 like
 I


said,
 "Oh,
 let's
 do
 that
 cuz
 it's
 better


than
 not
 doing
 that."
 So
 then
 in
 endless


situations
 where
 I
 see
 people
 run
 from


confrontation


and
 I
 of
 course
 can't
 do
 anything.
 Of


course
 you
 I
 tolerate
 it.
 But
 I
 tend
 to


kind
 of
 run
 from
 it.
 It
 just
 makes
 me


uncomfortable.
 Uh,
 and
 I
 understand


better
 those
 that
 are


incapable
 of
 it
 or
 worried
 about
 it
 than


I
 do
 me
 that's
 very
 capable
 of
 it.
 I


mean,
 I
 certainly
 understand
 why
 you


would
 be
 uh
 it
 it
 it's
 combative.
 It
 is


irritating.
 It
 is
 often
 frustrating.
 It


is
 a
 lot
 of
 things.
 I
 value
 those


things.
 Other
 people
 hate
 it.
 You
 have
 a


passage
 in
 your
 book
 that
 I
 I
 loved.


It's
 great
 selft
 talk
 and
 I'm
 going
 to


read
 it
 because
 I
 want
 to
 quote
 it.
 You


said
 like
 almost
 everything
 in
 my
 life


iteration
 one
 dumb
 step
 in
 front
 of
 the


other
 course
 correcting
 as
 you
 go
 is
 the


only
 process
 I'm
 any
 good
 at.


And
 this
 process
 became
 your
 mantra.
 Can


you
 unpack
 this
 for
 me
 a
 bit?


I
 learn
 from
 bouncing
 off
 the
 walls


uh
 of
 a
 bad
 direction
 or
 a
 mistake
 or


whatever.
 and
 course
 correcting
 and
 make


plus
 mistakes.
 Look,
 there
 are
 some


people
 for
 sure,
 relatively
 few,
 but


there
 are
 certainly
 people
 who
 don't


need
 to
 bother
 with
 that
 because
 they


are
 brilliant
 in
 ways
 I'm
 not.
 Uh,
 and


they
 are
 able
 to
 seemingly
 not
 have
 any


process.
 those
 that's
 that's
 where


genius
 lies
 for
 those
 people
 that
 are


fantastic.
 My
 observation
 is
 they
 have


other
 problems
 but
 for
 those
 of
 us
 who


are
 not
 particularly
 in
 something
 that


hasn't
 happened
 before
 now
 you
 know


things
 that
 are
 very
 known
 uh
 you
 can


find
 guideposts
 but
 in
 the
 world
 that
 I


am
 involved
 in
 uh
 which
 and
 the
 world


that
 I'm
 most
 happy
 to
 be
 involved
 in
 is


where
 something
 isn't
 known
 and
 you
 are


making
 progress
 as
 you
 go
 building
 a


company
 step
 by
 adapt
 an
 idea
 from
 a


whatever
 wherever
 it
 comes
 from
 to


whatever
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 that
 the
 only


way
 to
 proceed


is
 in
 that
 world
 of
 unknown
 of
 building


something
 is
 I
 can
 do
 it
 only
 by


bouncing
 off
 the
 wall
 going
 a
 step


forward
 pushing
 back
 being
 pushed
 back
 a


half
 a
 step
 and
 eventually


making
 less
 mistakes
 and
 busting


through.
 I
 think
 what
 keeps
 people
 from


doing
 that
 is
 they
 don't
 want
 to
 look


like
 an
 idiot.
 So,
 it
 prevents
 them
 from


starting
 in
 the
 first
 place.
 They
 don't


want
 to
 look
 like
 an
 amateur.
 They're


scared.
 But
 what's
 your
 reaction
 to


that?


It
 was
 a
 long
 time
 ago.
 I
 don't
 know
 who


said
 it
 or
 whatever,
 but
 it
 rang
 for
 me.


Very
 true.
 Somebody
 said
 something
 and


someone
 else
 said,
 "Well,
 that's


stupid."
 And
 the
 person
 said,
 "That's


what
 I
 want,
 stupid.
 The
 more
 I
 hear


stupid,
 the
 more
 I
 will
 hear
 ideas.
 And


so
 if
 you're
 in
 a
 process
 with
 other


people
 and
 any
 idea,


any
 idea,
 dumb,
 stupid,
 wrong,


uh
 any
 one
 of
 those
 words
 you
 want
 to


attach
 to
 it
 is
 a
 step
 to
 the
 next
 idea,


which
 isn't.
 You
 got
 to
 get
 stupid


before
 you
 get
 smart.
 You
 never
 feared


failure
 because
 you
 had
 one
 primary
 fear


most
 of
 your
 life
 which
 made
 it
 easier


for
 you
 to
 eliminate
 other
 fears.
 Yet


one
 of
 the
 things
 that
 stood
 out
 in
 the


book
 was
 you
 had
 this
 contradiction.
 You


struggled
 with
 this
 decision
 to
 leave


Fox
 and
 start
 your
 own
 thing.


Can
 you
 explore
 the
 tension
 there


between
 what
 was
 the
 fear
 going
 into


that?


I'd
 been
 working
 in
 companies
 since
 I


was
 19.
 That
 was
 30
 years
 later.
 I
 was


49.


I'd
 been
 a
 very
 good
 corporatist.
 I
 had


run
 two
 movie
 companies
 and
 incredibly


successful
 in
 the
 world
 that
 I
 was
 in.


And
 yet
 I
 yearned
 for
 something
 that
 was


my
 own.
 And
 it
 wasn't
 mine.
 I
 mean,
 uh,


I
 worked
 for
 large
 enterprises.
 And
 I


think
 any
 good
 employee
 believes
 and


acts
 like
 it's
 theirs.


But
 that's
 a
 delusion.
 It
 isn't
 theirs.


It's
 someone
 else's.
 And


that
 struck
 me
 and
 sat
 with
 me
 for


once
 I'd
 realized
 that
 I
 had
 this
 yearn


for
 independence.


Uh
 I
 was
 very
 comfortable.
 I
 I
 I
 was,
 as


I
 said,
 you
 couldn't
 be
 more
 successful


than
 I
 was
 at
 that
 time.
 We
 created
 the


fourth
 network.


Simpsons
 like
 you
 had


a
 very
 successful
 movie
 company
 etc
 etc


but
 it
 wasn't
 mine
 and
 I
 thought
 well


what
 am
 I
 going
 to
 do
 about
 that
 and
 I


came
 up
 with
 this
 thing
 in
 my
 brain
 and


I
 couldn't
 get
 out
 of
 my
 brain
 which
 was


either
 you
 are
 or
 you're
 not.
 It's


binary
 and
 you
 can
 do
 what
 most


executives
 do
 which
 is
 you
 rationalize


and
 you
 you
 know
 you
 live
 a
 pretty
 good


life.
 So
 you
 rationalize
 your
 situation


or
 you
 just
 say
 well
 this
 is
 what
 it
 is


and
 you
 don't
 have
 any
 yearn
 to
 be


independent
 or
 on
 your
 own.
 I
 did
 and
 I


knew
 that
 that
 was
 binary
 and
 it
 just


kept
 at
 me.
 I
 didn't
 wasn't
 that
 I
 was


afraid.
 It
 was
 I
 didn't
 want
 to
 confront


the
 very
 binariness
 of
 it
 because
 on
 the


other
 side
 of
 not
 being
 a
 corporatist
 or


being
 on
 your
 own
 or
 being
 independent


or
 wanting
 to
 build
 something
 yourself


is
 that
 you
 are
 very
 far
 away
 from
 the


mother
 church.
 You
 really
 are
 on
 your


own.
 And
 while
 it
 didn't
 frighten
 me,
 it


was
 like


such
 a
 different
 solar
 system
 that
 I


couldn't
 even
 conceive
 of
 it
 other
 than


in
 these
 terms
 of
 you
 are
 or
 you're


you're
 not.
 And
 I
 couldn't
 accept
 that
 I


was
 not.
 And
 that's
 that's
 what
 got
 me


out.
 It
 was
 my
 inability
 to
 accept
 that.


And
 so
 I
 left
 Fox
 and
 had
 no
 clue
 what
 I


was
 going
 to
 do.
 So
 up
 until
 that
 point


you
 had
 been
 on
 the
 receiving
 end
 of
 a


lot
 of
 these
 compensation
 agreements
 and


now
 you're
 setting
 them
 for
 your
 CEOs.


How
 do
 you
 think
 about
 that?
 Do
 you
 have


a
 different
 approach
 than
 others
 or
 how


do
 you
 think
 about
 incentives
 and


ownership?


I
 believe
 in
 risk
 and
 reward
 and
 I


believe
 if
 the
 risks
 if
 you
 take
 risks


and
 if
 you're
 doing
 any
 valuable
 work


you're
 going
 to
 be
 taking
 risks.
 If
 it


works
 out,
 the
 rewards
 should
 be
 there


and
 we
 now
 and
 always
 have
 hope
 always


will
 compensate
 people
 accordingly.


People
 can't
 gain
 wealth
 in
 the


enterprises
 that
 I'm
 involved
 in.


Something's
 wrong
 with
 the
 enterprise.


So,
 I'm
 about
 wanting
 people
 to
 give


people
 the
 opportunity
 to
 create
 real


wealth
 with
 unlimited
 upside
 for
 it.
 How


do
 you
 think
 about
 that?
 Can
 you
 walk
 me


through
 an
 example
 of
 sort
 of
 like
 how


you
 think
 about
 the
 principles
 of


compensation
 and
 alignment
 and
 base


salary
 and
 sort
 of
 incentives?


I
 think
 generally
 compensation
 that
 is


stockbased
 is
 not
 the
 best
 route.
 Uh
 it


depends
 again
 it's
 a
 broad
 general


statement
 for
 developed
 enterprises.


It's
 not
 the
 best
 route.
 uh
 the
 best


route
 is
 up
 to
 me
 a
 much
 simpler
 one.
 If


you
 create
 value
 working
 in
 a
 project


where
 you
 create
 value
 to
 whatever


degree
 you
 created,
 you
 should
 share
 in


that
 value
 on
 a
 cash
 basis.
 Meaning
 any


time
 period
 a
 year
 just
 take
 every
 year


if
 the
 enterprise
 does
 well
 you
 should


have
 a
 share
 of
 how
 well
 it
 does
 paid
 to


you
 at
 that
 moment.
 What
 I
 have
 learned


is
 that
 most
 people
 you
 think
 that


giving
 large
 populations
 options
 in
 the


company's
 securities


that
 they
 would
 hold
 on
 to
 them
 and
 what


you
 find
 out
 is


80
 90%


the
 first
 moment
 that
 they
 quote
 vest


they
 cash
 them.
 So
 it
 I
 don't
 know
 I've


got
 a
 lot
 of
 endless
 thoughts
 about
 that


that
 bore
 the
 hell
 out
 of
 everyone.
 Well


they
 won't
 bore
 me.
 I'm
 really
 curious


about
 it
 actually
 because
 you
 know


stockbased
 compensation
 is
 um
 it


distorts
 a
 lot
 of the
 economics
 of
 the


business
 and
 people
 think
 that
 it


incentivizes
 or
 retains
 people
 when


you've
 had
 no
 problem.


I
 don't
 believe
 by
 the
 way
 I
 also
 I
 I've


heard
 retention
 arguments


from
 time
 immemorial


decades
 of
 well
 we
 do
 this
 to
 retain


people.
 I
 think
 that's
 ridiculous.
 to


retain
 people.
 People
 stay
 in
 your


enterprise


because
 they
 like
 what
 they
 do
 and


there's
 opportunity
 there.
 Uh
 a
 handcuff


so
 to
 speak
 or
 they
 stay
 because
 they


haven't
 vested
 in
 this
 or
 that.
 I
 think


that's
 hogwash.


I
 don't
 believe
 in
 retention.
 I
 believe


in
 opportunity.


I
 like
 the
 idea
 of
 sort
 of
 participating


in
 the
 success
 of
 the
 organization.
 How


do
 you
 think
 about
 it
 as
 a
 new
 CEO


coming
 in
 maybe
 to
 a
 mature
 business
 and


do
 you
 set
 the
 compensation
 based
 on


above
 baseline
 for
 next
 year
 or
 how
 do


you
 think
 about
 that?


You
 certainly
 if
 you
 have
 an
 ongoing


business


you're
 really
 compensating
 people
 for


growth.
 I
 mean
 other
 than
 base
 tasks


that
 need
 to
 be
 performed.
 You
 want


growth.
 If
 people
 can
 provide
 you
 with


growth
 you
 should
 give
 them
 a
 share
 of


that
 growth.
 If
 they
 want
 to
 be
 an


owner,
 they
 can
 take
 their
 cash


compensation
 and
 then
 go
 buy
 stock.


Yes,
 absolutely.
 Give
 them
 their


resources
 and
 let
 them
 go
 do
 it.
 But
 the


wealth
 you
 can
 create
 for
 them,
 it


should
 be
 based
 upon
 what
 they
 do
 and


what
 they
 produce.


Have
 you
 ever
 lost
 anybody
 ever
 because


you
 wouldn't
 give
 stock
 options?


No,
 I
 don't
 think
 so.
 See,
 people
 might


say
 yes,
 but
 I
 don't
 think
 so.
 One
 of
 my


friends
 had
 a
 clever
 idea
 because
 he


doesn't
 give
 stock
 options.
 So
 when
 he


was
 recruiting
 people,
 they
 were
 like,


"We're
 walking
 away
 from
 all
 these


options."
 And
 he's
 like, "I'll
 give
 you


the
 exact
 same
 options
 at
 the
 company


you're
 leaving,
 but
 I'm
 not
 going
 to


give
 you
 options
 in
 the
 company
 you're


coming
 to."


That's
 a
 good
 idea.
 I
 like
 that.


One
 of
 the
 the
 moments
 that
 really
 stuck


out
 in
 your
 book,
 you
 had
 this
 core


principle
 and
 you
 said
 that
 the
 clock


starts
 ticking
 the
 moment
 you're
 made


aware
 of
 the
 incident.
 From
 the
 second


from
 that
 second,
 you're
 responsible
 for


the
 actions.
 And
 I
 think
 you
 hit
 on
 that


in
 relation
 to
 two
 of
 your
 marketing


people
 who
 were
 who
 were
 stealing
 from


you.
 Can
 you
 tell
 me
 that
 story
 and
 sort


of
 what
 happened
 and
 what
 the


realization
 was?
 It
 was
 my
 first


exposure
 to
 something
 like
 that
 where


uh
 we
 found
 out
 that
 two
 of
 our
 key


executives
 had
 been
 stealing
 and
 uh


and
 and
 one
 of
 my
 colleagues
 said,
 you


know,


we
 can
 bury
 this.
 Another
 of
 my


colleagues
 said,
 "Well,
 actually,
 one
 of


the
 people
 who
 did
 this,
 they
 threatened


you
 very
 directly,
 kind
 of
 blackmail
 and


saying
 if
 you
 expose
 this
 or
 if
 you


report
 this
 to
 the
 authorities,
 we'll
 do


this
 terribly
 damaging
 thing,
 which
 was


so
 heinous
 to
 me."
 But
 what
 I
 realized


and
 it
 is
 a
 great
 lesson
 for
 me


presuming
 you
 run
 a
 straight


organization
 or
 meaning
 in
 other
 words


presuming
 you're
 not
 engaged
 in


nefarious
 stuff
 but
 if
 something
 happens


and
 it
 doesn't
 necessarily
 have
 to
 be


somebody
 stealing.
 Could
 be
 one
 of
 your


products
 has
 some
 antisocial
 thing
 that


you
 discover
 or
 somebody
 in
 your


organization
 has
 just
 done
 something


that
 is
 unethical.
 Whatever
 it
 is
 and
 so


long
 as
 you're
 running
 a
 general
 like


you
 have
 checks
 and
 balances
 up
 until


that
 moment
 that
 you
 know
 it,
 you
 have


no
 issue
 with
 culpability,
 you
 have
 no


agency,
 you
 have
 no
 nothing.
 But
 the


second
 you
 know
 it,
 the
 clock
 is
 ticking


and
 you
 have
 to
 have
 that
 in
 your
 brain.


You
 have
 to
 know
 that
 every
 second
 after


that,
 what
 you
 do
 about
 that


is
 now
 your
 absolute
 responsibility.
 I


have
 a
 like
 a
 word
 bubble
 above
 my
 head


about
 it,
 but
 it
 is
 a
 great
 discipline.


And
 I've
 seen
 so
 many
 situations
 where


that
 was
 not
 recognized
 where


proarication
 or
 other
 methods
 where


you're
 not
 aware
 that
 that
 clock
 ticks


and
 every
 action
 you
 take
 is
 then
 your


actions
 before
 that
 you
 got
 no
 fault.
 I


want
 to
 come
 to
 public
 broadcasting
 for


a
 second.
 One
 of
 the
 the
 things
 that
 I


don't
 see
 getting
 enough
 attention
 that


you
 wrote
 about
 was
 the
 fairness


doctrine.
 I'm
 wondering
 if
 you
 can


explain
 what
 that
 is
 and
 what
 the


impacts
 been
 in
 getting
 rid
 of
 it.
 Well,


the
 fairness
 doctrine
 was
 a
 fundamental


tenant
 of
 broadcasting


which
 meant
 that
 you
 had
 to
 in
 any


dissemination
 of
 anything
 you
 had
 to


present
 if
 there
 were
 two
 sides
 to
 an


argument
 you
 had
 to
 present
 them
 fairly.


You
 had
 to
 be
 fair
 in
 your
 presentation.


And
 this
 was
 along
 with
 a
 lot
 of
 other


regulation
 thrown
 out
 some
 time
 ago
 and


I
 think
 is
 uh
 very
 unfortunate
 for
 the


common
 wheel
 as
 they
 say.
 Meaning
 that


that
 proviso
 for
 broadcasters
 that
 and


the
 fact
 that
 they
 still
 are
 but
 they


were
 licensed
 because
 they
 were
 using


the
 public
 airways
 belong
 to
 the
 public.


And
 so
 you
 felt
 a
 responsibility
 if
 you


were
 in
 that
 world
 to
 do
 the
 right


thing.
 And
 we
 can
 define
 right
 in
 all


sorts
 of
 different
 ways,
 but
 we
 all
 know


what
 the
 mainstream
 of
 right
 is
 to
 a


very
 large
 degree.
 That's
 kind
 of
 been


tossed
 and
 I
 think
 it's
 just
 very


unfortunate.


How
 do
 you
 think
 about
 the
 media


landscape
 today
 in
 terms
 of
 information,


disinformation,
 and
 how
 it's
 all
 playing


out
 with
 people?


Oh
 my
 god.
 I
 mean
 it's
 we're
 in
 a
 very


difficult
 period
 about
 information
 about


facts.
 There
 is
 so
 much
 from
 our


leadership


that
 uh
 is
 not
 based
 on
 facts
 is
 not


true.
 It's
 promotional
 or
 it's
 just


outright


not
 factual.


And
 we
 hear
 this
 thing
 about
 quote
 fake


news


principally
 by
 people
 who
 are
 faking


news.
 Uh,
 not
 always,
 of
 course.
 And


listen,
 I
 hate
 the
 right
 as
 much
 as
 far


right
 as
 much
 as
 I
 hate
 the,
 you
 know,


the
 the
 woke
 left
 is
 as
 horrible
 as
 the


woke
 right
 or
 woke
 right
 is
 whatever.


Say
 it
 when
 any
 way
 you
 like.
 But
 we


have
 lost
 a
 central
 factbased


method
 for
 the
 dissemination
 of
 call
 it


news
 broadly
 speaking.
 And
 this
 is
 every


bird
 brain
 knows
 this.
 Most
 of
 the


talkers
 are
 talking
 essentially
 to


themselves
 and
 to
 their
 audience,


reinforcing


what
 they
 think,
 which
 is
 not


necessarily
 factual.
 Wherever
 you
 are
 in


the
 spectrum,
 the
 biggest
 issue
 we
 have


is


having
 faith
 and
 belief
 in
 information


and
 that's
 that's
 that's
 a
 sorry
 state


and
 there
 are
 some
 trusted
 sources


relatively
 few.


We
 always
 end
 these
 interviews
 with
 the


same
 question
 Barry
 which
 is
 what
 is


success
 for
 you?


Well,
 success
 for
 me
 uh
 is
 is
 remaining


curious.
 I
 the
 only
 thing
 that
 that
 the


only
 thing
 that


drives
 me
 is
 is
 my
 curiosity


and
 if
 I'm
 curious


then
 that
 is
 success.


I
 love
 that
 answer.
 Uh
 thank
 you
 very


much
 for
 the
 time
 today.


Nice
 to
 be

 you.
