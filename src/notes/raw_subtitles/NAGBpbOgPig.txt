Hi
 everyone,
 I'm
 Nicolola
 Tangan,
 the


CEO
 of
 the
 Norwegian
 Sovereign
 Wealth


Fund
 and
 today
 I'm
 in
 really
 good


company
 with
 Rob
 Wallace
 who's
 built
 one


of
 the
 most
 impressive
 carriers
 in


institutional
 investing.
 Now
 Rob
 is
 the


president
 and
 CEO
 of
 Stanford
 Management


Company
 and
 if
 you
 are
 on
 screen
 you
 can


see
 the
 wonderful
 campus
 behind
 him.
 I


mean
 my
 hey
 I'm
 I'm
 envious
 here.
 The
 uh


Stanford
 endowment
 runs
 more
 than
 $40


billion
 and
 is
 one
 of
 the
 most


successful
 university
 endowments


anywhere.
 His
 journey
 took
 him
 from


learning
 under
 uh
 under
 Davis
 Swenson
 at


Yale
 onto
 leading
 ELA
 advisors
 uh


Londonbased
 investment
 firm
 before


joining
 Stanford
 in
 2015
 and
 here
 he
 has


delivered
 exceptional
 returns.
 So
 uh


well
 done
 Rob
 and
 great
 to
 have
 you
 on.


>> Nice
 to
 be
 with
 you
 Nikico.
 just
 kick


off.
 What's
 the
 kind
 of
 core
 investment


philosophy
 at
 Stanford?


>> Yeah,
 it's
 um
 it's
 actually
 reasonably


simple.
 So,
 uh
 we
 we
 start
 with
 like
 any


institutional
 investor,
 we
 start
 with


the
 goals
 we
 have
 for
 the
 endowment.
 And


if
 you're
 a
 perpetual
 educational


endowment
 like
 Stanford,
 you
 generally


have
 two
 primary
 goals.
 The
 first
 is
 you


want
 your
 endowment
 to
 provide
 a


material
 amount
 of
 support
 for
 the


current
 generations
 of
 students
 and


scholars.
 So
 this
 year
 we're


distributing
 about
 uh
 $2
 billion
 from


the
 Stanford
 Endowment
 to
 support
 the


current
 operating
 budget
 of
 Stanford.
 Uh


and
 that
 support
 uh
 is
 one
 of
 the


reasons
 that
 Stanford
 is
 uh
 one
 of
 the


least
 expensive
 private
 four-year


colleges
 to
 attend
 in
 the
 country.
 Uh


it's
 one
 of
 the
 reasons
 that
 nearly
 90%


of
 undergrads
 at
 Stanford
 graduate
 with


no
 student
 debt.
 Um,
 and
 it's
 one
 of
 the


reasons
 that
 uh
 uh
 you
 know
 that
 that
 we


can
 offer
 need-b
 blind
 admission
 to
 to


to
 undergraduate
 students.
 And
 so
 so
 so


and
 and
 and
 research
 is
 supported
 by


with
 that
 $2
 billion
 of
 course.


>> So
 that's
 goal
 number
 one.
 Uh
 you
 want


to
 be
 impactful
 to
 the
 current
 students


and
 scholars
 at
 at at
 your
 institution.


>> The
 second
 goal
 and
 that's
 that
 $2


million
 is
 about
 5%
 of
 the
 endowment.


The
 second
 goal
 is
 we
 want
 to
 be
 at


least
 as
 supportive
 for
 all
 future


generations
 of
 students
 and
 scholars.


And
 there's
 a
 little
 tension
 that
 that


that
 comes
 when
 you
 have
 both
 of
 these


goals.
 One,
 you
 know,
 one
 pushes
 you


towards
 an
 investment
 program
 that
 has
 a


lot
 of
 stability
 and
 the
 other
 pushes


you
 towards
 wanting
 to
 preserve


purchasing
 power
 so
 that
 you
 can
 spend


5%
 a
 year
 and
 also
 offset
 the
 erosion


that
 accompanies
 inflation.
 And
 the


inflation
 that
 we
 care
 about
 at
 Stanford


is
 higher
 education
 price
 inflation,


which
 tends
 to
 run
 a
 little
 bit
 higher


than
 consumer
 price
 inflation.
 So
 if


you're
 if
 you're
 distributing
 5%
 of
 your


endowment
 every
 year
 and
 higher


education
 price
 inflation
 is
 3
 or
 4%,


you
 know,
 you
 need
 an
 expected
 return
 in


your
 investment
 program
 of
 around
 9%.
 So


the
 goals
 we
 have
 for
 the
 endowment


suggest
 an
 investment
 strategy
 that
 has


an
 equity
 bias
 because
 we
 need
 a
 pretty


high
 return.
 So
 roughly
 70%
 of
 the


portfolio
 is
 invested
 in
 equities
 here


of
 one
 type
 or
 another
 and
 30%
 is
 in


things
 that
 are
 less
 risky
 than
 equity.


Uh
 and
 when
 we
 put
 all
 that
 together
 uh


we
 think
 we
 have
 a
 chance
 of
 being
 able


over
 the
 very
 long
 run
 to
 provide
 a


material
 level
 of
 support
 for
 the
 for


the
 students
 and
 scholars
 at
 Stanford


and
 still
 preserve
 purchasing
 power
 and


that's
 really
 the
 that's
 the
 crux
 of
 the


investment
 strategy.


>> How
 would
 you
 say
 it
 differs
 from
 other


university
 endowments?
 Is
 it
 different


or
 is
 that
 pretty
 much
 the
 model
 for


most?


>> I
 think
 those
 core
 goals
 are
 the
 same.


And
 so
 I
 mean
 everybody
 might
 have
 a


different
 take
 on
 the
 amount
 of
 risk


they
 need
 in
 their
 portfolio
 to
 hit


their
 hit
 their
 expected
 return.
 Uh
 some


people
 might
 say
 a
 60/40
 blend
 is
 is


more
 appropriate.
 Others
 might
 say
 8020.


I
 think
 7030
 is
 roughly
 probably
 in
 the


middle
 of
 the
 pack.
 uh
 and
 um
 the
 you


know
 the
 the
 differences
 really
 mostly


would
 come
 in
 the
 how
 you
 how
 you


execute
 how
 you
 execute
 on
 that
 general


strategy
 what
 constitutes
 the
 70
 what


constitutes
 the
 30
 we
 I'm
 sure
 we'll
 get


into
 that
 but
 uh
 I
 think
 at
 the
 high
 at


the
 highest
 level
 most
 endowments
 are


managed
 reasonably
 similarly
 these
 days


>> now
 um
 in
 a
 way
 the
 endowment
 model
 was


invented
 by
 David
 Swenson
 uh
 at
 Yale
 and


you
 trained
 under
 him
 what
 was
 the
 most


valuable
 thing
 you
 learned?


>> Oh
 gosh.
 Um


>> uh
 in
 a
 in
 a
 in
 a
 few
 minutes.


>> Yeah.
 A
 few
 hours.
 Uh
 a
 few
 I
 think
 a


few
 key
 things.
 The
 importance
 of


thinking
 from
 first
 principles
 and


having
 a
 lot
 of
 analytical
 rigor
 uh


backing
 up
 your
 work.
 Uh
 D
 remind
 us


remind
 us
 the
 first
 principle.
 First


principles
 means
 thinking
 from
 uh
 from
 a


premise,
 a
 logical
 premise
 and


supporting
 each
 step
 of
 your
 uh


decision-making
 process
 with
 logic


informed
 by
 data.
 And
 that's
 where
 the


rigor
 comes
 in.
 You
 want
 to
 have
 a
 lot


of
 a
 lot
 of
 data
 supporting
 what
 you
 do


in
 your
 in
 your
 investment
 work.
 And


that's
 really
 one
 of
 the
 things
 that
 I


think
 differentiates
 investment
 from
 say


speculation,
 right?
 So
 investors
 are


very
 disciplined.
 there.
 You
 know,


particularly
 if
 you're
 managing
 a


perpetual
 endowment
 that
 has
 a
 very
 very


longterm
 horizon
 like
 a
 farm
 and
 wealth


fund,
 you
 know,
 you
 need
 you
 really
 need


to
 be
 very
 very
 disciplined
 because


you're
 making
 decisions
 that
 uh
 that
 are


often
 five
 or
 seven
 or
 10
 or
 even
 12
 or


15
 years
 out
 in
 in in
 terms
 of
 their


investment
 horizon.
 And
 and
 so
 uh
 you


know,
 it
 really
 matters
 what
 you're


doing
 with
 uh
 with
 each
 decision
 that


you
 make.
 And
 so
 David
 was
 great
 about


bringing
 first
 principles
 thinking
 and
 a


lot
 of
 rigor
 uh
 to
 the
 way
 he
 invested


capital.
 And
 the
 other
 thing
 that
 I


learned
 from
 David
 is
 the
 importance
 of


sort
 of
 paying
 attention
 to
 the


intersection
 of
 supply
 and
 demand
 and


fear
 and
 greed.
 He
 was
 fantastic
 at


understanding
 where
 where
 the


opportunity
 set
 was
 in
 that
 in
 that


space.
 uh
 and
 he
 was
 um
 you
 know
 he
 was


part
 uh
 you
 know
 part
 scientist
 but
 also


part
 psychologist
 and
 I
 think
 I
 I
 saw


him
 put
 that
 into
 practice.
 He
 was


incredibly
 good
 with
 people.
 He
 had
 a


very
 strong
 ability
 to
 reason


qualitatively
 as
 well
 as
 quantitatively.


Um,
 and
 that
 turns
 out
 to
 be
 a
 really


important
 skill
 when
 you're
 um
 when
 you


have
 an
 a
 model
 like
 we
 do
 at
 Stanford


and
 like
 David
 pioneered
 at
 Yale,
 uh,


where
 you're
 working
 with
 external


partners
 to
 actually
 execute
 the


individual
 security
 level
 decisions
 in


your
 portfolio.
 That
 ability
 to


understand
 your
 partner,
 to
 understand


what
 motivates
 them,
 to
 understand
 their


skill,
 their
 level
 of
 discipline,
 their


temperament,
 their
 character,
 and
 their


alignment
 of
 interest
 with
 you
 and
 your


institution.
 Alignment
 of
 interest,
 the


kind
 of
 principal
 agent
 attention
 was


something
 that
 David
 paid
 enormous


attention
 to.


>> So,
 so,
 so
 Rob,
 given
 that
 training,


what
 kind
 of
 changes
 did
 you
 make
 to
 the


Stanford
 portfolio
 when
 you
 arrived?


>> Yeah,
 so
 I
 arrived
 in
 2015.
 uh
 portfolio


was
 uh
 was
 about
 $20
 billion
 and
 and
 one


of
 the
 things
 that
 I
 noticed
 uh
 was
 we


were
 dramatically
 overly
 diversified.


Not
 at
 the
 level
 of
 asset
 allocation.


That
 was
 fine.
 You
 want
 to
 be


diversified
 in
 terms
 of
 your
 asset


allocation,
 but
 within
 each
 asset
 class,


we
 had
 far
 too
 many
 investments.
 So
 for


us,
 that
 means
 we
 had
 far
 too
 many


external
 partners.
 We
 had
 300
 external


partners
 helping
 us
 manage
 a
 $20
 billion


portfolio.
 I
 remember
 real
 estate
 was
 8%


of
 the
 portfolio
 in
 2015
 and
 we
 had
 53


external
 partners
 helping
 us
 manage
 8%


of
 the
 portfolio.
 So
 you
 know
 uh


dramatically
 overly
 diversified
 and
 the


reason
 for
 that
 was
 the
 uh
 the
 the


culture
 of
 the
 office
 here
 and
 the


decision-m
 model
 that
 the
 office
 had


been
 following
 fostered
 that
 type
 of


very
 diversified
 kind
 of
 low
 conviction


investment.
 So,
 one
 of
 the
 things
 that


um
 and
 it
 had
 done
 okay,
 but
 there
 was


an
 opportunity
 to
 make
 it
 better.
 Uh
 and


the
 the
 way
 that
 I
 thought
 we
 would
 make


it
 better
 is
 we
 needed
 to
 have
 a
 much


higher
 conviction,
 more
 concentrated


portfolio
 with
 fewer
 partners
 that
 were


more
 carefully
 selected
 and
 then
 really


critically
 important,
 Nikolai,
 with
 whom


we
 could
 develop
 a
 strong,
 trustful
 uh


knowledgeable
 relationship.
 you
 know,
 we


we
 think
 of
 them
 as
 partners
 because


we're
 really
 working
 in
 a
 hopefully
 a


constructive
 and
 supportive
 way
 with
 our


partners,
 understanding
 how
 their


opportunity
 set
 evolves,
 being
 able
 to


lean
 into
 the
 win,
 being
 able
 to
 help


them
 be
 contrarian
 when
 their


opportunity
 set
 is
 particularly


attractive.
 So,
 that
 usually
 means
 their


performance
 is
 has
 recently
 been
 poor


when
 their
 opportunity
 set
 is


attractive.
 And
 you
 know,
 you
 need
 to


really
 know
 your
 partner
 and
 have
 huge


confidence
 in
 their
 work
 and
 and
 and


whether
 you're
 aligned
 with
 them
 uh
 to


send
 them
 money
 when
 their
 performance


is
 has
 been
 poor.
 And
 so
 we
 do
 that


routinely,
 but
 to
 have
 that
 type
 of


partnership
 with
 with
 people,
 you
 can't


have
 too
 many
 of
 them.
 So
 we
 wanted
 to


go
 from
 300
 to
 something
 less
 than
 a
 100


>> which
 should,
 you
 know,
 not
 be
 uh
 not
 be


sort
 of
 at
 at
 a
 high
 level,
 not
 be
 too


hard,
 not
 too
 too
 demanding.
 Rob,
 what's


the
 biggest
 challenge
 facing
 the


endowment
 model
 just
 now?


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 I
 mean,
 it
 certainly
 gets
 a


lot
 of
 attention
 in
 the
 media.
 You'll


hear
 things
 frequently
 or
 read
 things


that,
 you
 know,
 the
 endowment
 model
 is


dead.
 And
 uh
 and
 I
 I
 think
 one
 of
 the


challenges
 is
 that
 public
 equity
 markets


have
 been
 so
 strong
 and
 particularly
 the


US
 public
 equity
 market
 has
 been
 so


strong
 for
 the
 last
 10
 or
 15
 years.


really
 coming
 out
 of
 the
 '08
 crisis,
 I


think
 it's
 just
 been
 on
 a
 nearly


historic
 uh
 bull
 market
 uh
 punctuated
 by


only
 a
 couple
 a
 couple
 corrections.
 And


so
 valuations
 now
 in
 the
 US
 are
 at
 near


all-time
 highs.
 I
 think
 they're
 the
 only


time
 the
 US
 market's
 been
 more
 highly


valued
 on
 several
 important
 metrics.
 It


was
 1999
 than
 it
 is
 currently.
 And
 so,


you
 know,
 we're
 at
 a
 very
 high
 level
 of


valuation.
 And
 that's
 what
 happens
 after


a
 15-year
 bull
 market.
 you
 know,
 you


have
 you
 have
 multiple
 expansion


outpacing
 earnings.
 We've
 had
 tremendous


earnings
 growth
 in
 the
 United
 States,


but
 we've
 had
 a
 lot
 of
 multiple


expansion
 on
 top
 of
 it.
 So
 when
 you
 have


that
 type
 of
 uh
 result
 in
 in
 a
 major


asset
 class
 like
 US
 public
 equity
 you


know
 a
 more
 diversified
 portfolio
 like


endowments
 tend
 to
 run
 for
 reasons
 we


can
 talk
 about
 important
 reasons
 uh
 will


you
 know
 will
 look
 a
 little
 less
 good
 I


think
 than
 just
 a
 you
 know
 a
 single


asset
 class
 portfolio
 that
 happens
 to
 be


all
 in
 US
 equity.
 So
 people
 kind
 of
 say


that
 the
 endowment
 model's
 dead
 because


of
 that.
 There's
 also
 been
 a
 lot
 of


debate
 about
 uh
 private
 assets.
 So
 with


private
 assets
 we
 mean
 uh
 you
 know


private
 equity,
 venture
 capital
 and
 so


on.
 Just
 what's
 what's
 your
 take
 on
 that


just
 now?


>> I
 mean
 I
 think
 it's
 probably
 maybe
 to


back
 up
 and
 say
 when
 you
 have
 private


equity
 and
 early
 stage
 venture
 capital


and
 things
 like
 that
 in
 your
 portfolio,


you
 have
 to
 understand
 that
 um
 you
 know


the
 dispersion
 of
 outcomes
 in
 those


asset
 classes
 is
 very
 very
 wide.
 uh
 and


they're
 very
 expensive
 to
 access
 and


you're
 going
 to
 you
 need
 to
 be


absolutely
 sure
 that
 you
 understand
 your


ability
 to
 be
 in
 the
 top
 of
 the
 range


with
 your
 work
 net
 of
 these
 enormous


fees
 that
 you
 pay
 to
 access
 the
 asset


class
 because
 the
 middle
 of
 the
 range
 is


not
 very
 good
 and
 there's
 a
 huge
 left


tail
 you
 know
 below
 the
 middle
 of
 the


range
 where
 half
 the
 investors
 outcomes


sit
 that's
 really
 quite
 poor
 certainly


less
 attractive
 than
 you
 know
 US
 public


equity
 for
 instance.
 So,


>> so,
 so
 how
 do
 you
 make
 sure
 you
 end
 up


in
 the
 top
 court?


>> Well,
 it
 takes
 a
 lot
 of
 work,
 takes
 a


lot
 of
 rigor,
 it
 takes
 an
 enormous


amount
 of
 care
 and
 careful
 selection
 of


your
 partners
 and
 close
 work
 with
 your


partners
 once
 you
 are
 working
 with
 them.


And
 and
 that's
 one
 of
 the
 reasons
 you


don't
 want
 to
 have
 too
 many
 partners.


It's
 it's
 hard
 to
 find
 a
 lot
 of
 good


early
 stage
 venture
 capitalists.
 I
 mean


there's
 there's
 probably,
 you
 know,
 10


or
 12
 in
 the
 United
 States
 that
 generate


the
 substantial
 majority
 of
 all
 the


profits
 generated
 in
 in
 any
 venture


cycle.
 And
 so,
 you
 know,
 in
 venture
 in


particular,
 but
 also
 in
 buyout
 and
 other


private
 categories,
 you
 absolutely
 need


to
 be
 at
 the
 top
 of
 the
 the


distribution.


>> How
 helpful
 is
 it
 to
 be
 Stanford?
 I


mean,
 you
 are
 the
 dream
 client,
 right?


And
 a
 lot
 of
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 and
 a
 lot
 of


the
 whiz
 kids
 went
 to
 Stanford,
 too.


>> That's
 right.
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 whiz
 kids
 and


Stanford
 is
 sort
 of
 one
 of
 the
 one
 of


the
 parents
 of
 Silicon
 Valley
 for
 sure


and
 we
 benefit
 enormously
 in
 the
 uh
 in


the
 investment
 office
 from
 having
 that


that
 network.
 Uh
 and
 uh
 it
 helps
 it


helps
 a
 lot
 uh
 and
 we
 um
 you
 know
 we
 we


should
 be
 able
 to
 find
 ways
 to
 um
 create


to
 some
 degree
 our
 own
 venture


opportunities
 and
 we've
 been
 working
 on


that
 over
 the
 last
 decade.
 That's


something
 that
 for
 instance
 I
 could
 not


have
 done
 uh
 when
 I
 was
 working
 in


London
 but
 I
 can
 do
 here
 in
 uh
 in


PaloAlto.


>> How
 do
 you
 select
 private
 equity


partners?


>> Very
 carefully.
 Um
 we
 we
 will
 usually
 uh


almost
 all
 of
 them
 are
 groups
 that
 we


find
 ourselves
 or
 are
 referred
 to
 us
 in


some
 sort
 of
 qualified
 way
 from
 our


network.
 We
 very
 very
 seldom
 end
 up


working
 with
 a
 partner
 that
 you
 know


that
 is
 introduced
 to
 us
 from
 a
 broker


or
 cold
 calls
 us.
 So
 it's
 kind
 of
 a


curated
 um
 set
 from
 which
 we
 then
 um
 the


initial
 step
 would
 be
 spending
 a
 lot
 of


time
 with
 the
 partner
 over
 a
 series
 of


meetings
 in
 person
 uh
 and
 you
 know
 going


through
 all
 the
 things
 I
 mentioned


earlier.
 What
 is
 their
 process?
 What
 is


their
 motivation?
 How
 do
 they
 are
 they


rigorous?
 What
 is
 their
 investment


judgment
 like?
 What's
 their
 philosophy?


What
 are
 their
 ethics?
 Are
 they
 aligned


with
 Stanford?
 There's
 a
 lot
 of
 smart


people
 in
 in
 private
 equity
 who
 do


good
 work,
 but
 um
 who
 are
 not,
 you
 know,


who
 are
 going
 to
 make
 a
 lot
 of
 money
 for


themselves
 before
 you.
 What
 you
 really


need
 is
 that
 incredible
 talent
 and
 that


incredible
 discipline
 that
 will
 treat


Stanford's
 capital
 like
 it's
 their
 own


capital
 or
 better.
 And
 then
 you're


aligned
 and
 and
 and
 you
 have
 a
 better


chance
 of
 success
 in
 the
 long
 run.
 Uh


Rob,
 perhaps
 for
 the
 sake
 of
 full


disclosure,
 uh
 I
 could
 say
 that
 uh
 I
 in


my
 previous
 life
 ran
 some
 capital
 uh
 for


the
 great
 university
 and
 uh
 and
 my
 was


that
 a
 rigorous
 process
 to
 go
 through


that
 selection.
 Uh


>> that's
 right.
 Well,
 you
 you
 build
 a


great
 a
 great
 firm
 and
 we
 were
 uh


delighted
 to
 uh
 you
 know
 to
 to
 work
 with


you
 and
 still
 are.


>> So
 uh
 you
 know,
 I've
 been
 on
 that
 side


of
 it.
 Uh
 but
 if
 you
 were
 to
 look
 at
 um


the
 hallmarks
 of
 a
 great
 investment


organization,
 what
 what
 what
 is
 it?


>> I
 mean,
 I
 think
 certainly
 you
 need
 to
 be


uh
 if
 you're
 managing
 an
 endowment
 that


that
 has
 the
 type
 of
 asset
 allocation


that
 we
 have
 where
 you're
 investing
 in


these
 alternative
 asset
 classes
 and


you're
 trying
 to
 invest4
 or
 $50
 billion,


it's
 hard.
 You
 need
 to
 be
 early.
 You


need
 to
 create
 your
 own
 opportunities.


You're
 never
 going
 to
 get
 enough
 capital


to
 work
 with
 a
 disciplined
 partner


that's
 not
 going
 to
 outgrow
 their


opportunity
 set
 with
 too
 much
 capital.


Um,
 you're
 never
 going
 to
 get
 enough
 of


your
 endowment
 to
 work
 to
 have
 a
 high


conviction
 portfolio
 if
 you're
 not
 there


first.
 If
 you're
 not
 there
 early.
 So,


you
 need
 to
 be
 early.
 You
 need
 to
 be


creative.
 You
 need
 to
 be
 um,
 you
 know,


very
 forwardleaning
 in
 terms
 of
 your


ability
 to
 find
 new
 opportunities.
 In


order
 to
 do
 that
 work,
 you
 need
 a
 team


that's
 energetic,
 uh
 that's
 open-minded,


uh
 that's
 passionate
 about
 their
 work,


uh
 that
 uh
 you
 know
 that
 um
 work
 well


together.
 So,
 one
 of
 the
 things
 we
 uh


we've
 we
 care
 a
 lot
 about
 at
 at
 Stanford


Management
 Company
 is
 having
 a
 team
 of


individual
 very
 high
 performers,
 people


that
 seek
 and
 accept
 a
 high
 degree
 of


personal
 responsibility,
 but
 who
 care


more
 about
 the
 overall
 result
 of
 the


team,
 the
 overall
 result
 of
 the


endowment
 than
 their
 own
 individual
 uh


area.
 And
 when
 you
 have
 that
 type
 of


incredible
 motivated
 person
 that
 has


very
 low
 ego
 and
 and
 is
 team
 oriented,


you
 know,
 you
 can
 just
 you
 can


accomplish
 enormous
 amounts
 of
 of


wonderful
 things.
 So,
 one
 of
 the
 things


that
 we've
 been
 doing
 for
 the
 last
 10


years
 is
 hiring
 for
 our
 team,
 our


analysts
 right
 out
 of
 Stanford


undergrad.
 So,
 these
 are
 21
 or
 22
 year


old
 uh
 people.
 When
 they
 graduate,


they're
 young,
 they're
 super


intelligent,
 they're
 super
 energetic
 um


and
 they're
 and
 they
 grow
 very
 fast.
 We


show
 them
 the
 entire
 investment
 world,


all
 the
 asset
 classes
 all
 over
 the
 world


in
 real
 time.
 They
 get
 to
 interact
 with


the
 best
 investors
 in
 venture
 capital
 or


public
 equity
 or
 real
 estate.
 And
 they


grow
 very
 very
 fast,
 very
 quickly.
 They,


you
 know,
 they
 kind
 of
 absorb


information
 like
 a
 sponge.
 And
 after


they've
 been
 in
 this
 program
 for
 a


remarkably
 short
 amount
 of
 time,
 a
 few


years,
 they're
 they're
 really
 competent.


and
 after
 they've
 been
 in
 this
 program


for
 seven
 or
 eight
 or
 nine
 or
 10
 years,


they're
 they're
 fantastic
 investors.


>> How
 many
 people
 do
 you
 take?


>> We
 uh
 we
 take
 one
 or
 two
 a
 year.
 Um


>> and
 how
 many
 how
 many
 people
 apply?


>> Uh
 dozens
 and
 dozens.
 Um
 and
 one
 of
 the


ways
 that
 we
 we
 find
 people
 that
 um
 uh


that
 are
 particularly
 well
 suited
 as
 we


teach
 a
 class,
 we
 teach
 an
 undergraduate


seminar.
 maybe
 you'll
 be
 kind
 enough
 to


come
 help
 us
 uh
 teach
 it
 one
 one
 time


and
 talk
 about
 your
 work
 in
 Norway,
 but


uh
 we
 have
 a
 small
 seminar
 of
 20


students
 that
 apply
 to
 take
 the
 seminar


and
 we
 can
 tell
 through
 the
 course
 of


that
 uh
 that
 seminar
 who
 really
 feels


passionate
 about
 this
 work
 and
 then
 we


often
 offer
 them
 an
 internship
 and


sometimes
 that
 internship,
 you
 know,


matures
 into
 a
 full-time
 job.


>> I
 have
 to
 say,
 I
 mean,
 what
 a
 what
 a


dream
 start
 on
 your
 investment
 career.


It's
 just
 unbelievable.
 Now
 what
 um
 what


makes
 a
 good
 in
 investor?
 So
 when
 you


have
 these
 young
 people
 in
 the
 seminar,


how
 do
 you
 identify
 good
 potential


investors?


>> So
 a
 lot
 of
 intellectual
 curiosity
 um


always
 questioning
 the
 ability
 to
 kind


of
 uh
 combine
 quantitative
 and


qualitative
 data
 thoughtfully
 in
 the


type
 of
 investment
 that
 we
 do.
 um
 both


aspects
 are
 really
 important
 and
 so
 we


tend
 to
 find
 uh
 that
 the
 best
 endowment


style
 investors
 kind
 of
 spike
 enough
 in


both
 areas
 that
 they're
 quite
 competent


in
 both
 areas
 but
 then
 the
 real
 skill
 is


how
 you
 bring
 them
 together
 and
 to
 form


investment
 judgments.
 uh
 and
 some
 people


are
 just
 kind
 of


I
 would
 say
 you
 can
 teach
 a
 lot
 of
 that


but
 there's
 also
 some
 of
 it
 that
 is
 sort


of
 seems
 to
 be
 innate
 in
 somebody
 some


the
 way
 that
 people
 tend
 to
 just
 sort
 of


uh
 naturally
 or
 natively
 process


information
 some
 people
 just
 have
 a
 a


very
 fil
 way
 of
 bringing
 together
 all
 of


that
 different
 type
 of
 data
 prioritizing


it
 correctly
 synthesizing
 it
 in
 a
 way


that
 really
 makes
 sense
 and
 they
 make


they
 make
 the
 best
 investors


>> do
 you
 find
 that
 uh
 really
 clever
 people


are
 able
 to
 take
 risks.


>> I
 find
 it's
 a
 spectrum.
 Um,
 and
 uh,
 and


I
 think
 I've
 sort
 of
 I'm
 not
 sure
 I'm


right
 about
 this,
 but
 I've
 kind
 of
 come


to
 have
 a
 theory
 that
 we
 all
 sort
 of


because
 of
 our
 temperament
 and
 our


experience,
 we
 all
 fall
 on
 a
 different


part
 of
 the
 risk
 return
 continuum.
 Um,


some
 of
 us
 take
 a
 naturally
 happy
 and


comfortable
 taking
 a
 lot
 of
 risk
 and


some
 of
 us
 are
 naturally
 very


riskaverse.
 And
 I
 I
 think
 it's
 okay
 to


be
 either.
 Um
 you
 can't
 have
 a
 long-term


investment
 portfolio
 as
 an
 endowment


that's
 too
 riskaverse
 because
 you'll


fail
 to
 preserve
 purchasing
 power.
 So


you
 need
 to
 take
 enough
 risk
 in
 your


portfolio.
 But
 on
 your
 team,
 I
 think


it's
 okay
 to
 have
 a
 variety
 of
 people


that
 are
 on
 that
 continuum
 at
 different


places.
 The
 important
 thing
 is
 that


they're
 all
 sort
 of
 on
 the
 efficient


frontier
 so
 that
 they're
 for
 whatever


amount
 of
 risk
 they're
 taking,
 they're


getting
 the
 highest
 level
 of
 return
 uh


possible.
 So
 that
 efficient
 that


efficient
 way
 of
 thinking
 about
 risk
 is


probably
 more
 important
 and
 it's


actually
 helpful
 to
 have
 people
 on
 your


team
 that
 are
 on
 different
 parts
 of
 that


spectrum.


>> To
 which
 extent
 do
 you
 delegate
 these


type
 of
 decisions?


>> We
 really
 work
 um
 together
 on


everything.
 uh
 I'm
 I'm
 the
 chief


investment
 officer.
 So
 ultimately
 I
 make


the
 decisions
 but
 you
 know
 the
 the
 real


way
 that
 the
 decisions
 are
 made
 is
 we


work
 iteratively
 in
 in
 small
 in
 small


kind
 of
 deal
 teams
 on
 individual


investments.
 We
 work
 collectively
 on
 our


larger
 strategic
 issues
 like
 how
 are
 we


going
 to
 change
 our
 asset
 allocation


which
 we
 don't
 do
 very
 much
 um
 but
 we


look
 at
 once
 a
 year
 um
 and
 really
 the


decisions
 sort
 of
 uh
 they're
 not


consensus
 decisions
 but
 they
 do
 evolve


in
 an
 iterative
 way
 as
 we
 work
 together


in
 these
 small
 teams.


>> So
 how
 does
 it
 work?
 So
 now
 I'm
 um
 I'm


one
 of the
 lucky
 few
 uh
 I've
 been


trained
 by
 you
 for
 5
 years.
 I'm
 roaming


around
 finding
 this
 great
 company
 or


this
 great
 manager
 and
 I
 come
 back
 to


you
 know
 back
 to
 the
 ranch
 and
 it's
 just


like
 hey
 Rob
 just
 saw
 this
 amazing


company
 I
 would
 you
 know
 this
 group
 of


people
 wow
 we
 going
 to
 make
 a
 total


fortune
 so
 where
 do
 you
 go
 from
 there
 I


I
 I
 give
 you
 the
 idea
 and
 just
 how
 do


you
 work
 on
 this


>> so
 I
 mean
 we
 have
 to
 spend
 more
 time
 I


have
 to
 spend
 a
 lot
 of
 time
 with
 the


potential
 partner
 uh
 and
 uh
 get
 to
 know


I
 have
 to
 kind
 of
 go
 through
 all
 the


work
 again
 if
 I'm
 sometimes
 I'm
 part
 of


it
 very
 that
 process
 very
 early.
 I
 might


be
 even
 in
 the
 first
 meeting.
 Sometimes


there's
 several
 meetings
 before
 I
 am


before
 I
 join
 the
 group.
 But
 it
 no


matter
 what
 part
 I
 join,
 I
 have
 to
 kind


of
 go
 through
 all
 of
 that
 uh
 work
 all


over
 again.
 I
 have
 to
 talk
 about
 the
 how


they
 built
 the
 you
 know
 how
 they
 do


their
 work,
 how
 they
 make
 decisions,


what
 they
 care
 about,
 what,
 you
 know,


talk
 about
 many
 many
 case
 studies
 from


their
 past.
 Um
 understand
 them
 as


people.
 What's
 their
 background?
 what


motivates
 them,
 what's
 what
 do
 they
 care


about,
 you
 know,
 and
 uh
 and
 that
 takes
 a


long
 time.
 And
 then
 we
 we
 kind
 of
 write


it
 all
 up
 in
 a
 40
 or
 50
 page
 investment


memo.
 We
 talk
 to
 everybody
 we
 can
 who


knows
 the
 group,
 who
 knows
 their
 work,


sometimes
 people
 that
 they've
 worked


with
 in
 the
 past,
 sometimes
 their
 peers


or
 competitors.
 Um,
 and
 we
 try
 to
 kind


of
 triangulate
 uh
 or
 substantiate
 our


own
 views
 through
 that
 reference
 type
 of


work.
 There's
 obviously
 a
 quantitative


assessment
 of
 their
 track
 record
 and
 and


and
 and
 opportunity
 set
 as
 well.
 Um,
 and


we
 put
 it
 all
 together
 in
 a
 big


investment
 memo
 is
 we
 write
 it
 and
 we


write
 it
 down.
 It's
 it's
 mostly
 text.


And
 we
 find
 that's
 really
 important,


Nikolai,
 because
 when
 you
 have
 to
 write


something
 down
 in
 all
 of
 its
 full


complexity,
 the
 qualitative
 things
 are


hard
 to
 kind
 of
 to
 write
 it
 down
 in
 and


and
 have
 it
 in
 black
 and
 white
 and
 have


it
 hang
 together
 um
 really
 helps
 us
 make


the
 right
 decisions.
 It's
 funny
 how


sometimes
 even
 after
 you've
 worked
 on
 an


opportunity
 for
 months
 and
 you
 think
 you


know
 everything
 about
 it
 in
 your
 head,


you
 write
 the
 memo
 and
 you
 read
 the
 memo


and
 you've
 missed
 something.
 Something's


important
 that's
 not
 there
 or


something's
 there
 that's
 uncomfortable.


Um,
 and
 that,
 you
 know,
 that
 still


happens
 even
 now.
 And
 I've
 been,
 you


know,
 a
 CIO
 for
 21
 years.
 That
 still


happens.


>> What's
 the
 one
 thing
 that
 really
 puts


you
 on
 fire?
 So,
 here
 I
 am.
 I'm
 a


manager.
 I
 run,
 you
 know,
 I
 run
 this


group.
 I
 come
 into
 your
 office.
 What's


the
 one
 thing
 I
 can
 say
 uh
 that
 really


would
 make
 you
 wake
 up?


>> Oh,
 if
 you
 if
 you're
 sloppy,
 if
 you


treat
 if
 you
 if
 you
 if
 you're
 if
 you


throw
 capital
 around
 without
 discipline,


>> um
 or
 if
 you
 clearly
 are
 out
 to
 make


money
 for
 yourself
 and
 you
 don't
 really


care
 about
 your
 partner's


>> and
 on
 the
 opposite
 side,
 what
 is
 it


that
 really


>> gives
 you
 kind
 of
 uh


>> oh,
 I
 get
 total
 excitement.
 Every
 once


in
 a
 while,
 you
 know,
 every
 few
 years,


you'll
 have
 a
 meeting
 with
 a
 partner
 or


a
 potential
 partner
 where
 it's
 just
 so


clear
 that
 they've
 got
 just
 some
 unique


capabil
 unique
 way
 of
 looking
 at


businesses
 and
 understanding
 business


models
 and


>> such
 as
 for
 instance
 what


>> I
 mean
 I
 I
 think
 you
 uh
 you
 know
 most


people
 are
 familiar
 with
 Chris
 Han
 from


the
 Children's
 Investment
 Fund.
 He's
 got


a
 brilliant
 uh
 understanding
 of


businesses
 and
 business
 models
 and


>> we
 we
 did
 we
 did
 a
 we
 did
 a
 podcast
 with


him
 recently
 as
 you
 know.
 Yeah,
 that's


right.
 And
 he's
 f
 he's
 so,
 you
 know,


fantastic
 on
 so
 many
 different
 levels.


But
 I
 was
 on
 the
 in
 the
 very
 when
 he


formed
 the
 children's
 investment
 fund,
 I


was
 the
 point
 person
 on
 that


relationship.
 I
 was
 at
 Yale.
 Yale
 was


the
 initial
 investor
 with
 TCI.
 I
 was
 in


the
 very
 first
 meetings
 with
 with
 Chris


and
 and
 the
 Yale
 team
 and
 David
 Swenson.


And
 it
 was
 obvious.
 I
 mean,
 I
 was
 pretty


junior
 at
 that
 time,
 but
 it
 was
 obvious


even
 then,
 even
 in
 that
 first
 hour
 or


two
 or
 three.


>> So
 go,
 can
 you
 just
 go
 back?
 So
 here
 you


here
 you
 are.
 You
 are
 in
 Yale.
 You
 you


are
 at
 Yale.
 Tell
 me
 about
 that
 hour.


>> So
 we
 were
 in
 London.
 We
 went
 to
 see
 him


and
 uh
 he
 had
 just
 left
 Perry
 and
 we


know
 it
 was
 more
 than
 an
 hour.
 It
 was


probably
 3
 hours
 and
 we
 just
 did
 all
 the


things
 I
 described
 a
 moment
 ago.
 We


talked
 about
 his
 work
 and
 his
 philosophy


and
 how
 he
 thought
 about
 businesses
 and


um
 you
 know
 he
 wasn't
 as
 fully
 formed
 a


thinker
 as
 he
 is
 now.
 But
 the
 the
 the


the
 the
 key
 element
 of
 how
 he


understands
 investment
 opportunities,


how
 he
 processes
 risk
 and
 return,
 how
 he


thinks
 about
 quality
 businesses
 that
 was


clear
 in
 I
 think
 it
 was
 2003.
 I
 think
 he


launched
 TCI
 in
 2004.
 So
 we
 spent
 six
 or


nine
 months
 with
 him
 before
 he
 even
 you


know
 took
 our
 capital
 uh
 or
 anyone's


capital.
 we
 were
 the
 first
 investor
 and


uh
 um
 and
 you
 know
 it's
 just
 I
 don't


know
 it
 was
 a
 whole
 it
 was
 just
 how
 he


thought
 it
 was
 how
 deeply
 and
 not
 only


deeply
 but
 how
 clearly
 he
 thought
 about


things
 because
 he
 did
 all
 the
 work
 he
 so


you
 know
 he
 did
 an
 enormous
 amount
 of


work
 but
 he
 was
 able
 to
 synthesize
 the


two
 or
 three
 or
 four
 things
 that
 really


really really
 mattered
 and
 he
 waited


those
 two
 or
 three
 or
 four
 things


appropriately
 in
 his
 final
 in
 you
 know


investment
 analysis


And
 it's
 it's
 very
 hard
 to
 do
 that.


>> Do
 you
 find
 that
 many
 good
 investors
 are


on
 the
 spectrum
 somewhere?


>> Yeah,
 we
 see
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 that.
 Yeah.


>> Tell
 me
 about
 it.
 Tell
 me
 about
 it.


>> Uh
 well,
 I
 don't
 know.
 I'm
 not
 a


psychologist.
 I
 I'm
 not
 capable
 of


defining
 it
 precisely,
 but
 that
 there's


an
 intensity
 and
 a
 focus.
 Um
 you
 know,


it
 for
 the
 great
 investors,
 it's
 not


about
 how
 much
 money
 they
 make
 at
 all.


They're
 not
 generally
 not
 motivated
 by


their
 personal
 wealth,
 which
 is
 strange


to
 say,
 but
 it's
 it's
 very
 often
 true.


They're
 motivated
 by
 the
 their
 passion


for
 investment.
 They
 they
 love
 the


intellectual
 challenge
 of
 it.
 They
 love


the,
 you
 know,
 the
 constant
 growth.
 They


love
 the
 constant
 learning,
 the
 variety


of
 information
 they
 need
 to
 process
 as


an
 investor.
 And
 they
 they
 want
 to
 be
 an


excellent
 investor
 that
 and
 the
 money


comes
 along.
 If
 they
 do
 that,
 great.
 But


they
 don't
 focus
 on
 the
 money.
 You
 know,


the
 asset
 gatherers
 focus
 on
 the
 money.


That's
 a
 different
 thing.
 That's
 not


being
 an
 excellent
 investor.
 That's


building
 a
 great
 asset
 management


business.
 Different
 thing.
 But
 if
 you're


a
 great
 investor,
 you're
 consumed
 by


what
 you're
 doing.
 And
 that
 often,
 you


know,
 can
 look
 like
 someone's
 a
 little


bit
 on
 on
 the
 spectrum,
 I
 suppose.


>> I
 think
 it's
 so
 interesting
 because
 you


see
 it
 in
 in
 music.
 You
 have
 old
 people,


you
 know,
 just
 continuing
 on
 until
 they


die.
 But
 you
 also
 have
 it
 in


investments,
 right?
 People
 are
 just


really
 curious.
 They're
 not
 in
 it
 for


the
 money.
 they
 got
 enough
 of
 it.
 Uh
 but


they
 are
 just
 they
 they
 just
 love
 it,


right?


>> Yeah.
 I
 think
 you
 see
 it
 in
 any
 field
 of


endeavor
 that
 just
 requires
 an


tremendous
 amount
 of
 focus
 to
 succeed,


which
 is
 most
 you
 know,
 you
 see
 it
 in


athletics,
 you
 see
 it
 in
 the
 arts,
 as


you
 said,
 you
 certainly
 see
 it
 you
 see


it
 in
 investment.


>> What's
 the
 average
 uh
 length
 of


relationships
 you
 have
 at
 Stanford?
 How


long
 do
 you
 keep
 a
 manager?


>> I
 I
 haven't
 calculated
 it.
 Um
 we
 had


that
 huge
 portfolio
 turnover.
 So
 we
 had


300
 partners.
 We
 put
 we
 put
 265
 of
 them


into
 liquidation.
 We
 kept
 35
 of
 the


original
 300.
 We've
 added
 another
 50.
 So


it's
 you
 know
 we're
 still
 we're
 10
 years


in
 now,
 but
 that's
 not
 long
 enough
 for


me
 to
 give
 you
 the
 right
 answer.
 But
 if


I
 look
 over
 my
 whole
 20
 year
 career
 as
 a


CIO,
 I
 think
 the
 average
 tenure
 would
 be


12
 or
 12
 plus
 years
 for
 a
 partner.
 Maybe


maybe
 closer
 to
 15.


>> When
 do
 you
 sack
 them?
 when
 they
 um
 when


they
 lose
 discipline,
 when
 this
 when


they
 when
 they
 outgrow
 their
 opportunity


set,
 when
 their
 motivation
 uh
 fades,
 uh


when
 when
 we've
 made
 a
 mistake,
 we
 do


sometimes
 uh
 hopefully
 not
 too
 often,


but
 we
 do
 sometimes
 uh
 make
 mistakes


initially
 and
 our
 work
 is
 somehow


incomplete
 or
 we
 don't
 understand


something.
 And
 then
 sometimes
 this


happens
 less
 uh
 less
 often,
 but


sometimes
 the
 opportunity
 set
 goes
 away.


So
 or
 or
 our
 ability
 to
 access
 the


opportunities
 that
 changes.
 So
 for


instance,
 a
 real-time
 example
 is
 China.


We've
 made
 a
 tremendous
 amount
 of
 money


uh
 for
 Stanford
 investing
 in
 public
 and


private
 opportunities
 in
 China.
 And
 it's


a
 fantastically


interesting
 and
 wildly
 inefficient


market
 both
 public
 and
 private
 uh
 which


is
 a
 great
 initial
 condition
 for
 us
 and


our
 partners
 to
 operate.
 But
 the
 nature


of
 the
 political
 reality
 between


Washington
 and
 Beijing
 and
 as
 a
 US


nonprofit
 institution
 um
 governed
 by
 the


rules
 of
 the
 United
 States
 of
 course
 um


the
 way
 that
 that
 relationship
 is


evolving
 uh
 has
 made
 Stanford
 has
 made


China
 much
 less
 um
 uh
 accessible
 for
 us.


I
 think
 the
 opportunity
 sets
 as
 rich
 as


ever
 but
 for
 Stanford
 it's
 not.
 And
 so


that's
 one
 example
 of
 where
 we
 may
 we


have
 to
 um
 change
 the
 way
 we
 work
 with


our
 partners
 because
 our
 ability
 to


access
 that
 opportunity
 set
 has
 changed.


>> Changing
 tax
 a
 bit.
 Uh
 you
 are
 very


passionate
 about
 research
 universities


role
 in
 innovation
 and
 of
 course
 you're


sitting
 in
 the
 the
 kind
 of
 main
 hub
 of


it
 all.
 So
 explain
 explain
 this
 model


please.


>> Sure.
 So
 it's
 a
 model
 that
 the
 United


States
 really
 has
 followed
 since
 uh
 the


end
 of
 World
 War
 II
 and
 and
 it's
 you


know
 it's
 reasonably
 straightforward.


The
 United
 States
 federal
 government


receives
 taxpayer
 funds
 uh
 and
 they
 have


priorities
 for
 national
 uh
 innovation.


They
 have
 areas
 of
 of
 of
 of
 research


that
 the
 they
 are
 that
 are
 strategic


priorities
 for
 the
 United
 States.
 So


what
 they
 do
 with
 the
 taxpayer
 funds
 is


they
 put
 that
 money
 out
 for
 competitive


bids
 from
 research
 universities,


Stanford
 obviously
 included
 uh
 but


dozens
 of
 others
 and
 we
 compete
 with
 our


with
 our
 peers
 with
 our
 tremendous
 and


excellent
 peers
 for
 that
 research
 money


on
 any
 particular
 thing
 healthcare
 issue


or
 or
 you
 know
 research
 into
 cancer
 or


research
 into
 some
 engineering
 problem.


uh
 and
 uh
 and
 the
 you
 know
 the
 the


person
 who
 puts
 the
 most
 competitive


proposal
 in
 front
 of
 the
 federal


government
 wins
 that
 contract.
 We
 do
 the


research.
 That's
 usually
 basic
 research


that
 we're
 doing,
 basic
 science.
 And


then
 when
 we've
 when
 we've
 researched


it,
 we
 publish
 it
 and
 that
 publication


is
 is
 for
 anybody.
 I
 mean,
 it's


completely
 wide
 open
 for
 people
 to
 see


the
 results
 of
 the
 of
 their
 taxpayer


money
 at
 work.
 And
 then
 private


companies
 come
 take
 the
 results
 of
 that


basic
 research
 and
 build
 interesting


technologies
 on
 top
 of
 it
 and
 build


interesting
 companies
 that
 that
 provide


valuable
 goods
 and
 services
 you
 know
 to


us
 uh
 customers
 and
 global
 customers.


And
 so
 that
 innovation
 model
 really
 I


think
 has
 led
 the
 world
 in
 innovation


for
 you
 know
 for
 80
 years.
 has
 been
 a


very
 very
 successful
 model
 and
 it
 has


acred
 in
 my
 opinion
 at least
 to
 the


benefit
 of
 of
 the
 United
 States
 and
 the


world.
 Uh
 and
 so
 I
 am
 passionate
 about


the
 role
 of
 research
 universities
 and


and
 and


it's
 a
 good
 model
 and
 it's
 worked


extremely
 well.


>> So
 if
 you
 were
 to
 give
 some
 examples
 on


how
 the
 end
 has
 really
 supported
 the


innovation
 ecosystem,
 you
 know,
 what


would
 be
 one
 or
 two
 examples?
 Oh,
 there


are
 dozens
 of
 examples
 in
 and
 in
 in


health
 care
 in
 in
 innovative
 uh
 uh


research
 into
 life-saving
 healthcare.
 We


had
 a
 I
 heard
 the
 story
 of
 um
 this
 kind


of
 combines
 medicine
 and
 and
 AI
 a
 little


bit.
 We
 had
 a
 I
 think
 it
 was
 a


six-year-old
 um
 infant
 who
 had
 a
 genetic


disorder
 come
 to
 the
 hospital
 at


Stanford.
 And
 the
 medical
 school
 at


Stanford
 is
 you
 know
 works
 with
 the


Stanford
 hospital.
 The
 faculty
 goes
 back


and
 forth
 between
 the
 hospital
 and
 the


medical
 school
 and
 this
 baby
 was
 having


seizures.
 There
 was
 quite
 a
 serious


situation
 and
 within
 8
 hours
 the
 staff


at
 the
 hospital
 faculty
 of
 the
 school
 of


medicine
 had
 sequenced
 the
 baby's
 uh


genome
 had
 isolated
 um
 a
 million


possible
 genetic
 variations
 that
 were


you
 know
 likely
 one
 of
 them
 was


responsible
 for
 the
 seizures
 and
 used
 um


AI
 used
 machine
 learning
 models
 and


methodology
 to
 isolate
 50
 50
 of
 the
 you


thousands
 or
 millions
 of
 possible


genetic
 variations.
 And
 they
 all
 then


they
 went
 in
 and
 looked
 at
 each
 one
 of


those
 50.
 The
 humans
 went
 in
 and


analyzed
 each
 and
 they
 found
 the
 one


that
 that
 that
 was
 causing
 the
 the


seizures
 and
 they
 were
 able
 to
 take
 they


were
 able
 to
 make
 a
 genetic
 correction


and
 then
 save
 the
 save
 the
 infant's


life.
 That
 all
 that
 whole
 process
 took


eight
 hours.
 So
 that
 type
 of
 work
 is
 um


and
 is
 an
 example
 of
 what
 you
 know
 of


what
 Stanford
 can
 do.
 Obviously


technologies
 like
 semiconductors
 a
 lot


of
 them
 were
 developed
 at
 Stanford.
 Um


that
 was
 the
 beginning
 of
 Silicon
 Valley


back
 in
 the
 50s
 and
 60s
 and
 70s.
 Uh


Google
 was
 started
 at
 Stanford.
 So
 you


know
 tremendous
 uh
 companies
 have
 been


uh
 have
 been
 started
 and
 grown
 and


fostered
 at
 um
 at
 the
 university.
 I


think
 right
 now
 we
 have
 20
 Noble


laureates
 on
 faculty.
 Rob,
 moving
 back


to
 your
 uh
 younger
 uh
 days,


um
 you
 are
 one
 of
 the
 very
 few
 people
 in


the
 investment
 world
 who's
 been
 a
 ballet


dancer
 and
 um
 you
 you
 dance
 for
 you


dance
 professionally
 for
 16
 years,


right?


>> That's
 right.
 I
 did.
 Yeah.


>> Wow.
 Wow.
 So
 tell


just
 amazing.
 Hey,
 I
 mean
 you
 still
 look


fantastic
 and
 very
 agile
 and
 all
 that


kind
 of
 stuff,
 but
 um
 tell
 me
 about
 the


the
 journey
 from
 a
 ballet
 dancer
 to
 the


financial
 world.


It
 sounds
 it
 sounds
 strange
 to
 people


when
 I
 when
 I
 talk
 about
 it,
 but
 to
 me


of
 course
 it
 was
 very
 natural
 and
 sort


of
 evolved
 and
 seemed
 very
 organic.
 But


I
 did
 sort
 of
 uh
 fall
 in
 love
 with


classical
 ballet
 when
 I
 was
 about
 13
 and


I
 had
 seen
 Mikal
 Bishnikov
 in
 my
 opinion


the
 greatest
 male
 dancer
 of
 the
 20th


century
 uh
 perform
 live
 in
 Washington
 DC


where
 I
 grew
 up
 and
 I
 just
 couldn't


believe
 that
 anybody
 could
 do
 that
 what


he
 was
 doing
 on
 stage.
 The
 athleticism


of
 it
 was
 captivating
 to
 me
 at
 that
 at


that
 time.
 And
 so
 I
 ended
 up
 going
 to
 a


ballet
 class
 in
 suburbia,
 Washington
 DC.


I
 was
 the
 only
 I
 was
 the
 only
 boy.
 I
 was


13
 surrounded
 by
 about
 15
 13
 year old


girls.
 And
 uh
 I
 I
 told
 that
 story
 to


David
 Swenson
 in
 my
 first
 interview
 for


him
 at
 the
 Yale
 Investments
 office
 and


he
 he
 said,
 "Stop
 stop.
 That
 was
 your


first
 and
 most
 important
 lesson
 in


supply
 and
 demand."


But
 but
 I
 just
 immediately,
 you
 know,


kind
 of
 fell
 in
 love
 with
 ballet
 and
 and


the
 physical
 challenge
 of
 it.
 Um,
 and


then
 I
 I
 thought,
 well,
 you
 know,
 look,


I'm
 really
 enjoying
 this.
 Uh,
 maybe
 I


should
 see
 if
 I
 can
 have
 a
 some
 success


as
 a
 professional
 dancer.
 So,
 I


graduated
 from
 high
 school
 a
 little
 bit


early.
 I
 turned
 professional
 at
 17.
 Uh,


and
 my
 deal
 with
 myself
 was
 let
 me
 try


it
 for
 a
 year
 uh,
 and
 see
 how
 it
 goes.


And
 if
 it
 doesn't
 work
 out,
 I'll
 go
 to


college.
 So,
 the
 the,
 you
 know,
 the


backup
 plan
 was
 always
 go
 to
 college.
 I


always
 knew
 that
 eventually
 I
 would
 go


to
 college,
 but
 you
 you
 know
 you
 you


those
 early
 years
 are
 too
 important
 as
 a


classical
 ballet
 dancer
 to
 go
 to


college.
 You
 have
 to
 really
 turn


professional
 when
 you're
 young.
 So
 I


turned
 professional
 17
 and
 I
 kind
 of


think
 of
 it
 as
 16
 one-year
 decisions
 to


keep
 dancing.
 And
 I
 ended
 up
 uh


Brishikov
 ended
 up
 hiring
 me
 in
 New
 York


City
 in
 American
 Valley
 Theater.
 had
 a


tremendous
 uh
 it
 was
 a
 lovely
 time
 in


American
 dance
 to
 work
 closely
 with


Berishnikov
 and
 great
 choreographers


like
 Mark
 Morris
 and
 and
 Agnes
 Deil
 and


Jerry
 Robbins
 and
 uh
 you
 know
 and
 uh


even
 Martha
 Graham
 was
 was
 still
 active


at
 that
 point
 and
 u


>> but
 but
 Rob
 Barishov
 he
 he
 continued


until
 very
 late
 at
 life
 right


>> he
 did
 he
 stopped
 doing
 classical
 ballet


so
 I
 mean
 he
 he
 he
 uh
 first
 of
 all
 even


into
 until
 into
 into
 his
 late
 30s,
 which


is
 very
 a
 very
 advanced
 age
 for
 an
 elite


male
 classical
 ballet
 dancer.
 He
 was


still
 quite
 a
 beautiful
 I
 mean
 very


capable,
 incredible
 male
 uh
 technique


even
 in
 his
 late
 30s.
 But,
 you
 know,
 but


but
 he
 started
 to
 really
 change
 the


types
 of
 roles
 he
 was
 doing.
 And
 by
 the


by
 the
 time
 he
 was
 in
 his
 40s,
 he
 was
 no


longer
 really
 doing
 the
 the
 real
 bravor


of
 classical
 ballets
 anymore.
 it's
 it's


just
 not
 possible
 uh
 to
 do
 it.
 And
 um


but
 he
 continued
 dancing
 in
 other
 in


other
 you
 know
 in
 other
 types
 of
 dance


until
 I
 think
 he
 may
 still
 he's
 in
 his


70s.
 I
 think
 he's
 still
 doing
 a
 little


bit.
 Um
 he's
 you
 know
 he
 was
 an
 absolute


genius.
 What's
 a
 great
 quote
 that


somebody
 said
 that
 talent
 hits
 a
 target


no
 one
 else
 can
 hit
 and
 genius
 hits
 a


target
 no
 one
 else
 can
 see.


>> Berishnikov
 was
 so
 far
 ahead
 of
 his
 time


as
 a
 male
 classical
 dancer.
 He,
 you


know,
 he
 was
 truly
 a
 genius.
 So
 to
 work


with
 him
 and
 he
 picked
 me
 out
 of
 the


core
 to
 fill
 in
 for
 him
 when
 he
 got
 hurt


one
 one
 time
 in
 New
 at
 the
 world


premiere
 at
 the
 Metropolitan
 Opera
 House


in
 New
 York


>> to
 work
 with
 great
 dancers
 and
 great


choreographers.
 That
 was
 a
 journey
 that


you
 know
 for
 16
 years
 uh
 just
 completely


I
 found
 completely
 wonderful
 and
 very


immersive.
 We
 were
 talking
 about
 the


importance
 of
 kind
 of
 passion
 and


intensity
 and
 focus.
 Those
 were
 things
 I


really
 enjoyed
 about
 classical
 ballet.


Then
 I
 got
 a
 little
 bit
 old.
 I
 was
 32.


My
 wife
 and
 I
 were
 expecting
 our
 first


child.
 Uh
 I
 kind
 of
 knew
 that
 it
 was


time
 for
 me
 to,
 you
 know,
 start
 to
 to
 to


think
 about
 career
 change.
 So
 I
 I


decided
 that
 was
 the
 right
 time
 to
 go
 to


college.
 So
 I
 ended
 up
 going
 to
 Yale
 as


a
 freshman.
 I
 was
 a
 normal
 freshman


except
 I
 was
 32
 and
 not
 18.
 And
 while
 I


was
 um
 uh
 you
 know,
 all
 three
 of
 my


children
 were
 born
 while
 I
 was
 an


undergraduate
 at
 Yale.
 uh
 we
 didn't
 have


a
 whole
 lot
 of
 money,
 so
 I
 had
 two


part-time
 jobs.
 One
 of
 which
 was


teaching
 ballet
 to
 the
 kids
 in
 New


Haven,
 Connecticut,
 and
 the
 other
 of


which
 was
 working
 as
 an
 intern
 in
 the
 Al


Investments
 office.
 I
 I
 just
 applied
 and


it
 was
 an
 ad
 in
 the
 student
 newspaper.


Still
 had
 newspapers
 at
 that
 time.
 And


uh
 and
 I
 applied
 and
 they
 accepted
 me


and
 um
 and
 that's
 really
 how
 I
 learned


about
 uh
 investment
 management,
 how
 I


learned
 about
 endowment
 management.


>> Wow.
 I
 just
 think
 it's
 such
 an
 amazing


story.
 How
 has
 that
 discipline
 from


ballet
 helped
 you
 in
 life?


>> I
 think
 I
 think
 it's
 helped
 me
 a
 lot,


but
 and
 I
 don't
 think
 it's
 anything


unique
 to
 ballet.
 I
 think
 any
 anytime


you
 want
 to
 succeed
 at
 something
 that


you
 know
 that's
 very
 challenging
 in
 any


walk
 of
 life,
 it
 requires
 a
 lot
 of


discipline.
 Um,
 and
 uh,
 and
 that's
 true


for
 investment
 management.
 I
 I
 do
 think


one
 of
 the
 I've
 reflected
 on
 this
 and
 I


I
 think
 one
 of
 the
 things
 that
 ballet


and
 investment
 long-term
 investment


management
 have
 in
 common
 is
 you're


always
 working
 for
 something
 that's


years
 away.
 You
 know,
 every
 day
 you
 walk


into
 the
 ballet
 studio,
 you're
 working


on
 your
 technique.
 It
 takes
 years
 and


years
 and
 years
 before
 it
 pays
 off,
 you


know,
 and
 when
 you're
 investing


endowment
 capital
 for
 Stanford,
 you
 walk


in
 every
 day,
 you're
 doing
 work,
 and
 you


don't
 and
 it's
 going
 to
 pay
 off
 five
 or


10
 years
 later.
 That's
 how
 long
 it
 takes


in
 this
 type
 of
 investment
 that
 we


generally
 do.
 And
 so
 that
 kind
 of


willingness
 to
 do
 the
 work
 and
 stay


focused
 even
 though
 the
 kind
 of
 the


payoff
 is
 so
 far
 in
 the
 future
 that


feels
 very
 uh
 similar
 to
 me
 in
 both


professions.


>> How
 would
 you
 describe
 your
 leadership


philosophy
 or
 style?
 I
 think,
 you
 know,


if
 you
 get
 um
 if
 you
 get
 great
 people


and
 you
 give
 them
 opportunities
 to
 grow


and
 uh
 and
 they're
 and
 they're
 hugely


individually
 motivated,
 but
 also
 they're


team
 players,
 the
 leadership
 challenge


gets
 a
 lot
 easier
 because
 you
 know
 to


some
 extent
 most
 of
 the
 work
 is
 done
 for


you
 just
 by
 creating
 that
 that
 fact


pattern,
 that
 initial
 condition.
 You


just
 want
 to
 you
 want
 to
 be
 a
 people


work
 well
 together.
 They
 grow.
 They


listen.
 They
 learn.
 You
 listen
 to
 them.


You
 grow.
 You
 learn
 from
 them.
 Uh
 you


have
 fun
 doing
 it
 together.
 Uh
 and
 so


I've
 always
 kind
 of
 felt
 like
 um
 that


managing
 a
 I've
 never
 managed,
 you
 know,


a
 big
 team.
 I've
 always
 managed
 several


dozen
 people.
 And
 I've
 felt
 like
 I
 need


to
 kind
 of
 treat
 them
 like


I
 I
 wouldn't
 carry
 this
 analogy
 too
 far,


but
 I
 I
 grew
 up
 in
 with
 three
 brothers.


The
 four
 of
 us
 were
 born
 within
 five


years.
 We
 were
 very
 close.
 We
 were
 we


love
 each
 other.
 We
 were
 very


supportive.
 We
 had
 a
 wonderful
 young


life,
 but
 we
 were
 also
 intensely


competitive.
 Uh
 and
 and
 I
 think
 that's


sort
 of
 what
 I
 think
 of
 for
 the
 small


teams
 that
 I
 run.
 I
 want
 that
 kind
 of
 uh


I
 wanted
 to
 feel
 a
 little
 bit
 like
 a


family,
 but
 also
 to
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 energy


and
 a
 lot
 of
 drive
 um
 and
 you
 know,
 a


fair
 amount
 of
 competitive
 competitive


spirit.
 And
 so
 that's
 what
 I
 think
 of


when
 I
 think
 of
 my
 own
 leadership
 style.


That's
 what
 I
 want
 to
 create
 and
 that's


what
 has
 worked
 for
 me
 for,
 you
 know,
 21


years.


>> What
 drives
 you
 now
 after
 10
 years
 at


Stanford?


>> Well,
 the
 first
 few
 years
 were
 so
 hard,


Nikolai.
 I
 mean,
 we
 were
 changing
 so


much
 in
 terms
 of
 the
 the
 office,
 the


team,
 the
 the
 way
 we
 worked,
 the


portfolio,
 massive,
 massive
 changes
 to


the
 portfolio.
 We
 had
 to
 work
 on
 the


governance
 around
 around
 the
 investments


office.
 the
 first
 few
 years
 were
 so
 hard


um
 and
 and
 and
 we
 knew
 that
 we
 wouldn't


see
 the
 results
 of
 them
 for
 you
 know


five
 or
 10
 years.
 So
 now
 we're
 starting


to
 see
 you
 know
 the
 really
 positive


effects
 of
 that
 early
 work.
 Uh
 and
 so


that's
 very
 motivating
 because
 I'm


really
 enjoying
 getting
 to
 see
 the


benefit,
 you
 know,
 the
 result
 of
 that
 of


of
 that
 effort.
 Um,
 I'm
 very
 motivated


by
 the
 mission
 uh
 at
 Stanford
 and
 I
 I


talked
 about
 it
 a
 moment
 ago
 and
 I'm
 I'm


a
 deep
 believer
 um
 that
 Stanford
 is
 one


of
 the
 points
 of
 light
 in
 the
 world


doing
 work
 that
 um
 the
 world
 needs
 to
 be


done
 that
 we
 should
 care
 about
 and
 I'm


very
 proud
 of
 the
 endowment's
 role
 in


supporting
 that
 work
 and
 so
 that's


massively
 motivating
 to
 me
 and
 then
 I


love
 I
 just
 love
 coming
 every
 day
 and


working
 with
 my
 colleagues
 working
 with


our
 partners
 around
 the
 world
 who
 are


fas
 fascinating
 um
 and
 incredibly


talented
 uh
 and
 such
 a
 joy
 to
 learn
 from


and
 so
 it's
 a
 it's
 a
 a
 fantastic
 uh


investment
 job.


>> Rob,
 before
 we
 wrap
 up,
 when
 do
 you
 wake


up
 in
 the
 morning?


>> Between
 5
 and
 six.


>> Mhm.
 First
 thing
 you
 do?


>> Uh
 after
 I
 I
 I
 pet
 my
 dog
 on
 the
 way


downstairs.
 Um
 I
 uh
 I
 check
 my
 email.


>> Right.
 Uh
 and
 how
 do
 you
 relax?


>> Not
 well,
 probably
 I
 think
 is
 the


answer.
 I
 mean,
 I
 I
 I
 actually
 um
 I
 I


have
 three
 children.
 They're
 children.


They're
 all
 grown
 now.
 Uh
 and
 um
 my
 wife


and
 I
 try
 to
 spend
 as
 much
 time
 with


them
 as
 we
 can.
 Um
 we
 I
 don't
 have
 a
 lot


of,
 you
 know,
 I
 read
 a
 lot,
 but
 I
 don't


do
 I'm
 not
 I
 don't
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 hobbies


outside
 of
 family
 and
 work.
 So,
 that's


really
 I
 think
 maybe
 families
 and
 family


is
 the
 way
 that
 I
 I
 best
 relax.


>> And
 what
 do
 you
 read?


>> Oh,
 I
 read
 widely.
 I
 read
 fiction,


non-fiction.
 I
 I I
 um
 I
 consume
 a
 lot
 of


books.


>> Um
 now
 we
 got
 um
 thousands
 of
 uh
 young


listeners
 listening
 into
 this.
 What
 what


is
 your
 advice
 to
 young
 people?


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 it's
 such
 an
 interesting


time
 to
 be
 a
 young
 person
 and
 the
 world


is
 so
 dynamic
 and
 and
 challenging.
 Um


and
 I
 think
 um
 you
 know
 the
 the


technology
 we
 see
 emerging
 is
 going
 to


you
 know
 and
 AI
 and
 other
 areas
 going
 to


is
 going
 to
 be
 offer
 a
 lot
 of


opportunity
 to
 young
 people
 and
 also
 a


lot
 of
 a
 lot
 of
 challenge.
 One
 of
 the


things
 I
 often
 think
 about
 that
 um
 that


I
 feel
 like
 I've
 benefited
 from
 in
 my


career
 is
 I've
 listened
 to
 the
 bottom
 up


singles
 more
 than
 I
 have
 sort
 of
 top


down
 um
 kind
 of
 strategic
 goals.
 So,
 you


know,
 the
 reason
 I
 was
 a
 ballet
 dancer


was
 cuz
 I
 loved
 ballet.
 It
 wasn't
 a


sensible
 economic
 move
 for,
 you
 know,


for
 a
 teenage
 boy
 in
 Virginia
 to
 want
 to


become
 a
 classical
 ballet
 dancer.
 But
 I


loved
 it
 and
 I
 did
 it
 and
 I
 did
 it
 for


16
 years
 and
 I
 found
 it
 massively


rewarding.
 The
 reason
 I
 do
 endowment


management
 is
 because
 I
 love
 it.
 I
 I


love
 the
 people.
 I
 love
 the
 process.
 I


love
 the
 mission.
 But,
 you
 know,
 but
 I


I'll
 tell
 you
 one
 short
 story
 and
 that


may
 be
 helpful
 to
 um
 young
 listeners.


when
 I
 was
 graduating
 from
 Yale.
 So
 for


me,
 I
 was
 in
 I'm
 in
 my
 mid-30s
 at
 this


point.
 I
 had
 an
 offer
 to
 go
 to
 Harvard


Business
 School.
 I've
 had
 been
 accepted


at
 Harvard
 Business
 School
 and
 David


Swenson
 came
 and
 said,
 "Well,
 look,
 you


know,
 you
 can
 go
 to
 Harvard
 Business


School
 or
 you
 can
 stay
 and
 work
 here


full-time
 in
 the
 Investments
 office
 and


give
 it
 a
 try
 and
 if
 you
 don't
 like
 it,


I'll
 help
 you.
 I
 think
 you're
 going
 to


learn
 more
 here
 and
 you'll
 enjoy
 it
 more


and
 if
 you
 don't
 like
 it
 after
 a
 few


years,
 I'll
 help
 you
 find
 something


else."
 And
 so,
 you
 know,
 I
 think
 if
 you


were
 building
 a
 resume,
 you
 might
 well


have
 25
 years
 ago,
 you
 might
 well
 have


said,
 "Well,
 you
 know,
 maybe
 Harvard


Business
 School
 is
 more
 important
 for
 my


CV."
 Um,
 but
 I
 listened
 to
 what
 David


was
 telling
 me,
 and
 I
 adored
 the
 people


I
 was
 working
 with,
 David
 Swenson
 and


Dean
 Takahashi,
 this
 right-hand
 man,
 uh,


man,
 and
 I
 I
 said,
 "That's
 the
 right


thing
 for
 me."
 And
 so,
 that
 kind
 of
 that


and
 the
 same
 thing
 happened
 when
 they


said,
 "Come
 to
 Stanford."
 And
 I
 knew


that
 um
 I
 knew
 the
 mission
 was
 going
 to


be
 important,
 but
 I
 also
 knew
 that
 the


people
 were
 going
 to
 be
 in
 me.
 I
 was


going
 to
 learn
 a
 lot.
 Uh
 and
 so
 that


bottom
 up
 thinking
 is
 really
 important


for
 young
 people
 to
 pay
 attention
 to.
 I


think
 some
 young
 people
 try
 to
 get
 a
 CV


built
 and
 they
 end
 up
 making
 decisions


top
 down
 more
 than
 listening
 to,
 you


know,
 what
 they
 really
 enjoy
 and
 where


the
 people
 that
 they
 respect
 and
 from


whom
 they're
 learning
 something.
 that


type
 of
 that
 type
 of
 single
 is
 really


very
 very
 important
 to
 pay
 attention
 to.


>> Well,
 Rob,
 I
 have
 to
 say
 in
 addition
 to


the
 job
 I
 I
 have
 now,
 the
 other
 job
 I


would
 have
 loved
 to
 have
 would
 be
 to
 to


work
 with
 you.
 So,
 uh
 perhaps
 sometime


in
 the
 future,
 but
 uh


>> in
 the
 meantime,
 your
 your
 passion
 for,


you
 know,
 everything
 you've
 done
 and
 for


the
 university
 is
 uh
 is
 just
 so
 clear


and
 is
 coming
 through
 so
 so
 very


clearly.
 Um
 and
 um
 big
 thanks
 for
 for


being
 with
 us
 today.
 All
 the
 best
 of


luck
 going
 forward.


>> Thanks,
 Nichol.
 Pleasure
 to
 be
 with
 you.


>> Thank
 you.
