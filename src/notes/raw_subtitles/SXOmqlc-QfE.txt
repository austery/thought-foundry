From
 the
 New
 York
 Times,
 it's
 the


headlines.
 I'm
 Tracy
 Mumford.
 Today's


Friday,
 October
 31st.
 Here's
 what
 we're


covering.


To
 start,
 three
 updates
 on
 the


government
 shutdown,
 which
 has
 now
 hit


the
 1
 month
 mark.


First,
 as
 of
 tomorrow,
 the
 federal
 food


stamps
 program,
 SNAP,
 will
 have


exhausted
 its
 remaining
 funds,
 and
 the


benefits
 are
 set
 to
 start
 disappearing.


Nationwide,
 roughly
 42
 million
 Americans


depend
 on
 SNAP
 to
 buy
 groceries.
 And


while
 some
 states
 are
 trying
 to
 step
 up


to
 fill
 the
 gap,
 others
 say
 they
 don't


have
 the
 resources.
 Roughly
 two
 dozen


states
 got
 together
 to
 sue
 the
 Trump


administration
 to
 keep
 the
 program


running,
 pointing
 to
 an
 emergency


reserve
 the
 government
 has
 specifically


for
 SNAP.
 But
 in
 court
 yesterday,


government
 lawyers
 argued
 that
 there
 are


legal
 and
 technical
 hurdles
 that
 prevent


them
 from
 moving
 the
 money
 around.
 The


judge
 in
 the
 case
 was
 skeptical
 of
 those


claims,
 saying
 at
 one
 point
 she
 saw
 no


reason
 not
 to
 use
 the
 reserve.
 She
 said,


quote,
 "Congress
 has
 put
 money
 in
 an


emergency
 fund.
 It's
 hard
 for
 me
 to


understand
 how
 this
 isn't
 an
 emergency.


And


>> you
 look
 at
 the
 aviation
 system,
 whether


it's
 LAX
 or
 it's
 Atlanta
 or
 it's
 Dallas,


you're
 seeing
 impacts
 of
 this
 shutdown


on
 our
 airspace.
 And
 that
 means


travelers
 are
 delayed.
 Travelers


>> Transportation
 Secretary
 Shawn
 Duffy
 is


warning
 that
 the
 shutdown
 is
 stressing


an
 air
 traffic
 control
 system
 that
 was


already
 on
 the
 brink.
 For
 years,
 there's


been
 a
 chronic
 shortage
 of
 controllers,


leaving
 basically
 no
 slack
 in
 the


system.
 The
 Trump
 administration
 says


that
 workers
 going
 without
 pay
 could


make
 the
 situation
 worse.
 Airports


serving
 DC,
 New
 York,
 and
 Orlando
 all


had
 controller
 staffing
 issues
 yesterday


that
 led
 to
 delays
 or
 cancellations.


And
 lastly,
 President
 Trump
 is
 calling


on
 Republicans
 to
 eliminate
 a


long-standing
 Senate
 rule
 as
 a
 way
 of


forcing
 an
 end
 to
 the
 shutdown.
 In
 a


late
 night
 post
 on
 social
 media,
 Trump


called
 on
 them
 to
 get
 rid
 of
 the


filibuster,
 which
 requires
 most
 Senate


legislation
 to
 have
 60
 votes
 to
 pass.


It's
 the
 reason
 mathwise
 that


Republicans
 need
 a
 handful
 of
 Democrats


right
 now
 to
 side
 with
 them
 to
 reopen


the
 government.
 Over
 the
 years,
 both


parties
 have
 worked
 to
 tweak
 the


filibuster
 to
 soften
 it,
 but
 have


stopped
 short
 of
 getting
 rid
 of
 it


entirely.
 Many
 Republicans
 worry
 that
 if


they
 do
 that,
 basically
 choose
 the


nuclear
 option,
 it
 could
 come
 back
 to


haunt
 them
 if
 Democrats
 take
 control
 of


Congress.


Meanwhile,
 there's
 another
 political


battle
 unfolding
 at
 the
 state
 level.


This
 spring,
 President
 Trump
 urged


Republicans
 to
 redraw
 states
 election


maps
 earlier
 than
 usual
 to
 try
 and
 give


the
 GOP
 an
 advantage
 in
 the
 midterms


next
 year
 and
 keep
 the
 party's
 majority


in
 the
 House
 of
 Representatives.


Lawmakers
 in
 several
 red
 states
 like


Texas,
 Missouri,
 and
 North
 Carolina
 took


him
 up
 on
 that.
 But
 Democrats
 also


jumped
 in
 working
 to
 redraw
 maps
 in
 blue


states.
 Now
 there's
 a
 kind
 of
 mad


scramble
 tit
 fortat
 push
 to
 redraw


election
 maps
 all
 over
 the
 country.
 This


week
 alone,
 Republicans
 in
 Ohio
 and


Indiana
 moved
 forward
 with
 their


redistricting
 efforts.
 And
 Democrats
 in


Virginia
 did
 the
 same.
 And
 in
 a
 few
 days


in
 California,
 voters
 will
 decide
 on
 a


measure
 that
 would
 potentially
 help


Democrats
 pick
 up
 as
 many
 as
 five
 seats


in
 that
 state.
 The
 parallel
 efforts
 have


led
 to
 intense
 push
 back
 with
 both


parties
 issuing
 similar
 warnings
 to
 each


other.
 One
 Republican
 lawmaker
 in


Virginia
 described
 Democrats
 efforts
 as


a
 quote
 power
 grab,
 while
 a
 Democratic


lawmaker
 in
 Indiana
 said
 of
 Republican


efforts,
 quote,
 "This
 is
 not
 democracy.


This
 is
 desperation.


In
 Sudan
 this
 week,


>> there
 was
 a
 dramatic
 shift
 in
 the


country's
 brutal
 civil
 war,
 which
 is


widely
 considered
 the
 largest


humanitarian
 crisis
 in
 the
 world.
 For
 18


months,
 the
 city
 of
 Alaser
 had
 been


under
 siege
 by
 a
 paramilitary
 group,
 the


RSF,
 which
 has
 been
 battling
 Sudan's


army.


But
 the
 army
 has
 now
 retreated
 and


images
 coming
 out
 of
 the
 city
 show


scenes
 of
 violence
 and
 horror
 for
 the


roughly
 quarter
 million
 people
 trapped


there
 as
 the
 RSF
 has
 moved
 in.
 The


fighters
 themselves
 have
 filmed


executions.
 Other
 videos
 show
 trenches


filled
 with
 bodies.
 And
 on
 Tuesday,


human
 rights
 groups
 say
 the
 RSF
 carried


out
 the
 worst
 massacre
 of
 the
 war,


killing
 more
 than
 460
 people
 at
 a


hospital
 there.
 The
 hospital
 had
 been


the
 last
 refuge
 for
 many
 starving
 and


injured
 civilians
 in
 the
 city.
 The
 RSF


has
 rejected
 the
 accusations.


>> Mr.
 President,
 we
 cannot
 hear
 the


screams,
 but
 as
 we
 sit
 here
 today,
 the


horror
 is
 continuing.


>> At
 an
 emergency
 meeting
 of
 the
 United


Nations
 yesterday,
 officials
 condemned


the
 RSF
 and
 said
 there
 must
 be


accountability
 for
 foreign
 powers
 who


have
 backed
 the
 group.
 The
 Times
 has


previously
 found
 that
 the
 United
 Arab


Emirates
 secretly
 funneled
 them
 money,


weapons,
 and
 drones.


>> Stop
 arming
 this
 violence.
 There
 must
 be


accountability
 for
 those
 carrying
 out


the
 killing,
 and
 those
 providing
 the


weapons
 should
 consider
 their


responsibilities.


>> The
 Emirates
 has
 publicly
 denied
 backing


the
 RSF
 in
 the
 conflict.
 But
 in
 recent


days,
 with
 outrage
 over
 the
 violence


growing,
 congressional
 leaders
 in


Washington
 have
 called
 for
 a
 pause
 in


arm
 sales
 to
 the
 UAE.


In
 the
 UK
 yesterday,
 King
 Charles
 handed


down
 an
 extraordinary
 punishment,
 moving


to
 strip
 his
 brother,
 Prince
 Andrew,
 of


his
 title,
 something
 unheard
 of
 in
 the


history
 of
 the
 modern
 royal
 family.
 For


years,
 Andrew
 has
 faced
 accusations
 of


sexually
 assaulting
 a
 young
 woman,


Virginia
 Jeffrey,
 who
 was
 trafficked
 by


Jeffrey
 Epstein.
 Andrew
 has
 denied
 that,


though
 he
 paid
 a
 lawsuit
 that
 she


brought
 against
 him.
 Because
 of
 the


allegations,
 Andrew
 had
 already
 stepped


back
 from
 official
 duties
 and
 lost
 some


of
 his
 royal
 titles.
 Now
 though,


Buckingham
 Palace
 is
 going
 further
 after


new
 details
 about
 his
 alleged
 behavior


surfaced
 in
 Jeffrey's
 memoir,
 which
 was


published
 after
 her
 death
 by
 suicide.


The
 book
 contains
 vivid
 descriptions
 of


how
 she
 said
 Andrew
 had
 assaulted
 her
 in


London
 and
 at
 Epstein's
 homes
 in


Manhattan
 and
 the
 Virgin
 Islands.
 The


book
 reignited
 the
 scandal
 around
 the


royal
 family.
 And
 royal
 experts
 tell
 the


Times
 the
 king
 took
 action
 in
 part


because
 he
 was
 worried
 it
 was
 sapping


public
 support
 for
 the
 monarchy.
 Moving


forward,
 Andrew
 must
 now
 move
 out
 of
 his


sprawling
 residence,
 the
 Royal
 Lodge,


and
 is
 officially
 a
 commoner.


And
 finally,
 a
 new
 study
 out
 this
 week


looked
 at
 the
 effectiveness
 of
 a
 popular


new
 form
 of
 therapy.
 Therapy
 via
 text


message.
 It's
 exactly
 what
 it
 sounds


like.
 People
 may
 wake
 up,
 say,
 and
 text


their
 therapists
 that
 they're
 feeling


anxious.
 A
 few
 hours
 later
 comes
 a


response,
 encouraging
 them
 to
 label
 that


thought,
 reframe
 it,
 examine
 what
 may
 be


feeding
 that
 feeling.
 The
 pandemic


really
 supercharged
 the
 rise
 of
 this


kind
 of
 digital
 therapy
 and
 others
 in


place
 of
 in-person
 appointments.
 And
 the


study
 published
 in
 the
 journal
 JAMAMA


network
 open
 provides
 early
 evidence


that
 it
 is
 effective
 in
 treating
 mild
 to


moderate
 depression.
 In
 a
 clinical
 trial


of
 over
 800
 people,
 those
 who
 received


unlimited
 messaging
 with
 a
 therapist


reported
 improvement
 in
 their
 depression


symptoms,
 the
 same
 level
 of
 improvement


as
 those
 who
 had
 weekly
 video
 sessions


with
 a
 therapist.
 The
 study
 was
 kicked


off
 after
 a
 company
 that
 offers
 digital


therapy
 approached
 researchers.
 At
 the


moment,
 there's
 very
 little
 data
 about


text
 therapy
 since
 it
 hasn't
 been
 around


for
 very
 long,
 and
 most
 insurance


companies
 don't
 cover
 it.
 One
 medical


expert
 not
 involved
 with
 the
 study
 told


the
 Times
 that
 while
 the
 new
 evidence
 is


encouraging,
 it's
 not
 sufficient
 to


justify
 insurers
 deciding
 to
 cover
 this


kind
 of
 care
 just
 yet.


Those
 are
 the
 headlines.
 If
 you'd
 like


to
 play
 the
 Friday
 news
 quiz,
 stick


around.
 It's
 just
 after
 these
 credits.

Now,
 time
 for
 the
 quiz.
 Every
 week,
 we


ask
 you
 a
 few
 questions
 about
 stories


the
 Times
 has
 been
 covering.
 Can
 you
 get


them
 all?


First
 up,


>> bumpy
 weather

 in

air.
 We're
 a
 little
 bit
 bumpy.
 President


Trump
 spent
 a
 lot
 of
 time
 on
 Air
 Force


One
 this
 week
 as
 he
 went
 on
 a
 whirlwind


tour
 of
 Asia.
 We're
 going
 to
 do
 a
 speed


round
 on
 that
 for
 you
 where
 you
 have
 to


fill
 in
 four
 blanks
 about
 his
 visit.


Here
 we
 go.
 Trump
 started
 his
 tour
 on


Sunday
 when
 he
 landed
 in


Malaysia.
 He
 moved
 on
 to
 Japan
 where


officials
 seemed
 to
 try
 and
 get
 on
 his


good
 side
 over
 lunch
 by
 serving
 an


American
 grown
 version
 of
 the
 Japanese


staple


rice.
 They
 also
 put
 thousand
 island


dressing
 on
 the
 menu,
 apparently
 his


favorite.
 From
 there,
 Trump
 flew
 to


South
 Korea
 where
 he
 was
 presented
 with


a
 replica
 of
 an
 elaborate
 ancient
 royal


crown.

 obviously.
 And
 lastly,


one
 leader
 Trump
 did
 not
 meet
 with

the
 trip,
 even
 though
 he
 repeatedly
 said


he
 wanted
 to,
 was


Kim
 Jong-un

Moving
 on
 to
 the
 next
 question.
 We


continue
 to
 track
 Hurricane
 Melissa.


winds
 at
 160
 mph
 on
 the
 island
 nation
 of


Jamaica
 in
 the
 eye
 of
 the
 storm.


>> This
 week,
 Hurricane
 Melissa
 cut
 a
 path


across
 the
 Caribbean
 Sea
 as
 one
 of
 the


top
 five
 strongest
 hurricanes
 ever


recorded.
 Crews
 on
 board
 the
 US


government's
 so-called
 hurricane
 hunter


planes
 have
 flown
 into
 the
 storm


multiple
 times
 to
 gather
 valuable
 data.


During
 one
 of
 those
 flights,
 they


spotted
 something
 alive
 inside
 the
 eye


of
 the
 storm.
 What
 creatures
 were
 in


there?


The
 answer,
 birds.
 It's
 actually
 not


unusual
 for
 birds
 to
 get
 sucked
 into
 a


hurricane
 like
 that
 and
 then
 once


they're
 in
 the
 eye,
 it's
 almost


impossible
 to
 get
 out.
 So,
 they
 just


chug
 along
 in
 the
 calm
 center
 of
 it
 all.


A
 couple
 years
 ago,
 bird
 lovers
 in
 the


UK
 rushed
 to
 see
 more
 than
 a
 dozen


species
 of
 North
 American
 birds
 that


showed
 up
 after
 they
 were
 pulled
 all
 the


way
 across
 the
 Atlantic
 by
 the
 remnants


of
 a
 storm.


And
 last
 one,
 today
 is
 Halloween,
 in


case
 you're
 wondering
 why
 people
 outside


are
 wearing
 funny
 outfits
 and
 hitting


you
 up
 for
 candy.
 It's
 a
 day
 to
 trickor


treat
 or
 turn
 your
 lights
 off
 and


pretend
 you're
 not
 home.
 Also
 a
 good
 day


to
 break
 out
 the
 horror
 classics.
 We're


going
 to
 play
 you
 four
 screams
 from
 some


spooky,
 scary,
 or
 Halloween
 themed


favorites.
 See
 if
 you
 can
 ID
 what
 each


one
 of
 them
 is
 from.
 Scream
 queens
 might


get

 right
 off

 you


are

 are


coming.

One

 Hollywood

 for

It's
 actually
 been
 used
 in
 hundreds
 of


movies
 and
 TV
 shows,
 becoming
 so
 iconic


it
 has
 its
