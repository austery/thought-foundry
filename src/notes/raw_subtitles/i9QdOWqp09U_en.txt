Good

 to
 you.
 I'm
 Nathan
 Hager
 and
 we


begin
 today's
 program
 with
 earnings
 from


the
 biggest
 banks
 on
 Wall
 Street.
 JP


Morgan
 Chase,
 Goldman
 Sachs,
 Cityroup,


and
 Wells
 Fargo
 kick
 off
 big
 bank


earning
 season
 with
 Bank
 of
 America,
 and


Morgan
 Stanley
 not
 too
 far
 behind.
 For


more
 on
 what
 to
 expect,
 we're
 joined
 by


Allison
 Williams,
 senior
 analyst
 for


Global
 Banks
 and
 Asset
 Managers
 at


Bloomberg
 Intelligence.
 Allison,
 thanks


for
 being
 with
 us.
 Uh,
 let's
 just
 get


into
 it.
 What
 to
 expect,
 especially
 now


that
 we've
 uh
 heard
 some
 comments
 from


JP
 Morgan
 Chase
 CEO
 Jamie
 Diamond


himself.
 What
 are
 you
 looking
 for
 from


the
 big
 banks?


Thanks
 for
 having
 me.
 Three
 key
 things


that
 we're
 looking
 for
 for
 the
 big
 banks


this
 week.
 First,
 the
 strength
 in


markets
 is
 going
 to
 translate
 into


further
 revenue
 and
 profit
 momentum
 both


for
 the
 third
 quarter
 and
 the
 outlook.


We
 expect
 this
 could
 be
 a
 record
 year


for
 capital
 markets
 revenue
 and
 that


benefits
 all
 of
 the
 banks
 especially
 uh


Goldman
 Sachs
 and
 Morgan
 Stanley.
 Uh
 but


JP
 Morgan
 the
 leader
 um
 in
 absolute


revenue.
 Second,
 uh
 we
 have
 the
 add
 a


tailwind
 of
 improving
 core
 net
 interest


income
 as
 rate
 expectations
 are
 moving


lower
 while
 loan
 growth
 and
 in


particular
 commercial
 loan
 growth
 is


picking
 up.
 Third,
 credit
 remains
 solid


and
 we
 will
 see
 some
 provisioning
 uh
 we


expect
 for
 normalization
 and
 loan
 growth


but
 not
 much
 change
 to
 economic


assumptions
 underlying
 uh
 reserves.
 So


um
 based
 on
 these
 three
 core
 trends
 uh


putting
 them
 together
 we
 think
 that


earnings
 could
 beat
 with
 upward


revisions
 to
 estimates
 for
 2025
 and


2026.
 We
 are
 seeing
 some
 estimate


increases
 for
 the
 quarter.
 Uh
 some


positive
 revisions
 going
 into
 results


but
 notably
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 trading


which
 we
 think
 is
 going
 to
 be
 very


strong.
 Analyst
 estimates
 do
 tend
 to
 be


conservative
 so
 we
 think
 there
 is
 room


for
 upside
 there.
 Are
 you
 looking
 for


any
 big
 shifts
 in
 market
 share
 when
 it


comes
 to
 trading?
 Because
 it
 seems
 like


all
 of
 these
 banks
 are
 really
 going


after
 each
 other
 on
 that
 front
 and
 we


have
 seen
 this
 torid
 rally
 in
 the
 stock


market
 from
 the
 April
 low.


We
 do
 think
 that
 uh
 the
 big
 are
 going
 to


continue
 to
 get
 bigger.
 So
 the
 shift


that
 we've
 seen
 over
 time
 is
 that
 um
 you


know
 banks
 like
 Goldman
 Sachs,
 Morgan


Stanley
 and
 JP
 Morgan
 have
 gained
 share.


Um
 we've
 also
 uh
 seen
 Bank
 America
 and


Cityroup
 uh
 gain
 over
 the
 very
 long


term.
 But
 we
 think
 that
 uh
 this
 is
 going


to
 be
 a
 quarter
 where
 we
 see


outperformance
 especially
 in
 the
 equity


trading
 business
 from
 uh
 Goldman
 Sachs


who
 is
 the
 leader
 in
 that
 business
 and


absolute
 revenue.
 Um
 Goldman
 is
 also
 the


leader
 in
 M&A
 and
 we
 also
 expect
 them
 to


have
 a
 quarter
 in
 that
 business.


One
 of
 the
 key
 uh
 businesses
 that
 that


has
 been
 helping
 the
 banks
 is
 prime


brokerage
 and
 some
 of
 the
 larger
 hedge


funds
 um
 and
 the
 asset
 levels.
 You
 know,


when
 we
 look
 at
 some
 of
 the
 largest


hedge
 funds
 and
 we
 look
 at
 uh
 things


like
 record
 equity
 prices
 around
 the


globe
 um
 we
 do
 think
 that
 uh
 that


there's
 going
 to
 be
 some
 help
 to
 that


business.
 We
 also
 saw
 record
 trading


volume.
 You
 know
 when
 we
 look
 at
 the


underlying
 trends
 to
 trading
 uh
 the


equities
 trading
 business
 should
 be


supported
 by
 continued
 strength
 in
 prime


brokerage.
 We
 saw
 some
 record
 bounces


last
 quarter.
 We
 think
 we're
 going
 to


see
 new
 records
 this
 quarter.
 We
 also


saw
 a
 record
 in
 US
 exchange
 trading


volume.
 So
 um
 that's
 a
 big
 business
 for


the
 banks.
 But
 we're
 also
 going
 to
 see


strength
 on
 the
 fixed
 income
 side
 of


things
 both
 within
 rates
 and
 spread


trading.
 a
 really
 broad
 brace
 strength


um
 at
 the
 banks
 and
 we
 think
 that
 um
 it


it
 that's
 really
 going
 to
 help
 uh
 all


the
 competitors.


And
 what
 are
 you
 looking
 for
 when
 it


comes
 to
 commentary
 from
 these
 banks
 on


the
 resilience
 of
 the
 consumer
 that
 has


been
 the
 driver
 for
 this
 economy
 even


when
 we're
 starting
 to
 see
 you
 know


cracks
 in
 the
 labor
 market.
 When
 you


think
 about
 banks
 like
 Bank
 of
 America


and
 Croup
 that
 have,
 you
 know,
 more
 of
 a


focus
 on
 households,
 what
 could
 they


tell
 us
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 uh
 credit


quality,


you
 know,
 to
 to
 your
 point,
 we
 always
 do


get
 an
 eye
 into
 the
 consumer
 for
 these


banks.
 Uh
 the
 one
 interesting
 thing
 that


we're
 seeing
 at
 the
 industry
 level
 is
 uh


the
 commercial
 side
 of
 loan
 growth


picking
 up.
 It
 really
 has
 been
 the


credit
 card
 business
 that's
 been
 driving


growth,
 especially
 at
 these
 large
 uh


banks
 in
 recent
 years.
 But
 we
 are
 seeing


a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 shift
 to
 that
 on
 the


commercial
 side
 and
 we
 do
 think
 that


that's
 healthy.
 On
 the
 credit
 quality


side
 of
 things,
 as
 I
 said,
 I
 do
 think


that
 we
 see
 some
 normalization,


but
 we
 don't
 expect
 to
 see
 big
 changes


in
 economic
 assumptions.
 So,
 we
 think


that
 um
 the
 reserve
 building
 should
 be


relatively
 modest.


And
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 banks
 with
 a
 sort


of
 a
 big
 wealth
 management
 focus,
 I'm


thinking
 of
 you
 know
 Morgan
 Stanley,


Goldman
 Sachs,
 uh
 those
 kind
 of
 firms,


is
 the
 bar
 high
 for
 them?


The
 bar
 is
 high,
 but
 we
 think
 that
 they


are
 going
 to
 deliver
 on
 that
 bar
 because


um
 as
 I
 mentioned,
 we've
 seen
 uh
 global


equity
 prices
 and
 global
 equity
 market


capitalization
 hit
 a
 new
 record
 towards


the
 end
 of
 September.
 We've
 seen
 new


highs
 already
 in
 this
 fourth
 quarter
 and


that
 is
 very
 good
 for
 uh
 wealth
 and


banking
 fees
 both
 for
 the
 third
 quarter


and
 the
 outlook
 going
 into
 this
 quarter.


All
 right.
 Well,
 we'll
 see
 as
 that
 big


bank
 earning
 season
 kicks
 off
 early
 next


week.
 That's
 Allison
 Williams
 with
 us,


senior
 analyst
 for
 global
 banks
 and


asset
 managers
 at
 Bloomberg


Intelligence.
 Allison,
 thank
 you.
 We


move
 next
 to
 earnings
 from
 some
 of
 the


regional
 banks.
 Citizens
 Financial,


First
 Horizon,
 PNC
 Financial
 Services.


They
 are
 among
 the
 flood
 of
 lenders


opening
 their
 books
 this
 week.
 Let's


bring
 in
 Herman
 Chan
 to
 preview
 those


results.
 Herman's
 a
 senior
 analyst
 for


US
 regional
 banks
 at
 Bloomberg


Intelligence.
 These
 banks
 have
 been
 in


the
 spotlight.
 Herman,
 of
 course,
 these


results
 are
 coming
 off
 the
 heels
 of
 the


uh
 fifth
 bank
 deal
 for
 Co-America
 that


we
 all
 remember
 so
 much
 about.
 So,


should
 we
 be
 looking
 for
 more


consolidation
 chatter
 when
 the
 banks


report
 this
 week?


I
 think
 that's
 going
 to
 be
 the
 top


question
 uh
 within
 the
 analyst
 community


is
 is
 which
 banks
 are
 going
 to
 be


acquisitive
 and
 which
 banks
 potentially


are
 thinking
 about
 selling
 themselves.


We've
 seen,
 as
 you
 mentioned,
 the
 the


Fifth
 Third
 Com,
 and
 that
 comes
 on
 the


heels
 of
 PNC
 buying
 a
 bank
 in
 Colorado


called
 First
 Bank,
 uh,
 which
 really


boosts
 their
 Denver
 presence,
 and
 also


Huntington,
 which
 is
 a
 Ohio
 based
 lender


that's,
 uh,
 going
 into
 Texas
 with
 its


Veritex
 deal.
 So,
 there
 is
 definitely


some
 consolidation
 that's
 brewing,
 and


we'd
 expect
 that
 uh,
 continue
 going


forward.
 And
 of
 course,
 uh,
 Fifth
 Third


and
 Com
 are
 both
 going
 to
 be
 among
 those


banks
 opening
 their
 books.
 Uh,
 what
 are


you
 expecting
 specifically
 from
 those


results?


Yeah,
 so
 Fifth
 Third
 specifically
 H
 has


talked
 about
 um
 some
 strong
 lending


trends.
 So
 that's
 great
 to
 see
 and
 and


we'd
 expect
 some
 further
 improvement
 in


their
 top
 line.
 What
 um
 was
 the
 surprise


for
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 investment
 community
 is


that
 Fifth
 Third
 mentioned
 that
 they're


in
 snared
 in
 this
 uh
 bankruptcy.
 So


that's
 going
 to
 create
 a
 a
 fairly
 large


credit
 loss
 for
 them
 which
 will
 hit
 the


third
 quarter
 numbers.
 We
 view
 that
 as


more
 of
 a
 one-off
 issue
 that
 that


shouldn't
 reverberate
 throughout
 the


entire
 loan
 book
 and
 throughout
 the


industry,
 but
 it
 is
 something
 that'll
 uh


affect
 their
 their
 3Q
 reporting.
 In


terms
 of
 Kamemeric,
 Kame's
 been
 um
 one


of
 the
 banks
 that
 has
 taken
 a
 bit
 longer


to
 recover
 from
 the
 SVB
 issues
 a
 couple


years
 back.
 And
 so
 they're
 they're
 along


the
 way
 of
 trying
 to,
 you
 know,
 shore
 up


their
 balance
 sheet
 in
 terms
 of
 their


deposits
 and
 deposit
 repricing
 and


growing
 uh
 loans,
 but
 uh
 that
 that'll
 be


more
 steadier
 going
 forward.
 and
 we
 and


given
 the
 fact
 that
 they're
 going
 to
 do


this
 deal
 for
 a
 fifth,
 I
 think
 that's


going
 to
 be
 less
 of
 a
 priority
 for
 a
 lot


of
 the
 uh
 analysts
 and
 investors.


Are
 there
 some
 other
 banks
 reporting


this
 week
 that
 uh
 could
 be
 in
 a
 similar


situation
 as
 commeric
 and
 potentially
 be


acquisition
 targets
 themselves?


Yeah,
 that's
 that's
 a
 good
 question.


That's
 one
 of
 the
 things
 that
 we'll
 try


to
 sus
 out.
 Um
 there
 are
 banks
 that
 in


in
 our
 coverage
 that
 we
 think
 are


probably
 better
 uh
 buyers
 than
 sellers


at
 this
 point.
 So,
 uh,
 banks
 like


Regent,
 which
 operates
 in
 the
 southeast,


um,
 and
 has
 a
 really
 strong
 valuation


multiple
 that
 has
 the
 currency
 to
 really


do
 deals.
 Uh,
 another
 bank,
 um,
 based
 in


Buffalo,
 New
 York,
 Mnt
 Bank,
 also
 has
 a


track
 record
 of
 doing
 deals
 and
 has
 a


strong
 currency
 to
 do
 deals.
 So,
 those


are
 the
 ones
 that
 I
 think
 the
 market's


going
 to
 focus
 on
 in
 terms
 of,
 you
 know,


they're
 going
 to
 be
 the
 next
 to
 to


potentially
 be
 acquisitive.
 Uh
 you


mentioned
 uh
 one
 earlier,
 PNC
 Financial,


talking
 about
 their
 expansion
 plans
 in


the
 Southwest
 in
 particular.
 Do
 you


expect
 that
 to
 to
 show
 up
 in
 the
 results


and
 bolster
 the
 balance
 sheet?


At
 this
 point,
 uh
 that
 deal
 needs
 to
 be


closed,
 but
 I
 think
 uh
 the
 next
 question


for
 PNC
 in
 particular,
 um
 is
 what's
 next


for
 them?
 They've
 been
 vocal
 about


potentially
 doubling
 their
 balance
 sheet


to
 over
 a
 trillion
 dollars
 in
 assets.


And
 this
 deal,
 while
 helpful,
 it's
 not


going
 to
 get
 them
 there
 anytime
 soon.


So,
 there's
 going
 to
 be
 some
 organic


growth,
 but
 really
 there's
 going
 to
 be


more
 consolidation
 over
 the
 next
 several


years.
 Where
 do
 they
 go
 next?
 They


they've
 done
 the
 deal
 with
 First
 Bank.


They've
 acquired
 BBVA
 USA,
 which
 really


is
 the
 jump
 start
 for
 their
 South
 uh


West
 and
 and
 and
 Sunb
 Belt
 expansion


into
 California
 as
 well.
 And
 now
 it's
 a


a
 coast
 to
 coast
 lender.
 So
 where
 do


they
 grow
 from
 here?
 That's
 going
 to
 be


the
 next
 question.


Interesting.
 Now
 uh
 one
 other
 bank
 I


mentioned
 earlier
 has
 been
 coming
 off
 uh


its
 own
 deals
 as
 well.
 What
 are
 you


looking
 for
 from
 Citizens?


Yeah,
 Citizens
 H
 has
 done
 a
 string
 of


deals
 over
 the
 past
 few
 years.
 they
 they


really
 um
 filled
 in
 their
 market


footprint
 which
 was
 missing
 in
 the
 New


York
 City
 metro
 area
 with
 investors
 bank


corp
 in
 New
 Jersey
 and
 then
 they


acquired
 uh
 the
 branches
 from
 HSBC
 in


the
 New
 York
 City
 metro
 area.
 So
 that


really
 fills
 out
 their
 their
 traditional


northeast
 u
 uh
 New
 England
 footprint
 w


with
 the
 mid-Atlantic
 footprint.
 So


they're
 comfortably
 in
 Wisconsin
 in
 the


northeast
 and
 and
 do
 they
 expand
 more


outside
 where
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 its
 large


competitors
 have
 moved
 into
 the
 into
 the


southeast
 as
 well.
 So
 that
 that's
 going


to
 be
 top
 of
 mind
 and
 a
 good
 question


for
 them.
 There's
 some
 scuttlebutt
 in


the
 investor
 community
 if
 citizens
 is


going
 to
 be
 a
 seller
 or
 a
 buyer.
 So
 that


that's
 an
 ongoing
 question
 um


particularly
 as
 larger
 banks
 try
 to
 get


bigger
 to
 compete
 with
 the
 likes
 of
 JP


Morgan
 and
 BFA.


All
 right.
 Well
 looking
 forward
 to


regional
 bank
 earnings
 season.
 Thank
 you


for
 this
 Herman.

And
 the
 creative
 minds
 you
 haven't
 heard


of
 yet.
 It
 is
 serious
 stuff,
 but
 never


doom
 and
 gloom.
 I
 am
 Akshhati.
 Listen

This
 is
 Bloomberg
 Daybreak
 Week
 and
 our


global
 look
 ahead
 at
 the
 top
 stories
 for


investors
 in
 the
 coming
 week.
 I'm
 Nathan


Hager
 in
 Washington.
 Up
 later
 in
 our


program,
 after
 a
 fresh
 record
 for
 gold,


what's
 ahead
 for
 bullion
 heading
 into


November.
 But
 first,
 in
 the
 coming
 days,


global
 climate
 bankers,
 forecasters,
 and


government
 ministers
 will
 gather
 in


London
 for
 the
 annual
 new
 energy
 finance


summit.
 The
 number
 of
 extreme
 weather


events
 keeps
 rising,
 and
 the
 economic


damage
 they
 cause
 is
 going
 up,
 too.
 With


the
 US
 pushing
 the
 EU
 to
 stop
 buying


Russian
 gas
 and
 to
 cut
 back
 on
 green


regulation,
 many
 are
 asking
 if
 the


continent's
 green
 plans
 for
 the
 future


are
 still
 intact.
 For
 more,
 let's
 go
 to


London
 and
 bring
 in
 Bloomberg
 Daybreak


Europe
 anchor
 Caroline
 Heepker.
 Nathan,


Europe
 is
 getting
 hotter,
 2.4Â°
 C
 hotter


than
 before
 the
 industrial
 revolution.


That's
 4
 and
 a
 half
 degrees
 Fahrenheit


for
 our
 US
 listeners.
 That
 means
 the


continent
 is
 warming
 faster
 than
 any


other
 region
 on
 Earth,
 which
 in
 turn
 is


disrupting
 the
 continent's
 weather.
 It's


also
 getting
 harder
 to
 predict
 when


power
 grids
 need
 more
 energy
 to
 cope.


That
 hasn't
 stopped
 some
 European


politicians
 from
 calling
 for
 the
 roll


back
 of
 green
 pledges
 as
 they
 grapple


with
 high
 costs
 of
 living.
 Greg
 Jackson


is
 chief
 executive
 officer
 of
 the
 UK's


largest
 energy
 retailer,
 Octopus
 Energy.


He
 told
 us
 that's
 a
 knock-on
 effect
 of


the
 shift
 in
 America.


You
 can't
 ignore
 what
 happened
 in
 the


US.
 you
 know,
 you
 went
 from
 an


administration
 that
 passed
 the
 IRA,
 you


know,
 one
 of
 the
 biggest
 commitments
 to


to
 government
 support
 uh
 for
 a
 specific


set
 of
 industries
 in
 history,
 you
 know,


world
 changing
 to
 an
 administration
 that


use
 the
 phrase
 drill
 baby
 drill.
 I
 think


that
 has
 really
 set
 the
 tone
 in
 a
 bunch


of
 European
 countries,
 including
 the
 UK,


where
 there
 is
 now
 an
 intense
 debate


about
 our
 future
 of
 energy.
 That
 was


Octopus
 Energy
 CEO
 Greg
 Jackson
 there
 on


this
 week's
 Zero
 podcast.
 So,
 what
 does


the
 future
 of
 power
 look
 like?
 Well,
 in


the
 next
 few
 days,
 the
 European
 Union's


energy
 commissioner
 and
 Portugal's


energy
 minister
 will
 be
 joining


executives
 right
 here
 in
 London
 for
 the


annual
 BNEF
 summit.
 Joining
 me
 now
 is


Ben
 Vickers,
 who
 is
 our
 chief
 editor
 of


Bloomberg
 NEF,
 and
 Joe
 Wartz,
 our


weather
 and
 climate
 reporter
 here
 in


London.
 Welcome
 to
 both
 of
 you.
 All


right,


Joe,
 can
 I
 start
 with
 you?
 Firstly,


we're
 thinking
 about
 climate
 change.


Summers
 in
 Europe
 have
 seen


record-breaking
 heat
 waves
 with
 really


serious
 consequences.
 I
 wonder
 when
 you


think
 about
 your
 work,
 your
 job
 as
 a


weather
 and
 climate
 reporter.
 How
 has


that
 changed?


Well,
 I
 mean,
 isn't
 that
 the
 joke,


right?
 That
 the
 the
 weather
 is
 always


always
 changing.
 Uh,
 you
 know,
 my
 job


has
 changed
 quite
 a
 bit.
 you
 know,
 uh,


really
 as
 I
 started
 as
 a
 climate
 and


environment
 reporter
 and
 increasingly


that
 became
 more
 and
 more
 about
 extreme


weather
 and,
 you
 know,
 extreme
 weather


really
 shapes
 how
 people,
 businesses,


you
 know,
 power,
 energy
 move
 across
 the


world.
 It
 dictates
 trade
 um,
 economy
 and


in
 people's
 lives
 and
 and
 and
 that's


increasingly,
 you
 know,
 the
 story
 that


that
 that
 we're
 focusing
 on.
 Ben,
 how


are
 Bloomberg's
 NEF
 teams
 looking
 at


this
 changing
 world,
 the
 impact
 of


climate
 change?
 A
 kind
 of
 big
 big


thought.


Yeah,
 I
 was
 going
 to
 say
 that's
 a
 very


very
 big
 question.
 So
 I
 mean
 basically


what
 we
 do
 um
 we're
 a
 data
 supplier
 and


we
 do
 analysis
 from
 the
 back
 of
 that
 and


we're
 looking
 at
 the
 shift
 um
 in
 the


economies
 worldwide
 to
 a
 basically
 a


lower
 carbon
 economy
 for
 everyone.
 Now,


climate
 adaptation
 and
 climate
 risk
 have


come
 to
 the
 four.
 Um,
 so
 we're
 adding


new
 areas
 of
 research
 to
 help
 companies


and
 and
 policy
 makers
 sort
 of
 navigate


um
 not
 just
 the
 the
 climate
 risk
 and
 and


the
 need
 for
 climate
 adaptation,
 but


also
 how
 to
 keep
 businesses
 going,
 keep


them
 profitable
 um
 as
 as
 we
 as
 we
 um
 go


down
 the
 the
 route.
 Energy
 transition


really


energy
 transition.
 Yeah.
 Exactly.


So,
 it's
 a
 very
 it's
 very
 much
 a


changing
 picture
 as
 well.
 It's
 not
 as


bad
 as
 the
 weather,
 but
 um
 yeah,
 the


shifting.
 Well,
 thinking
 about
 that


weather
 element,
 Joe,
 in
 the
 winter


months,
 Europe
 has
 had
 in
 the
 past
 fears


that
 a
 sudden
 cold
 snap
 would
 cause
 gas


prices
 to
 spike.
 This
 in
 amidst
 all
 of


the
 other
 kind
 of
 energy
 challenges
 that


we
 have.
 Is
 there
 also
 a
 similar
 concern


about
 that
 this
 year?


Yes,
 absolutely.
 We've
 already
 seen
 uh


you
 know
 a
 early
 season
 coal
 snap.
 We
 we


had
 a
 had
 a
 big
 one
 in
 Eastern
 uh
 Europe


already.
 And
 you
 know,
 traders
 and


governments
 are
 really
 locked
 in
 right


now.
 This
 is
 basically
 like
 yeah
 cold


snap
 hunting
 season
 uh
 for
 governments


and
 traders.
 They're
 their
 eyes
 are
 on


the
 forecast.
 They're
 they're
 they're


they're
 watching
 for
 any
 sign
 um
 that
 a


drop
 in
 temperatures
 could
 really
 throw


off
 balance
 the
 sort
 of
 fragile
 state
 of


the
 uh
 energy
 markets
 right
 now.
 You


know,
 increased
 competition
 for
 for
 for


for
 gas.
 And
 so,
 you
 know,
 any
 any
 any


deviation
 there,
 any
 any
 cold
 snap
 can


really
 raise
 demand
 and
 create
 ripple


effects.


And
 gas
 storage
 has
 also
 been
 an
 issue.


It's
 been
 an
 issue
 in
 the
 UK
 and
 across


Europe
 in
 past
 winters.
 Is
 it
 equally


bad
 this
 time
 round?


So,
 you
 know,
 uh
 Europe
 did
 a
 did
 a
 good


job
 stockpiling
 gas
 over
 the
 summer.
 Uh


it's
 still
 that
 stockpiling
 was
 below
 uh


what
 is
 is
 historically
 the
 summer,
 you


know,
 norm
 for
 stockpiling,
 but
 it
 it it


did
 beat
 some
 expectations
 for
 that


stockpiling.
 So,
 they
 you
 know,
 we


started
 the
 natural
 gas
 winter


essentially,
 which
 starts
 in
 October.
 So


started
 that
 season
 with
 about
 83%
 of


the
 stock
 piles
 full.
 Um,
 which
 was


better
 than
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 expected,


but
 still
 not
 as
 good
 as
 it
 as
 it
 as
 it


could
 be.
 But
 we've
 already
 seen
 with


that
 that
 first
 cold
 snap
 we
 had
 uh


recently
 in
 Eastern
 Europe
 that
 uh
 some


European
 countries
 are
 already
 having
 to


tap
 into
 that
 into
 that
 gas
 supply.


Absolutely.
 Now,
 of
 course,
 there
 have


been
 incidents
 of
 blackouts
 in
 Europe,


and
 I
 think
 this
 is
 going
 to
 be
 quite


crucial.
 When
 you
 speak
 to
 Portugal's


energy
 minister,
 who
 is
 speaking


actually
 at
 the
 Bloomberg
 NEF
 summit


just
 in
 the
 next
 few
 days,
 I'm
 sure


there'll
 be
 a
 lot
 of
 interest
 in


understanding
 what
 she
 has
 to
 say
 about


how
 the
 country
 dealt
 with
 that


blackout.
 It
 has
 been
 blamed
 both
 on
 the


power
 grid
 and
 also
 on
 renewable
 energy.


And
 Ben,
 you're
 going
 to
 be
 interviewing


her.
 What
 are
 you
 going
 to
 try
 to
 ask


and
 find
 out?


So,
 well,
 there's
 a
 couple
 of
 things.


There's
 obviously
 the
 human
 side
 to
 this


because
 being
 an
 energy
 minister
 and


waking
 up
 one
 morning
 with
 the
 lights


off,
 not
 just
 in
 your
 house
 or
 down
 the


street,
 but
 across
 the
 country
 is
 is


probably
 a
 nightmare.
 So,
 there's
 that


personal
 experience
 of
 finding
 yourself


in
 the
 hot
 seat.
 Um,
 and
 and
 um
 well,


three
 3
 months
 after
 that
 April
 28th


blackout,
 the
 minister
 presented
 31


measures
 to
 basically
 address
 all
 the


all
 the
 problems
 they've
 been
 able
 to


identify.
 And
 some
 of
 those
 are


obviously
 within
 her
 remitt.
 Those
 are


the
 ones
 she's
 she's
 trying
 to
 address.


But
 there's
 a
 bigger
 bigger
 issue
 of


inter
 interconnections
 basically
 between


European
 power
 markets.
 And
 for
 a
 long


time,
 Spain
 and
 Portugal
 have
 been


asking
 France
 um
 to
 improve
 the
 the


connections
 between
 those
 countries.
 And


there's
 a
 sort
 of
 a
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a


tiff
 between
 them
 and
 and
 and


allegations
 that
 their
 interest
 for
 the


nuclear
 power
 plants
 to
 be
 able
 to
 sell


their
 power
 um
 rather
 than
 allowing


solar
 from
 Spain
 to
 come
 in
 really


cheaply
 and
 so
 on.
 So
 there's
 a
 little


bit
 of
 EU
 negotiation
 to
 go
 on
 there
 as


well.
 But
 they're
 investing
 137
 million


in
 their
 grid
 to
 upgrade
 that.
 Um


they're
 putting
 in
 a
 couple
 of
 um
 new


power
 stations
 that
 are
 going
 to
 um


light
 up
 in
 January
 which
 are
 what
 they


call
 they
 call
 them
 black
 start
 stations


which
 is
 basically
 when
 everything
 goes


off
 these
 switch
 on
 automatically
 and


and
 sort
 of
 a
 first
 line
 of
 defense
 but


there's
 actually
 quite
 a
 you
 know
 31
 of


these
 measures.
 So
 we're
 going to
 be


talking
 to
 her
 a
 lot
 about
 what
 the


plans
 are


what
 the
 plans
 are
 and
 what
 what
 she's


delivering
 and
 how
 quickly
 and
 so
 on.


Yes,
 I
 think
 that
 will
 be
 really


fascinating.
 Um
 in
 terms
 of
 though
 the


other
 major
 theme
 surely
 is
 about
 the


backlash
 against
 green
 energy.
 I
 mean
 a


little
 bit
 of
 that
 comes
 through
 in
 the


discussion
 around
 Portugal
 and
 the


spending
 required
 Joe
 for
 climate


adaptation.
 This
 is
 a
 significant
 issue


in
 the
 US.
 It
 has
 also
 rippled
 across


Europe.
 Is
 it
 gaining
 traction
 in


particular
 parts
 of
 Europe
 or
 for


particular
 areas
 in
 the
 energy
 space?


You
 know,
 it
 really
 seems
 to
 be
 gaining


traction
 in
 in
 all
 sorts
 of
 different


corners
 across
 Europe.
 The
 context
 here


is
 that
 Europe's
 energy
 grid,
 energy


markets
 are
 increasingly
 uh
 renewable,


increasingly
 rely
 on
 on
 the
 weather.


They're
 dependent
 on
 how
 much
 sun
 is


shining,
 how
 much
 uh
 wind
 is
 blowing
 and


also
 uh
 comes
 with
 all
 the
 you
 know


international
 competition
 for
 gas
 and


other
 factors.
 Geopolitics
 can
 influence


the
 supply
 side
 of
 that
 equation.
 Uh
 so


you
 know
 increased
 pressure
 on
 all
 those


markets
 um
 are
 are
 are
 definitely
 uh
 you


know
 raising
 the
 stakes
 and
 in
 each
 of


these
 countries
 you
 know
 these
 ambitious


uh
 climate
 targets
 that
 they
 set
 up
 uh


uh
 have
 have
 really
 been
 challenged.
 You


know
 last
 month
 was
 supposed
 to
 be
 a
 big


milestone
 right?
 Europe
 was
 supposed
 to


get
 together
 and
 uh
 come
 to
 uh
 this
 big


agreement
 this
 final
 agreement
 on
 on


their
 long-term
 2040
 targets
 and
 and
 and


they
 kicked
 that
 can
 down
 the
 road
 um


and
 and
 now
 those
 countries
 are
 are


fighting
 about
 that.
 there's
 more


domestic
 spending
 demands
 on
 each
 of


these
 countries.
 Um,
 in
 some
 cases,


these
 countries
 are
 wanting
 to
 siphon


off
 more
 money
 for
 defense
 spending
 and


and
 things
 like
 that
 and
 and
 and
 and


more
 political
 uh
 uh
 unease
 with
 uh
 some


of
 the
 ambitious
 spending
 targets
 that


go
 along
 with
 these
 these
 green
 goals.


And
 if
 that
 wasn't
 enough,
 you
 just
 have


to
 throw
 in
 artificial
 intelligence,


which
 we
 have
 spent
 months
 thinking


about,
 you
 know,
 the
 big
 buildout
 of


artificial
 intelligence,
 the
 energy


demand,
 Ben,
 that
 is
 going
 to
 also
 um


really
 underline
 some
 of
 the


difficulties
 in
 the
 energy
 space.
 How
 um


do
 you
 think
 that
 the
 impact
 of
 AI
 is


going
 to affect
 your
 forecast
 when
 it


comes
 to
 power
 demand?
 How
 are
 you


thinking
 about
 this
 oncoming
 technology?


So
 there's
 there's
 a
 massive
 amount
 of


interest
 in
 in
 the
 impact
 that
 AI
 is


going
 to
 have
 on
 on
 power
 demand
 on
 on


prices
 more
 generally
 as
 well
 for


consumers.
 Yeah,
 we
 we've
 been
 looking


at
 what
 the
 likely
 development
 of
 AI


data
 centers
 basically
 the
 the


hyperscalers.
 But
 um
 we're
 looking
 at


out
 to
 2035
 um
 the
 power
 demand
 from


data
 centers
 expected
 to
 have
 quadrupled


from
 where
 it
 is
 right
 now.
 That's
 only


actually
 4.4%
 of
 all
 the
 electricity


demand
 worldwide.
 So
 it's
 a
 small


proportion
 of
 the
 electricity
 worldwide


but
 it's
 where
 it
 happens
 and
 when
 it


happens
 I
 suppose
 which
 is
 really


important.
 Now
 if
 in
 2035
 you
 put
 all


the
 data
 centers
 together
 they
 would
 be


and
 and
 look
 at
 them
 as
 if
 they
 were
 a


country
 they
 would
 be
 the
 fourth
 largest


country
 in
 the
 world
 behind
 the
 US,


China,
 India
 then
 there's
 data
 centers


as
 a
 sort
 of
 a
 a
 demand
 center.
 So
 it
 is


it
 is
 going
 to
 be
 very
 big.
 That
 said,


as
 as
 one
 of
 the
 one
 of the
 senior


executives
 in
 one
 of
 the
 AI
 companies


was
 saying
 this
 week,
 you
 know,
 if


there's
 only
 one
 thing
 you
 really
 need


need
 to
 know
 about
 AI,
 which
 is
 it's


changing
 so
 fast
 and
 we
 don't
 quite
 know


what's
 going
 to
 happen.
 So,
 so
 the


forecasting
 here
 is
 going
 to
 be
 is


obviously
 going
 to
 be
 quite
 tricky.
 Um


yeah,
 uh
 shortterm
 we
 expect
 the
 demand


to
 be
 demand
 for
 power
 to
 be
 supplied
 by


rather
 traditional
 sources.
 So,
 it
 is


going to
 be
 coal
 and
 gas
 coming
 in.
 Um


that's
 in
 the
 short
 term
 because
 the
 the


buildout
 is
 so
 rapid.
 Um
 so
 places
 in


the
 US
 like
 Virginia
 and
 Oregon,
 Texas


and
 Ohio
 which
 have
 classically
 been


able
 to
 be
 able
 to
 supply
 this
 are
 going


to
 benefit
 from
 the
 immediate
 demand
 but


longer
 term
 then
 renewables
 have
 an


opportunity
 to
 move
 in
 here.


Yeah.
 And
 that's
 that's
 a
 trend
 that
 we


see
 uh
 you
 know
 generally
 in
 in
 such
 a


tight
 market
 like
 Europe
 is
 that
 u
 not


just
 with
 data
 centers
 but
 just


traditional
 sources
 of
 demand
 for
 for


for
 electricity.
 um
 when
 the
 demand
 gets


high
 and
 the
 prices
 uh
 spike
 or
 maybe


the
 supply
 is
 con
 you
 know
 constrained


um
 they
 they
 switch
 on
 the
 traditional


sources
 of
 of
 of
 of
 power
 to
 to


supplement
 that
 grid.
 That
 means
 you


know
 switching
 on
 a
 gas
 plant
 and
 uh


using
 what
 can
 be
 switched
 on
 more


reliably
 than
 than
 maybe
 the
 wind
 or
 the


solar
 which
 uh
 you
 know
 might
 not
 be


coming
 in
 the
 middle
 of
 a
 of
 a
 cold
 dark


day.

ever.
 This
 year
 has
 seen
 a
 meteoric
 rise


for
 the
 precious
 metal.
 Year
 to
 date,


it's
 up
 a
 whopping
 50%.
 And
 that
 gain
 is


catching
 the
 eye
 of
 one
 of
 Wall
 Street's


biggest
 names.
 Ken
 Griffin,
 the
 CEO
 of


Citadel,
 says
 the
 surge
 in
 gold
 could


point
 to
 a
 move
 away
 from
 the
 dollar,


and
 he
 says
 that's
 concerning.
 Ken


Griffin
 sat
 down
 for
 a
 wide-ranging


interview
 with
 Bloomberg's
 Francine


Lacqua
 to
 weigh
 in
 on
 gold's
 future
 and


the
 prospects
 for
 a
 US
 recession
 on
 the


horizon.
 Let's
 listen
 into
 that


conversation.
 Now,
 let's
 just
 cut
 to
 the


chase.
 Inflation
 is
 substantially
 above


target
 and
 substantially
 above
 target
 in


all
 forecast
 for
 next
 year.
 I
 mean,
 it's


part
 of
 the
 reason
 the
 dollar
 has


depreciated
 by
 about
 10%
 in
 the
 first


half
 of
 this
 year.
 It's
 the
 single


biggest
 decline


in
 the
 US
 dollar
 in
 6
 months
 in
 50


years.
 Gold
 is
 is
 at
 record
 highs.
 And


the
 appreciation
 in
 other
 dollar


substitutes
 um
 to
 use
 that
 word
 loosely


in
 in
 items
 like
 crypto,
 for
 example,
 is


is
 is
 unbelievable.
 So,
 we're
 seeing


substantial
 asset
 inflation
 away
 from


the
 dollar
 as
 as
 people
 are
 looking
 for


ways
 to
 effectively
 dd
 dollararize
 or


derisk
 their
 portfolios
 visa
 v
 sovereign


risk.


Are
 you
 really
 seeing
 that?


No,
 just
 check
 the
 price
 of
 gold.


Well,
 I
 mean,
 I
 don't
 have
 to
 look
 very


hard.


Life
 of
 its
 own.


Yeah.


What?


It's
 a
 life
 of
 its
 own.
 Gold.


No,
 but
 it's
 a
 life
 of
 its
 own.
 as
 as


you
 see
 sovereigns
 around
 the
 world,
 as


you
 see
 central
 banks
 around
 the
 world,


as
 you
 see
 individual
 investors
 around


the
 world
 go,
 you
 know
 what,
 I
 now
 view


gold
 as
 a
 safe
 harbor
 asset
 in
 a
 way


that
 the
 dollar
 used
 to
 be
 viewed.


That's
 that's
 what's
 really
 concerning


to
 me.
 And
 there's
 been
 plenty
 of


published
 research
 in
 in
 recent
 weeks,


months
 about
 foreign
 investors
 now
 when


they
 buy
 US
 equities
 hedging
 the
 returns


back
 to
 their
 local
 currency.


So
 that
 again
 is
 a
 bifurcation
 of
 I
 I'm


going
 to
 bet
 on
 American
 business,
 but
 I


want
 to
 immunize
 some
 of
 my
 sovereign


exposure
 to
 the
 United
 States.


Can
 the
 previous
 panel
 was
 talking
 about


the
 shutdown?
 Given
 where
 we
 are
 in
 the


shutdown,
 can
 the
 Fed
 properly
 do
 its


job
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 month
 in
 these


circumstances
 where
 we
 we
 may
 not
 have


enough
 data?


I
 I
 I
 don't
 think
 the
 data
 over
 a
 few


weeks
 should
 really
 be
 that


determinative
 to
 the
 Fed.
 I
 mean,
 that


that
 sort
 of
 over


over
 grandizes
 what
 the
 impact
 or


importance
 of
 that
 data
 is,
 particularly


with
 the
 sampling
 errors
 that's


intrinsic
 in
 how
 that
 data
 is
 is


produced
 and
 compiled
 for
 the
 Fed.
 Like


I
 I
 just
 think
 that's
 that's
 a
 bit
 of
 a


a
 misplaced
 warrior
 concern.


Do
 you
 worry
 about
 the
 shutdown
 full


stop?


Look,
 the
 the
 the
 shutdown
 is
 symbolic


of
 a
 different
 problem
 which
 is
 the


dysfunction
 between
 the
 Republican
 and


Democratic
 party
 on
 on
 resolving
 issues


with
 respect
 to
 the
 budget
 of
 the
 United


States
 of
 America.
 And
 and
 to
 be
 clear,


both
 parties
 today
 are
 are
 guilty
 of


just
 proflegate
 spending.
 You
 know,
 as
 I


said
 at
 the
 start,
 the
 US
 fiscal


situation
 is
 that
 of
 of
 a
 nation
 that's


trying
 to
 work
 its
 way
 out
 of
 a


recession.


Except
 the
 reality
 is
 is
 we're
 multiple


years
 into
 into
 a
 very
 high
 period
 of


growth.
 This
 is
 where
 we
 should
 be


running
 a
 deficit
 of
 of,
 you
 know,
 in


the
 Clinton
 days,
 we
 ran
 a
 surplus


at
 this
 point
 in
 the
 business
 cycle.


We're
 now
 running
 a
 deficit
 of
 close
 to


six
 six
 to
 7%
 depending
 upon
 on
 where
 a


number
 of
 things
 land.
 that
 is
 just


completely
 irresponsible.


And
 so
 what's
 amazing
 is
 is
 we're
 having


a
 shutdown
 debate
 over
 in
 the
 scheme
 of


things
 a
 relatively
 small
 amount
 of


money.
 And
 neither
 party
 is
 stepping
 up


the
 plate
 to
 to
 deal
 with
 or
 grapple


with
 the
 reality
 that
 the
 United
 States


needs
 to
 endure
 a
 fair
 amount
 of
 fiscal


reform
 to
 be
 on
 a
 path
 for
 long-term


sustainability.


Why
 is
 it
 not
 being
 talked
 about?
 it


it's
 politically
 unpopular
 and
 and


unfortunately
 politics
 had
 gotten


shorter
 and
 shorter
 and
 shorter
 in


horizon.
 You
 know,
 can
 you
 imagine
 that


like
 I
 said
 in
 the
 Clinton
 days
 they


signed
 a
 budget
 with
 a
 surplus


and
 yet
 that
 was
 in
 our
 lifetime.


It's
 been
 a
 long
 time
 since
 we've
 seen


that
 level
 of
 discipline
 in
 Washington


around
 managing
 the
 affairs
 of
 the
 US


economy.


You
 worry
 a
 lot
 about
 debt
 or
 you
 worry


about
 debt.
 What's
 the
 way
 out?


Well,
 I
 mean,
 you
 must
 also
 like
 we
 all


have
 to
 worry
 about
 the
 level
 of
 debt
 we


have
 in
 the
 United
 States.
 And


the
 market
 is
 pretty
 cool
 about
 it.


The
 the
 market
 is
 is
 we'll
 we'll
 look


past
 it
 for
 a
 few
 years,
 but
 if
 you
 go


out
 with
 with
 anybody
 to
 talk
 about
 what


they
 worry
 about
 with
 respect
 to
 the
 US


economy,
 the
 fiscal
 situation
 is
 almost


always
 top
 of
 list.
 So,
 you
 know,
 I
 I


think
 there's
 one
 thing
 to
 keep
 in
 mind,


which
 is
 which
 is
 asset
 prices
 reflect
 a


level
 of
 exuberance
 that
 we
 see
 today.


But
 I
 got
 to
 tell
 you,
 if
 you're
 out


with
 with
 anybody
 who's
 in
 the
 asset


management
 business,
 top
 of
 list


concerns,


the
 level
 of
 spending
 in
 Washington
 is


is
 always
 top
 three,
 if
 not
 number
 one


on
 the
 list.


What's
 the
 way
 out?


Well,
 the
 the
 way
 out
 is
 we
 need
 I
 mean,


first
 and
 foremost,
 growth
 is
 an


important
 part
 of
 the
 way
 out.


And
 this
 is
 where
 the
 Trump's


administration
 focus
 on
 deregulation
 is


so
 important.


It's
 so
 important
 in
 terms
 of
 of


creating
 an
 environment
 in
 which
 growth


can
 exist.
 Like
 really
 important.


Unleash
 unleash
 the
 animal
 spirits
 in


America.
 And
 the
 one
 thing
 about
 this


country
 different
 than
 most
 countries
 is


the
 entrepreneurial
 class
 in
 this


country
 is
 incredibly
 ambitious
 and
 it's


really
 able
 to
 make
 profound
 changes


happen.
 I
 mean
 if
 you
 look
 at
 if
 you


look
 across
 our
 investment
 portfolios


a
 substantial
 portion
 of
 all
 the
 money


we
 invest
 is
 in
 businesses
 started
 in


the
 last
 50
 years.


I
 mean,
 it's
 it's
 remarkable


the
 wealth
 created
 in
 this
 country
 by


newly
 formed
 businesses.
 It's
 just


stunning.
 It's
 the
 envy
 of
 the
 world.


And
 the
 Trump
 administration
 is
 is
 is


certainly
 taking
 steps
 to
 help
 encourage


that
 continued
 American
 success
 story,


but
 we
 also
 need
 to
 give
 real


consideration
 to
 tax
 policy
 and
 to


spending
 policies.
 And
 I
 think
 that
 the


the


How
 are
 they
 rebanding
 rebranding
 the


big
 beautiful
 bill
 at
 this
 point?
 Do
 you


know
 what
 the
 rebranding
 is
 going to
 be


yet?


How
 would
 you
 rebrand
 it?


Well,
 I
 mean,
 I
 I
 don't
 think
 there's
 a


nice
 way
 to
 put
 lipstick
 lipstick
 on


that
 pig.
 I
 mean,
 it's
 it's
 a
 it's
 a


proyical
 tax
 cut
 late
 in
 the
 in
 the


economic
 cycle.
 And
 you
 know,
 everybody


in
 this
 room,
 like,
 let's
 be
 clear,
 no


one
 wants
 to
 pay
 more
 in
 taxes,
 but
 if


you're
 not
 on
 a
 sustainable
 set
 of
 tax


policies
 in
 the
 best
 of
 times,


what
 policies
 will
 that
 unleash
 in
 the


worst
 of
 times?
 You
 know,
 for
 example,


will
 the
 United
 States
 head
 towards
 a


wealth
 tax
 when
 the
 in
 inevitable
 bills


come
 due?
 Will
 we
 head
 towards
 tax
 rates


that
 we
 last
 saw
 in
 Europe,
 60,
 70,
 80%


as
 the
 inevitable
 bills
 come
 due?
 like


what
 is
 the
 long-term
 consequence


of
 these
 policies
 right
 here
 right
 now?


And
 I
 think
 people
 are
 very
 concerned


about
 what
 that
 might
 be
 in
 10
 or
 15
 or


20
 years.
 How
 do
 inheritance
 taxes
 have


to
 change
 in
 light
 of
 the
 tremendous


amount
 of
 wealth
 held
 by
 the
 baby


boomers
 and
 the
 tremendous
 amount
 of


debt
 that
 their
 generation
 was
 was
 a


part
 of.
 So
 I
 think
 these
 are
 going
 to


be
 really
 interesting
 policy
 debates


that
 will
 emerge
 7
 years,
 10
 years,
 15


years
 down
 the
 road
 which
 could
 have


some
 pretty
 adverse
 consequences.
 I
 mean


particularly
 for
 American


entrepreneurialism.
 You
 know
 today
 as
 an


entrepreneur
 you're
 like
 if
 I
 build
 a


great
 business
 I
 will
 get
 to
 keep
 a


substantial
 amount
 of
 the
 wealth
 I


create.
 If
 you
 go
 back
 to
 a
 world
 of
 you


know
 70%
 tax
 rates
 that
 we
 had
 in
 this


country
 in
 this
 last
 century
 maybe
 throw


in
 a
 wealth
 tax
 for
 good
 measure.
 you


may
 really
 impact
 that
 zeitgeist
 that
 is


so
 powerful
 in
 terms
 of
 our
 economic


prosperity.


Can
 where
 do
 you
 see
 the
 animal
 spirits


in
 the
 US?
 Because
 a
 lot
 of
 chief


executives
 say
 look
 they're
 they
 like


some
 of
 the
 policies
 but
 there
 also
 a


lot
 of
 policies.
 It
 could
 be
 visas
 or


others
 and
 and
 because
 they're
 uncertain


where
 the
 next
 one
 comes
 from.
 They're


they're
 a
 little
 bit
 reluctant
 to
 spend


right
 now.


Well,
 I
 mean
 let's
 be
 clear
 that
 the


Trump
 administration's
 been
 able
 to
 give


us
 a
 lot
 that
 we
 love
 and
 a
 lot
 that
 we


hate.


like
 they're
 an
 equal
 opportunity
 giver


and


you
 on
 the
 on
 the
 pro
 side
 is
 is
 clearly


the
 push
 for
 deregulation


is
 clearly
 a
 message
 to
 American
 whether


it's
 small
 business
 owners
 or


entrepreneurs
 that
 this
 country
 wants
 to


see
 our
 commercial
 class
 succeed.
 That


that's
 like
 a
 foreign
 language
 to
 the


Biden
 administration.
 I
 mean
 they
 they


had
 no
 connectivity
 with
 American


business.
 The
 Trump
 administration
 is
 is


very
 connected
 in
 a
 very
 different
 and


profound
 way.
 But
 having
 said
 that,
 the


tariff
 policy
 has
 had
 incredibly
 uneven


impacts
 across
 the
 commercial
 landscape.


I
 mean,
 I
 I
 really
 do
 feel
 sorry
 for
 the


small
 and
 medium-sized
 businesses
 that


that
 are
 single
 source
 in
 terms
 of
 their


goods
 from
 from
 Asia
 who
 are
 now
 seeing


tariffs
 that
 are
 at
 levels
 that
 are


unimaginable
 in
 the
 context
 of
 their


business
 model.
 they're
 really
 going
 to


be
 in
 in
 a
 world
 of
 hurt
 over
 the
 months


ahead
 and
 they're
 not
 going
 to
 have
 the


flexibility
 that
 a
 you
 know
 a
 large


conglomerate
 will
 have
 in
 being
 able
 to


rearchitect
 supply
 chains
 and
 navigate


around
 these
 these
 issues.
 So
 that


that's
 an
 area
 that's
 that's
 quite


painful
 to
 watch
 the
 impact
 on
 farmers.


I
 mean
 that
 the
 Chinese
 have
 voted
 very


clearly
 to
 buy
 their
 food
 products
 from


other
 countries
 and
 it's
 really
 hitting


the
 American
 farming
 community
 quite


hard.
 That's
 that's
 painful
 to
 watch


play
 out.


The
 immigration
 policies
 I
 I
 must
 say
 I


I
 scratched
 my
 head
 over,
 we
 we
 as
 a


nation
 are
 facing
 a
 birth
 rate
 that's


that's
 below
 that
 required
 to
 maintain


our
 population.


So
 unless
 the
 United
 States
 actually


wants
 to
 shrink
 in
 size
 over
 the
 next
 50


years,
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 permit


immigration.
 And
 I
 would
 think
 that
 our


policies
 would
 be
 around
 trying
 to


encourage
 the
 best
 and
 brightest
 from


around
 the
 world
 coming
 to
 the
 United


States
 and
 building
 careers
 and
 building


families
 and
 building
 roots
 in
 our


country.
 You
 know,
 I've
 I've
 long
 said


every
 single
 student
 in
 the
 United


States
 with
 a
 STEM
 degree
 should
 get
 a


green
 card
 staple
 that
 diploma
 and
 a


path
 to
 citizenship.
 You
 know,
 roughly


50%
 of
 all
 the
 Silicon
 Valley
 startups


are
 started
 by
 immigrants.
 I
 mean,
 it's


just
 remarkable
 how
 this
 country
 has
 won


in
 the
 global
 war
 for
 talent
 and
 we


should
 continue
 to
 pursue
 that


aggressively.


And
 then
 on
 the
 on
 on
 the
 millions
 of


people
 who
 came
 across
 the
 borders
 in


the
 last
 several
 years,
 you
 know,
 I


applaud
 the
 president
 for
 for


controlling
 our
 borders.


It
 was
 really
 important
 to
 stop
 that


flow
 of
 of
 illegal
 immigration.
 And


unfortunately,
 as
 you
 and
 I
 both
 know,
 a


number
 of
 countries
 in
 South
 and
 Central


America
 didn't
 send
 us
 their
 best
 and


brightest.
 They
 did
 empty
 their
 prisons


and
 send
 people
 to
 the
 United
 States


that
 we
 really
 should
 not
 have
 welcomed


warmly.
 So,
 I
 I
 applaud
 the
 president


for
 shutting
 the
 borders.
 But
 those


who've
 come
 to
 this
 country
 who
 have
 who


have
 placed
 roots
 here,
 who
 are
 working


and
 contributing
 to
 our
 economy,
 we


should
 find
 a
 path
 for
 them
 to
 be
 able


to
 stay
 here
 and
 continue
 to
 contribute.


They're
 important
 in
 agriculture.


They're
 important
 in
 construction.


They're
 important
 in
 the
 in
 the
 leisure


industries.
 They
 do
 a
 lot
 of
 jobs


that'll
 be
 damn
 near
 impossible
 for
 us


to
 fill
 with
 with
 American
 Americanborn


laborers.
 That's
 just
 going
 to
 be
 really


tough.
 And
 and
 what
 gets
 lost
 in
 some
 of


the
 debate
 is
 they're
 they're
 they're


not
 taking
 jobs
 from
 Americans
 by
 and


large.
 They're
 actually
 playing
 critical


roles
 that
 help
 American
 businesses


thrive
 and
 succeed
 that
 allow
 us
 to


employ
 more
 people
 at
 higher
 wages


across
 the
 broader
 economy.
 So,
 I
 think


when
 it
 comes
 to
 immigration
 at
 large,
 I


think
 we've
 we've
 come
 off
 the
 rails
 and


we
 really
 do
 need
 to
 rethink
 our


policies.
