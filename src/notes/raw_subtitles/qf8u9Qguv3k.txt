>> You're
 listening
 to
 Bloomberg
 Business


Week
 with
 Carol
 Masser
 and
 Tim
 Stenc
 on


Bloomberg
 radio.


>> We
 are
 in
 the
 heart
 of
 Hollywood
 live
 at


Bloomberg
 Screen
 Time.
 We're
 speaking
 to


the
 mogul,
 celebrities,
 entrepreneurs,


the
 leaders
 defining
 the
 next
 fav
 phase


of
 pop
 culture.
 One
 of
 those
 leaders


joins
 us
 now,
 Rick
 Caruso.
 He's
 the


billionaire
 real
 estate
 developer,
 the


former
 candidate
 for
 mayor
 of
 LA.
 He's


the
 founder
 and
 executive
 chairman
 of


Caruso.
 It's
 one
 of the
 largest


privately
 held
 real
 estate
 companies
 in


the
 US.
 He's
 a
 philanthropist.
 He's


going
 to
 be
 here
 on
 stage
 a
 little
 bit


later
 for
 a
 conversation
 with
 our
 LA


bureau
 chief,
 John
 Gdson.
 He
 joins
 us


now
 ahead
 of
 that
 conversation.
 Rick,


welcome
 back
 to
 Bloomberg
 Business
 Week.


It's
 been
 a
 bit
 since
 we
 last
 spoke
 to


you.
 We
 got
 to
 start
 with
 what
 LA
 Mayor


Bass
 said
 last
 night
 here.
 She
 spoke


with
 Sarah
 McGregor,
 managing
 editor,


national
 desk
 at
 Bloomberg.
 Here
 she
 is


last
 night
 at
 screen
 time.
 Rick
 Russo,


who
 you
 defeated
 in
 2022
 in
 the
 mayor's


race
 and
 um
 has
 been
 one
 of
 your
 most


vocal
 critics
 around
 the
 fires.
 He


released
 a
 statement
 today
 after
 the


arrest,
 saying
 it
 shows
 the
 disaster
 was


preventable
 and
 in
 his
 words
 calling
 it


a
 failure
 of
 government
 on
 an
 epic


level,
 starting
 with
 Mayor
 Bass.
 He'll


be
 with
 us
 on
 this
 stage
 tomorrow.


>> How
 do
 you
 respond
 to
 that?
 Well,
 the


way
 he
 characterized
 me
 sounded
 like


Trump,
 but
 um
 I
 just
 was
 saddened
 by
 it


honestly
 because
 I
 think
 that
 that


response
 was
 beneath
 him
 and
 um
 we


actually
 he
 was
 in
 my
 office
 a
 couple
 of


weeks
 ago.
 We're
 working
 on
 something.


We're
 working
 on
 a
 couple
 of
 things


together.
 Uh
 but
 I
 think
 that
 he
 is
 sad


and
 bitter
 and
 um
 and
 I
 think
 that
 it
 is


really
 sad
 to
 exploit.
 You
 guys
 laughing


about
 that?
 He
 I
 I
 feel
 like
 it's


exploiting
 tragedy.
 It's
 exploiting


grief.


>> Well,
 there
 you
 have
 it.
 That
 was
 LA


Mayor
 Karen
 Bass
 last
 night
 here
 at


Bloomberg
 screen
 time.
 Rick
 Caruso
 joins


us
 now.
 Rick,
 your
 turn
 to
 respond
 to


criticism
 of
 your
 criticism
 from
 the
 LA


Mayor.
 What
 do
 you
 make
 of
 it?
 Listen,
 I


I
 I
 I
 I
 said
 what
 I
 think
 so
 many
 people


around
 Los
 Angeles,
 throughout
 LA,
 and


>> this
 whole
 region
 uh
 feel
 especially


after
 reading
 the
 afteraction
 report.
 I


don't
 know
 if
 any
 of
 you
 have
 read
 it,


but
 it's
 very
 clear
 that
 this
 fire
 was


preventable.
 And
 um
 it's
 very
 clear
 that


they
 didn't
 have
 a
 plan
 uh
 to
 do


anything
 about
 it
 because
 if
 she
 had
 a


plan,
 she
 would
 have
 responded
 in
 that


uh
 question
 by
 saying
 this
 is
 the
 plan
 I


had
 and
 you
 know
 we
 did
 our
 best
 to


implement
 it.
 Um,
 but
 I,
 you
 know,
 going


forward,
 we've
 got
 to
 solve
 these


problems
 because
 when
 you
 read
 that


afteraction
 report,
 glaring
 failures,


uh,
 systematic
 failures
 of
 our
 system,


our
 city
 are
 outlined
 in
 there.
 And,
 um,


there's
 solutions
 to
 all
 of
 them.
 And,


uh,
 you
 know,
 the
 focus
 has
 got
 to
 be


making
 sure
 this
 kind
 of
 thing
 doesn't


happen
 again.
 But,
 uh,
 I'm
 not
 going
 to


dwell
 on
 on,
 uh,
 the
 fact
 that
 the
 city


failed
 because,
 um,
 boy,
 it's
 in
 black


and
 white
 now
 and
 and
 very
 clear.


>> Well,
 Rick,
 just
 to
 follow,
 Mayor
 Bass


said
 that
 you
 guys
 were
 together
 just


recently
 working
 together
 on
 things.
 So,


I'm
 just
 curious,
 um,
 you
 know,


conversations
 sometimes
 are
 things
 we


hear
 in
 public
 versus
 things
 we
 hear


behind
 the
 scenes.
 I
 mean,
 one
 of
 the


things
 we
 got
 from
 Mayor
 Bass
 is
 talking


about
 members
 of
 the
 Trump


administration
 um
 that
 certainly
 LA,


California
 in
 general
 have
 have
 clashed


with,
 but
 that
 she
 talks
 to
 them
 on
 a


regular
 basis,
 people
 she
 knew
 from
 her


time,
 uh
 certainly
 in
 DC.
 So,
 I'm
 just


curious,
 what
 are
 the
 conversations
 or


what
 can
 you
 share
 with
 us
 about
 maybe


the
 constructive
 conversations
 you're


having
 with
 Mayor
 Bass
 behind
 the
 scenes


about
 what
 happened,
 what
 can
 be
 done


better
 going
 forward?


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 here's
 something
 that's


really
 important
 that
 she
 said.
 Um,
 in


the
 next
 question,


she
 said
 politics
 is
 performative.


Uh,
 and
 you
 know,
 they
 would
 go
 out,
 uh,


beat
 each
 other
 up
 and
 then
 go
 have


dinner.
 Something
 like
 that
 that
 she


talked
 about.
 I
 I
 don't
 think
 politics


is
 performative.
 I
 think
 what
 we
 learned


from
 this
 fire
 is
 that
 leadership


matters.
 that
 these
 positions
 when


you're
 the
 head
 of
 a
 city,
 the
 head
 of
 a


state,
 uh,
 in
 in
 any
 kind
 of
 very


important
 elected
 office,
 you
 actually


impact
 lives
 and
 it's
 not
 about
 putting


on
 a
 show.
 It's
 actually
 about
 making
 a


difference
 in
 people's
 lives
 every
 day.


So,
 I
 was
 really
 stunned
 uh
 by
 her


statement
 and
 listen,
 I
 have
 met
 with


her.
 um
 my
 job
 through
 steadfast.
 We
 are


working
 very
 hard
 uh
 with
 the
 city,
 with


the
 county,
 with
 the
 state
 to
 get
 people


back
 in
 their
 homes
 quickly
 and
 safely,


get
 these
 neighborhoods
 rebuilt.
 And
 so


we
 have
 a
 number
 of
 initiatives
 that
 we


have
 delivered
 to
 the
 city
 to
 help
 them


do
 their
 job
 better
 and
 quicker.
 and
 I


have
 met
 with
 her
 and
 uh
 I
 will
 work


with
 anybody
 to
 help
 rebuild
 Altadena,


Malibu
 and
 the
 Palisades
 and
 do
 that


with
 great
 uh
 honesty,
 great
 dedication


because
 that
 is
 the
 mission
 right
 now
 is


to
 get
 people's
 lives
 rebuilt
 that
 have


been
 shattered
 and
 uh
 but
 it's
 not


performative.
 It's
 real
 and
 uh
 it's
 also


real
 in
 my
 criticism
 uh
 because
 that


criticism
 is
 factually
 true
 and
 um
 I


think
 what
 we
 need
 to
 be
 doing
 is


spending
 a
 lot
 of
 time
 like
 I
 just
 said


going
 through
 that
 afteraction
 report


asking
 some
 really
 tough
 questions.
 How


could
 this
 have
 happened
 and
 what
 are


the
 solutions
 so
 it
 never
 happens
 again?


Whether
 it's
 a
 fire
 or
 an
 earthquake
 or


a
 flood
 or
 whatever
 may
 be,
 it
 clearly


points
 out
 that
 there
 wasn't
 a
 plan
 and


the
 system
 failed
 and
 a
 community
 burnt


down
 and
 11
 people
 died.
 Let's
 not


forget
 about
 that.
 So,
 you
 know,
 are


there
 tens
 and
 tens
 of
 thousands
 of


people
 who
 are
 sad
 and
 angry?
 There
 sure


are.
 And
 yesterday
 after
 that


announcement
 came
 out,
 it
 re-triggered
 a


lot
 of
 emotions
 in
 a
 lot
 of
 people.
 and


I
 stand
 with
 them.


>> I
 understand
 it
 because
 of
 the
 losses


that
 we
 incurred
 that
 my
 daughter
 lost


her
 house,
 my
 son
 lost
 his
 house
 and
 um


that
 emotion
 is
 a
 true
 raw
 emotion.
 It's


important
 to
 recognize
 and
 it's
 frankly


important
 to
 sympathize
 and
 be


compassionate
 about
 because
 people
 are


really
 hurting.
 I'm
 fortunate
 we
 have
 a


number
 of
 options,
 but
 the
 far
 majority


of
 the
 people
 that
 lost
 their
 homes
 or


lost
 their
 jobs,
 they
 don't
 have
 options


and
 they
 need
 help
 and
 help
 quickly.
 And


that's
 what
 we're
 doing
 at
 Steadfast
 is


making
 a
 real
 difference
 in
 people's


lives.


>> And
 I'm
 proud
 of
 that.


>> Well,


Rick,
 last
 time
 you
 were
 on
 with
 us,
 uh


it
 was
 just
 over
 a
 month
 ago,
 you
 said


you
 were
 still
 deciding
 whether
 or
 not


you
 were
 going
 to
 run
 for
 mayor
 or
 for


governor.
 Have
 you
 made
 up
 your
 mind


yet?


>> I
 don't
 like
 this
 guy.
 No,
 but
 I'm


working
 hard
 at
 it.
 I've
 been
 spending
 a


lot
 of
 time
 going
 across
 the
 state.
 I


was
 in
 San
 Francisco
 last
 night
 at
 a


great
 dinner
 with
 a
 bunch
 of
 tech
 uh


executives
 and
 entrepreneurs
 and
 I
 was


in
 Bakersfield
 and
 I've
 been
 all
 over


the
 place.
 So,
 I'm
 I'm
 I'm
 doing
 what
 I


want
 to
 do,
 meaning
 I'm
 on
 this
 tour
 of


the
 state
 and
 the
 city.
 I'm
 meeting


people.
 I'm
 listening
 to
 people.
 I'm


understanding
 what
 the
 issues
 are.


developing


policies
 where
 we
 can
 make
 a
 big


difference
 whether
 it's
 the
 city
 or
 the


state
 and
 at
 the
 right
 time
 I'll
 make
 my


decision
 and
 I'll
 announce
 it
 and
 you


guys
 will
 be
 one
 of
 the
 first
 to
 know


he's
 got
 a
 couple
 movies
 coming.


>> Thank
 you.


>> We
 are
 talking
 with
 Rick
 Caruso,
 founder


and
 executive
 chair
 of
 Caruso.
 Wait,


having
 said
 that,
 you
 know,
 I'm
 not


going
 to
 let
 this
 go
 completely.
 Um,
 you


said
 you're
 in
 San
 Francisco
 talking
 to


tech
 executives.
 You're
 in
 Bakersfield.


Um,
 you're
 all
 you're
 all
 over
 the


place.
 You're
 in
 LA
 right
 now.
 Um,
 that


sounds
 to
 me
 like
 a
 broader
 scope.
 So,


are
 you
 leaning
 maybe
 towards
 being


governor


versus
 mayor?
 I'm
 just,
 you
 know,
 I'm


just
 curious.
 Are
 you
 leaning
 a
 little


bit?


>> That
 is
 a
 great
 followup.
 I
 love
 you.


But,
 uh,
 I
 am
 keeping
 both
 options
 very


open.
 I
 have
 two
 different
 teams.
 I
 have


two
 different
 teams
 that
 are
 working
 on


both
 and
 both
 are
 really
 important


positions
 and
 I
 want
 to
 do
 my
 best
 to


end
 up
 in
 a
 position
 where
 I
 could
 do


the
 greatest
 good
 uh
 to
 make
 a


difference
 in
 people's
 lives
 and
 that


that
 is
 my
 motivation.
 It's
 not
 a
 career


move
 for
 me.
 Um,
 it's
 really
 to
 give


back
 like
 I've
 done
 before,
 working
 with


three
 different
 mayors.
 And
 you
 know,


your
 uh
 your
 uh
 LA
 uh
 lead
 guy,
 John,


who
 just
 wrote
 the
 article
 about
 me,
 you


know,
 there
 was
 a
 great
 statement
 in


there
 that
 three
 mayors
 turned
 to
 me
 to


help
 with
 critical
 problems
 that
 needed


to
 be
 fixed
 at
 the
 time.
 And


>> and
 I
 was
 honored
 to
 be
 able
 to
 do
 that.


So,
 to
 me,
 that's
 what
 public
 service
 is


all
 about
 is
 having
 the
 trust
 of
 people


and
 really
 making
 a
 difference
 in


people's
 lives.
 And
 uh


I'll
 let
 you
 know
 where
 I
 end
 up
 when
 I


make
 a
 decision.


>> Well,
 John
 Gdson
 is
 going to
 be
 speaking


with
 you
 on
 stage
 here
 at
 Screen
 Time


just
 a
 little
 later.
 If
 you
 have
 not
 yet


seen
 that
 story
 in
 Bloomberg
 Business


Week,
 check
 it
 out
 at
 bloomberg.com
 and


on
 the
 Bloomberg
 terminal
 as
 well.
 I


want
 to
 talk
 a
 little
 bit
 about


Hollywood
 and
 and
 what
 you
 think
 the
 fix


is
 here.
 As
 we
 know,
 the
 film
 industry


has
 been
 under
 tremendous
 pressure.
 Uh


COVID,
 the
 fires,
 technological


disruption.
 What
 is
 the
 right
 fix?


We've
 got
 to
 be
 competitive
 with


>> Atlanta.
 We
 got
 to
 be
 competitive
 with


New
 Jersey.
 We've
 got
 to
 save
 the
 film


industry.


>> You
 know,
 people
 that
 are
 below
 the
 line


are
 just
 getting
 destroyed.
 You
 know,


the
 florists,
 the
 drivers.
 Um,
 all
 of


the
 people
 that
 support
 the


entertainment
 industry.


There's
 an
 arrogance,
 I
 think,
 in
 our


leadership
 that
 the
 entertainment


industry
 was
 born
 here,
 it's
 going
 to


stay
 here.
 That's
 just
 not
 dealing
 with


reality.
 And
 this
 is
 where
 I
 think


leadership
 and
 executive
 skills
 really


matter.
 Identify
 a
 problem
 and
 solve
 it.


If
 we're
 the
 fourth
 largest
 economy
 as
 a


state
 in
 the
 world,
 let's
 act
 like
 it.


And
 let's
 give
 the
 resources
 to
 keep
 the


entertainment
 industry
 in
 California
 and


in
 Los
 Angeles.
 And
 we
 we've
 got
 to
 be


competitive
 and
 not
 allow
 and
 force


people
 quite
 frankly
 to
 go
 to
 London.


Like
 I
 said,
 donor
 of
 New
 Jersey.
 I


mean,
 the
 mayor
 of
 New
 Jersey,
 you
 know,


Phil
 did
 a
 hell
 of
 a
 job
 getting


Netflix,
 gave
 a
 lot
 of
 money
 to
 build
 a


studio
 there,
 and
 that's
 a
 sucking
 sound


of
 jobs
 coming
 out
 of
 California.
 So,
 I


would
 reverse
 that
 course
 immediately
 so


that
 we're
 competitive
 and
 keep
 people


in
 our
 state.


>> 20
 seconds
 very
 quickly.
 Do
 you
 think
 a


tariff
 on
 movies
 made
 outside
 the
 United


States
 makes
 sense?
 And
 forgive
 me


really
 quickly.


>> No,
 no.
 Let's
 Let's
 just
 be
 competitive


and
 let's
 not
 be
 punitive,
 okay?


>> And
 if
 we
 can't
 win
 the
 industry
 by


being
 competitive,
 shame
 on
 us.
 I
 think


we
 can.


>> All right,
 Rick.
 You
 know
 where
 to
 find


us
 when
 you're
 ready
 to
 announce.
