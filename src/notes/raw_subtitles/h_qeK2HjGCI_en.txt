Bloomberg
 Tech
 is
 live
 from
 coast
 to


coast
 with
 Caroline
 Hyde
 in
 New
 York
 and


Ed
 Lllo
 in
 San
 Francisco.


Welcome
 to
 a
 special
 edition
 of


Bloomberg
 Tech
 live
 from
 Bloomberg


Screen
 Time
 in
 Los
 Angeles.
 Coming
 up


this
 hour,
 we're
 going
 to
 bring
 you


conversations
 with
 some
 of
 the
 biggest


names
 in
 the
 entertainment
 industry.


We'll
 be
 speaking
 with
 top
 celebrities,


Ed,
 with
 entrepreneurs
 with
 leaders


across
 this
 very
 much
 changing
 media


landscape.
 And
 we
 first
 go
 to
 the
 talk


of
 the
 town
 here
 at
 Screen
 Time.
 Of


course,
 it
 was
 Jimmy
 Kimmel.
 The
 late


night
 show
 host
 sat
 down
 with


Bloomberg's
 Luca
 Shaw
 and
 explained
 how


he
 thinks
 his
 comments
 about
 the


conservative
 activist
 Charlie
 Kirk
 were


mischaracterized
 by
 the
 political
 right.


Take
 a
 listen.


I
 didn't
 think
 there
 was
 a
 big
 problem.


I,
 you
 know,
 I
 just
 saw
 it
 as
 distortion


on
 the
 part
 of
 uh
 some
 of
 the
 right-wing


media
 networks
 and
 I
 was
 I
 aimed
 to


correct
 it.


I
 have
 problems
 like
 all
 the
 time
 and


it's
 kind
 of
 funny
 because
 sometimes


you
 think
 oh
 this
 is
 not
 a
 problem
 and


then
 it
 turns
 into
 a
 big
 problem
 and


then
 sometimes
 it
 goes
 the
 other
 way


where
 you
 think
 like
 uh
 oh
 this
 is
 going


to
 be
 a
 problem
 and
 nobody
 really


notices


and
 so
 at
 what
 point
 did
 you
 realize


this
 was
 a
 problem?


I
 think
 when
 um
 when
 they
 pulled
 the


show
 off
 the
 air


like
 well
 that's
 unusual.


Yeah.
 And
 what
 were
 the
 conversations


with
 Dana
 and
 Bob
 that
 led
 to
 that?


Um,
 I
 I
 hate
 to
 disappoint
 you,
 but
 they


were
 really
 good
 conversations.


Yeah,
 I'm
 not
 asking
 you
 to
 anyone.


I
 mean,
 like
 really
 good
 conversations.


They
 are
 I
 mean,
 these
 are
 people
 that
 I


I've
 known
 for
 a
 long
 time
 and
 who
 I


like
 very
 much
 and
 who
 were,
 you
 know,


who
 wanted
 we
 all
 wanted
 this
 to
 work


out
 best.
 And
 I
 will
 tell
 you
 like
 I


mean,
 first
 of
 all,
 I
 ruined
 Dana's


weekend.
 It
 was
 just
 non-stop
 phone


calls
 all
 weekend.
 But
 I
 don't
 think


what
 I
 don't
 think
 the
 result,
 which
 I


think
 turned
 out
 to
 be
 very
 positive,


um,
 would
 have
 been
 as
 positive
 if
 I


hadn't
 talked
 to
 Dana
 as
 much
 as
 I
 did


because
 it
 helped
 me
 think
 everything


through
 and
 it
 helped
 me
 just
 kind
 of


understand
 where
 everyone
 was
 coming


from.
 I
 can
 sometimes
 be
 reactionary.
 I


can
 sometimes
 be
 aggressive
 and
 um
 I
 can


sometimes
 be
 unpleasant
 and
 I
 think
 that


it
 it
 helped
 me
 just
 really
 having
 those


days
 to
 think
 about
 it
 was
 helpful.


Okay,
 I
 have
 a
 I
 have
 a
 dumb
 question


about
 this
 as
 someone
 who
 was
 kind
 of


reporting
 on
 it
 in
 real
 time
 trying
 to


figure
 out
 what's
 happening.
 So
 the
 show


goes
 off
 the
 air,
 you
 have
 all
 these


conversations
 and
 when
 you
 made
 or
 when


you
 all
 made
 a
 decision
 to
 put
 the
 show


back
 on
 the
 air
 as
 my
 understanding
 at


the
 time
 was
 it
 still
 wasn't
 exactly


clear
 what
 you
 were
 going
 to
 say.
 They


still
 hadn't
 resolved
 the
 issues
 with


the
 affiliates.
 So
 what
 are
 the
 what
 do


you
 resolve
 in
 those
 conversations
 to
 to


know
 you're
 going
 back
 if
 you
 haven't


figured
 out
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 things
 that


come
 out
 of
 it?
 I
 think
 just
 the
 spirit


of
 what
 I'm
 going
 to
 say
 rather
 than


specifically
 what
 I
 was
 going
 to
 say.


And
 I
 think
 that's
 something
 that
 we
 all


agreed
 on.
 And
 I
 think
 that
 um
 um


ultimately


I
 wanted
 to
 kind
 of
 cover
 every
 base
 if


I
 could.
 And
 sometimes
 he
 can
 do
 that


and
 sometimes
 he
 can't
 do
 that.
 And
 it


was
 something
 really
 that
 had
 to
 come


from
 inside
 me.
 It
 had
 to
 be
 truthful


and
 I
 had
 to
 lay
 it
 all
 out
 there
 and


just
 be
 honest
 about
 what
 I
 was
 feeling


and
 what
 I'd
 experienced.
 And
 I
 think
 I


did.
 And
 I
 think
 that
 um
 it
 probably


went
 about
 as
 well
 as
 it
 could
 go.
 I


knew
 that
 it
 wasn't
 going
 to
 be
 perfect


and
 there
 were
 always
 going
 to
 be
 pe


people
 that
 didn't
 like
 it
 and
 didn't


accept
 it.
 But
 um
 the
 the
 important


thing
 to
 me
 was
 that
 I
 was
 able
 to


explain


what
 I
 was
 saying,
 what
 I
 was
 trying
 to


say


because
 you
 felt
 like
 your
 initial


comments
 had
 been
 mischaracterized.


I
 didn't
 feel
 like
 it
 was


it
 was
 intentionally
 and
 I
 think


maliciously
 mischaracterized.
 Yes.


There
 was
 Jimmy
 Kimmel
 there
 with


Bloomberg
 screen
 time
 host
 Lucas
 Shaw


who
 joins
 us
 now
 this
 morning.
 The
 story


around
 Jimmy
 Kimmel
 is
 one
 of
 the
 most


read
 on
 the
 Bloomberg
 terminal
 and
 the


website
 and
 it's
 being
 shared
 across
 the


industry.
 I
 think
 that's
 not
 that


surprising,
 right,
 Lucas?
 Um
 the


headline
 is
 really
 straightforward.
 He


thought
 that
 the
 show
 was
 done
 and
 in


the
 course
 of
 what
 we
 just
 heard,
 he


explained
 everything
 that
 happened
 in


the
 days
 that
 followed
 being
 taken
 off


air,
 confirming
 quite
 a
 lot
 of
 your


reporting.
 I
 just
 invite
 you
 to
 take
 it


from
 there
 and
 and and
 the
 main


takeaways
 from
 you
 from
 the


conversation.
 Well,
 it's
 I
 guess
 I
 was
 a


little
 surprised
 on
 retrospect
 not


shocked
 by
 how
 ausive
 his
 praise
 was
 for


Disney
 just
 because
 in
 the
 moment
 my


sense
 from
 people
 around
 him
 was
 that
 he


was
 pretty
 pissed
 off
 at
 them.
 Right?


They
 had
 taken
 him
 off
 the
 air.
 You


heard
 him
 say,
 "I
 didn't
 think
 I
 did


anything
 that
 wrong."
 My
 comments
 got


sort
 of
 weaponized
 by
 right-wing
 media.


And
 yet
 he
 had
 nothing
 but
 positive


things
 to
 say
 about
 CEO
 Bob
 Iger,
 about


entertainment
 co-chair
 Dana
 Walden.
 he


sort
 of
 somewhat
 endorsed
 Dana
 Walden
 to


succeed
 Bob
 Iger.
 Um,
 which
 you
 know
 I


don't
 know
 that
 he
 he
 or
 Dana
 were


expecting
 to
 happen
 last
 night.
 Um,
 but


he
 this
 this
 turned
 from
 what
 could
 have


been
 a
 really
 sad
 ugly
 episode
 in
 his


career
 to
 something
 that
 has
 made
 him


something
 of
 a
 hero.
 Um,
 and
 so
 I
 you


know
 this
 was
 I
 guess
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a


victory
 lap
 for
 him.


A
 victory
 lap
 which
 then
 you
 get
 to
 the


nitty-gritty
 of
 numbers
 cuz
 that's
 what


Bloomberg
 does.
 And
 you're
 trying
 to


present
 to
 him
 that
 ultimately,
 yes,
 he


had
 record
 bump
 in
 terms
 of
 numbers,
 but


the
 numbers
 haven't
 been
 great
 for
 late


night
 television,
 full
 stop.
 How
 did
 he


navigate
 what
 he
 thinks
 is
 the
 revenue,


positive
 or
 negatives
 right
 now
 for
 him?


Well,
 twofold.
 One,
 he
 was
 like,
 look,


there
 was
 a
 lot
 of
 reporting
 about
 how


much
 his
 peer
 Steven
 Cobear's
 show
 was


losing.
 He
 thinks
 that
 that's
 wrong.
 He


knows
 how
 much
 money
 these
 shows
 cost
 to


make.
 He
 knows
 generally
 how
 much
 they


bring
 in.
 I
 think
 he
 said
 last
 night
 it


costs
 about
 $120
 million
 to
 do
 one
 of


these
 shows.
 Um,
 but
 he
 also
 said,


"Look,
 if
 they
 were
 if
 they
 were
 losing


money,
 they'd
 go
 off
 the
 air.
 Steven


Coar
 show
 is
 going
 off
 the
 air.
 We
 don't


know
 the
 future
 of
 Kimmel
 show.
 His


contract
 is
 up
 next
 year."
 I
 think
 most


people
 assume
 that
 he'll
 be
 around
 for
 a


little
 bit
 longer.
 They
 don't
 want
 to
 at


at
 a
 minimum,
 they're
 not
 going
 to
 fire


him
 in
 the
 same
 way
 that
 CBS
 did
 Colar.


Uh,
 but
 obviously
 the
 the
 big
 challenge


for
 late
 night
 is
 that
 there's
 just
 so


much
 more
 consumption
 happening
 online


and
 you
 can't
 monetize
 it
 in
 the
 same


way.
 I
 found
 that
 so
 interesting
 like


his
 insight
 into
 how
 the
 industry
 works,


budgets,
 talent
 costs,
 losses
 or
 not


losses.
 Um,
 Lucas,
 that's
 kind
 of
 the


point
 of
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 day.
 We
 have


many
 very
 high-profile
 speakers
 across


entertainment
 and
 media
 generally,
 but


just
 for
 you,
 what
 is
 your
 next
 big


focus
 after
 last
 night?
 My
 first


interview
 is
 David
 Ellison
 who
 I
 think


is
 other
 than
 Kimmel
 probably
 the


biggest
 interview
 of
 of
 the
 uh
 of
 the


conference
 just
 because
 he
 hasn't
 done
 a


big
 interview
 since
 taking
 over


Paramount
 Sky
 Dance.
 Um
 he's
 seems
 to
 be


in
 the
 news
 every
 other
 day.
 He
 bought


Barry
 Weiss's
 the
 free
 press.
 He
 may
 or


may
 not
 be
 trying
 to
 buy
 Warner
 Brothers


Discovery.
 We'll
 talk
 about
 both
 those


things
 with
 him.


And
 you've
 got
 Warner
 Brothers
 Discovery


at
 the
 table
 as
 well.
 Well,
 that's
 going


to
 be
 fascinating
 considering
 the


conversation
 you
 have
 with
 Greg
 Peters,


the
 co
 of
 Netflix,
 about
 how
 ultimately


he's
 not
 after
 M&A
 WBD.
 That's
 going to


be
 a
 fascinating
 conversation.


Yeah,
 the
 the
 co-chairs
 of
 their
 movie


studio,
 I'm
 sure
 that
 they
 will
 avoid


talking
 about
 any
 big
 corporate
 matters


and
 kind
 of
 defer
 that
 to
 their


leadership.
 But
 look,
 they
 they
 will
 be


great
 to
 talk
 about
 the
 movie
 business


with.
 They
 have
 been
 on
 a
 real
 hot


streak
 with
 Sinners,
 uh,
 with
 Minecraft,


many
 other
 hits
 over
 the
 summer,


weapons,
 and
 then
 the
 new
 PTA
 movie,


which
 probably
 isn't
 a
 commercial
 hit,


but
 looks
 like
 an
 Oscar
 front
 runner.


All right,
 Bloomberg's
 Lucas
 Shaw,
 who's


leading
 our
 coverage
 here
 at
 Bloomberg


Screen
 Time
 in
 Los
 Angeles.
 Thank
 you


very
 much.
 But
 actually
 here
 on


Bloomberg
 Tech,
 Carol,


so
 much
 more
 coming
 up.
 We're
 going
 to


be
 speaking
 with
 Katherine
 Mayer,
 NPR


CEO.
 Look,
 public
 media
 faces
 threats,


particularly
 under
 the
 Trump


administration
 right
 now.
 What
 is
 the


future
 of
 funding?
 Stick
 with
 us.
 This


is
 bringing
 back
 tack.


See,
 that's
 what
 happens
 when
 people
 get


activated.
 People
 got
 activated
 and
 uh


demanded
 that
 Jimmy
 Kimmel
 come
 back
 on


the
 air.
 And
 I
 think
 that
 that
 was
 a


great
 victory.
 So
 sometimes,
 you
 know,


when
 you're
 struggling
 and
 you're
 going


through
 all
 these
 changes
 because
 of
 the


madness
 in
 DC,
 it's
 important
 to
 realize


when
 you
 do
 win,
 when
 you
 have
 a


victory.
 And
 I
 think
 Jimmy
 Kimmel
 being


back
 on
 the
 air
 was
 a
 victory
 for
 all
 of


us.


Los
 Angeles
 mayor
 there,
 Karen
 Bass,


reacting
 to
 Jimmy
 Kimmel's
 return,
 of


course,
 to
 the
 air
 after
 a
 brief


suspension
 of
 what
 he
 described
 as
 a


mischaracterization


of
 his
 comments
 about
 Charlie
 Kirk.


Meanwhile,
 look,
 Ed,
 public
 broadcasting


as
 a
 whole
 is
 facing
 new
 challenges.


Outlets
 PBS,
 NPR,
 for
 example,
 seeing


their
 share
 in
 federal
 funding
 cut
 by


Congress
 over
 the
 summer.
 It
 raises


questions
 about
 the
 future,
 the


viability.
 At
 the
 center
 of
 the
 debate


is
 NPR
 CEO
 Katherine
 May,
 who
 we're


pleased
 to
 say
 not
 only
 has
 just
 been
 is


joining
 us,
 having
 already
 been
 called


before
 the
 oversight
 committee
 earlier


this
 year.
 Katherine,
 how
 how
 do
 you


navigate
 this
 time?
 How
 are
 you
 seeing


the
 ability
 for
 NPR
 to
 thrive
 and
 drive


forward?
 Well,
 there's
 certainly
 no
 road


map
 for
 this
 moment
 in
 time.
 I
 think


this
 represents
 a
 step
 change
 for
 all


public
 broadcasting.
 It's
 not
 just
 here


in
 the
 United
 States.
 We
 recognize
 that


public
 broadcasters
 around
 the
 world
 are


under
 incre
 increasing
 scrutiny
 and


pressure.
 Um,
 the
 good
 news
 for
 us
 is


that
 we
 have
 a
 viable
 model
 because


we've
 built
 audiences
 over
 the
 50
 years


we've
 been
 in
 existence.
 We
 have
 46


million
 listeners
 a
 week.
 And
 so,
 as
 we


look
 to
 the
 future,
 we're
 looking
 at,


all
 right,
 this
 is
 a
 change.
 It
 doesn't


change
 our
 public
 service
 mandate.
 It


doesn't
 change
 our
 mission
 and
 our


obligation
 to
 the
 American
 public.
 It


just
 probably
 will
 change
 how
 we
 have
 to


do
 our
 work.


When
 you
 say
 how
 you
 do
 your
 work,
 does


it
 ultimately
 mean
 that
 you
 have
 to


think
 about
 the
 resources
 that
 you
 put


to
 work
 there?
 Can
 you
 be
 as
 expansive


in
 the
 coverage
 that
 you
 have
 been
 for


so
 many
 years?


It's
 a
 good
 question
 and
 it's
 something


we're
 trying
 to
 figure
 out.
 NPR
 received


traditionally
 about
 1%
 of
 our
 budget


directly
 from
 the
 federal
 government,


but
 we
 have
 just
 1%.
 But
 we
 have
 a


network
 of
 around
 250
 member
 stations


which
 received
 as
 much
 as
 70%
 in
 rural


parts
 of
 the
 country.
 And
 so
 we're


waiting
 to
 see
 what
 some
 of
 the
 fallout


will
 be
 for
 those
 stations.
 We
 have


projections.
 We're
 concerned
 about
 this


and
 we're
 looking
 at
 how
 we
 can
 buttress


some
 of
 their
 work
 by
 cutting
 fees
 to


them
 and
 thinking
 about
 how
 to
 make,
 you


know,
 a
 dollar
 stretch
 a
 little
 bit


further
 to
 continue
 to
 serve
 local


communities.


Catherine,
 I
 think
 there
 would
 be
 a
 lot


of
 value
 in
 you
 explaining
 the
 business


model.


It
 is
 confusing.
 Yes.
 Well,
 well,
 the


reason
 I
 ask
 actually
 is
 in
 in


preparation
 for
 today,
 I
 suddenly


stopped
 and
 looked
 at
 NPR's
 following
 on


social
 platforms,
 for
 example.
 It's


very,
 very
 big.


Um,
 you
 know,
 how
 do
 I
 consume
 some
 NPR


content
 like
 on
 YouTube
 for
 example,
 but


that
 isn't
 necessarily
 um
 a
 big
 big


income
 generator
 for
 you?
 Is
 that
 is


that
 right?


Right.
 So,
 I
 think
 people
 think
 of
 us
 as


radio
 because
 that's
 our
 origin.
 But
 in


fact,
 50%
 of
 our
 listening
 comes
 from


digital
 platforms.
 It
 comes
 through


podcasts.
 It
 comes
 through
 YouTube.
 It


actually
 comes
 through
 reading
 online


and
 you
 can
 see
 in
 our
 numbers
 that
 our


demographics
 are
 actually
 very
 well


distributed.
 We've
 been
 accused
 of
 being


too
 liberal.
 But
 what
 I
 can
 tell
 you
 is


that
 when
 we
 look
 at
 the
 audience
 data


as
 to
 who
 comes
 to
 us,
 it's
 actually
 a


very
 represent
 representative


distribution
 of
 the
 American
 public.
 So


50%
 of
 what
 we're
 doing
 is
 for
 digital


audiences
 and
 50%
 of
 what
 we're
 doing
 is


for
 radio
 audiences.
 On
 the
 radio
 side,


we
 have
 these
 roughly
 250
 members
 across


the
 country.
 They
 serve
 99.7%
 of
 the


American
 public.
 So,
 in
 some
 ways,
 we


are
 one
 of
 the
 largest
 national


networks,
 and
 we
 have
 3,000
 local


journalists
 around
 the
 country
 who
 then


serve
 back
 into
 the
 network
 with
 stories


that
 they're
 filing
 for
 their
 local


communities
 and
 for
 their
 states.


How
 does
 it
 make
 them
 feel
 when
 they're


deemed
 to
 be
 too
 liberal?
 And
 how


not
 good.
 Really
 not
 good.
 I
 mean,
 we


have
 reporters
 who
 are
 covering
 tribal


areas
 who
 are
 primarily
 focused
 on
 the


issues
 of
 Native
 American
 communities.


We
 have
 reporters
 in
 rural
 Alaska
 who


are
 focusing
 on
 the
 issues
 that
 their


communities
 face.
 Some
 of
 the
 issues


around
 for
 example
 fishing
 and
 access
 to


um
 access
 to
 the
 sorry
 the
 national


wildlife
 preserve
 and
 what
 does
 that


mean
 for
 economic
 opportunity
 for


Alaskans.
 They're
 having
 nuanced


conversations
 that
 represent
 the
 full


spectrum
 of
 the
 American
 debate
 on
 any


of
 these
 issues.
 And
 so
 to
 be
 called


liberal
 or
 to
 be
 demeaned
 in
 that
 way
 is


really
 a
 misrepresentation
 of
 the
 work


that
 they
 do.
 Nuance
 is
 a
 great
 word.


You
 need
 more
 of
 it.


Well,
 we
 we
 try
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 we're


hearing
 from
 all
 sides
 of
 the
 story
 in


every
 story.
 And
 that
 means
 that
 we
 are


representing,
 sure,
 of
 course,


communities
 in
 California
 that
 perhaps


have
 one
 point
 of
 view,
 but
 also


communities
 in
 Indiana
 that
 have
 a


different
 point
 of
 view.


Well,
 you
 know,
 we
 talked
 about
 this
 as


a
 team
 and
 our
 one
 of
 our
 producers,
 Zoe


Thomas,
 brought
 up
 the
 idea
 that
 there


is
 like
 the
 NPR
 strategy
 and
 then


there's
 what
 the
 local
 stations
 are


doing.
 um
 on
 the
 politics
 side
 of


things,
 you
 know,
 how
 how
 are
 the
 local


stations
 reacting?
 For
 example,
 if
 a
 lot


of
 their
 listener
 base
 did
 vote
 for


President
 Trump,
 you
 know,
 with
 what's


going
 on,
 how
 are
 you
 factoring
 that
 in?


But
 also
 like
 the
 in
 the
 business
 model,


um
 do
 you
 end
 up
 sort
 of
 also
 competing


at
 the
 NPR
 level
 with
 the
 local
 station


level
 because
 you're
 trying
 to
 pursue


different
 subscribers,
 things
 like
 that?


Well,
 those
 are
 sort
 of
 two
 very


different
 questions.
 I
 mean,
 we
 aim
 to


serve
 the
 entire
 spectrum
 of
 American


conversation,
 right?
 So,
 we
 had
 the


White
 House
 press
 secretary
 on
 just
 last


week
 speaking
 directly
 to
 the
 American


public
 about
 the
 administration's


thinking
 on
 the
 current
 government


shutdown.
 We
 invite
 members
 of
 both


parties
 on
 all
 the
 time.
 We
 in
 invite


independent
 voices
 on
 all
 the
 time.
 This


is
 important
 to
 us,
 but
 it's
 not
 just


our
 politics
 coverage.
 It's
 also


coverage
 of
 American
 life,
 all
 of
 the


cultural
 aspects
 that
 make
 up
 our


differences
 as
 well.
 And
 that
 is
 one
 of


the
 flexibilities
 of
 local
 reporting
 is


it
 means
 that
 our
 station
 in
 Utah
 can


run
 stories
 about
 the
 local
 reaction
 to


the
 Charlie
 Kirk
 assassination
 as
 well


as
 contributing
 to
 our
 national
 coverage


so
 that
 Americans
 all
 across
 the
 country


can
 hear
 from
 those
 perspectives.


What
 is
 the
 feedback
 from
 your
 American


from
 from
 the
 American
 listeners
 about


everything
 that's
 happened?


Well,
 I
 I
 mean
 on
 the
 news
 of
 course
 I


think
 what
 you
 hear
 very
 consistently
 is


that
 this
 is
 a
 concerning
 time.
 People


dislike
 the
 amount
 of
 polarization.
 We


do
 hear
 that
 our
 coverage
 and
 the
 way


that
 we
 approach
 things
 tends
 to
 bring


people
 closer
 to
 an
 understanding
 of


their
 fellow
 Americans
 because
 we
 really


do
 focus
 on
 finding
 the
 personal
 story.


We
 like
 to
 say
 that
 everything
 that


happens
 in
 America
 happens
 somewhere.


And
 so
 we're
 always
 trying
 to
 find
 the


somewhere
 that
 that
 that
 is
 happening


whether
 it's
 the
 implications
 of
 tariffs


or
 you
 know
 the
 conversation
 that's


happening
 around
 for
 example
 Jimmy


Kimmel
 who
 you
 were
 just
 recently


referencing.


Listeners
 are
 so
 loyal.
 You
 turn
 to
 them


for
 funding.
 Have
 you
 seen
 big


billionaires,
 big
 donors
 wanting
 to
 step


up
 to
 this
 moment?


Um,
 we
 have
 seen
 a
 outpouring
 of


support.
 Absolutely.
 So,
 New
 Hampshire


Public
 Radio,
 for
 example,
 raised
 a


million
 dollars
 in
 response
 to
 the


defunding
 efforts
 in
 over
 the
 course
 of


a
 short
 period
 of
 weeks.
 We're
 really


appreciative
 of
 this,
 but
 that
 won't


fill
 the
 gap
 for
 these
 rural
 communities


that
 are
 already
 socioeconomically


strapped.
 There's
 a
 reason
 they
 have


been
 fedally
 funded.
 We
 know
 that
 for


sorry
 we
 know
 that
 20%
 of
 Americans
 live


without
 local
 news.
 There's
 a
 reason
 for


that.
 The
 market
 conditions
 don't
 allow


it
 and
 that's
 where
 public
 media
 has


filled
 in
 the
 gap.
 So
 that
 still
 remains


a
 challenge.
 We
 have
 seen
 a
 lot
 of


support
 of
 course
 across
 the
 board
 for


public
 radio.
 I
 think
 there
 were
 3


million
 people
 who
 wrote
 into
 Congress


to
 support
 the
 to
 support
 us
 at
 the
 time


of
 defunding.
 Um
 but
 it
 won't
 be
 enough


to
 fill
 the
 $120
 million
 gap
 relative
 to


the
 defunding
 effort.
 Your
 own


background
 is
 so
 fascinating
 having
 been


for
 a
 stint
 with
 the
 web
 summit
 making


huge
 big
 events
 and
 for
 a
 tech


community.
 You're
 on
 you're
 the
 chair
 of


the
 signal
 foundation.
 You're
 also
 been


at
 Wikipedia.
 I'm
 I'm
 interested
 as
 to


how
 in
 this
 moment
 of
 belt
 tightening


your
 technological
 savvy
 comes
 into
 all


of
 it.


Well,
 I
 actually
 think
 that
 technology


is
 an
 enormous
 advantage
 for
 the
 complex


structure
 that
 you
 have.
 You
 asked
 me


about
 the
 business
 model
 earlier
 and
 I


think
 it's
 a
 great
 lead
 into
 this.


Right.
 there
 is
 a
 way
 in
 which
 we
 could


be
 in
 competition.
 All
 of
 these
 local


stations
 seeking
 to
 make
 now
 transform


their
 work
 for
 a
 national
 audience.


Technology
 actually
 offers
 us
 the
 place


to
 bring
 all
 of
 that
 aggregate
 reporting


together.
 And
 so
 if
 somebody
 is
 running


a
 really
 great
 story
 here
 in
 LA
 about
 a


local
 band
 that
 is
 about
 to
 go
 on
 tour,


and
 I
 would
 I
 reference
 that
 because


music
 is
 a
 big
 part
 of
 what
 we
 do
 at


NPR.
 um
 we
 now
 have
 the
 ability
 to
 serve


that
 to
 any
 audience
 member
 anywhere


across
 the
 country
 who
 might
 be


interested
 in
 what
 that
 band
 is
 about
 to


do.
 Right?
 We
 wouldn't
 have
 been
 able
 to


do
 that
 in
 a
 previous
 era.
 But
 the


ability
 of
 digital
 platforms,
 the


affordances
 for
 us
 to
 serve
 audiences


seamlessly,
 they
 don't
 think
 of
 us
 as


our
 local
 station
 versus
 our
 local


station.
 They
 think
 of
 us
 as
 one
 public


media
 experience.
 And
 that's
 really
 what


we're
 leaning
 into.


So
 Zen,
 what
 are
 you
 going
 to
 do


differently,
 you
 know,
 in
 this


environment?
 What
 are
 you
 going
 to


change
 to
 to
 bring
 in
 more
 money
 that


you
 need?
 Well,
 certainly
 investing


pretty
 heavily
 in
 the
 fundraising
 piece.


I
 mean,
 I
 don't
 think
 that
 that's


dissimilar
 from
 what
 we've
 seen
 in


nonprofit
 news
 as
 a
 whole.
 We've
 seen


tremendous
 success
 in
 the
 nonprofit
 news


sector
 in
 building
 subscriptions
 and


building
 memberships.
 That's
 an


opportunity
 for
 us.
 And
 in
 fact,
 we've


been
 doing
 it
 for
 a
 long
 time.
 We
 have


millions
 and
 millions
 of
 loyal
 donors


across
 the
 country.
 It's
 time
 to
 bring


in
 the
 next
 generation.
 You
 mentioned
 I


come
 from
 Wikipedia.
 We
 have
 a
 little


experience
 in
 this,
 right?
 Um,
 so
 that's


one
 piece
 of
 it.
 I
 also
 think
 that
 it's


an
 opportunity
 for
 us
 to
 think
 about
 how


we're
 doing
 our
 news
 gathering
 and
 news


production
 more
 effectively.
 And
 so
 we


have
 all
 these
 journalists
 across
 the


country.
 What
 does
 it
 mean
 to
 do
 the


national
 editorial
 planning
 where
 we're


really
 thinking
 about
 how
 to
 elevate


these
 conversations
 that
 are
 happening


around
 the
 country
 into
 the
 national


story?
 And
 then
 of
 course
 we
 have
 this


great
 international
 and
 national


reporting
 that
 we're
 to
 now
 weave
 into


the
 mix.


Katherine
 Mayer,
 NPR
 CEO,
 thank
 you
 very


much
 for
 being
 with
 us
 here
 at
 Bloomberg


Screen
 Time.
 Meanwhile,
 Warner
 Music


Group
 is
 said
 to
 be
 in
 close
 agreement


with
 Netflix
 to
 create
 a
 slate
 of
 movies


and
 documentaries
 based
 on
 the
 record


label's
 catalog
 of
 artists
 and
 songs.


That's
 according
 to
 sources.
 Here's
 what


Warner
 Music
 Group
 CEO
 Robert
 Khal
 said


about
 a
 potential
 deal.


I
 cannot
 confirm
 anything
 but
 um
 but
 the


you
 know
 if
 you
 step
 back
 and
 think


about
 this
 it
 makes
 a
 lot
 you
 know
 our


company
 has
 tremendous
 catalog
 Prince


Madonna


uh
 Fleetwood
 Mac
 you
 know
 it's
 just
 it


just
 goes
 on
 and
 on
 and
 on
 the
 the
 the


stories
 that
 we
 have
 are
 incredible
 and


they
 haven't
 really
 been
 told
 um
 it
 may


more
 like
 Marvel
 for
 music
 as
 I
 That's


that's
 that's
 where
 we
 are
 and
 it
 it


will
 be
 unlocked
 and
 uh
 so
 it
 makes
 a


lot
 of
 sense
 for
 us
 to
 partner
 with
 a


company
 that
 can
 bring
 it
 to
 life
 all


around
 the
 world
 and
 it's
 exciting
 both


for
 acts
 who
 are
 no
 longer
 with
 us


uh
 but
 we
 make
 their
 estates
 happy
 and


satisfied
 but
 also
 for
 acts
 who
 are
 with


us
 who
 then
 can
 actually
 help
 bring


young
 audiences
 to
 the
 streaming


platforms.
 Robert
 Kinsel,
 Warner
 Music


Group
 CEO.
 Then


I
 think
 it's
 it's
 hard
 for
 any
 brand


that
 has
 a
 deep,
 you
 know,
 consumer


sense
 of
 what
 are
 you
 doing
 for
 me,


right?
 And
 then
 you're
 like,
 well,
 I'm


going
 to
 do
 this
 as
 well.
 And
 you
 have,


it
 takes
 a
 while
 to
 really
 build
 up
 that


sense
 of
 what's
 happening.
 But
 it's
 not


it's
 not
 that
 dissimilar
 to,
 let's
 say,


when
 we
 launched,
 you
 know,
 in
 a
 in
 a


new
 country
 like
 I
 you
 know,
 you
 went
 to


Japan,
 right?
 So
 when
 we
 started
 in


Japan,
 2%
 of
 the
 Japanese
 population
 had


ever
 heard
 of
 Netflix.
 So
 nobody
 knew


what
 we
 who
 nobody
 could
 nobody
 knew
 our


name,
 much
 less
 be
 able
 to
 tell
 you
 what


we
 were
 doing.
 And
 we're
 doing
 pay
 TV


service
 in
 a
 country
 that
 doesn't
 really


have
 a
 great
 pay
 TV,
 you
 know,


operation.
 We're
 doing
 over
 the
 internet


in
 a
 way
 that
 was
 totally
 new.
 And
 so


you
 you
 got
 to
 every
 day
 build
 a
 little


bit
 of
 like
 what
 are
 we
 doing,
 who
 we


are,
 what
 are
 we,
 you
 know,
 how
 are
 we


here
 to
 serve
 you.
 So
 that
 10-year


journey,
 let's
 say,
 you
 know,
 we
 just


did
 the
 10th
 anniversary
 in
 Japan,
 you


know,
 tremendous
 progress
 over
 10
 years,


but
 it
 took
 us
 a
 long
 time.
 And
 I
 think,


you
 know,
 the
 gaming
 situation
 is
 not


dissimilar
 to
 that.
 How
 much
 is
 it
 a


impediment
 that
 for
 the
 most
 part
 now


you
 can
 only
 play
 it
 on
 your
 on
 your


phone?


Well,
 I
 would
 say,
 you
 know,
 the
 phone


is
 what's
 great
 about
 it
 is
 it's
 a


well-developed
 gaming
 ecosystem,
 right?


So
 it
 um
 you
 know
 folks
 know
 to
 find


games
 there
 but
 it's
 also
 a
 highly


competitive
 gaming
 ecosystem.
 So
 it's


developedness
 gives
 you
 both
 that
 upside


and
 that
 downside.
 But
 what's
 exciting


is
 that
 now
 we
 are
 moving
 beyond
 the


phone
 to
 the
 TV.
 So
 I
 mentioned
 like
 one


the
 big
 gaming
 areas
 we're
 going
 after


one
 of
 the
 big
 gaming
 areas
 we're
 going


after
 now
 is
 you
 know
 social
 gaming


experiences
 that
 will
 show
 up
 on
 your


TV.
 So,
 uh,
 we
 are
 now
 announcing,
 we're


going to
 announce
 here
 actually
 that


we're
 going
 to
 have
 these
 social
 party


games,
 a
 pack
 of
 social
 party
 games
 that


you
 can
 play
 on
 your
 TV
 with
 your
 phone


as
 the
 controller,
 and
 it's
 things
 like,


you
 know,
 recognizable
 games
 like
 Bogle,


you
 got
 Pictionary,
 we've
 got
 a
 Lego


party
 game,
 we've
 got
 Tetris,
 we've
 got


like
 a
 mafia
 style.
 Uh,
 who
 done
 it?


This
 is
 This
 is
 uh
 me
 and
 our
 CTO


Elizabeth
 playing
 Boggle
 here,
 which
 is


uh
 it's
 um
 we're
 two
 very
 competitive


people.
 So,
 it
 it
 got
 it
 got
 pretty


ugly.


Who
 won
 it?


I'm
 not
 going
 to
 say.


That
 means
 you
 lost.


Oh,
 does
 it?
 Why
 don't
 you
 watch
 the


video,
 my
 friend?


You
 you
 triggered
 my
 competitive
 spirit.


But
 this
 is
 again,
 this
 is,
 you
 know,
 so


it's
 your
 phone,
 which
 is
 an
 incredible


device.
 And
 there's
 all
 sorts
 of
 things


you're
 going
 to
 be
 able
 to
 do
 on
 your


phone,
 uh,
 that
 you
 can't
 do
 on
 a
 normal


controller
 like
 touchscreen.
 And
 this
 is


us
 basically
 picking
 our
 our
 words
 on


that.
 And
 it's,
 you
 know,
 it's
 dead


simple
 to
 use.
 It's
 intuitive.
 And
 then


this
 is,
 you
 know,
 us
 on
 the
 earliest


days
 of
 how
 we
 actually
 can
 use
 that.


And
 if
 we,
 you
 know,
 basically
 are
 gonna


like
 unleash
 this
 with
 a
 bunch
 of


creators
 and
 they're
 going
 to
 go
 figure


out
 stuff
 that
 we
 didn't
 even
 imagine


that
 they
 can
 do
 with
 that


interactivity.


That
 was
 Netflix
 co-CEO
 Greg
 Peters.
 Key


conversations
 coming
 up,
 gaming
 with


Twitch
 CEO
 Dan
 Clancy,
 UniS
 Lee
 of


Scopely.
 One
 of
 the
 top
 streamers
 out


there
 is
 Poke
 Main.
 So
 much
 more
 from


Los
 Angeles
 and
 Bloomberg
 Screen
 Time.


This
 is
 Bloomberg
 Tech.


Welcome
 back
 to
 a
 special
 edition
 of


Bloomberg
 Tech.
 We're
 live
 from


Bloomberg
 Screen
 Time
 in
 Los
 Angeles.


Amazon's
 streaming
 platform
 Twitch
 is


growing
 online
 stars
 by
 the
 minute.
 It's


averaging
 more
 than
 105
 million
 monthly


visitors
 globally.
 And
 here
 to
 discuss


the
 current
 state,
 but
 also
 the
 future


state
 of
 the
 live
 streaming
 business


model
 is
 Twitch
 CEO
 Dan
 Clancy.


Thank
 you
 for
 having
 me.
 It's
 great
 to


be
 here.


So,
 Twitch
 is
 such
 an
 interesting
 thing,


an
 entity.
 Um,
 there
 are
 loads
 of
 people


out
 there
 that
 aren't
 familiar
 with
 it.


And
 actually,
 I
 thought
 the
 most


sensible
 place
 to
 start
 is
 like,
 can
 you


just
 explain
 what
 Twitch
 is
 and
 how
 it


works?
 Yeah,


quickly
 for
 those.
 So,
 um,
 simplest
 way.


So,
 Twitch
 is
 a
 live
 streaming
 platform


where
 people
 go
 live.
 Okay.
 And
 so
 if


you
 say
 it's
 a
 live
 um
 version
 of


YouTube
 or
 something
 like
 that,
 but
 the


thing
 that
 really
 makes
 Twitch
 unique


and
 the
 the
 kind
 of
 um
 uh
 need
 that
 it


meets
 in
 people
 is
 um
 as
 human
 beings,


we
 are
 all
 yearning
 for
 community.
 And


what
 happens
 on
 Twitch
 is
 people
 go
 live


and
 they
 basically
 share
 their
 lives.


They
 let
 people
 into
 their
 living
 room.


They
 go
 out
 in
 the
 world
 and
 they


explore.
 They
 game.
 And
 then
 what
 they


do
 is
 very
 authentically
 engage
 with


those
 people
 that
 are
 watching.
 And


since
 people
 spend
 a
 fair
 amount
 of
 time


watching
 these
 people,
 a
 community
 forms


between
 the
 folks
 that
 are
 watching.
 And


um
 I
 think
 that
 is
 really
 the
 magic
 of


Twitch
 and
 what
 distinguishes
 Twitch


from
 many
 other
 platforms
 that
 have
 live


streaming.
 The
 phrase
 I
 use
 is
 we're


communitycentric
 live
 streaming
 because


people
 find
 a
 place
 where
 they
 belong.


So
 the
 simple
 origin
 was
 like
 people


would
 be
 playing
 video
 games
 in
 simple


terms
 and
 they
 would
 be
 filming
 and


streaming
 themselves
 playing
 this
 game


sometimes
 with
 others.
 But
 it's
 kind
 of


evolved
 into
 a
 much
 broader
 set
 of


content.
 IRL
 or
 just
 chatting
 is
 um
 are


things
 that
 I
 you
 know
 I'm
 following
 on


the
 platform.
 Is
 there
 a
 still
 a
 heavy


proportion
 of
 activity
 that's
 gaming


related
 or
 is
 it
 now
 much
 more
 diverse?


Well,
 it's
 very
 diverse
 and
 the


interesting
 story
 is
 even
 before
 Twitch


Twitch
 started
 as
 Justin
 TV
 and
 in


Justin
 TV
 it
 was
 life
 casting.
 So
 in


fact
 it
 wasn't
 about
 gaming.


Okay.
 And
 then
 Twitch
 formed
 life


casting
 is
 what
 they
 called
 it
 back
 then


where
 you
 were
 just


casting
 your
 life.
 And
 then
 um
 uh
 Twitch


pivoted
 and
 focused
 on
 gaming.
 And


that's
 when
 it
 really
 took
 off.
 And
 now


it's
 kind
 of
 come
 full
 circle
 cuz
 while


gaming
 is
 still
 a
 big
 part
 of
 Twitch
 and


will
 always
 be
 a
 big
 part
 of
 Twitch,


more
 and
 more
 creators
 are
 out
 there


just
 doing
 all
 sorts
 of
 things.
 You
 said


IRL,
 which
 is
 in
 real
 life,
 which
 means


you
 go
 out
 on
 the
 streets,
 you
 go


climbing
 a
 mountain.
 I've
 watched
 you


stream
 from
 a
 water
 slide
 in
 a
 donut.


Yes.
 Necessary
 content.


Is
 that
 IRL?


That's
 IRL
 streaming.
 It's
 in
 real
 life.


DJ
 Clancy,
 I
 think,
 is
 who
 you're


streaming
 as.
 I'm
 I'm
 interested
 though,


like
 Ed
 does
 such
 a
 great
 job
 on
 this


show
 reminding
 us
 of
 the
 sheer
 scale
 and


the
 power
 of
 numbers
 of
 gaming.
 When
 we


think
 about
 big
 movie
 hits,
 it
 pales


into
 comparison
 of
 the
 amount
 of
 money


earned
 by
 gaming
 versus
 video
 games.


And
 what
 amazes
 me
 is
 how
 much
 the


content
 creators
 are
 winning
 in
 terms
 of


content.
 Yeah,


they
 they
 are
 getting
 $100
 million


contracts
 to
 jump
 from
 you
 to
 kick
 or


from
 kick
 to
 you
 or
 to
 YouTube
 more
 than


LeBron
 James
 is
 earning.
 Can
 you
 go
 to


actually
 who
 your
 competition
 therefore


is
 and
 how
 you
 fight
 for
 that
 content
 in


this
 moment?
 Yeah,
 the
 way
 I
 look
 at
 it


as
 we're
 fairly
 unique
 in
 this
 space
 and


I
 don't
 focus
 on
 the
 competition
 because


um
 as
 a
 live
 streaming
 platform
 at
 our


scale
 there
 are
 smaller
 ones
 but
 you


know
 really
 when
 we
 think
 of
 the
 social


media
 space
 you
 have
 YouTube
 you
 have


Tik
 Tok
 you
 have
 Instagram
 but
 Twitch
 is


really
 the
 only
 one
 that
 solely
 focuses


on
 this
 communitycentric
 live
 streaming


experience
 and
 the
 way
 I
 describe
 it


sometimes
 is
 we
 actually
 are
 a
 long
 form


platform
 and
 that
 people
 sit
 there
 and


watch
 for
 1
 hour
 2
 hours
 so
 in
 that


sense
 we're
 like
 prime
 video
 and


Netflix,
 but
 we're
 social.
 So,
 we're


sort
 of
 right
 in
 the
 middle
 of
 what
 I'll


call
 the
 the
 streaming
 platforms
 and
 the


social
 media
 platforms
 where
 we're


really
 a
 long
 form
 social
 media


platform.


You're
 also,
 dare
 I
 say
 it,
 right
 in
 the


middle
 of
 the
 culture
 wars.
 And
 I'm
 just


really
 interested
 as
 to
 how
 you
 navigate


that
 in
 leadership
 when
 people
 are


bringing
 them
 into
 their
 homes
 in
 a
 more


intimate
 setting
 and
 feel
 that
 they
 can


share
 anything
 that
 they
 feel.
 But
 that


then
 can
 blow
 up
 in
 many
 different
 ways.


Yeah.
 So,
 um,
 first
 of
 all,
 it's
 very


important
 that
 we
 take
 it
 very
 seriously


in
 terms
 of
 having
 a
 set
 of
 guidelines


of
 what's
 appropriate
 on
 Twitch
 and


what's
 not.
 Um,
 and
 so
 we
 we
 spend
 a
 lot


of
 time
 thinking
 about
 that
 and
 letting


our
 creators
 do
 what
 they
 need
 to
 do
 to


protect
 themselves.


And
 you
 kick
 them
 off,
 too,
 if
 they're


not


kick
 them
 off
 if
 they're
 not
 adhering
 to


them.
 That's
 really
 important
 for
 our


platform.
 But
 really
 what
 it
 is
 is


that's
 just
 one
 of
 the
 things
 you
 have


to
 deal
 with
 if
 you
 want
 to
 get
 that


authenticity.
 Because
 this
 key


difference
 between
 Twitch
 and,
 you
 know,


many
 other
 um
 short
 form
 platforms,
 if


you're
 just
 making
 a
 a
 short
 clip,
 you


can
 put
 on
 a
 mask.
 When
 you're
 live


streaming,
 you
 can't
 put
 on
 a
 mask.
 And


and
 one
 thing
 that's
 been
 leading
 a
 lot


of
 celebrities,
 um
 entertainers,


athletes,
 influence,
 all
 sorts
 of
 people


now
 to
 live
 streaming
 is
 they
 want
 that


authentic,
 honest
 connection
 with
 their


fans
 and
 turn
 those
 fans
 into
 community.


Dan,
 sorry
 to
 interrupt.
 team.
 Let's


bring
 up
 the
 the
 Gavin
 Newsome
 session


then
 and
 just
 play
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 it
 um


if
 we
 can.
 Um
 there's
 some
 sound


associated
 with
 it,
 Dan,
 but
 in
 very


simple
 terms,
 Gavin
 Newsome
 went
 on
 the


Twitch
 and
 not
 providing
 due
 process,


went
 on
 the
 Twitch
 platform,
 and
 my


understanding
 is
 that,
 you
 know,
 he
 was


engaging
 with
 one
 of
 his
 children's


favorite
 content
 creators.
 That
 that's


the
 governor
 of
 California
 using
 Twitch


to
 communicate.
 Just
 explain
 how
 you


feel
 about
 that.
 Yeah.
 The
 way
 I
 think


of
 it,
 what
 he's
 doing
 is
 he's
 um
 uh


he's
 just
 authentically
 interacting
 with


um
 you
 know
 those
 people
 that
 may
 have


an
 interest
 in
 him,
 right?
 And
 I
 do
 that


myself.
 I
 stream
 and
 have
 a
 great
 time


doing
 it.
 And
 when
 you
 do
 it,
 you


realize
 there's
 like
 there's
 something


really
 special
 about
 having
 that
 impact


on
 people
 and
 having
 that
 feedback,
 that


visceral
 feeling
 of,
 you
 know,
 when
 I


when
 I
 stream,
 I'll
 play
 the
 piano
 and


sing
 and
 they'll
 say,
 "Oh,
 I
 love
 that


song."
 And
 it
 really
 kind
 of
 makes
 it's


very
 different
 than
 just
 looking
 at


metrics
 like
 you
 do
 on
 other
 social


media.


You've
 been
 really
 clear.
 There
 are


guidelines
 for
 the
 content
 creators.


There
 are
 guidelines
 for
 the
 viewers
 in


how
 they
 interact.
 But
 Twitch
 is
 one
 of


a
 number
 of
 platforms
 that
 is
 caught
 up


in
 a
 wider
 discussion
 about
 people
 that


want
 to
 talk
 politics
 or
 even
 in
 the


context
 of
 radicalization.


just
 give
 us
 your
 sort
 of
 blanket
 policy


and
 approach
 to
 managing
 that


environment
 on
 the
 Twitch
 platform,


please.
 Because
 DC
 is
 paying
 attention,


not
 just
 to
 Twitch.
 I
 I
 get
 that,
 but


but
 it
 is
 important.


Well,
 that's
 what
 I'd
 say
 like
 first
 of


all,
 our
 policy
 is
 um
 you
 know,
 you
 can


freely
 express
 your
 views.
 It's
 how
 you


say
 it
 that's
 important
 that
 you
 should


not
 be
 attacking
 and
 um
 hate
 and


harassment
 is
 not
 allowed
 on
 our


platform
 and
 we're
 very
 clear
 about


that.
 But
 um
 we
 understand
 that
 people


are
 going
 to
 express


quick
 who
 adjudicates
 that.


Um


we
 have
 both
 automated
 techniques
 and
 we


have
 a
 a
 large
 group
 of
 people
 that
 work


whenever
 something's
 reported
 to
 then


analyze
 it
 and
 see
 if
 it
 aderes
 to
 our


community
 guidelines
 and
 then
 if
 there's


a
 violation
 we
 take
 an
 enforcement


action.


What's
 so
 great
 is
 you
 two
 are
 going
 to


be
 on
 stage
 together
 a
 little
 bit
 later.


Twitch
 CEO
 Dan
 Clansancy.
 We
 so
 thank


you
 for
 your
 time
 with
 us
 on
 the
 show
 as


well.
 Well,
 now
 coming
 up,
 we're
 going


to
 be
 speaking
 with
 Scopely
 COO
 Unice


Lee
 about
 the
 growth
 and
 competition
 in


the
 mobile
 gaming
 industry.
 This
 is


Bloomberg
 Tech.


In
 the
 realm
 of
 mobile
 gaming,
 there
 are


a
 few
 key
 players
 increasingly


dominating
 the
 space.
 One
 of
 those
 is


Scopely.
 It's
 the
 publisher
 behind


Marvel
 Strikeforce,
 Yatsi
 with
 Buddies,


Pokémon
 Go,
 my
 kids
 favorite.


Scopely
 chief
 operating
 officer
 Ununice


Lee
 joins
 us
 now.
 And
 we
 see
 that
 IP
 and


it
 stands
 out
 so
 much.
 UniCe,
 but


competition
 is
 really
 building.
 How
 do


you
 see
 that
 as
 a
 really
 helping
 you


focus
 on
 the
 business,
 scale
 the


business,
 but
 also
 try
 drive
 off
 those


competitors?


Sure.
 I
 mean,
 it's
 always
 great
 to
 have


competition
 because
 it
 only
 fuels
 that


drive
 to
 innovate
 and
 to,
 you
 know,


exceed
 expectations
 for
 us.
 We
 welcome


all
 of
 it.
 I
 think
 Scopely
 in
 particular


is
 always
 focused
 on
 a
 community
 first


approach.
 And
 so
 the
 games
 that
 we're


building,
 we
 think
 about
 how
 are
 we


creating
 these
 highly
 social
 engaging


experiences.
 And
 I
 think
 that's
 what


sets
 us
 apart
 ultimately
 because
 we


always
 start
 from
 that
 core
 premise.


And
 that
 highly
 social
 engagement
 drives


revenue.
 I'm
 assuming.
 Just
 talk
 us


through
 the
 business
 model.


Sure.
 I
 mean,
 it's
 pretty
 astounding.


Uh,
 last
 year
 we
 achieved
 over
 $10


billion
 in
 lifetime
 revenue.
 Um,
 we're


really
 excited
 about
 that.
 We
 have
 500


million
 plus
 uh
 daily
 active
 users


touching
 our
 games
 in
 the
 last
 12


months.
 There's
 just
 amazing
 things


happening
 and
 we're
 so
 excited
 about


adding
 Pokémon
 Go
 to
 our
 stable
 or


amazing
 portfolio
 of
 games.
 uh
 they


continue
 to
 grow
 and
 reach
 new
 players


every
 day
 and
 so
 yeah
 it's
 pretty


amazing.


Unice
 here
 at
 Bloomberg
 screen
 time


there's
 been
 a
 lot
 of
 industry
 news.
 I
 I


wondered
 if
 we
 could
 run
 through
 some
 of


it.
 So
 like
 last
 night
 Netflix


to
 me
 basically
 demoed
 uh
 a
 technology


that
 casts
 a
 mobile
 game
 from
 your
 phone


to
 your
 TV
 screen.
 As
 a
 hardcore
 gamer


in
 many
 different
 domains
 and
 formats


wasn't
 blown
 away
 by
 that.
 What
 do
 you


make
 of
 that
 concept
 and
 idea?
 I
 mean,


it's
 a
 mobile
 game
 cast
 to
 the


television.


I'm
 also
 a
 hardcore
 gamer,
 so
 I
 feel


you.
 Um,
 I
 think
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day,


we're
 trying
 to
 create
 again
 highly


social
 engaging
 experiences.
 And
 for


Scopely,
 it's
 about
 trying
 to
 be
 on
 the


different
 mediums
 where
 our
 players
 want


to
 be
 and
 even
 bringing
 our
 community


together
 in
 real
 life
 as
 we
 have
 with


the
 Go
 Fest,
 which
 is
 for
 Pokemon
 Go


community.
 So,
 I
 think
 for
 us,
 we're


just
 look,
 we're
 going
 to
 always
 keep
 an


eye
 on
 where
 people
 are
 playing,
 how


they
 want
 to
 engage
 with
 our
 content,


and
 try
 to
 serve
 that
 up
 to
 our


community.


The
 industry
 has
 seen
 seismic
 shifts
 in


the
 last
 2
 years.
 I
 think
 that's
 a


completely
 fair
 statement.
 Um,


you
 have
 some
 uh
 financial
 relationship


with
 this
 with
 Saudi
 through
 various
 um


you
 know,
 investments
 that
 they've
 made.


The
 biggest
 most
 recent
 news
 is
 the
 the


take
 private
 of
 electronic
 arts.
 Um,
 my


question
 is
 very
 simple.
 Have
 you
 had


discussions
 about
 cooperating
 with
 EA?


You
 know,
 you
 are
 very
 strong
 in
 mobile


gaming.
 EA
 is
 not
 so
 strong
 in
 mobile


gaming.


We
 are,
 we
 have
 so
 much
 respect
 for
 what


EA
 has
 been
 able
 to
 do
 and
 the
 amazing,


you
 know,
 brands
 and
 IPs
 that
 they've


built.
 So,
 we
 have
 we
 come
 from
 that


place
 first.
 Right
 now,
 uh,
 we're
 not
 in


specific
 discussions,
 but
 post
 deal
 if


those
 opportunities
 arrive,
 we're


definitely
 open
 to
 discussions
 for
 sure.


and
 and
 we
 think
 about
 ultimately
 where


you've
 come
 from,
 the
 fact
 that
 you
 were


busy
 over
 at
 Activision
 with
 Call
 of


Duty.
 You
 are
 someone
 who
 calls
 yourself


a
 hardcore
 gamer.


Where
 do
 you
 think
 the
 balance
 shifts
 in


terms
 of
 mobile
 versus
 console?
 How
 do


you
 see
 that
 continuing
 to
 evolve?


Honestly,
 I
 think
 our
 community,
 our


players
 want
 to
 access
 our
 content
 in


different
 ways.
 And
 it's
 not
 this
 huge


battle
 so
 much,
 but
 again,
 as
 I


mentioned
 earlier,
 it's
 about
 serving


our
 community
 where
 they
 want
 to
 engage


with
 our
 content,
 where
 they
 want
 to


play.
 And
 I
 think
 there's
 a
 place
 for


all
 of
 it.
 We
 are
 also
 we
 have
 several


things
 which
 I
 can't
 talk
 about,
 but
 in


development
 that
 are
 crossplatform
 and


across
 platforms
 you
 may
 not
 expect
 from


Scopely.


Okay,
 keep
 us
 tuned
 on
 that
 respect.
 But


you
 we
 can
 go
 global
 with
 you
 because


you're
 a
 woman
 who
 is
 international,


very
 core.
 You've
 been
 in
 London,
 you


studied
 in
 Asia,
 and
 I'm
 thinking
 about


how
 things
 change
 from
 global
 era
 to


global
 era.
 Pokémon
 Go
 inherently
 for
 us


a
 very
 Japanese
 bit
 of
 IP
 that
 has


become
 a
 total
 global
 phenomenon.


Yes,
 absolutely.
 I
 mean,
 for
 us
 again,


it's
 there's
 a
 whole
 wide
 world
 to


appeal
 to.
 And
 what
 the
 beauty
 of
 games


is
 that
 it
 brings
 these
 folks
 together


across
 the
 globe.
 It
 transcends


geographies,
 cultures,
 and
 that's
 super


exciting
 for
 us.
 And
 that's
 that
 social


connection
 part
 that
 we
 want
 to
 continue


to
 promote
 and
 continue
 to
 see.


So,
 we're
 talking
 about
 this
 thing,


right?
 The
 mobile,
 right?
 And
 and
 gaming


is
 one
 thing
 I
 can
 do
 on
 my
 mobile


phone.
 Do
 you
 guys
 consider
 your
 rivals


to
 be
 Tik
 Tok?
 Literally,
 this
 is


Bloomberg
 screen
 time,
 you
 know,
 how
 do


you
 assess
 a
 marketplace
 where
 the


competition
 for
 rivals
 isn't
 necessarily


in
 the
 time
 spent
 on
 gaming?


Yeah.
 Yeah,
 I
 mean
 I
 think
 the
 gaming


space
 itself


is
 so
 fast
 moving
 and
 evolves
 very


quickly.
 So
 wherever
 eyeballs
 intention


is
 again
 wherever
 our
 players
 are
 fans


because
 they're
 looking
 at
 IP
 through


various
 mediums.
 So
 being
 conscious
 of


that
 it's
 not
 just
 through
 the
 game


there's
 different
 um
 ways
 of
 the
 IP


coming
 to
 life.
 So
 us
 staying
 on
 top
 of


that
 is
 super
 important
 at
 Scopely.


Again,
 how
 do
 we
 connect
 with
 the


community
 where
 they
 want
 to?
 mobile
 is


one
 of
 the,
 you
 know,
 most
 tactile
 and


easiest
 ways
 to
 do
 so,
 but
 it's


something
 that
 is
 always
 on
 our
 minds.


Roblox
 CEO
 Damjuki
 told
 us
 very
 recently


that
 sometimes
 on
 a
 Friday
 night
 their


servers
 melt
 because
 of
 all
 the


condensed
 activity
 in
 the
 mobile
 gaming


domain.
 Do
 you
 ever
 come
 across
 like


flash
 moments
 like
 that
 where
 the
 world


is
 just
 playing
 at
 the
 same
 time?


I
 mean,
 we
 have
 so
 many
 people
 engaging


daily,
 hourly,
 uh,
 with
 our
 products


because
 of
 their
 deep
 love
 of
 these
 IPs.


Star
 Trek
 Fleet
 Command
 is
 a
 great


example.


75%
 of
 our
 players
 of
 that
 game,
 they


are
 touching
 it
 every
 single
 day.


Every
 single
 day
 and
 in
 meaningful


amounts
 of
 time.


I
 mean,
 I
 know
 it's
 for
 your
 business.


I
 think
 for
 Star
 Trek
 fans,
 it's
 like


amazing
 to
 be
 able
 to
 be
 in
 that


universe
 and
 th
 those
 are
 hardcore
 fans


that
 that
 IP
 attracts
 real
 loyalty
 and


so
 our
 ability
 to
 do
 that,
 you
 know,
 for


that
 community
 is
 pretty
 special.
 How


many
 years
 has
 it
 been
 since
 I've
 done


like
 that
 on
 television?
 Um,
 Unicely,


chief
 operating
 ever
 done
 it
 on


television.


I
 have
 remember
 I
 did
 do
 it
 once.
 Well,


let's
 leave
 it
 behind.
 Uni
 Lee,
 chief


operating
 officer
 at
 Scopia.
 It's
 great


to
 have
 you
 on
 Blumotech.
 Thank
 you
 so


much.


So
 Hollywood's
 typically
 focused
 on
 the


people
 in
 front
 of
 the
 camera,
 but
 today


increasingly
 we're
 talking
 about


streamers.
 People
 like
 Emanis,
 more


commonly
 known
 as
 Pokémon.
 She's
 one
 of


the
 most
 popular
 streamers
 on
 Twitch


with
 nearly
 10
 million
 dedicated


followers
 and
 another
 20
 million
 across


other
 platforms.
 We're
 talking
 YouTube


X,
 Facebook,
 Insta.
 I'm
 delighted
 to
 say


that
 Pokey
 joins
 us
 now.
 We've
 been


talking
 in
 recent
 weeks.
 I
 It's
 great
 to


finally
 have
 you
 on
 Bloomberg
 Tech.


Likewise.


Now,
 now
 bear
 with
 me
 on
 this
 one.


But
 let's
 just
 start
 by
 asking,
 what
 is


your
 day
 job?
 How
 would
 you
 describe


what
 it
 is
 that
 you
 do?


In
 technical
 terms,
 I'm
 a
 content


creator.
 How
 I
 might
 want
 to
 describe
 it


is
 just
 I
 love
 sharing
 my
 life
 online.
 I


love
 to
 entertain
 people.
 I
 love
 to
 make


people
 happy.
 That's
 about
 it.
 I'd
 say


it


it
 started
 with
 with
 video
 games
 on


Twitch
 like
 quite
 a
 long
 time
 ago.
 you


you've
 got
 a
 long
 history
 with
 Twitch.


I
 sure
 do.


2013.


2013.
 And
 like
 um
 and
 and
 that's


something
 we
 share
 in
 common,
 you
 know,


some
 of
 the
 titles
 in
 particular,
 but
 we


just
 had
 Dan
 Clancy
 on
 the
 program


earlier.
 It
 for
 you
 in
 particular,
 it
 is


expanded
 to
 IRL
 and
 just
 chatting.
 Is


there
 a
 moment
 where
 that
 happened?
 It


it
 moved
 beyond
 video
 games.


I
 would
 say,
 interestingly
 enough,
 when


I
 first
 started
 streaming,
 you
 weren't


even
 allowed
 to
 stream
 IRL
 or
 just


chatting.
 it
 was
 just
 games,


right?


Anything
 else
 you
 might
 get
 banned
 for
 a


few
 days.


And
 so,
 as
 the
 platform
 started
 not
 only


allowing
 but
 supporting
 different
 types


of
 content,
 I
 of
 course
 only
 wanted
 to


try
 out
 those
 different
 things.
 And
 I


also
 love
 how
 it
 allowed
 me
 to
 showcase


different
 parts
 of
 my
 life.
 Now,
 instead


of
 traveling
 and
 feeling
 like,
 oh,
 I


can't
 do
 my
 job,
 I
 can't
 game,
 I
 can't


speak
 to
 my
 community,
 I
 could
 travel


and
 stream
 myself
 in
 those
 different


countries.
 So,
 as
 both
 this
 platform


changed
 and
 what
 the
 audiences
 like
 and


enjoy
 changed,
 I
 followed
 in
 and
 I
 was


able
 to
 explore
 so
 many
 different
 types


of
 content.


And
 then
 we've
 seen
 you
 go
 to
 Korea.


We've
 seen
 you
 go
 to
 around
 the
 world.


But
 what's
 so
 interesting,
 Pokey,
 is


that
 your
 demographic
 must
 have


broadened
 from
 League
 of
 Legends
 out
 to


now
 wanting
 to
 see
 you
 horse
 ride,


talking
 about
 some
 of
 your
 health


stories.
 How
 can
 you
 break
 down
 the


demographics
 and
 who
 it
 is
 in
 your


community?


Absolutely.
 What
 I
 find
 the
 most


interesting
 is
 that
 it
 entirely
 depends


on
 the
 piece
 of
 content
 and
 the


platform.
 So
 on
 Twitch,
 of
 course,
 the


platform
 itself
 is
 maybe
 majority
 men,


sometimes
 younger
 depending
 on
 the
 game


or
 what
 you're
 streaming.
 But
 on
 Tik


Tok,
 a
 lot
 of
 my
 videos
 are
 like


majority
 female.
 I
 do
 get
 readies
 with


me,
 makeup,
 hauls,
 all
 sorts
 of


different
 things.
 And
 I
 really
 adore


that
 because
 it
 allows
 me
 to
 really
 tap


into
 and
 share
 all
 the
 different
 facets


of
 my
 hobbies
 and
 what
 I
 like
 to
 do.
 and


you
 do
 share
 your
 community
 of
 friends.


They
 appear
 with
 you.
 There's
 also


though
 perhaps
 your
 brother
 who
 doesn't


appear
 so
 much
 on
 screen
 and
 you're
 here


in
 LA.
 There
 are
 safety
 concerns
 whether


it's
 in
 real
 life
 or
 whether
 it's
 online


as
 well.
 How
 do
 you
 think
 about
 that
 and


navigate
 it?


Oh
 my,
 it
 really
 depends
 on
 the
 safe
 the


exact
 safety
 concern
 and
 what
 aspect
 it


brings.
 So
 there's
 online
 safety
 and


there's
 also
 in-person
 safety.
 So,
 what


you
 said
 earlier
 about
 IRL
 streaming,
 I


typically
 don't
 IRL
 stream
 in
 LA
 unless


I
 have
 security
 with
 me.
 Um,
 otherwise,


I
 feel
 a
 little
 bit
 better
 streaming
 IRL


in
 other
 countries.
 When
 it
 comes
 to


moderation
 online,
 oh,
 it's
 been
 um


trial
 and
 error
 kind
 of
 situation,


learning
 how
 to
 moderate
 my
 platforms,


how
 to
 feel
 safe
 online,
 how
 to
 make


sure
 my
 community
 feels
 safe.
 So,
 it's


really
 a
 lot
 of
 different
 things.
 Pokei


as
 part
 of
 the
 IRL
 and
 and
 just
 chatting


content.
 Sometimes
 you
 have
 discussed


things
 that
 are
 more
 political
 or


societal
 issues.
 How
 do
 you
 choose
 those


that
 you
 want
 to
 to
 weigh
 in
 on
 and
 and


then
 the
 safety
 piece
 you
 just
 explained


how
 you
 factor
 that
 in?


I
 would
 say
 my
 priority
 for
 starters
 is


of
 course
 speaking
 to
 my
 direct


experiences
 and
 how
 I
 know
 those
 things


affect
 others.
 For
 example,
 the
 safety


issues
 that
 I
 face
 online.
 I'm
 not
 the


only
 one
 and
 it's
 not
 just
 creators.
 Any


woman,
 any
 girl,
 frankly,
 any
 person


online
 can
 be
 victim
 to
 those
 same


safety
 issues.
 So,
 I
 love
 to
 be
 a


spokesperson
 for
 the
 things
 that
 I
 have


direct
 experience
 and
 knowledge
 in.
 And


then
 secondly,
 for
 me,
 political
 topics,


what
 I
 really
 feel
 passionate
 speaking


out
 about
 is
 simply
 just
 human
 rights,


respecting
 other
 people,
 what
 their


rights
 should
 be
 in
 regards
 to
 the


things
 that
 they
 can
 say,
 that
 they
 can


experience,
 that
 they
 can
 share.
 I
 feel


like
 that's
 what
 I
 feel
 comfortable


talking
 about.
 And
 so
 aside
 from
 that,


luckily
 the
 safety
 aspects
 that
 I
 have


in
 place
 right
 now
 allow
 me
 to
 feel


comfortable
 discussing
 anything.


Pokey,
 you've
 made
 a
 career
 of
 this.


Would
 you
 please
 explain
 to
 our


Bloomberg
 Tech
 audience,
 you
 know,
 how


it
 works,
 how
 you
 make
 money
 with
 with


respect,
 if
 you're
 able
 to
 like
 you've


also
 set
 up
 a
 talent
 agency
 for
 create


uh
 content
 creators,
 you
 know,
 how
 big
 a


piece
 is
 that
 for
 you?
 Is
 it
 different


Twitch
 versus
 Instagram
 for
 example?
 So,


your
 streams
 of
 income
 do
 differ
 greatly


depending
 on
 the
 platform.
 I
 would
 say


the
 unique
 thing
 about
 Twitch
 is
 that


there's
 a
 subscription
 model,
 which


means
 as
 opposed
 to
 YouTube
 where
 you


can
 subscribe
 to
 someone
 for
 free
 and


you're
 essentially
 just
 following
 them


like
 you
 follow
 someone
 on
 Instagram.


For
 Twitch,
 when
 you
 subscribe,
 you're


sending
 them
 $5
 every
 month.
 It's
 a


monthly
 subscription
 that
 also
 generates


income.
 But
 for
 me,
 the
 large
 large


large
 large
 majority
 of
 my
 career
 income


has
 come
 just
 from
 sponsorships
 and


contracts.
 And
 then
 probably
 the
 second


largest
 piece
 has
 come
 from
 business


ventures.
 And
 then
 the
 third
 largest


piece
 might
 be
 subscriptions.
 So
 I'd
 say


that's
 the
 unique
 piece
 that
 most
 people


don't
 know
 about
 Twitch.
 But
 for
 IG
 and


most
 other
 platforms,
 it's
 primarily
 ads


and
 sponsors.


We
 could
 talk
 to
 you
 for
 so
 much
 longer


and
 I'm
 very
 pleased
 that
 Ed's
 going
 to


be
 on
 stage
 with
 you.
 Iman
 Anis,
 also


known
 as
 Pokémon
 Man.
 We're
 so
 pleased


that
 she
 joined
 the
 show.
 And
 what
 a


show
 it
 has
 been
 because
 that
 does
 it


for
 this
 edition
 of
 Bloomberg
 Tech.
 But


the
 story
 doesn't
 stop.
 There
 are
 so


many
 people
 going
 to
 be
 on
 stage.
 I've


got
 the
 Foster
 Sisters.
 You've
 got
 a


great


Pokey
 and
 Dan
 from
 Clancy.
 Like
 I
 want


to
 understand
 the
 content
 creator


economy
 so
 much
 more
 because
 as
 we
 just


heard,
 it's
 so
 different.
 And
 then


tomorrow,


do
 not
 miss
 this.
 We're
 going
 all
 in
 on


defense
 technology.
 We
 will
 speak
 with


the
 leaders
 of
 Anderil,
 Palanteer,
 and


many
 other
 leaders
 in
 defense
 tech
 from


Anderil's
 headquarters
 right
 here
 in


California.
 You
 don't
 want
 to
 miss
 it.


There
 is
 a
 lot
 to
 recap
 from
 the
 last


hour.
 Check
 out
 the
 pod.
 Loads
 of
 you


are
 listening
 to
 it.
 Super
 grateful
 for


the
 feedback
 we've
 had.
 Listen
 on
 Apple,


Spotify,
 iHeart,
 and
 the
 Bloomberg


platforms.
 Car,
 take
 us
 out.


I
 mean,
 what
 an
 amazing
 array
 we
 can
 do


right
 here
 in
 Los
 Angeles
 in
 the
 world


of
 content
 creation
 to
 the
 world
 of


defense
 tech.
 There's
 a
 lot
 to
 be
 had.


Yeah,
 this
 is
 Los
 Angeles
 and
 Bloomberg


screen
 time.
 This
 is
 Bloomberg
 Tech.
