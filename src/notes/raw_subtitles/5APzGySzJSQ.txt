[Music]


Hi
 everyone,
 I'm
 Nicolola
 Tangan,
 the


CEO
 of
 the
 Norwegian
 Southern
 Wealth


Fund.
 And
 today
 I'm
 in
 really
 good


company
 with
 super
 agent
 and
 media
 mogul


Ariel
 Emanuel.
 He's
 represented
 some
 of


the
 biggest
 names
 in
 Hollywood
 and
 he's


now
 the
 owner
 of
 companies
 such
 as
 UFC


and
 WWE.
 Ari,
 warm
 welcome.


>> Hi.
 Hi.
 How
 are
 you
 doing?
 So,
 how
 long


has
 this
 been
 since
 you
 started
 doing


this
 and
 why?


>> It's
 like
 3
 years.


>> You
 think
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 an
 interview


you
 to
 me?
 I'm
 going to
 interview
 you.


>> Let's
 see
 how
 it
 goes.
 Let's
 see
 how
 it


goes.
 So
 Ari,
 when
 I
 was
 researching


this,
 I
 was
 just
 astonished
 about
 how


many
 things
 you
 do.
 So
 just
 in
 brief,


what
 do
 you
 do?


>> You
 know,
 um
 I
 started
 out
 almost
 over


30
 years
 ago
 representing
 writers,


writer,
 director,
 actors,


then
 had
 a
 vision
 for
 where


entertainment
 was
 going.
 Started
 uh
 you


know,
 merged
 quote
 unquote
 with
 William


Morris.


um
 and
 then
 bought
 IMG
 and
 then
 realized


half
 my
 life
 was
 representation,
 half
 my


life
 was
 ownership.
 um
 almost
 like
 I


mean
 I
 don't
 know
 what
 your
 inves
 I
 know


that
 you're
 one
 of the
 largest
 investors


in
 the
 world
 of
 every
 single
 country
 and


every
 single
 company
 but
 we
 realized


when
 we
 were
 in
 the
 representation


business
 of
 entertainment
 and


entertainment
 c
 takes
 from
 podcast
 to


owning
 sports
 events
 music
 writer
 direct


ex
 everything


we
 could
 look
 at
 companies
 that
 we


represented
 or
 people
 or
 things
 and
 then


we
 could
 move
 them
 the
 thought
 process


to
 an
 ownership
 position


>> because
 we
 could
 extract
 greater
 value


because
 we
 were
 global.
 And
 if
 if
 a


company
 was
 localized
 but
 had
 a
 global


possibility,
 we
 could
 extract
 a
 great


deal
 of
 value.


>> And
 as
 we're
 negotiating
 deals
 between


IMG,
 negotiating
 all
 sports
 rights
 on
 an


international
 basis.
 We
 added
 we
 added


content
 to
 that
 and
 then
 we
 got
 out
 we


sold
 that
 business
 for
 a
 billion


dollars.
 We
 had
 a
 we
 had
 we
 had
 a
 very


big
 playing
 field
 and
 so
 we
 um
 just


started
 moving
 stuff
 to
 ownership
 from


live
 events
 to
 sports.
 So
 we
 represented


the
 WWE,
 we
 represented
 UFC,
 we


represented
 bull
 riding
 and
 we
 realized,


you
 know,
 if
 we
 got
 involved,
 we
 could


make
 all
 the
 broadcast
 deals,
 we
 could


do
 all
 the,
 you
 know,
 marketing
 deals,


um
 and
 then
 we
 could
 extract
 more
 value


with
 site
 fees
 and
 all
 the
 other
 tricks


that
 we
 have.
 And
 so
 we
 bought
 them
 and


people
 thought
 at
 the
 time
 we
 were
 crazy


with
 IMG
 and
 then
 they
 thought
 we
 were


crazy
 with
 the
 UFC
 and
 it
 turned
 out
 we


made
 the
 right
 position
 and
 then
 we


merged
 it
 and
 we
 just
 are
 on
 the
 field
 a


lot.
 So
 we
 get
 to
 kind
 of
 move
 things


around.
 So
 all
 right
 we're
 going
 to
 kind


of
 unpack
 uh
 one
 thing
 after
 the
 other


here
 but
 let's
 let's
 kick
 off
 at
 the


beginning
 with
 the
 endeavor.
 So
 you


started
 in
 creative
 artist
 agency
 and


how
 did
 they
 get
 the
 job?
 you
 I
 I
 gather


you
 cold
 called
 him
 quite
 a
 lot
 of
 times


>> way
 way
 way
 before
 that.
 Uh
 I
 started
 in


New
 York
 with
 a
 old
 with
 a
 kind
 of
 guy


in
 the
 theater
 business
 by
 the
 name
 of


Robbie
 Lance.


After
 six
 months
 I
 realized
 kind
 of
 the


business.
 I
 had
 just
 moved
 back
 from


Europe
 where
 I
 had
 been
 playing
 around.


My
 father
 told
 me
 to
 come
 back.
 He
 was


cutting
 off
 my
 bank
 account
 and
 I
 went


into
 the
 mail
 room
 and
 I
 was
 making
 15


cents
 a
 mile.
 M


>> that's
 how
 I
 made
 my
 living
 dropping
 in


the
 mail
 room
 dropping
 packages
 off


became
 an
 agent
 and
 then
 I
 went
 to
 this


company
 Inner
 Talent
 which
 was
 a
 small


boutique
 that
 had
 started
 as
 a
 spin-off


of
 some
 of
 the
 big
 guys


after
 three
 years
 I
 think
 it
 was
 they


sold
 they
 broke
 the
 company
 up
 and
 I


went
 to
 this
 company
 called
 ICM
 which


recently
 CA
 bought


>> and
 a
 crazy
 thing
 happened
 I
 got
 hit
 by


a
 car
 and
 I
 realized
 life
 was
 not
 a


dress
 rehearsal
 you
 know
 you
 can't
 just


sit
 around
 and
 think
 it's
 going
 to
 it's


going
 to
 figure
 itself
 out.
 So
 I
 just


after
 18
 months
 of
 surgery,
 rehab,


surgery.


Um
 I
 said
 I
 want
 to,
 you
 know,
 be
 on
 my


own
 and
 go
 for
 it.
 And
 so
 we
 started


this
 company
 called
 Endeavor
 in
 1995
 on


my
 birthday,
 March
 29th.


>> Who
 was
 your
 first
 client?


>> It's
 between
 Amy
 Litman,
 I
 think
 it
 was


Amy
 Litman
 and
 Greg
 Daniels.
 And
 then


there
 was
 a
 bunch
 of
 others.


>> Why
 did
 they
 choose
 you?
 Um,


I
 don't
 think
 they
 wanted
 me
 to
 keep
 on


calling
 them
 to
 beat
 them
 up
 to
 sign


with
 me,
 so
 they
 just
 gave
 in.


>> What's
 the
 most
 times
 you
 called
 a


client
 to
 get
 them
 on
 board?


>> To
 get
 them
 to
 sign
 with
 me?
 I
 think
 it


was
 probably
 Larry
 David
 way
 back
 in
 the


day.
 I
 I
 don't
 know.
 It
 was
 It
 was


unrelenting.
 I
 felt
 really
 bad
 for
 him.


And
 I
 kind
 of
 said
 it
 to
 him.
 I
 think
 I


said,
 "I
 feel
 bad
 for
 you.
 Here's
 what's


going
 to
 happen."
 I
 don't
 embarrass


easily,
 so
 it
 doesn't
 really
 matter.


>> What's
 the
 key
 to
 cold
 calling?


>> You
 know,
 if
 I
 believe,
 like
 when
 I
 saw


the
 UFC
 that
 there
 was
 more
 value
 that


could
 be
 created,
 if
 I
 if
 I'm
 looking
 at


a
 client
 that
 I
 don't
 think
 is
 being


handled
 properly,


um
 I
 I
 will
 just
 pound
 on
 that
 issue
 uh


until
 they
 realize
 because
 eventually


they're
 going
 to
 realize
 I'm
 right.
 Um
 I


I
 believe
 I
 start
 the
 conversation


usually
 with
 something
 like
 are
 you


happy


and
 then
 and
 I
 know
 where
 I
 I
 believe


after
 analyzing
 say
 where
 the
 trigger


points
 are
 and
 then
 I
 just
 pound
 away.


>> What
 does
 an
 agent
 do
 for
 a
 client?


>> Well,
 in
 this
 day
 and
 age
 because


there's
 so
 much
 distribution
 and
 there's


depending
 on
 the
 client
 like
 all
 clients


are
 different.
 Music
 clients
 are


different
 than
 actors,
 actors
 are


different
 than
 directors.
 But
 if
 you're


talking
 about
 a
 a
 writer
 creator
 in
 the


television
 space,
 you
 have
 multiple


players
 going
 on.
 How
 you
 tell
 them
 what


properties
 to
 buy
 to
 write
 or
 create
 on


their
 own
 and
 then
 packaging
 them


together.
 You're
 putting
 together
 kind


of
 a
 package
 to
 go
 out
 to
 the


marketplace.
 It
 used
 to
 be
 that
 the


studios


would
 be
 the
 composer
 of
 the
 content.


It's
 now
 moved
 to
 the
 agent.
 And
 I


always
 say
 to
 the
 people
 here,
 ideas


matter
 more
 than
 ever
 right
 now
 as
 an


agent
 because
 you
 have
 to
 you
 you
 have


to
 be
 full
 service.
 And
 what
 we've


attempted
 to
 do
 by
 all
 the
 companies


we've
 bought
 and
 put
 together
 is
 be
 a


fullervice
 agency
 whether
 it
 be


licensing,
 marketing,
 books,
 p
 all


actors.
 how
 you
 put
 things
 together
 for


a
 director,
 an
 actor,
 a
 writer
 happens


inside
 our
 doors
 now
 more
 than
 it
 does


at
 the
 Sony's,
 at
 the
 Netflix,
 at
 the


Paramounts.


>> And
 what's
 the
 key
 to
 maintaining
 a
 good


relationship
 with
 a
 client?


>> You
 you
 actually
 have
 to
 be
 their


partner,
 not
 their
 representative.
 you


actually
 have
 to
 be
 their
 business


partner
 and
 think
 about
 the
 world
 and


where
 the
 possibilities
 and
 um
 you
 know


you
 know
 it
 there's
 bad
 things
 happen


you
 have
 to
 have
 an
 agent
 I
 believe
 that


is
 willing
 and
 I
 hope
 we've
 taught
 this


to
 have
 endurance


um
 and
 take
 the
 failures
 and
 kind
 of


think
 through
 all
 the
 different
 possib


teams
 together
 to
 help
 you
 think
 through


things
 um
 I
 think
 we've
 done
 that
 here


Um,
 not
 always
 great,
 but
 usually
 pretty


good.
 Um,
 and
 I
 think
 that's
 the


requirement
 for
 whether
 it
 be
 a
 music


client,
 a
 social
 media
 client,
 you
 know,


uh,
 a
 book,
 uh,
 an
 author,
 a
 actor,
 a


director,
 everything.


>> You
 are
 known
 as
 one
 of
 my
 Hollywood's


toughest
 negotiators.
 Why
 do
 you
 think


that
 is?


>> Well,
 I'm
 just
 I,
 you
 know,
 I'm
 not


going
 to
 roll
 over
 because


somebody
 thinks,
 you
 know,
 somebody's


more
 powerful
 or
 whatever.
 I'm
 not
 sure


I'm
 the
 toughest
 negotiator.
 I
 just
 have


a
 point
 of
 view
 on
 something
 and
 I'll


stick
 to
 my
 guns.
 First
 of
 all,
 I
 don't


have
 to
 I
 don't
 when
 I
 I
 think
 when
 I


negotiate,
 I
 don't
 have
 to
 have
 all
 the


chips
 off
 the
 table.
 Um,
 but
 I
 do
 have


to
 I
 think
 there's
 this
 line


there
 was
 this
 old
 uh
 lawyer
 at
 Warner


Brothers
 in
 my
 first
 deal.
 And
 he
 told


me
 um
 and
 I
 said
 to
 him
 in
 the
 middle
 of


the
 negotiation,
 the
 head
 of
 CA,
 Bill


Haber,
 gave
 me
 a
 a
 property
 to
 negotiate


for
 him,
 an
 underlying
 right.
 And
 he
 and


I
 told
 him
 in
 the
 middle
 of
 the


negotiation,
 I
 said,
 "This
 is
 not
 fair."


And
 he
 was
 the
 senior
 lawyer
 at
 Warner


Brothers.
 And
 he
 told
 me
 to
 drive
 over


to
 Warner
 Brothers.
 And
 I
 did.
 And
 he
 I


walk
 in.
 I
 said,
 "Mr.
 Stleness,
 hi,
 I'm


Ari
 Emanuel."


And
 he
 said,
 "Son,
 fair
 is
 where
 we
 end


up."


and
 he
 said,
 "Leave
 my
 office."
 And
 so,


you
 know,
 in
 all
 these
 negotiations,
 I


just
 always
 say
 to
 the
 people,
 fair
 is


where
 we're
 going
 to
 end
 up.
 I
 might
 not


be
 completely
 happy,
 you
 might
 not
 be


completely
 happy,
 but
 it
 is
 the
 right


number.


>> If
 you
 were
 to
 give
 them
 the
 listeners


like
 a
 20
 second
 crash
 course
 in


negotiation,
 what
 would
 you
 what
 would


you
 include?


>> One
 is
 you've
 you've
 got
 to
 keep
 the


negotiation
 within
 the
 you
 know,
 you


don't
 go
 out
 of
 the
 you
 don't
 negotiate


in
 public.
 you
 respect
 your
 negotiator,


you're
 tough
 and
 you
 kind,
 you
 know,
 but


you
 um
 you
 negotiate
 inside
 the
 rooms.


You
 don't
 kind
 of
 and
 every
 negotiation


is
 different.


>> There's
 not
 one
 negotiation,
 there's
 not


one
 principle
 uh
 to
 a
 negotiation.


Sometimes
 there's
 only
 one
 buyer.
 You


you
 you
 you
 struck
 out,
 you
 have
 to
 get


a
 deal
 done
 and
 you
 close.
 Sometimes


there's
 multiple
 buyers
 and
 you
 you
 drag


it
 out
 as
 long
 as
 you
 can
 to
 get
 the


highest
 price.
 M


>> um
 so
 you
 just
 have
 to
 recognize
 the


environment
 and
 the
 situation
 you're
 in.


I
 think
 everybody
 does
 the
 same
 thing.


You
 know,
 you
 have
 to
 be
 honorable.
 You


have
 to
 keep
 your
 word
 whenever
 you're


negotiating.
 It's
 not
 your
 last
 deal
 if


you're
 talented.


>> And
 so
 you
 you
 know,
 your
 word,
 your


negotiation
 with
 that
 person
 is
 actually


important
 because
 that
 reputation
 kind


of
 precedes
 you
 and
 follows
 you.
 So


>> you
 once
 said
 that
 agents
 are
 like


cockroaches.


>> Yeah.


>> What
 did
 you
 mean
 by
 that?
 meaning
 you


can't
 kill
 us.
 We're
 going
 to
 be
 around


in
 this
 business
 forever.


>> Uh,
 as
 much
 as
 people
 have
 tried
 to


disintermediate
 agents,
 um,
 when
 I
 think


I
 started
 in
 the
 business,
 we
 were
 just


in
 the
 television
 business
 and
 a
 little


bit
 of
 motion
 picture
 business.
 Now


we're
 in


Instagram,
 people,
 podcasts.
 We're
 in
 so


many
 different
 areas
 and
 the
 agency


business
 has
 constantly
 adapted
 and
 and


kind
 of
 transformed
 itself
 in
 what
 is


required
 to
 be
 a
 good
 agent
 and


representation.
 You
 got
 to
 have


marketing
 in
 there.
 You
 got
 to
 have


books
 in
 there.
 You
 got
 to
 have
 license


and
 merchandising
 in
 there.
 And
 you


know,
 you
 you
 just
 constantly
 are


adapting
 your
 skill
 set
 um
 the
 agency
 at


large
 to
 actually
 perform
 the
 best
 for


the
 clients.
 And
 I
 don't
 think
 a
 lot
 of


agencies
 have
 done
 that.
 That's
 why
 they


haven't
 survived.
 Uh
 we
 have
 done
 that.


Um
 and
 I
 think
 that's
 why
 we're


thriving.


>> Many
 uh
 many
 would
 have
 seen
 the
 um
 the


series
 Andrew
 Rash
 which
 is
 loosely


based
 on
 you
 I
 believe.
 How
 how
 spot-on


is
 that?


>> In
 my
 early
 days
 it
 was
 I'm
 sad
 to
 say


too
 spot
 on.
 Um
 but
 um
 I've
 mellowed.


So
 yeah,
 I
 mean
 in
 the
 early
 days
 of


remember
 when
 I
 started
 the
 business,


you
 had
 four


No,
 you
 had
 Yeah.
 You
 had
 four
 big


agencies
 against
 us
 and
 you
 you
 weren't


you
 there
 was
 no
 price
 differential
 that


could
 distinguish
 you.
 It
 was
 all
 the


same
 price.
 So
 you
 know
 I
 was
 um


difficult.


>> Well,


>> I'm
 a
 lot
 nicer
 now.


>> Why
 is
 that?


>> You
 know,


success.
 I
 don't
 have
 to
 constantly
 be


fighting
 battles.
 Um
 the
 employees
 are


doing
 a
 lot
 of
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 heavy


lifting
 that
 I
 used
 to
 do
 by
 myself.
 Um


and
 with
 others
 and
 um
 yeah,
 taking
 on
 a


lot
 of
 the
 battles
 that
 I
 don't
 have
 to


take
 on
 makes
 life
 a
 little
 bit
 easier.


And
 also
 my
 clients
 have
 reached
 a


stature
 that
 it's
 a
 lot
 easier
 to
 to
 to


move
 their
 careers
 around.
 And
 I
 have
 I


think
 and
 you'll
 have
 to
 just
 ask
 the


buyers.
 I've
 lived
 by
 my
 reputation
 and


how
 I
 negotiate
 and


>> All right,
 moving
 on
 to
 sports.
 So
 in


2016
 you
 bought
 UFC.


>> Yes.


>> Was
 that
 a
 strategic
 transaction
 or
 an


opportunistic
 opportunity
 that
 just
 came


by?


>> Well,
 we
 had
 bought
 before
 that
 uh
 PBR.


we
 had
 proven
 that
 we
 could
 buy
 an
 a
 a


company
 in
 the
 sports
 area
 and
 resurrect


it.
 Um


I
 think
 Silverlake
 would
 say
 as
 they


thought
 about
 it,
 we
 negotiate
 every


deal
 with
 networks
 on
 behalf
 of
 packages


etc.
 We
 do
 in
 at
 that
 time
 we
 did


internationally
 all
 the
 sports
 rights.


We
 knew
 how
 to
 handle
 uh
 UFC


internationally
 in
 the
 value.
 We


represented
 him
 and
 had
 already


negotiated
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 broadcast
 deals


by
 owning
 it,
 running
 it
 properly.
 Um
 we


could
 get
 90%
 of
 the
 value
 um
 as
 opposed


to
 10%
 of
 the
 value.


>> When
 would
 you
 say
 that
 when
 did
 you
 say


a
 combat
 sport
 got
 into
 the
 mainstream?


Well,
 I
 was
 just
 looking
 at
 the
 numbers


and
 looking
 where
 sports
 was
 going
 to
 go


and
 where
 I
 thought
 the
 distribution


model
 was
 going
 and
 the
 requirement
 for


ESVOD
 and
 Avod
 and


I
 did
 my
 calculation
 that
 Fox
 had
 to


have
 the
 product
 based
 on
 where
 they


were
 going
 with
 their
 business
 from
 the


RSNs
 and
 etc.
 I
 didn't
 realize
 that
 they


were
 going
 to
 sell,
 that
 RER
 was
 going


to
 sell,
 but
 I
 did
 did
 realize
 where,


you
 know,
 the
 marketplace
 was
 going
 with


regard
 to
 streaming
 and
 sports
 has


always
 been
 a
 huge
 driver
 in
 that
 space.


>> And
 there's
 not
 a
 lot
 of
 sports
 to
 own.


Um
 and
 I
 thought
 between
 international


distribution,
 sponsorship,


site
 fees,
 all
 the
 things
 that
 we
 did,


production
 where
 we
 had
 global


production
 facility
 in
 London
 and
 five


different
 locations,
 we
 could
 take
 a
 lot


of
 costs
 out
 and
 add
 a
 lot
 of
 value


>> and
 it
 it
 rang
 true
 and
 we
 just
 let
 I


mean
 we
 I
 had
 I
 have
 one
 of
 the
 great


partners
 in
 Dana
 White
 who
 could


continue
 to
 do
 what
 he
 needed
 to
 do
 and


I
 would
 do
 the
 business
 side
 with
 Mark


Shapiro.
 everyone
 and
 and
 if
 we
 had
 that


combination,
 it
 was
 going
 to
 be
 a
 lethal


combination.


>> Why
 is
 it
 a
 good
 business
 to
 open?
 What


what
 are
 the
 characteristics
 with
 that


particular
 business?


>> One
 is


>> with
 that
 particular
 sport.


>> Yeah.
 One
 is
 um


it's
 a
 sport
 that
 happens
 over
 um
 one


day,
 six
 hours.
 The
 demographics
 are


four
 quadrants.
 Young
 men,
 older
 men,


women
 now.
 I
 mean,
 it's
 it's
 a
 and
 it's


global
 and
 it's
 very
 the
 the
 fights
 are


15
 minutes
 or
 25
 minutes.
 They're


action-packed.
 They're
 great
 for
 social.


Um,
 we're
 in
 every
 country
 in
 the
 world


with
 our
 fighters.
 It
 was
 the
 dominant


player
 in
 that
 sport.
 And
 so,
 um,
 and
 I


just
 thought
 it
 had
 bigger
 and
 bigger


upside
 because
 people
 want
 big
 events,


um,
 on
 a
 weekly
 basis.
 And,
 you
 know,
 it


turned
 out
 to
 be
 true.
 You're
 going
 to


have
 an
 event
 in
 the
 White
 House,
 I


think,
 next
 year.


>> Yeah,
 in
 June.
 I
 think
 it
 got
 announced,


the
 president
 announced
 it
 last
 week.


>> I
 don't
 know
 when
 this
 is
 airing,
 but


yes.


>> Tell
 me
 about
 the
 the
 links
 between


politics
 and
 uh
 martial
 art.


>> Well,
 you
 that
 that
 that
 you
 have
 to


actually
 talk
 to
 my
 partner
 Dana
 White.


Uh
 I
 have
 a
 I
 you
 know,
 I
 represented


the
 president
 for
 seven,
 nine
 years
 in


his
 days
 on
 NBC.
 Um,
 he
 had
 an


incredible
 relationship
 with
 Dana
 when


the
 UFC
 started.
 He
 was
 the
 first
 one
 in


Atlantic
 City
 to
 put
 the
 UFC
 on
 when


nobody
 would
 do
 it
 and
 they
 were
 calling


it
 fighting.
 And
 um,
 they've


maintained
 an
 incredible
 relationship.


And
 um
 when
 the
 president
 was
 running


for
 the
 second
 time,
 Dana
 helped
 him
 out


with
 his
 his
 his
 strategy
 uh
 in
 social


and
 was
 very
 helpful
 and
 has
 been


helpful
 for
 the
 president
 for
 a
 long


time.


>> Do
 you
 think
 politics
 is
 increasingly
 uh


becoming
 a
 bit
 more
 like
 combat
 sport?


>> I
 would
 say
 the
 following.
 I
 hope
 not.


uh


uh
 going
 to
 this
 Charlie
 Kirk
 situation,


I
 hope
 that
 um


this
 is
 a
 kind
 of
 watershed
 moment
 where


people
 realize
 this
 is
 a
 very
 bad
 path


for
 the
 United
 States
 and
 for
 the
 world.


I
 think
 it's
 all
 over
 the
 world.
 There's


a
 very
 combative
 um
 situation
 in


politics.
 Um


but
 uh
 I
 hope
 nobody
 gets
 choked
 out
 in


politics.
 I
 just
 hope
 we
 kind
 of
 kind
 of


realign
 our
 thinking.


>> So,
 um


>> I
 mean
 that
 I
 think
 as
 Bill
 Maher
 said,


it's
 very
 important


uh
 to
 talk
 to
 everybody
 and
 I
 agree
 with


that


>> because
 you
 have
 to
 have
 you
 have
 to


understand
 them
 and
 you
 have
 to
 be
 able


to
 express
 your
 opinion
 so
 that
 there


can
 be
 a
 there
 can
 be
 a
 middle
 ground.


Uh,
 it's
 like
 any
 negotiation
 as
 I
 said


to
 you.
 You
 have
 to
 you
 can't
 take


everything
 off
 the
 table.


>> No.


>> They
 have
 to
 win
 some.
 You
 have
 to
 win


some.


>> Then
 you
 bought
 WWE.


>> No,
 we
 merged.


>> Well,
 we
 merged.
 No,
 you
 were
 I
 believe


I
 be
 I
 believe
 you
 were
 a
 wrestler
 uh
 in


you
 know
 in
 your
 early
 years.
 Is
 that
 is


that
 why
 you
 begin
 to
 buy
 it
 or


>> No,
 I
 also
 I
 represented
 um
 Vince
 in
 the


WWE
 for
 a
 long
 long
 time
 at
 Endeavor
 and


then
 um
 we
 didn't
 go
 public
 at
 the
 like


uh
 in
 um
 I
 want
 to
 say
 19.
 I
 had


approached
 Vince
 with
 uh
 my
 partner
 at


Silverlake
 Egon
 Durban
 to
 kind
 of
 pull


the
 UFC
 out
 and
 merge
 it
 with
 the
 WWE


and
 create
 one
 entity
 and
 we
 would
 like


we
 have
 now
 be
 private
 with
 Endeavor.


Vince
 because
 we
 were
 just
 getting
 into


co
 I
 think
 it
 was
 in
 200
 I
 don't


remember
 2020
 2021
 something
 like
 that.


Vince
 didn't
 want
 to
 do
 it.
 We
 then


retook
 Endeavor
 out
 with
 all
 of
 the
 the


first
 time
 we
 went
 out,
 we
 only
 had
 51%


of
 the
 UFC
 with
 we
 had
 negotiated
 a
 deal


that
 KKR
 and
 and
 Silverlake
 would
 roll


their
 their
 portion
 of
 it
 in.
 We
 went


public.
 The
 market
 never
 really


understood
 what
 I
 was
 trying
 to
 express


that
 we
 cover
 every
 aspect
 of


entertainment
 from
 sports
 to
 social
 to


books.
 That
 conglomerate
 conversation


never
 happened.
 We
 kept
 on
 selling
 off


pieces.


>> We
 sold
 off
 our
 academy.
 We
 sold
 off
 our


production
 company.
 They
 just
 never
 got.


And
 so,
 you
 know,
 we
 looked
 around


after,
 you
 know,
 significant
 time
 and


other
 representative
 businesses
 were


getting
 valuations
 of
 $7
 billion.
 And


this
 doesn't
 make
 sense.
 And
 that's,
 you


know,
 it
 the
 pure
 play
 was
 the
 right


thing
 for
 the
 UFC
 and
 the
 WWE
 in
 bull


riding.
 We
 first
 started
 out
 with
 just


UFC
 and
 WWE.


Vince
 under
 circumstances
 had
 to
 leave.


We
 then
 realized
 here's
 the
 here's
 the


remaining
 portion
 of
 what
 sports
 is


which
 is
 distribution
 production


um
 premium
 ticketing
 with
 on
 location


and
 we
 rolled
 in
 our
 last
 sport
 PBR
 and


that
 is
 a
 pure
 play
 sports
 entity
 um
 uh


in
 TKO
 and
 the
 rest
 is
 the


representation
 business
 and
 and
 that's


actually
 private.
 So
 now
 you
 have


something
 like
 350
 events
 per
 year
 and


is
 it
 close
 to
 a
 billion
 viewers?


>> A
 lot
 of
 viewers
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 events.


>> Are
 there
 any
 challenges
 to
 having


choreographed
 and
 non-coreographed


content
 in
 the
 same
 company?


>> One
 sports
 entertainment
 and
 this
 past


weekend
 I
 don't
 know
 when
 this
 again


when
 this
 is
 going
 to
 air.
 We
 had
 our


launch


for
 uh
 uh
 Russell
 Palooa
 in
 Indianapolis


with
 ESPN.
 And
 ESPN
 realizes
 when
 you
 go


to
 one
 of
 these
 live
 events
 or
 you
 watch


it,
 it's
 uh
 sports
 entertainment


>> and
 it
 is
 definitely,
 you
 know,


competitive.
 Um
 it
 is
 entertainment.
 So


there,
 you
 know,
 but
 um
 the
 fan
 base
 is


incredible.
 It's
 again
 like
 the
 UFC,


it's
 global
 and
 it's
 it's
 it's
 it's
 it's


a
 blast
 uh
 to
 see.
 you
 um
 have
 said
 in


the
 past
 that
 um
 you'd
 love
 to
 go
 into


boxing
 and
 then
 you
 had
 the
 Ali
 Act


which
 was
 kind
 of
 protecting
 the
 boxers


and
 now
 you
 have
 people
 who
 come
 out
 and


say
 that
 they
 want
 to
 update
 the
 act
 and


so
 now
 you
 are
 going
 into
 boxing
 right?


>> Well
 we
 had
 an
 event
 two
 weekends
 ago
 at


Allegian
 uh
 Stadium
 where
 the
 Raiders


play


um
 and
 uh
 there
 was
 70,000
 people
 in
 the


arena.
 We
 had
 one
 of the
 great
 on


Netflix,
 one
 of
 the
 great
 boxing
 events


ever.
 Actually,
 in
 Alleion,
 I
 think
 the


records
 are
 with
 WWE
 and
 our
 boxing


match
 for
 um
 live
 events.
 It
 was
 crazy.


It
 was
 It
 was
 incredible.
 Um,
 we
 are
 in


the
 middle
 of
 kind
 of
 seeing
 if
 we
 can


work
 with
 the
 administration
 and


Congress
 about
 um
 kind
 of
 having
 having


an
 addendum
 to
 the
 Ali
 Act,
 which
 I


think
 is
 better
 for
 the
 boxers


health-wise,
 moneywise,
 etc.
 Creating
 an


opportunity
 like
 we
 have
 with
 the
 UFC.


And
 um
 if
 if
 everything
 works
 out,
 we'll


boxing
 is
 an
 area
 that
 we're
 looking
 at.


We're
 also
 in
 jiu-jitsu.
 Um,
 so
 we
 will


cover
 the
 full
 spectrum
 of
 um
 of
 uh


combat
 sports.


>> How
 how
 large
 could
 book boxing
 be
 for


you?


>> I
 you
 know
 the
 funny
 thing
 is


we
 again
 we
 have
 Nick
 Khan
 and
 Dana


White
 and
 Hunter
 Camp.
 We
 have
 a
 great


team
 led
 by
 uh
 Dana
 and
 and
 Nick
 Khan.


Uh
 we
 have a
 good
 partner
 in
 in
 the


Saudis.
 Um,
 and
 you
 see
 how
 big
 I
 mean
 I


think
 on
 the
 event
 we
 had
 two
 weekends


ago
 I
 think
 there
 was
 25
 million


consecutive
 streams
 on
 Netflix.
 I
 don't


remember
 how
 many
 globally.
 It
 was
 a


significant
 number.
 Boxing
 has
 been


around
 for
 hundreds
 of
 years.
 I
 mean
 UFC


has
 been
 around
 for
 over
 30
 but
 you
 know


not
 and
 there's
 an
 understanding
 of
 it.


If
 we
 can
 bring
 it
 back
 to
 the
 glory


days
 and
 Dana
 and
 Nick
 can
 create
 the


stars
 behind
 it,
 it
 can
 be
 as
 big
 as
 any


of
 our
 other
 assets.


>> You
 nearly
 bought
 Formula
 1
 at
 one


point,
 I
 believe.


>> You
 know,
 when
 we
 So,
 before
 the
 TKO


merger,
 um,
 we
 had
 been
 working
 on
 uh


CBC
 in
 the
 UK.
 they
 had
 owned
 it
 at
 the


time


uh
 to
 buy
 it
 because
 they
 were
 you
 know


they
 it
 had
 run
 its
 cycle
 and
 uh
 Egon


real
 we
 had
 just
 bought
 three
 months


before
 the
 UFC


and
 you
 know
 it
 was
 a
 910
 billion
 chunk.


We
 had
 not
 gone
 into
 our
 execution
 of


the
 broadcast
 strategy
 yet
 and
 we
 had
 we


were
 starting
 to
 cut
 costs
 and
 do
 all


the
 things
 that
 we
 were
 doing.
 And
 I


just
 think
 it
 was
 um


we
 you
 got
 to
 remember
 also,
 you
 know,


you
 had
 Brexit
 so
 we
 had
 a
 banking


issue.
 We
 didn't
 have
 a
 relationship


with
 you
 so
 we
 could
 get
 infinite
 money.


Um,
 and
 uh,
 I
 think
 it
 was
 just
 a
 little


bit
 kind
 of
 thought
 through,
 hard
 to


kind
 of
 get,
 you
 know,
 I
 think
 looking


back
 and
 we
 both
 looked
 at
 each
 other,


we're
 probably
 going
 to
 regret
 this,
 you


know,
 regardless,
 we've
 done
 very
 well.


>> If
 you
 could
 buy
 another
 sport,
 what


would
 it
 be?


>> Well,
 first
 of
 all,
 I
 I
 I'm
 not
 thinking


about
 that
 right
 now.
 I
 mean,
 we
 have
 to


execute
 on
 everything
 we
 have
 now.
 We


have
 to
 uh
 get
 jiu-jitsu
 up
 on
 its
 feet.


We
 got
 to
 continue
 to
 execute
 slowly
 our


boxing
 strategy.
 Um
 there's
 a
 lot
 on
 our


plate.
 Um
 we've
 just
 finished
 the


majority
 of
 the
 broadcast
 deals


domestically,
 internationally.
 Things


come
 up
 um
 every
 year.
 So
 we
 got
 we


still
 got
 integration,
 you
 know,
 with


the
 WWE
 and
 UFC
 savings
 that
 we
 have
 to


get
 to.
 You
 know,
 I
 got
 a
 full
 I
 got
 a
 I


got
 a
 big
 plate.
 So,
 um
 I
 appreciate
 you


me
 wanting
 to
 kind
 of
 keep
 on
 going,
 but


if
 I
 just
 do
 what
 I'm
 doing,
 it's
 going


to
 be
 a
 really
 it's
 a
 great
 business.


>> Philosophically,
 how
 is
 um
 how
 is
 the


way
 people
 consume
 and
 think
 about


sports
 changing?
 How
 how
 how
 do
 you
 see


this
 in
 10
 10
 years?
 you
 know,
 you
 have


to
 you
 have
 to
 have
 a
 to
 keep
 it
 young,


you
 have
 to
 have
 a
 really
 thoughtout


social
 strategy


uh
 with
 your
 fighters,
 with
 your
 sport.


Um
 to
 keep
 the
 demo
 young
 and
 I
 think
 we


have
 some
 of
 the
 youngest
 demos
 in
 the


business
 in
 across
 our
 platforms.
 You


then
 have
 to
 be
 on
 your
 distributors


domestically,
 internationally
 about


their
 marketing
 strategy.
 And
 then
 you


have
 to
 kind
 of
 with
 your
 sponsors,
 you


have
 to
 do
 integrations
 with
 them
 uh


appropriately
 for
 your
 sports
 as
 the


events
 come
 up.
 And
 if
 you
 do
 all
 three


of
 those
 properly,
 then
 you
 know,
 you


can
 have
 a
 pretty
 successful


uh
 uh
 business.
 And
 we're
 in
 a
 enviable


position.
 We
 have
 very
 young
 sports
 and


they're
 consumable
 on
 this
 thing.
 You


know,
 you
 can
 have
 a
 knockout.


Boom.
 So,
 Ari,
 how
 do
 you
 when
 you
 do
 a


deal,
 how
 do
 you
 do
 the
 research?
 How


much
 is
 analysis
 and
 how
 much
 is
 gut


feel?


>> No,
 no,
 no.


when
 like
 when
 we
 presented
 the
 WWE
 or


the
 UFC
 when
 we're
 taking
 our
 rights
 out


for
 market,
 we
 have
 a
 whole
 research


team
 um
 that
 does
 here's
 our
 demo


like
 on
 Netflix
 or
 on
 Amazon
 or
 on


Apple.
 Here's
 who
 you're
 not
 touching.


Here's
 the
 people
 that
 want
 to
 sign
 up


for
 your
 place
 and
 if
 you
 get
 them,


here's
 how
 much
 we
 believe.
 We
 do
 a


huge,
 you
 know,
 100page
 decks
 about
 um


the
 value
 creation
 by
 being
 in
 business


with
 our
 assets
 are
 like
 the
 NFL
 does,


the
 NBA
 does,
 etc.
 And
 um
 yeah,
 I
 mean


that
 was
 you
 you
 don't
 go
 into
 these


things
 like
 where
 do
 you
 think
 the
 wins?


No,
 there's
 a
 huge
 presentation
 and
 then


you
 know
 because
 each
 one
 of
 them
 has
 a


different
 strategy.
 With
 the
 WWE
 and


ESPN,
 they
 wanted
 a
 big
 launch.
 They


needed
 another
 thing
 to
 kind
 of
 drive


people
 into
 their
 new
 service.
 Netflix


wanted
 to
 get
 to
 an
 advertising
 base.


Each
 one
 of
 them
 have
 different


reasoning
 for
 what
 why
 they
 want
 an


asset
 and
 so
 you
 have
 to
 tailor
 your


presentations
 to
 those
 assets
 and
 we


have
 a
 ton
 of
 people
 doing
 that
 for
 us.


>> And
 um
 you
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 different


people
 in
 this
 process
 with
 different


voices.
 Why
 is
 that
 important?
 I
 I
 think


it's
 important
 for
 leadership
 that
 if


you
 are
 a
 good
 leader,
 one
 is


you
 you
 want
 a
 lot
 of
 voices
 inside
 the


mix
 to
 come
 to
 the
 right
 conclusion
 and


not
 make
 a
 decision
 that
 your
 opinion
 is


the
 right
 opinion.
 So
 there
 are
 many


executives
 that
 we
 sit
 around
 constantly


going
 back
 and
 forth
 about
 deals,
 you


know,
 what
 we
 can
 ask
 for,
 what
 we


shouldn't
 ask
 for,
 places
 we
 should
 be


growing
 the
 business.
 Um,
 we
 have
 calls


every
 week
 on
 the
 UFC,
 calls
 every
 week


on
 the
 WWE
 jiu-jitsu
 bull
 riding.
 And
 I


think
 that's
 um,
 you
 know,
 um,
 important


for
 leadership
 um,
 to
 get
 to
 the
 right


conclusion.
 You
 always
 know
 you're
 going


to
 make
 mistakes,
 but
 you
 want
 everybody


that
 is
 running
 the
 operations
 for
 your


company
 at
 every
 level
 to
 have
 a
 voice


in
 it
 so
 that
 when
 the
 mistakes
 come,
 we


can
 at
 least
 mitigate
 them
 a
 little
 bit


and
 then
 have
 a
 path
 forward.
 And
 you


constantly
 have
 to
 be
 reviewing
 this


stuff
 um
 as
 you
 as
 as
 you
 as
 you
 operate


your
 business.


>> Um
 I
 don't
 know
 how
 other
 people
 do
 it.


running
 a
 sport
 is
 like
 anything
 else,


but
 we
 have
 the
 added


um


situation
 that
 you're
 on
 the
 WWE
 they're


employ,
 you
 know,
 they're
 signed


contracts
 on
 the
 on
 the
 UFC
 they're


independent
 contractors.
 That's
 why
 it's


very
 difficult
 for
 a
 media
 company
 like


a
 Disney,
 a
 Comcast,
 a
 Warner
 Brothers,


a
 Netflix
 to
 own
 a
 sport.
 I
 think
 they


would
 hurt
 the
 operate
 because
 it's
 it's


a
 very
 kind
 of
 fluid
 situation.
 Um,
 and


that's
 that's
 why
 you
 need
 a
 lot
 of


voices
 in
 that
 can
 tell
 you
 all
 the


different
 things
 going
 on
 because
 it's


not
 only
 how
 you
 run
 the
 business,
 it's


how
 your
 superstars
 and
 athletes


are
 thinking
 about
 it
 and
 those
 that


that's
 a
 very
 dynamic
 situation
 to
 to


kind
 of
 constantly
 be
 reviewing
 as


you're
 trying
 to
 run
 the
 business.


>> What
 type
 of
 leadership
 does
 it
 take
 to


run
 this
 type
 of
 fluid
 situation?
 a


democratic
 dictatorship


>> and
 that's
 what
 you
 have.


>> Well,
 we
 have
 we
 have
 multiple
 leaders


in
 the
 democratic
 dictatorship.
 Yeah.
 On


on
 the
 on
 the
 you
 know,
 you
 know,
 Triple


H
 runs
 WWE
 with
 Nick
 Khan,
 Dana
 runs,


you
 know,
 kind
 of
 making
 the
 fights
 and


everything.
 UFC,
 Mark
 and
 I
 run
 the


business
 side
 of
 it
 with
 multiple
 people


underneath
 us.
 And
 then
 there's
 that


coordination
 between
 uh
 you
 know
 the


people
 that
 are
 creating
 the
 storylines,


creating
 the
 fights,
 and
 us
 about
 where


we're
 going
 with
 it.


>> You
 seem
 to
 have
 very
 close


relationships
 with
 your
 with
 your


management.
 How
 do
 you
 balance
 kind
 of


um


>> Do
 you
 think
 there's
 work
 life
 balance?


>> No,
 I
 don't
 think
 so.


>> I
 don't
 either.


>> No,
 no,
 I
 don't
 think
 that.
 No,
 I
 don't


think
 I'm
 not
 asking
 how
 you
 balance


your
 life.
 I'm
 just
 asking
 how
 do
 you


balance
 professional
 and
 personal


relationships?


>> You
 know,
 I've
 known
 Dana
 for
 30
 years.


I've
 known,
 you
 know,
 Nick
 Khan
 was
 an


agent
 at
 um
 CIA.
 We
 tried
 to
 hire
 him
 as


an
 agent
 here.
 Have
 a
 very
 close


relationship
 with
 him.
 I've
 known
 Triple


H
 off
 and
 on
 for
 a
 long
 time
 now.
 Very


close.
 You
 just
 you
 just
 have
 to,
 you


know,
 stay
 close,
 know
 what's
 going
 on


in
 their
 lives.
 I
 mean,
 you
 just
 you're


you're
 you're
 in
 business
 with
 somebody,


so
 therefore
 you
 have
 to
 know
 a
 lot


about
 them
 and
 care
 about
 them.


>> Now,
 moving
 on
 to
 a
 different
 type
 of


entertainment.
 You
 recently
 bought
 uh


the
 Freeze
 Art
 Fair,


>> right?
 That's
 a
 new
 business


I
 started


>> less
 violent.


>> Well,
 here's
 what
 I
 here's
 what
 I


concluded.
 So,
 we
 took
 Endeavor
 Private,


we
 spun
 UFC
 and
 PBR
 and
 on
 location
 and


IMG
 into
 TKO.


Silver
 Lake
 as
 we
 took
 Endeavor
 Private


was
 selling.
 They
 wanted
 it
 to
 just
 be
 a


pure
 play
 representation
 business.
 We


had
 bought
 over
 time
 about
 700
 different


events.


I
 have
 a
 thesis
 that
 um
 you
 know
 we're


down
 to
 four
 day
 work
 weeks,
 maybe
 three


day
 work
 weeks.
 Europe,
 you
 know,
 um


with
 AI
 and
 a
 bunch
 of
 other
 stuff.
 Co


started
 it.
 And


so
 if
 that's
 the
 case,
 there's
 going
 to


be
 more
 free
 time
 than
 ever.
 We're


social
 animals,
 human
 beings,
 and


they're
 ether
 going
 to
 go
 to
 sporting


event,
 you're
 going
 to
 go
 to
 dinner,


you're
 going
 to
 watch
 entertainment,


you're
 going
 to
 live
 music.
 And
 I
 also


think
 you're
 going
 to
 do
 live
 events.


So,


we've
 uh
 acquired
 the
 tennis
 business,


the
 participatory
 sports
 in
 uh


collectibles
 freeze
 and
 and
 Barrett


Jackson,
 our
 food
 festivals,
 a
 bunch
 of


assets
 and
 we're
 we
 you
 know
 we've


raised


money


uh
 about
 $2
 billion
 in
 equity
 and
 we've


bought
 these
 assets
 and
 we're
 going
 to


hopefully
 create
 like
 Live
 Nation
 is
 in


music.
 We're
 gonna
 create
 a
 mini
 version


because
 they're
 a
 great
 company,
 but
 in


live
 events,
 a
 global


uh
 live
 events
 business
 as
 this
 world


kind
 of
 transforms
 itself
 um
 with
 AI.


>> And
 freeze
 is
 a
 part
 of
 that.


>> And
 freeze
 is
 a
 part
 of
 that.
 And
 I


think
 live
 is
 more
 important
 than
 it's


ever
 been.
 Um
 and
 that's
 the
 marketplace


that
 we're
 going
 to
 try
 and
 go
 capture.


>> What
 kind
 of
 art
 do
 you
 collect?


>> I
 collect
 um


artists.
 I
 work
 with
 this
 gentleman
 by


the
 name
 of
 Jeffrey
 Dichch.
 I
 collect


art
 um
 mainly
 at
 the
 beginning
 of
 my


life
 it
 was
 all
 over
 the
 place
 and
 then


I
 I've
 focused
 um
 significantly
 on
 um


black
 artists,
 American
 black
 artists


and
 South
 African
 um
 1930


to
 now
 um
 from
 Sam
 Gilliam,
 Mark


Bradford,


um
 uh
 Noah
 Davis,
 Carrie
 James
 Marshall,


um
 um
 Benny
 Andrews.
 It's
 a
 It's
 a


pretty
 nice
 collection.


>> It's
 I've
 been
 doing
 it
 for
 now
 in
 this


specific
 space.


>> And
 anybody
 I
 didn't
 mention,
 and


please,
 nobody
 um
 Cara
 Walker,
 please


don't
 be
 offended.
 It's
 it
 I
 um
 it's


it's
 a
 good
 collection.


>> It's
 not
 perfect,
 but
 you
 know,
 I
 I
 got


a
 lot
 of
 time.


>> Where
 do
 you
 think
 your
 energy
 comes


from?


>> Well,
 I
 was
 hyperactive
 when
 I
 was
 a


kid.
 I
 was
 one
 of
 the
 first
 Riddlin


kids.
 So,
 I
 was
 actually
 just
 having


this
 exchange
 with
 Egon
 Durban
 in
 this


morning
 about
 um


one
 of
 his
 portfolio
 companies
 that
 I'm


involved
 with
 out
 of
 Silverlake


and
 he
 was
 saying
 something
 and
 I
 was


saying
 something
 and
 I
 said
 to
 him,


"What
 makes
 us
 crazy?"
 And
 we
 just
 had


this
 tax
 exchange.


I
 really
 don't
 know.
 But
 um
 I'm
 still


intellectually
 curious,


>> you
 know,
 and
 uh
 I
 love
 it.
 I
 have
 uh


you
 know,
 I
 don't
 I
 I
 don't
 I
 I
 don't


I'm
 not
 tired.
 I'm
 not
 I
 I
 love
 the


every
 bit
 of
 the
 process
 now.
 I'm
 not


sure
 I
 I
 enjoyed
 the
 process
 before,
 but


it
 was
 a
 it
 was
 a
 means
 to
 get
 to,
 you


know,
 to
 fulfill
 an
 idea.
 Now
 I
 actually


love
 the
 process
 and
 the
 aggravation.


>> Which
 part
 of
 the
 process
 you
 like?


>> All
 of
 it.
 I
 I
 I
 realize
 there's
 going


to
 be
 a
 lot
 of
 aggravating
 moments.


Those
 are
 what
 it's
 required
 to
 do


business.


Um
 if
 you
 don't
 if
 you
 don't
 accept


that,
 which
 was
 at
 the
 beginning
 I


didn't
 understand
 it.
 Now
 I've
 accepted


it,


it's
 great,
 you
 know,
 and
 the
 outcome
 is


a
 different
 conversation.


>> I
 think
 you
 said
 pressure
 is
 a


privilege.


>> Yeah.
 And
 uh


>> I
 think
 that's
 a
 good
 one.
 I
 actually
 I


have
 to
 admit
 I
 used
 it
 earlier
 today.


>> Oh,
 you
 did
 with
 what?


>> No,
 I
 just
 thought
 it
 was
 No,
 just


explain
 why
 we
 like
 to
 be
 where
 stuff
 is


happening,
 you
 know.


>> Yeah.
 Um
 and
 it
 just
 you
 just
 kind
 of


get
 a
 different
 sense


of
 the
 world
 as
 opposed
 to
 kind
 of
 like


being
 a
 bystander.


>> I'm
 I'm
 not
 my
 my
 parents
 were
 never


bystanders.


My
 mom
 wasn't.
 She
 was
 in
 the
 civil


rights
 movement.
 My
 dad
 was
 a
 very


pretty
 hard
 advocate.
 He
 was
 a


pediatrician
 about
 uh
 you
 know
 kind
 of


kids
 rights.
 Um
 and


>> and
 you
 had
 two
 you
 had
 two
 clever


brothers.


>> Yeah.


>> Who
 is
 the
 cleverest
 of
 the
 three
 of
 you


>> in
 our
 respective
 field?
 I
 think
 we're


all
 pretty
 clever.
 Um


I
 wouldn't
 want
 to
 have
 an
 argument


about
 healthcare
 against
 my
 brother
 Zeke


who's
 at
 pen
 as
 I
 said
 to
 you.
 And
 I


definitely


uh
 wouldn't
 want
 to
 have
 a
 political


conversation


uh
 against
 my
 brother
 Rahm
 who


>> he's
 not
 the
 ambassador,


>> the
 former
 ambassador
 of
 Japan
 and
 mayor


of
 Chicago.
 Hopefully
 he
 runs
 for


president
 and
 I
 think
 he's
 the
 most


qualified
 guy
 out
 there
 um
 for
 the


Democratic
 party.
 Um
 and
 uh
 they're


pretty
 dynamic
 in
 their
 own
 specific


fields.


>> When
 do
 you
 wake
 up
 in
 the
 morning?
 I


flew
 to
 Indianapolis
 on
 Saturday,
 saw


our
 launch
 of
 our
 WWE
 Wrestle
 Palooa
 on


ESPN.
 Then
 I
 flew
 to
 New
 York,
 had


dinner
 with
 the
 Amir
 of
 Qar
 last
 night,


flew
 back,
 got
 in
 at
 2:00,
 woke
 up
 at
 6


here
 with
 you,
 and
 I'm
 flying
 back
 to


New
 York
 on
 Tuesday
 because
 I
 have a


premiere
 for
 a
 client.
 Flying
 back
 here


on
 T
 on
 Wednesday
 night,
 going
 to
 Aspen


and
 then
 back
 to
 Indianapolis
 on
 the


following
 Tuesday.
 So,
 I
 don't
 know.
 I


Whatever
 it
 is,
 it
 is
 it
 just
 does.


>> What
 is
 your
 What
 kind
 of
 fitness
 regime


do
 you
 have?


>> Oh,
 it
 it
 that's
 its
 own
 as
 its
 own


podcast
 with
 you.
 It's
 it's
 too
 long
 to


discuss.


>> Okay.
 One
 minute.


>> No,
 no,
 it's
 way
 too
 long.
 I
 mean,


>> well,
 give
 me
 a
 give
 me
 a
 give
 me
 a


taste.


>> I
 wake
 up
 at
 4:30,
 5:00.
 I
 work
 out
 for


an
 hour
 and
 a
 half.


Sauna,
 ice.
 I
 mean,
 it
 just
 it
 just
 it


it
 it
 it
 is
 over
 the
 years
 it's
 gotten


crazier
 and
 crazier.
 Do
 you
 drink


anymore?


>> I
 have
 a
 glass
 of
 wine
 from
 time
 to


time.


>> I
 don't
 drink
 at
 all
 anymore.


>> But
 you
 know
 what?
 But
 I'll
 tell
 you


I'll
 tell
 you
 one
 thing.
 Before
 this


podcast,
 I
 did
 have
 an
 ice
 bath
 and
 a


sauna.


>> See,
 I
 have
 one
 every
 day.
 Do
 you
 do
 one


every
 day?


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.


>> Yeah.
 How
 long
 is
 your
 sauna?


>> Well,
 not
 very
 long.
 I'm
 uh
 I'm
 pretty


quick.


>> How
 How
 long
 do
 you
 stay
 in


>> in
 the
 sauna?
 10
 minutes.
 Maximum
 10


minutes.


>> So,
 I
 do
 I
 do
 20
 minutes
 and
 I
 do
 three


minutes
 in
 the
 ice
 bath.


>> Okay.
 every
 day.


>> That's
 good.
 No,
 I
 I
 am
 a
 big
 believer.


>> Yeah.


>> How
 long
 is
 your
 attention
 span,
 you


think?


>> I've
 I've
 been
 pretty
 good
 here.


>> Yeah,
 absolutely.
 I'm
 I'm I'm
 going
 How


long
 have
 we
 been
 going?


>> No,
 no.
 Yeah,
 I
 I
 had
 expected
 you
 to


say
 uh
 uh
 I
 have
 to
 go.
 Love
 you.
 Uh


because
 I
 think
 that's
 how
 you
 normally


finish
 your


>> No,
 no.
 Two
 more
 two
 more
 minutes.
 Uh


uh
 learning
 from
 fa
 I
 mean
 some
 people


call
 it
 failures.
 I
 think
 you
 call
 it


something
 else
 but
 uh


learning
 from


trials,
 mistakes.


>> One
 of the
 biggest
 failures
 was
 you
 know


not
 going
 public
 the
 first
 time.
 I


didn't
 like
 I
 didn't
 even
 understand
 it


right


but
 that
 enabled
 us
 and
 then
 co
 hit
 and


so
 reading
 all
 the


points
 of
 view
 of
 what
 wasn't
 good


admitting
 that
 we
 screwed
 it
 up
 going


back
 into
 the
 market
 but
 with
 a


different
 uh
 strategy
 uh
 working
 with


Morgan
 Stanley
 and
 Egon
 and
 and
 really


refining
 it.
 I
 had
 you
 know
 Mark
 Shapiro


and
 team
 dealt
 with
 all
 the
 issues


on
 COVID
 which
 was
 as
 as
 you
 know
 for
 a


lot
 of
 your
 companies
 significant
 how


you
 handled
 it.
 Um
 doing
 the
 raise
 we


you
 know
 we
 just
 you
 can't
 I
 try
 and


instill
 this
 with
 my
 kids
 hopefully
 with


people
 that
 work
 with
 me
 you
 know
 when


you're
 running
 something
 it's
 not
 how


many
 punches
 you
 can
 throw
 it's
 how
 many


punches
 you
 can
 take.
 So
 endurance,


emotional
 endurance
 is
 a
 really
 key


factor
 and
 failure
 really
 puts
 the
 light


on
 that


>> and
 being
 able
 to
 get
 up
 off
 the
 canvas


and
 get
 back
 in
 the
 arena
 is
 crucial
 and


there's
 all
 these
 great
 quotes
 about
 it


and
 you
 know
 the
 Tom
 Brady's
 everybody


doesn't
 it
 just
 you
 just
 have
 to
 be
 able


to
 get
 off
 the
 canvas.


>> What
 would
 be
 your
 advice
 to
 young


aspiring
 entrepreneurs


in


>> actually
 enjoy
 the
 aggravation.


enjoy
 it
 because
 that
 is


what
 it's
 about.
 Um,
 if
 you
 if
 you
 love


what
 you're
 doing
 and
 I
 still
 love
 it


and
 it
 what
 what
 I'm
 doing
 is
 expanded


then
 enjoy
 the
 hardship
 because
 the


hardship
 is
 part
 of
 the
 process
 of
 the


enjoyment.


>> How
 can
 you
 enjoy
 uh,
 you
 know,


aggravation
 and
 stuff
 that
 hurts?
 How


can
 you
 how
 can
 you
 teach
 yourself
 that


pain
 is
 good?


>> Doing
 three
 minutes
 in
 an
 ice
 bath
 ain't


easy.
 meditating
 in
 a
 in
 in
 a
 very
 hot


sauna.
 You
 know,
 one
 of
 my
 things
 in
 my


in
 my
 uh
 why
 I
 do
 these
 things
 for
 my


health,
 you
 know,
 today
 I'm
 on
 a
 24-hour


fast.
 Every
 quarter
 I
 do
 a
 three-day


fast.
 getting
 your
 mind,
 the
 ability
 for


your
 mind
 to
 be
 able
 to
 handle


uncomfortable
 also
 on
 on
 a
 personal


level
 for
 your
 health
 helps
 you
 in


business
 too
 because
 it
 in
 you
 know
 kind


of
 putting
 barriers
 around
 yourself
 of


what
 you
 can
 and
 can't
 do.
 And
 that
 that


also
 helps
 even
 though
 it's
 for
 your


health,
 it
 also
 helps
 in
 your
 business


decision
 making
 and
 your
 ability
 to
 to


kind
 of
 be
 um
 the
 ability
 to
 endure
 the


aggravation


>> and
 you
 realize
 this
 too
 will
 pass
 um


and
 uh
 and
 it's
 not
 going
 to
 kill
 you


and
 you're
 going
 to
 work
 through
 it.
 You


just
 have
 to
 work
 really
 hard.
 M


>> um
 and
 if
 you
 kind
 of
 learn
 those
 things


at
 at
 at
 many
 different
 levels,


sometimes
 it
 comes
 from
 business,


sometimes
 it
 you
 see
 that
 you
 got


through
 this
 or
 sometimes
 it
 comes
 from


your
 personal
 life.
 You
 can
 handle
 it.


It
 for
 me
 it
 started
 and
 I
 didn't


realize
 this
 during
 the
 moments


I
 was
 dyslexic.


It
 was
 not
 easy
 reading


and
 it
 was
 embarrassing.


um
 it
 was
 uncomfortable
 and
 being
 able


to
 be
 comfortable
 in
 the
 uncomfortable


enables
 you
 to
 handle
 aggravation
 and


all
 the
 other
 things
 you
 need
 in


business.


>> And
 even
 at
 the
 time
 I
 I
 I
 hated
 myself


and
 my
 inability
 to
 read
 it
 has
 helped


me
 now
 realizing
 that
 you
 have
 to
 be


comfortable
 in
 the
 uncomfortable
 and
 I


think
 that's
 true
 for
 all
 business


people.


>> And
 what
 is
 your
 advice
 to
 young
 people?


>> Be
 comfortable
 in
 the
 uncomfortable.


learn
 that
 and
 don't
 think
 that,
 you


know,
 it's
 just
 it
 just
 should
 just


happen.
 You
 actually
 have
 to
 work


through
 all
 the
 pain
 to
 make
 it
 happen


if
 you
 care.
 And
 and
 I
 don't
 I
 don't
 you


know,
 people
 talk
 about
 I'm
 not
 sure


that
 that
 is
 being
 taught
 now.
 you
 know,


you
 your
 parents
 can't
 cuddle
 you
 and


can't
 give
 you
 an
 award
 for
 coming
 in


second
 and
 have
 to,
 you
 know,
 ground
 you


and
 do
 certain
 things
 for
 you.
 And
 then


then
 you
 have
 to
 pick
 up
 the
 mantle
 as
 a


as
 an
 adult
 and
 and
 keep
 on
 doing
 it
 and


and
 your
 parents
 have
 to
 be
 there
 all


the
 way
 but
 not
 giving
 you
 the
 answers.


So,
 um
 hopefully
 I've
 done
 that
 with
 my


kids.


>> Sounds
 like
 it.
 It's
 been
 great
 having


you
 on
 Ari.
 Uh
 all
 the
 best
 of
 luck
 with


all
 your
 projects
 and
 there
 are
 lots
 of


them.
