[Music]


All
 right.
 Hello
 everybody.
 Welcome
 back


to
 the
 channel.
 We
 are
 back
 on
 another


market
 close.
 Dude,
 the
 amount
 of
 jokes


you
 guys
 have
 in
 the
 chat
 for
 why
 I'm


late.
 We're
 a
 minute
 late,
 bro.
 We're


like
 30
 seconds
 late
 here.
 Not
 even
 a


full
 minute.
 The
 amount
 of
 jokes,
 bro.


Some
 of
 these
 comments
 are
 actually
 They


need
 to
 go
 in
 the
 Hall
 of
 Fame
 for
 some


of
 these
 comments.
 I
 leave
 him
 alone.


He's
 with
 his
 dentist.
 Goodness


gracious.
 Anyway,
 uh,
 dip
 buyers
 came


back
 with
 a
 vengeance,
 folks.
 Dip
 buyers


came
 back
 with
 a
 vengeance.
 Markets
 are


green.
 We
 have
 added
 $800
 billion


dollars
 of
 market
 cap
 today.
 800
 billion


of
 market
 cap,
 663
 on
 the
 S&P.
 We
 got


all
 the
 way
 up
 to
 664.6.
 Got
 a
 lot
 of


different
 headlines
 and
 different
 things


to
 talk
 about.
 But
 I
 mean
 the
 the
 kind


of
 punchline
 here
 is
 we
 are
 getting
 into


earnings
 tomorrow.
 We'll
 do
 a
 bit
 of
 a


preview
 on
 what
 we've
 got
 going
 on
 with


bank
 earnings
 because
 I
 think
 it's
 going


to
 set
 up
 really
 what
 happens
 with


overall
 stock
 market
 earnings
 going
 into


Q3.
 Um,
 but
 as
 you
 can
 see
 on
 the


screen,
 Google
 up
 3%,
 SoFi
 up
 4%,
 AMD
 up


half
 a
 percent,
 Nvidia
 up
 2.4,
 four


hoodie
 1.1,
 Palanteer
 up
 1%.
 Tesla
 nice


little
 5%
 move
 435
 right
 there
 on
 Tesla.


Tesla
 got
 to
 437
 at
 one
 point.
 Apple
 is


green,
 SMCI
 is
 green,
 Ethereum
 and


Bitcoin
 which
 were
 pretty
 weak
 when
 I


left
 at
 the
 market
 open.
 Bitcoin
 was


almost
 below
 114.
 Ethereum
 was
 actually


almost
 below
 4,000.
 Nice
 rebound.
 Those


two
 are
 green
 on
 the
 day.
 Uh
 your
 energy


names
 like
 Ollo
 that
 is
 up
 18%
 on
 the


day.
 Centress
 Energy
 LEU
 that
 is
 up
 10%


on
 the
 day.
 Bloom
 Energy
 got
 a
 $5


billion
 deal
 with
 Brookfield
 27%
 on
 the


day.
 Pretty
 damn
 incredible
 across
 the


board.
 Even
 Quantum
 making
 a
 move.


D-Wave
 40.46.
 That's
 up
 22%.
 Regetti
 got


above
 50.
 53
 right
 there
 up
 20%.
 As
 you


can
 see,
 the
 dip
 buyers
 came
 back
 and


they
 started
 to
 essentially
 buy
 as
 much


as
 they
 could
 based
 on
 the
 decline
 that


we
 got
 last
 week.
 I
 mean,
 there
 were
 a


lot
 of
 dip
 buyers
 on
 Friday,
 but
 today


you're
 seeing
 pretty
 much
 across
 the


board.
 Micro
 Strategies
 up
 3%
 as
 look
 at


that.
 9151.
 It
 hit
 92.
 That's
 an


all-time
 high.
 A
 lot
 of
 these
 names


continue
 to
 get
 buyers
 to
 pile
 in.
 Maybe


institutional,
 maybe
 retail,
 maybe
 a
 mix


of
 both.
 But
 I
 think
 the
 core
 argument


here
 is
 that
 the
 China
 Trump
 situation


probably
 was
 not
 the
 top
 of
 the
 market.


And
 eventually,
 we're
 going
 to
 find
 out


if
 we
 ever
 can
 get
 back
 above
 673.
 But
 I


think
 most
 analysts
 that
 have
 their


$7,000
 price
 target
 continue
 to
 have


their
 $7
 $7,000
 price
 target.
 It
 doesn't


seem
 like
 that's
 necessarily
 going
 to
 be


going
 away
 anytime
 soon.
 Yeah,
 it's
 the


most
 hated
 V-shaped
 rally
 2.0
 No,
 and


it's
 not
 a
 full
 Vshape
 yet.
 We
 got
 to


get
 back
 to
 alltime
 highs,
 but
 it's
 a


pretty
 close
 one
 as
 you're
 seeing
 on
 the


S&P
 500
 right
 there
 up
 1.53%
 on
 the
 day.


Now,
 the
 biggest
 deal
 of
 the
 day,
 and


we'll
 talk
 more
 about
 this
 after
 the


bell
 right
 here
 was
 Broadcom.
 Broadcom


up
 10%
 on
 the
 day.
 OpenAI
 signed
 a
 10


gigawatt
 deal
 with
 Broadcom.
 They
 put


out
 an
 entire
 podcast
 with
 both
 of
 the


companies
 actually
 talking
 about
 the


substance
 of
 the
 deal.
 But
 once
 again,


it
 continues
 to
 lead
 the
 argument
 for


how
 entrenched
 OpenAI
 is
 in
 this
 entire


ecosystem.
 $100
 billion
 dollar
 deal
 with


Nvidia,
 six
 gawatt
 deal
 with
 AMD,
 $300


billion
 deal
 with
 Oracle,
 and
 now
 about


a
 $300
 billion
 deal
 with
 Broadcom
 for


custom
 ASIC
 chips,
 which
 is
 quite


incredible.
 That
 deal
 kind
 of
 sparked


the
 rally,
 I
 think,
 in
 all
 the
 data


center
 plays.
 So,
 I
 that's
 up
 7%
 on
 the


day.
 Bit
 farms,
 is
 that
 above
 $5?
 That


is
 well
 above
 $5.
 Look
 at
 that.
 28%
 on


the
 day.
 Uh,
 CleanSpark,
 Marathon,
 all


those
 names.
 I
 mean,
 if
 OpenAI
 is


signing
 these
 gigawatt,
 multi-gawatt


deals
 with
 multiple
 companies,
 Sam
 Alman


saying
 he
 wants
 to
 get
 up
 to
 30


gigawatts
 in
 the
 next
 five
 years.
 I


mean,
 yeah,
 you're
 going
 to
 get
 a
 lot
 of


the
 Bitcoin
 miners
 that
 are
 turning
 into


data
 centers
 essentially
 to
 catch
 a
 bid.


Even
 Cipher,
 Cipher
 got
 that
 Google


investment
 a
 month
 ago.
 Look
 at
 Cipher


up
 20%
 on
 the
 day.
 Terra
 Wolf
 as
 well,


not
 doing
 too
 bad.
 And
 then
 that's
 not


even
 to
 mention
 the
 the
 the
 most


important
 sector
 of
 the
 day
 that
 was


running
 ever
 since
 that
 China
 news
 is


rare
 earth
 minerals
 and
 metals
 95.83.
 83


on
 MP.
 US
 AR
 also
 getting
 a
 big
 boost,


up
 17.9%.
 TMC,
 the
 metals
 company,
 that


one
 got
 a
 massive
 boost.
 That's
 up
 17%.


Uh
 and
 then
 you
 had
 TMQ,
 the
 company


that
 Trump
 will
 be
 taking
 a
 stake
 in


that
 is
 up
 another
 11%.


I
 mean,
 this
 is
 just
 this
 is
 just


incredible
 to
 witness
 the
 rerating
 of


these
 companies
 in
 real
 time.
 And
 if
 you


believe
 that
 this
 data
 center
 stuff
 is


not
 slowing
 down
 anytime
 soon,
 which


none
 of
 the
 evidence
 that
 at least
 I'm


seeing
 is
 a
 reason
 for
 it
 to
 slow
 down,


then
 it
 looks
 like
 these
 companies
 are


going
 to
 continue
 catching
 a
 bid.
 Nebas


right
 there,
 that's
 up
 4.8%
 of
 the
 day.


135.88
 is
 what
 you
 have
 on
 Navius.
 Now,


I
 did
 buy
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 of
 Amazon


today.
 I
 don't
 know,
 dude.
 I
 I
 just
 feel


like
 Amazon,
 again,
 there's
 we've
 gone


through
 the
 thesis
 plenty
 of
 times
 on


why
 I
 think
 it's
 undervalued,
 why
 I


think
 it
 should
 run
 towards
 the
 end
 of


the
 year.
 So,
 bought
 a
 little
 bit
 more


Amazon,
 I
 think,
 at
 220.
 I
 bought
 in
 at


222.
 It's
 not
 that
 big
 of
 a
 difference


in
 terms
 of
 the
 entry
 price
 right
 there,


but
 I
 think
 they're
 going
 to
 have
 a


strong
 Q3
 and
 I
 think
 AWS
 is
 going
 to


surprise
 to
 the
 upside
 and
 as
 long
 as


that
 plays
 out,
 I
 think
 Amazon
 does


okay.
 So,
 I
 bought
 a
 little
 bit
 more


Amazon,
 bought
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 grab


today
 as
 well.
 Google,
 right,
 they're
 up


3%.
 But
 across
 the
 board,
 you're
 just


seeing
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 names
 rebound
 from


where
 they
 were
 on
 Friday
 at
 the
 lows
 on


Friday,
 which
 is
 very
 nice
 to
 see.
 Crowd


Strike
 as
 well,
 508.
 That
 is
 up
 2.95%


on
 the
 day.
 Again,
 Olo
 massive
 move
 up


18%.
 I
 know
 the
 company
 doesn't
 have


revenue,
 but
 it's
 in
 the
 hottest
 sector


in
 the
 market,
 which
 is
 energy.
 Every


chart
 that
 we
 look
 at
 every
 day
 shows


how
 much
 we're
 going
 to
 need
 more
 and


more
 data
 centers,
 or
 how
 we're
 going
 to


need
 more
 and
 more
 energy
 to
 fuel
 the


data
 centers,
 and
 how
 we're
 going
 to


need
 more
 and
 more
 electricity
 to
 just


naturally
 make
 sure
 the
 price
 doesn't


spike
 up
 for
 the
 average
 person
 in


America
 that
 is
 using
 electricity
 in


their
 home
 because
 of
 those
 data


centers.
 And
 nuclear
 is
 going
 to


probably
 play
 a
 role.
 And
 as
 a
 result,
 I


think
 got
 low
 is
 getting
 more
 of
 this


momentum.
 PI,
 this
 one
 got
 a
 deal
 with


Nvidia
 this
 morning
 that's
 up
 23%.
 We


talked
 about
 that
 in
 the
 morning
 when
 it


was
 up
 10%.
 So,
 another
 14%
 since
 we


talked
 about
 it.
 $2.4
 billion
 market


cap.
 Small
 company,
 but
 again,
 uh,
 as
 we


see
 this
 energy
 ecosystem
 continuing
 to


thrive,
 you
 have
 companies
 like
 Powi,


which
 aren't
 really,
 you
 know,
 talk


about
 companies.
 Average
 volume
 is


748,000
 shares,
 was
 6.3
 million
 shares


today.
 So,
 6x
 the
 volume
 simply
 because


of
 the
 partnership
 with
 Nvidia.
 And
 it


doesn't
 look
 like
 that
 is
 slowing
 down.


SMR,
 New
 Scale
 Power,
 that's
 up
 another


15%
 on
 the
 day.
 And
 then
 Nanuclear


Energy,
 NE,
 that
 one
 is
 up
 18%
 on
 the


day.
 BMR
 also
 didn't
 do
 too
 bad.
 I
 mean,


now
 that
 Ethereum
 got
 above
 4200,
 there


you
 go.
 We're
 at
 56.
 We're
 at
 53
 when


the
 market
 open
 was
 ending.
 So,
 it's


nice
 to
 see
 that
 one
 gap
 up
 a
 little
 bit


above
 56.
 Again,
 it
 got
 to
 47
 on
 Friday


night.
 So,
 if
 anyone
 bought
 that
 dip,


not
 too
 bad.
 Uh,
 but
 you
 are
 seeing


crypto
 do
 okay.
 And
 you
 are
 seeing
 the


data
 center
 plays
 continue
 to
 get
 some


love.
 Uh,
 did
 you
 buy
 shares
 or
 calls
 of


Amazon?
 Just
 shares.
 Not
 buying
 any


calls
 at
 this
 time.
 just
 shares.
 KRE
 is


something
 I'm
 looking
 at
 as
 well.
 Again,


the
 banks
 are
 going
 to
 start
 to
 report


and
 we'll
 talk
 more
 about
 the
 banks


after
 the
 bell,
 but
 KRE
 is
 barely
 up


here
 to
 date.
 This
 is
 the
 regional


banking
 fund
 ETF.
 XLF
 is
 up
 like
 9%.
 So,


I
 mean,
 if
 you
 want
 to
 be
 selective
 with


certain
 parts
 of
 these
 banks,
 whether


it's
 a
 JP
 Morgan,
 Goldman
 Sachs,


Cityroup,
 they
 have
 run
 a
 lot
 this
 year.


So,
 you
 know,
 it
 wouldn't
 surprise
 me
 if


they
 kind
 of
 take
 a
 breather
 tomorrow


and
 don't
 actually
 perform.
 But
 the


actual
 earnings
 growth,
 I'm
 looking


forward
 to
 be
 pretty
 good.
 And
 I
 and
 I


think that
 gets
 us
 into
 the
 conversation


of
 what
 to
 expect
 from
 earnings
 growth.


The
 banks
 are
 set
 to
 report
 tomorrow
 if


the
 financials
 can
 give
 us
 a
 good
 start


to
 earnings
 and
 we
 see
 double
 digit


earnings
 growth
 throughout
 most
 sectors


in
 Q3,
 which
 is
 pretty
 much
 what
 is


expected
 from
 every
 analyst
 that
 I've


been
 reading
 in
 terms
 of
 their
 the


reports
 this
 morning
 going
 into
 the
 bank


earnings,
 then
 I
 think
 we're
 going
 to


continue
 to
 see
 an
 argument
 for
 multiple


expansion
 and
 money
 coming
 off
 the


sidelines.
 Now,
 the
 push
 back
 to
 this


argument
 is,
 well,
 what
 about
 the
 froth


in
 the
 market?
 And
 I
 think
 you
 have
 to


acknowledge
 that
 there
 is
 froth.
 But
 if


Nvidia
 was
 frothy
 and
 not
 putting
 up
 the


earnings
 growth,
 there
 would
 be
 an


argument.
 If
 JP
 Morgan
 was
 frothy
 and


not
 putting
 up
 the
 ear earnings
 growth,


there
 would
 be
 an
 argument
 for,
 hey,


this
 is
 too
 much.
 There's
 a
 structural


problem
 in
 the
 economy.
 Oaklo
 being


frothy,
 which
 I
 think
 most
 people
 can


agree,
 yes,
 it's
 probably
 a
 bit
 frothy.


$25
 billion
 company
 with
 no
 revenue


isn't
 that
 big
 of
 a
 deal
 because
 if
 25


billion
 goes
 to
 zero,
 again,
 it's


whatever,
 right?
 It's
 not
 it's
 not
 a
 $4


trillion
 company
 going
 to
 zero.
 And


second
 of
 all,
 a
 lot of
 the
 companies


that
 are
 perceived
 as
 frothy
 and
 might


legitimately
 be
 frothy,
 they're
 in
 a


sector
 that's
 getting
 a
 ton
 of


excitement
 and
 opportunities
 and


potentially
 the
 ability
 to
 get
 revenues.


I
 mean,
 even
 for
 the
 people
 that
 feel


that
 quantum
 is
 incredibly
 um
 frothy.
 JP


Morgan
 today
 announced
 a
 $ 1.5
 trillion


investment
 and
 they
 announced
 that
 part


of
 their
 investment
 is
 going
 to
 go
 to


quantum
 companies.
 So
 when
 you
 have


narratives
 like
 that
 going
 around,
 even


if
 you
 think
 there
 is
 some
 broader


froth,
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 it's
 enough
 to


say
 that
 is
 a
 top
 to
 the
 market
 or
 the


market's
 in
 a
 bubble
 and
 as
 a
 result,


you're
 seeing
 the
 dip
 buyers
 come
 out


and
 they
 are
 continuing
 to
 buy.
 S&P
 500


right
 there
 up
 1.62%


on
 the
 day.
 What
 do
 you
 think
 about


Dominoes?
 I
 don't
 know
 much
 about


Dominoes,
 but
 uh
 Papa
 John's
 got
 a


buyout
 offer
 today
 from
 Apollo
 at
 60


bucks
 a
 share.
 Stocks
 at
 45.
 It's
 up


10%.
 So
 obviously
 the
 market's
 not


really
 thinking
 the
 buyout
 is
 going
 to


go
 through,
 but
 they
 are
 kind
 of


thinking
 there's
 a
 chance
 for
 it
 to
 go


through
 because
 it's
 up
 9%.
 So
 if
 uh
 if


Apollo
 ends
 up
 actually
 taking
 Papa


John's
 private,
 then
 you
 know,
 you
 might


see
 Papa
 John's
 get
 bought
 it
 at
 60


bucks.
 But
 that
 was
 the
 offer
 that
 came


out
 today.
 That's
 what
 caused
 the
 spike.


I
 think
 got
 it
 up
 to
 50
 bucks
 95
 at
 one


point.
 Now
 it's
 down
 to
 4565.
 But
 Domino


earnings
 are
 going to
 be
 important


because
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 see
 how


is
 the
 consumer
 doing.
 And
 pizza
 is
 one


sign
 of
 seeing
 how
 the
 consumer
 is


ultimately
 playing
 out.
 Uh
 here
 is
 what


Beimo
 said.
 This
 is
 one
 of
 my
 favorite


analysts
 on
 their
 call
 on
 where
 the


market's
 going,
 their
 kind
 of
 thoughts


on
 the
 China
 selloff
 and
 then
 we
 will


get
 into
 this
 market
 close.


>> That
 just
 that
 just
 came
 to
 me.
 But
 um
 I


think
 it
 was
 oh
 no,
 here
 we
 go
 again


with
 respect
 to
 the
 tariffs
 and
 we
 knew


that
 China
 was
 kind
 of
 the
 remaining


story.
 We
 also
 know
 as
 investors
 that


there's
 been
 so
 much
 emphasis
 not
 just


on
 AI
 Mike
 but
 also
 with
 respect
 to


Nvidia
 Broadcom
 and
 some
 of
 the
 big


leaders
 in
 that.
 So
 of
 course
 uh
 we
 took


some
 air
 out
 of
 the
 out
 of
 the
 wind


there
 and
 the
 sales
 in
 terms
 of
 of
 the


ship
 that
 is
 the
 bull
 market.
 You
 know


when
 we
 talk
 about
 markets
 they're


rarely
 linear
 for
 long.
 This
 has
 been
 a


very
 exciting
 bull
 market
 the
 cyclical


bull
 market
 that
 started
 in
 October
 of


2022.
 We
 actually
 started
 to
 talk
 about


that
 cyclical
 bull
 in
 November
 of
 2022


and
 kind
 of
 people
 thought
 we
 were
 too


early
 on
 that.
 But
 look
 look
 what
 look


what's
 happened.
 But
 I
 do
 I
 do
 think


that
 what's
 happened
 here
 today
 is
 a


logical
 kind
 of
 recovery
 from
 oops
 I'm


going
 to
 overreact
 again.
 And
 I
 think


we're
 in
 one
 of
 those
 markets
 that
 until


we
 get
 into
 earnest
 uh
 heavier
 earning


side
 of
 things,
 which
 we
 ultimately


think
 are
 going
 to
 be
 the
 leading
 us


kind
 of
 out
 of
 this,
 I
 think
 you're


going
 to
 continue
 to
 see
 more


volatility.
 Plus,
 it's
 Columbus
 Day,
 so


there's
 some
 people
 that
 are
 off.


>> Yeah.
 And
 of
 course,
 bond
 market
 is


closed.


>> So
 again,
 we
 don't
 have
 as
 much
 volume


as
 you
 would
 have
 on
 a
 typical
 day
 where


the
 entire
 market
 was
 open.
 But
 the
 same


argument
 from
 Beimo
 that's
 been
 calling


for
 7,000
 on
 the
 S&P
 for
 a
 while.
 and


and
 very
 similar
 to
 Morgan
 Stanley,
 JP


Morgan,
 Goldman
 Sachs.
 By
 the
 way,
 the


JP
 Morgan
 trading
 desk
 today
 said,
 "Buy


the
 dip."
 So,
 they
 said,
 "Hey,
 this
 is
 a


nothing
 burger
 that
 happened
 on
 on
 uh
 on


Friday."
 And
 that's
 kind
 of
 unanimously


across
 the
 board
 from
 what
 I've
 been


reading
 this
 morning.
 All
 of
 them
 are


saying
 this
 China
 thing
 was
 a
 nothing


burger.
 Trump
 is
 using
 leverage,
 yada


yada.
 It's
 like
 he's
 trying
 to
 negotiate


like
 it's
 not
 something
 they
 should
 be


that
 concerned
 about.
 In
 fact,
 JP
 Morgan


said
 the
 top
 three
 stocks
 that
 were


bought
 by
 retail
 investors
 on
 Friday's


3%
 draw
 down,
 and
 we're
 going to
 get
 a


lot
 more
 data
 on
 how
 much
 retail


actually
 bought
 on
 Friday
 in
 the
 coming


days.
 Nvidia,
 Meta,
 and
 Hood.
 Nvidia,


Meta,
 and
 Hood.
 I
 didn't
 expect
 to
 see


Hood
 up
 there,
 quite
 frankly.
 Nvidia
 and


Meta
 make
 sense,
 but
 I
 guess
 people
 took


advantage
 of
 of
 buying
 Hood
 as
 well.
 So,


those
 were
 the
 three
 names
 that
 were


bought
 heavily
 by
 retail
 investors.
 Um,


and
 you
 know,
 there
 was
 a
 lot
 of
 other


names
 that
 we
 saw
 in
 the
 chat
 on
 Friday,


but
 again,
 it
 became
 a
 buying


opportunity
 and
 we
 haven't
 had
 a
 full


recovery
 to
 say
 that
 we're
 out
 of
 the


blue
 in
 terms
 of
 or
 out
 of
 the
 woods,
 I


should
 say,
 in
 terms
 of
 all
 the
 issues


that
 we
 dealt
 with
 on
 Friday
 because,


you
 know,
 it
 still
 created
 a
 a


meaningful
 draw
 down.
 But
 another
 800


billion
 in
 market
 cap
 being
 added
 today


is
 not
 bad
 and
 it
 definitely
 is
 a
 sign


that
 hopefully
 we
 should
 be
 on
 a
 a
 path


for
 a
 recovery.
 And
 right
 there,
 188.35,


you
 got
 circle
 that
 was
 up
 3.6
 6%
 app


111
 this
 was
 at
 570
 in
 the
 morning
 590


that's
 up
 three
 and
 a
 half%
 nphase
 up


1.5
 and
 then
 Microsoft
 up
 half
 a
 percent


on
 the
 day
 as
 well
 and
 then
 Tesla
 right


there
 436


that
 is
 also
 green
 we
 are
 2%
 away
 from


alltime
 highs
 that
 is
 correct
 2%
 away


and
 you
 know
 given
 the
 market
 action


today
 it
 doesn't
 feel
 like
 it's
 going
 to


be
 crazy
 to
 necessarily
 get
 back
 there


if
 earnings
 growth
 is
 going
 to
 be
 good


and
 that's
 the
 big
 thing
 we
 have
 40


seconds
 until
 the
 market
 closes
 we
 got


earnings
 growth
 We
 got
 a
 lot.
 Well,
 we


have
 earnings
 coming
 up.
 I
 think
 we're


going
 to
 have
 really
 good
 earnings


growth.
 And
 as
 long
 as
 that
 earnings


growth
 is
 not
 bad,
 dude.
 Like
 again,


it's
 it's
 really
 not
 that
 hard
 to
 to


make
 the
 argument
 for
 why
 people
 are


buying
 stocks
 today.
 If
 you've
 got
 a


good
 earning
 cycle
 that's
 coming
 up
 and


the
 banks
 are
 going to
 help
 prove
 that


tomorrow,
 you're
 probably
 going
 to
 get


more
 money
 coming
 into
 the
 ecosystem.


AMD
 right
 there
 216
 at
 37.
 We
 got
 about


20
 seconds
 until
 the
 market
 closes.


Tesla
 435.
 Broadcom
 was
 the
 real
 story


of
 the
 day.
 We'll
 talk
 more
 about
 them


on
 the
 close
 and
 what's
 going
 on
 with


OpenAI.
 But
 OpenAI
 continues
 to
 prove


that
 uh
 they
 are
 one
 of
 the
 most


important
 companies
 in
 AI


and
 as
 a
 result
 uh
 Oracle,
 Broadcom,


AMD,
 Nvidia,
 all
 of
 them
 are
 starting
 to


depend
 a
 lot
 on
 what
 OpenAI
 can
 do.


Monday,
 October
 13th,
 4
 p.m.
 Banker
 for


everybody
 for
 being
 here.
 The
 stock


market
 is
 now
 closed.


All
 right,
 we
 are
 done
 for
 the
 day.
 The


Monday
 after


uh
 the
 selloff
 on
 Friday.
 I
 mean,
 there


were
 some
 people
 saying
 it
 would
 be
 a


black
 Monday.
 Thankfully,
 it
 didn't
 end


up
 being
 the
 craziest
 Black
 Monday,
 but


it
 is
 uh
 it
 is
 nice
 to
 see
 a
 bit
 of
 a


rebound
 right
 here.
 And
 this
 rebound


being
 stronger
 than
 what
 some
 market


participants
 expected.
 S&P
 500
 close
 of


the
 day
 1.52%
 up
 basically
 getting
 50%


of
 that
 3%
 draw
 down
 that
 we
 had
 on


Friday.
 And
 that's
 where
 we
 get
 the


close.
 Robin
 Hood
 140.70.
 We
 actually


have
 a
 news
 update
 on
 Robin
 Hood
 that


we'll
 talk
 about
 in
 a
 second.
 We
 have a


quote
 from
 one
 of
 their
 VPs
 of
 products.


So,
 we'll
 talk
 about
 that
 in
 a
 bit.


Palanteer
 right
 there
 ended
 up
 about
 1%


on
 the
 day.
 Tesla
 5
 and
 a
 half
 percent.


Not
 too
 bad
 for
 Tessie.
 Nvidia
 up
 2.89%.


Nvidia
 did
 break
 190
 at
 one
 point
 today.


AMD
 up
 half
 a
 percent.
 AMD
 seemed
 like


it
 was
 down
 based
 on
 that
 Broadcom
 deal.


I
 really
 don't
 think
 that's
 a
 reason
 for


AMD
 to
 be
 down.
 I
 mean,
 it's
 not
 like


OpenAI
 is
 not
 working
 with
 AMD.
 So,
 it


was
 kind
 of
 weird
 that
 it
 had
 that


reaction,
 but
 AMD
 was
 down
 a
 little
 bit


from
 the
 pre-market.
 SoFi
 4%
 on
 the
 day.


Google
 up
 3%.
 Grab
 up
 1%.
 Reddit
 up
 2.5.


Amazon
 at
 1.69
 69
 at
 220
 on
 the
 day.


Meta
 1.4
 that
 was
 at
 690
 on
 Friday.
 Now


at
 715.
 Salesforce
 at
 258
 or
 248.
 PayPal


continually.


It's
 PayPal,
 dude.
 I
 I
 It's
 freaking


PayPal.
 68.90
 on
 PayPal
 that
 was
 down


about
 1%.
 ELF
 2.3%.
 Apple
 was
 up
 1%.


SMCI
 was
 up
 3%.
 Ethereum
 trying
 to
 break


4,300.
 Bitcoin
 115.8.
 Apploven
 that's
 up


three
 and a
 half.
 Uber
 was
 up
 1%
 on
 the


day.
 Rockab
 I
 think
 closed
 at
 68.
 Rock


11,
 never
 mind.
 6542.
 Still
 a
 nice


little
 rebound
 up
 1.8%
 on
 the
 day.
 Nebas


got
 the
 $135
 close.
 Not
 too
 bad.


Coreweave
 I
 think
 actually
 had
 a
 little


bit
 of
 a
 dip.
 No,
 it
 recovered.
 It
 was


dipping
 in
 the
 morning
 now
 back
 to
 141.


Fell
 all
 the
 way
 to
 137
 which
 is
 not
 too


bad.
 I
 Bit
 Farms,
 Cipher,
 all
 of
 them
 up


7
 to
 8%
 on
 the
 day.
 Many
 of
 them
 up
 even


20%
 like
 Cipher.
 There
 you
 go.
 Up
 20.1%.


That
 was
 green.
 Quantum
 massive
 massive


day
 across
 the
 board.
 D-Wave
 hitting


all-time
 highs
 up
 22%
 on
 the
 day.
 Oracle


as
 well.
 Did
 we
 get
 above
 300?
 We
 are


307
 up
 5%
 on
 the
 day.
 Great
 day
 for


Oracle.
 Looks
 like
 that
 Broadcom
 deal


was
 super
 bullish
 for
 Oracle
 as
 well.


Catching
 some
 of
 that
 momentum.
 And
 then


Broadcom
 right
 there
 up
 9.8%.
 Big
 Bear


got
 a
 partnership
 this
 morning.
 Uh
 and


that
 helped
 them
 get
 some
 green.
 That


touched
 920
 at
 one
 point.
 22%
 on
 Big


Bear.
 I
 mean,
 it
 shows
 you
 the
 appetite


on
 some
 of
 these
 names
 is
 pretty
 damn


strong.
 That's
 green
 again.
 This
 thing


was
 below
 five
 a
 couple
 months
 ago.
 So


big
 bear
 with
 that
 partnership
 this


morning
 8.85.


That
 one
 continues
 to
 be
 green.
 I
 guess


the
 most
 important
 argument
 one
 could


argue
 is
 not
 even
 Broadcom
 Open
 AAI
 but


rather
 gold.
 Gold
 surpassed
 an
 all-time


high
 again.
 4125
 up
 3%
 on
 the
 day.
 And


silver
 did
 the
 same
 thing
 at
 $503.


I
 mean
 gold
 and
 silver
 are
 both
 up
 70%.


Gold
 up
 55.
 Silver
 is
 up
 like
 68%.


It's
 really
 incredible.
 It's
 really,


really,
 really,
 really
 incredible
 to


see.
 But
 I
 think
 this
 is
 also
 a
 function


of
 that
 broader
 argument
 that
 says,
 hey,


cash
 is
 not
 the
 place
 where
 you
 want
 to


be.
 And
 if
 cash
 is
 not
 the
 place
 where


you
 want
 to
 be,
 you're
 going
 to
 start
 to


see
 a
 lot
 of
 diversified
 assets
 continue


to
 catch
 a
 bid.
 So,
 pretty
 incredible
 to


end
 out
 the
 Friday
 after
 one
 of the


worst
 sell-offs
 we've
 seen
 in
 the
 past


six
 months.
 AS
 gets
 the
 $90
 close.


Congratulations
 to
 those
 that
 are
 in
 AS.


This
 is
 a
 big
 one.
 It
 basically
 was


about
 to
 get
 the
 $90
 close
 on
 Friday
 and


then
 the
 whole
 Trump
 thing
 happened.
 So,


this
 one
 rebounding
 a
 real
 proper
 Vshape


down
 from
 the
 low
 80s
 back
 up
 to
 90.
 And


as
 John
 says
 right
 there
 in
 the
 chat,


7.4
 trillion
 is
 still
 in
 money
 market


funds,
 which
 inevitably


probably
 some
 of
 it
 comes
 out.
 EOS


Energy,
 another
 big
 energy
 name
 that
 was


up
 24%
 on
 the
 day.
 I
 mean,
 I
 think
 today


was
 just
 one
 of
 those
 days
 for
 energy.


And
 the
 reason
 I
 think
 the
 energy
 names


took
 off
 outside
 of
 Bloom
 Energy
 because


they
 had
 a
 specific
 reason
 with
 their


Brookfield
 deal
 is
 that
 OpenAI


partnership
 with
 Broadcom.
 I
 mean,
 when


Sam
 Alman
 is
 talking
 about
 the
 numbers


that
 he's
 talking
 about,
 I
 think
 the


entire
 market
 is
 thinking,
 how
 is
 this


possible
 without
 more
 power?
 And
 as
 a


result,
 these
 names
 end
 up
 getting
 a
 lot


of
 love.
 This
 is
 a
 clip
 of
 Sam
 Alman
 as


we
 head
 into
 some
 of
 the
 headlines
 now


as
 the
 market
 is
 closed
 um
 talking
 about


how
 much
 energy
 and
 how
 much
 demand


we're
 ultimately
 going
 to
 need.


Think
 about
 how
 much
 more
 the
 world


would
 like
 to
 do
 than
 they
 get
 to
 do


right
 now.
 Think
 about
 how
 much
 more
 the


world
 would
 like
 to
 do
 than
 they
 get
 to


do
 right
 now.
 If
 we
 had
 30
 gawatt
 today


with
 today's
 quality
 of
 models,


I
 think
 you
 would
 still
 saturate
 that


relatively
 quickly
 in
 terms
 of
 what


people
 would
 do,
 especially
 with
 the


lower
 cost
 we'll
 be
 able
 to
 do
 with


this.
 But
 the
 thing


>> if
 we
 had
 30
 gawatts
 of
 energy
 that
 we


could
 deploy
 on
 data
 centers,
 Sam
 Alman


is
 saying
 that
 still
 wouldn't
 be
 enough.


I
 mean
 that's
 the
 level
 that
 open
 AI
 is


thinking
 at
 and
 maybe
 they're
 being
 too


hyperbolic
 or
 maybe
 they're
 really


underestimating
 it
 but
 that
 is
 why
 I


think
 your
 ciphers
 your
 INS
 your
 ters


your
 bit
 farms
 are
 really
 catching
 a
 bit


>> we
 have
 learned
 again
 and
 again
 is
 let's


say
 we
 can
 push
 GPT6
 to
 feel
 like


you
 know
 30
 IQ
 points
 past
 GPT5


something
 something
 big
 the
 and
 that
 it


can
 work
 on
 problems
 not
 for
 a
 few
 hours


but
 for
 a
 few
 days
 weeks
 months
 whatever


the
 amount
 and
 while
 we
 do
 that
 we
 bring


the
 cost
 per
 token
 down
 the
 amount
 of


economic
 value
 and
 sort
 of
 surplus


demand
 that
 happens
 each
 time
 we've
 been


able
 to
 do
 that
 goes
 up
 a
 crazy
 amount


so
 you
 can
 see
 to
 pick
 a
 I
 think


well-known
 example
 at
 this
 point
 when


chat
 GBT
 could
 write
 a
 little
 bit
 of


code
 people
 actually
 used
 it
 for
 that
 it


would
 like
 very
 painfully
 paste
 in
 their


code
 and
 wait
 and
 they
 would
 say
 do
 this


for
 me
 and
 paste
 it
 back
 in
 and
 whatever


and
 models
 you
 know
 couldn't
 do
 much
 but


they
 could
 do
 a
 few


The
 models
 got
 better.
 The
 UI
 the
 UX
 got


better.
 Now
 we
 have
 codecs.
 Codeex
 is


growing
 unbelievably
 fast
 and
 can
 now
 do


like
 a
 few
 hours
 of
 work


at
 a
 higher
 level
 of
 kind
 of
 capability.


And
 when
 that's
 possible,
 the
 the
 demand


increase
 is
 crazy.
 Maybe
 the
 next


version
 of
 codecs
 can
 do
 like
 a
 few
 days


of
 work
 at
 kind
 of
 one
 of
 the
 best


engineer
 you
 know
 level
 or
 maybe
 that


takes
 a
 few
 more
 versions.
 Whatever


it'll
 get
 there.
 Think
 how
 much
 demand


there
 will
 just
 be
 for
 that
 and
 then
 do


it
 for
 every
 knowledge
 work
 industry.


>> Okay.
 So
 I
 know
 his
 voice
 is
 a
 little


hard
 to
 to
 listen
 to
 but
 the
 point
 is


he's
 saying
 hey
 we
 have
 multiple


verticals
 that
 are
 going
 to
 have
 levels


of
 demand
 that
 we
 can't
 even
 imagine
 and


as
 a
 result
 30
 gawatts
 of
 energy


wouldn't
 be
 enough
 because
 just
 the


coding
 version
 of
 chatbt
 which
 right
 now


I
 think
 anthropic
 is
 kind
 of the


undisputed
 winner
 in
 terms
 of
 being
 the


best
 model
 that
 can
 uh
 actually
 output


meaningful
 code
 uh
 chach
 is
 or
 openi
 is


saying
 codeex
 which
 is
 our
 version
 of


that
 is
 growing
 exponentially
 then
 they


have
 sora
 then
 they
 have
 the
 actual


chatbt
 product.
 Then
 they
 have
 all
 their


enterprise
 API
 calls.
 I
 mean
 you
 have


all
 these
 different
 verticals
 and
 now


multiply
 that
 by
 XAI
 by
 Gemini
 by


anthropic
 by
 all
 the
 large
 language


model
 companies.
 I
 mean
 you
 just
 have
 a


massive
 amount
 of
 comp.
 And
 then
 you
 you


think
 about
 the
 humanoid
 robotics


companies
 that
 are
 going
 to
 need
 to


train
 their
 chips
 to
 be
 able
 to
 be
 good


for
 the
 humanoid
 robots.
 And
 if
 you
 have


billions
 of
 robots
 walking
 the
 earth
 one


day
 like
 it
 just
 really
 does
 feel
 like


this
 is
 the
 narrative
 that
 is
 overtaking


the
 market.
 And
 even
 though
 a
 lot of


these
 data
 center
 companies
 don't
 have


the
 revenue,
 they
 don't
 have
 the


facilities
 or
 they
 don't
 have
 the


ability
 to
 execute
 on
 the
 facilities
 as


quickly
 as
 some
 people
 may
 think,


they're
 getting
 the
 premium.
 And
 the


best
 ones
 are
 getting
 a
 really
 good


premium
 like
 Iran
 because
 they've
 shown


a
 lot
 of
 capacity
 to
 to
 actually
 execute


um
 because
 the
 demand
 is
 there.
 And
 if


the
 demand
 is
 there,
 it's
 likely
 not


slowing
 down
 anytime
 soon.
 Uh,
 speaking


of
 OpenAI,
 this
 is
 what
 Oracle
 CEOs
 had


to
 say
 today
 when
 they
 were
 questioned


on
 if
 the
 money
 would
 be
 there
 uh,
 from


OpenAI
 because
 the
 reason
 their
 stock


went
 from
 230
 to
 300
 is
 primarily


because
 of
 that
 OpenAI
 deal.
 Here's
 what


they
 had
 to
 say.


>> It's
 a
 bet
 on
 the
 success
 of
 AI.


Obviously,
 we
 have
 a
 great
 relationship


with
 Open
 AI,
 but
 there
 are
 many


different
 customers
 that
 are
 all
 going


to
 need
 this
 type
 of
 infrastructure
 for


many,
 many
 years
 to
 come.


>> Meaning
 what
 though?
 I
 mean,
 they're
 I


mean,
 they're
 supposed
 to
 pay
 you
 as


much
 as
 60
 billion
 a
 year
 starting
 in


not
 too
 long.
 They're
 going
 to
 be
 good


for
 that
 money,
 I
 would
 assume.


>> Of
 course.
 No,
 I
 I
 think
 any
 look,


that's
 this
 is
 exactly
 Mike's
 point.
 If


you
 look
 at
 the
 financials,
 if
 you
 look


at
 the
 results,
 if
 you
 look
 at
 the


growth,
 if
 if
 you
 look
 at
 the
 the


products
 that
 were
 able
 to
 build
 with


this
 technology,
 this
 is
 unlike
 anything


that's
 happened
 before.
 These
 are
 not
 uh


typical
 ways
 that
 companies
 have
 been


founded
 and
 grow.
 I
 mean,
 just
 look
 at


their
 their,
 you
 know,
 f
 the
 rate
 at


which
 they've
 grown
 to,
 you
 know,
 almost


a
 billion
 users.
 That's
 just
 unheard
 of.


Yeah.
 And


>> all
 of
 this
 is
 unheard
 of,
 frankly.
 The


numbers
 that
 we're
 talking
 about
 are


unheard
 of
 as
 well.


>> And
 I
 think
 that's
 what
 people
 are


struggling
 with
 is
 they
 go,
 "Okay,
 is


this
 unheard
 of
 in
 a
 bad
 way
 or
 is
 this


unheard
 of
 in
 a
 good
 way?"
 And
 we
 think


it's
 unheard
 of
 in
 a
 very
 good
 way.


>> Um,
 you
 know,
 I
 wanted
 to
 follow
 up
 on


that
 then.


>> So,
 again,
 you
 got
 the
 Oracle
 CEOs


saying,
 "Dude,
 of
 course,
 that's
 their


exact
 wording.
 Of
 course,
 they're
 good


for
 that
 money.
 They
 are
 expecting
 to


make
 sure
 that
 open
 eyes
 openai
 is
 going


to
 be able
 to
 pay
 for
 this
 stuff
 and
 you


know
 as
 long
 as
 openai
 is
 good
 for
 that


money
 and
 there's
 an
 ROI
 and
 you
 hear


the
 Oracle
 CEO
 saying
 look
 at
 their


growth
 we
 expect
 that
 growth
 to
 continue


that's
 how
 I
 think
 this
 momentum
 around


the
 broader
 AI
 trade
 continues
 by
 the


way
 Palanteer
 looks
 like
 they
 just


confirmed
 earnings
 on
 November
 3rd


Monday
 November
 3rd
 I
 know
 Pounder
 has


been
 relatively
 quiet
 over
 the
 past


couple
 months
 I
 mean
 the
 biggest


catalyst
 is
 going
 to
 be
 earnings
 there


hasn't


too
 much
 beside
 that.
 Uh,
 but
 I
 think


the
 numbers
 will
 probably
 talk
 for


themselves.
 I
 mean,
 I'm
 expecting
 at


least
 50%
 revenue
 growth.
 We
 basically


got
 48.5%
 revenue
 growth
 last
 quarter.


So,
 looks
 like
 November
 3rd,
 we
 have


Pounder
 and
 then
 Hoodie
 on
 November
 5th.


Hoodie
 on
 November
 5th.
 So,
 that
 first


week
 of
 Monday
 or
 that
 first
 week
 of


November,
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 pretty
 big


week.
 It's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 pretty
 pretty


big
 week.
 Uh,
 Amit,
 are
 you
 going
 to
 do


a
 deep
 dive
 on
 energy?
 Yes,
 I've
 already


started
 a
 lot
 of
 research
 on
 energy.
 I'm


compiling
 a
 lot
 of
 sources
 trying
 to


understand
 what
 are
 the
 best


opportunities.
 Steve
 has
 been
 doing
 some


research
 on
 this
 as
 well.
 I
 mean,
 really


with
 energy,
 it
 comes
 down
 to
 are
 are


you
 going
 to
 bet
 on
 like
 a
 rerating
 on


Exxon
 Mobile
 or
 Chevron
 or
 are
 you
 going


to
 go
 to
 the
 EOS
 E
 of
 the
 world
 or
 the


Bloom
 Energies
 of the
 world
 or
 the


Oakloss
 of
 the
 world
 or
 the
 Centric


Energies
 of
 the
 world?
 Like
 I
 think
 and


obviously
 you
 could
 pick
 both,
 but
 like


what
 is
 kind
 of
 the
 best
 route
 logically


going
 into
 2026
 if
 one
 is
 bullish
 on


energy?
 I
 don't
 have
 the
 answer
 to
 that


question
 yet,
 but
 I
 have
 started
 the


research
 for
 it.
 I'm
 leaning
 towards
 the


latter
 versus
 the
 former.
 I
 mean,
 I


think
 Chevron
 and
 Exxon
 will
 matter,
 but


some
 of
 these
 other
 companies
 and
 just


like
 the
 battery
 technology
 solutions
 in


some
 of
 these
 company
 like
 they're


they're
 able
 to
 move
 faster
 and
 quite


frankly,
 their
 market
 caps
 are
 smaller.


So,
 any
 catalyst
 is
 able
 to
 move
 the


stock
 faster
 and
 so
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of


those
 names


continue
 to
 get
 some
 excitement.
 But


yeah,
 I
 have
 started
 working
 on
 that
 and


hopefully
 I'll
 be able
 to
 put
 out
 their


research
 very
 soon.
 Bit
 mine
 right
 here


56.85
 85
 closes
 above
 56
 for
 the
 day.


Not
 too
 bad.
 That's
 up
 a
 little
 bit
 more


after
 hours
 as
 well.


And
 that's
 getting
 some
 green


along
 with
 some
 of
 the
 energy
 names
 that


are
 still
 moving
 after
 hours.
 S&P


500,002%


for
 the
 day.
 CEG
 is
 a
 bigger
 one.
 I


mean,
 that
 stock
 is
 Constellation


Energy.
 They
 signed
 a
 big
 deal
 with


Meta.
 They
 were
 up
 3%
 on
 the
 day.
 See


even
 CEG
 there
 was
 no
 catalyst
 for
 CG
 to


go
 up
 today
 but
 you
 know
 just
 the
 entire


sector
 went
 up
 based
 on
 that
 Broadcom


deal
 57%
 year-to-
 date.
 So
 the
 other


question
 is
 which
 is
 important
 like
 is


is
 are
 the
 like
 and
 this
 is
 a
 very


important
 question
 are
 these
 stocks


so
 richly
 valued
 that
 uh
 deciding
 to


take
 a
 bet
 on
 these
 energy
 names
 could


end
 up
 being
 you
 know
 not
 the
 best
 bet.


like
 maybe,
 you
 know,
 these
 were
 good


bets
 5
 months
 ago
 and
 now
 it's
 getting
 a


bit
 aggressive.
 I
 mean,
 even
 the
 rare


earth
 mineral
 stocks,
 take
 a
 look
 at


this
 graphic
 right
 here.
 They're
 all
 up


at
 least
 350%.


On
 the
 year,
 most
 of
 these
 rare
 earth


names
 that
 we've
 been
 like
 just


exploring
 on
 the
 channel
 as
 we've
 been


seeing
 their
 names
 pop
 up.
 They
 don't


have
 any
 revenue.
 they
 are
 getting
 a


premium
 on
 the
 perception
 that
 the


decoupling
 of
 the
 United
 States
 and


China
 supply
 chain
 specifically
 around


rare
 earth
 minerals
 and
 metals
 is
 going


to
 be
 enough
 to
 provide
 all
 that
 demand


which
 is
 not
 a
 horrible
 thesis
 and
 same


thing
 for
 from
 an
 energy
 perspective
 a


lot of
 those
 companies
 that
 don't
 have


revenue
 eventually
 the
 assumption
 is


that
 data
 centers
 are
 going
 to
 need
 so


much
 energy
 that
 they
 should
 be
 getting


a
 premium
 and
 we
 should
 pull
 forward


that
 growth
 but
 none
 of
 it's
 there
 yet


and
 so
 it's
 one
 of
 those
 things
 in
 the


deep
 dive
 which
 is
 like
 hey
 do
 you
 feel


comfortable
 taking
 a
 risk
 at
 these


valuations


And
 I
 don't
 know
 yet.
 I
 don't
 know.


There's
 got
 to
 be
 some
 more
 work
 to
 be


done
 to
 see
 if
 that
 is
 the
 case.


But
 I
 think
 over
 the
 coming
 years,
 it


doesn't
 seem
 unlikely
 that
 we're
 not


going
 to
 need
 energy
 and
 we're
 not
 going


to
 need
 rare
 earth
 metals
 and
 all
 the


other
 things
 that
 have
 been
 starting
 to


get
 some
 excitement.
 I
 mean,
 are
 there


any
 stocks
 currently
 with
 any
 good
 entry


points
 to
 get
 into
 or
 is
 it
 all
 too


high?
 I
 mean,
 look,
 the
 the
 draw
 down


from
 Friday
 definitely
 made
 a
 lot
 of


things
 more
 exciting.
 I
 think
 grabb


below
 six
 is
 exciting.
 I
 think
 Amazon


still
 at
 220
 is
 exciting.
 I
 mean,
 even


Meta
 was
 at
 800.
 It's
 not
 like
 Meta
 is


the
 cheapest,
 but
 Meta
 is
 also
 not
 back


at
 800
 like
 it
 was
 two
 months
 ago,


right?
 Obviously,
 PayPal
 if
 you
 want
 to


take
 the
 risk
 there,
 but
 that's


relatively
 depressed.
 Um,
 I
 mean,
 there


are
 definitely
 opportunities
 now.
 You


know,
 Apploven,
 are
 you
 willing
 to
 deal


with
 the
 SEC
 probe?
 This
 is
 down
 from


750.
 It
 is
 an
 opportunity.
 You
 just
 have


to
 be
 able
 to
 assess
 the
 risk.
 I
 don't


think
 Ramad's
 like
 the
 best
 opportunity


in
 the
 world
 down
 from
 150.
 But


nonetheless,
 it's
 not
 at
 153
 anymore.
 So


that
 is
 also
 potentially
 an
 opportunity.


But
 realistically,
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of


these
 names
 come
 down
 to
 do
 you
 have
 a


trajectory
 where
 you
 can
 see
 the


earnings
 growth
 over
 the
 next
 five


years.
 If
 that's
 the
 case,
 a
 lot
 of
 the


market
 probably
 is
 not
 as
 expensive
 as


people
 would
 say
 it
 is.
 In
 fact,
 someone


who
 disagrees
 with
 the
 market
 being


super
 super
 bubbish
 is
 none
 other
 than


Howard
 Mark.
 So
 for
 those
 that
 missed
 it


today,
 he
 said
 three
 main
 things.
 Number


one,
 he
 said,
 "I
 don't
 see
 many
 in
 the


market
 right
 now."
 Yeah.
 UNH,
 that's


another
 uh
 stock
 that's
 probably


undervalued.
 S&P
 is
 expensive,
 but
 the


quality
 of
 companies
 are
 much
 better,


and
 I'd
 struggle
 to
 call
 the
 market
 a


bubble
 right
 now.
 I
 mean,
 I
 did
 not


expect
 Howard
 Marks
 to
 be
 this
 bullish.


And
 I'm
 not
 saying
 he's
 like
 gung-ho,


buy
 the
 S&P,
 buy
 AI
 stocks
 because
 he


doesn't
 have
 any
 exposure
 to
 them.
 But


dude,
 a
 month
 ago,
 if
 you
 listen
 to
 his


Bloomberg
 interview,
 he
 definitely


sounded
 way
 more
 cautious
 than
 he


sounded
 this
 morning
 on
 CNBC.
 And
 I


don't
 know
 what
 changed
 in
 the
 past


month.
 maybe
 he
 just
 saw
 a
 little
 bit


more
 of
 the
 uh
 actual
 progress
 of
 some


of
 these
 AI
 companies
 and
 he
 kind
 of


concluded
 you
 can't
 say
 that
 this
 is


mania
 euphoria
 if
 the
 earnings
 growth
 is


there.
 I
 mean,
 no
 fund
 manager,
 no


matter
 how
 much
 of
 a
 value
 investor
 they


are
 and
 how
 much
 they
 don't
 want
 to
 pay


expensive
 multiples,
 can
 deny
 earnings


growth.
 And
 I
 think
 that's
 why,
 you


know,
 the
 market
 continues
 to
 do
 what


it's
 doing.
 Definitely
 not
 the
 most


bullish,
 but
 also,
 I
 don't
 think,
 the


most
 bearish
 on
 what
 we
 have
 in
 the


market.
 UNH,
 how
 did
 that
 do
 today?
 That


was
 at
 350.
 359.
 Okay,
 so
 that
 was
 up


1.2%
 as
 well
 on
 the
 day.
 Let's
 go
 to
 the


stock
 draft.
 I
 think
 Matt's
 still


probably
 in
 the
 lead
 right
 here.
 Yeah,


Matt
 46.7.


I'm
 at
 41.
 Steve's
 at
 8.3.
 Tanner's
 at


21.
 Then
 Chris


is
 at
 12%


on
 the
 day.
 Do
 you
 think
 we'll
 ever
 see


April
 lows
 again?
 I
 think
 it's
 possible,


but
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 really
 tough
 to
 see


April
 lows.
 I
 mean,
 April
 lows,
 you're


talking
 about
 Robin
 Hood
 going
 back
 to


29.


You
 know,
 you're
 talking
 about
 Irene


going
 back
 to
 $10.
 No,
 I
 was
 like
 a
 $7


during
 like
 it
 it
 is
 hard
 to
 get
 those


opportunities
 again.


I
 think
 Friday
 was
 like
 a
 good
 enough


taste
 of
 what
 somewhat
 of
 a
 draw
 down


would
 look
 like.
 But
 then
 look
 at
 what


happened
 today.
 The
 dip
 buyers
 came
 back


on
 a
 day
 where
 you
 know
 a
 lot
 of


financial
 institutions
 are
 closed


including
 the
 credit
 market
 and
 the


banks.
 But
 still
 so
 much
 money
 came
 into


the
 markets
 today
 just
 off
 the
 idea
 that


maybe
 this
 is
 one
 of
 the
 best


opportunities
 that
 we
 have.
 So
 I
 don't


think
 we
 get
 April
 lows
 again
 but
 we


might
 you
 know
 see
 some
 inevitable
 dips


across
 the
 way.
 Amcore
 nice
 8%
 move


today.
 I
 mean
 again
 amcor
 did
 not


deserve
 to
 go
 to
 2850.
 The
 stock
 is


relatively
 cheap
 in
 my
 opinion,
 trading


at
 1.15
 time
 sales.
 So
 for
 anyone
 that


got
 in
 last
 week
 at
 28
 or
 29,
 you
 had


that
 opportunity
 on
 Friday
 and
 it
 jumped


up
 on
 relatively
 little
 volume,
 too.
 I


think
 this
 was
 just
 algorithmic
 that


this
 one
 didn't
 deserve
 to
 be
 down
 as


much
 as
 it
 was
 down.
 And
 so
 it
 made
 a


move
 higher
 back
 to
 kind
 of
 where
 it
 was


trading
 at
 before
 the
 draw
 down.
 And
 I


think
 that
 happened
 to
 a
 lot
 of


different
 stocks
 today.
 Like
 SoFi
 went


from
 25
 to
 27.
 I
 mean,
 nothing
 really


changed
 last
 Friday
 to
 bring
 it
 down
 to


25.
 Nothing
 really
 changed
 today
 to


bring
 it
 back
 to
 27.
 So
 a
 lot of
 these


names
 just
 kind
 of
 rebounded.
 Same
 thing


with
 Google.
 went
 from
 232
 to
 244,


but
 he
 created
 opportunities.


He
 created
 opportunities


for
 a
 ton
 of
 different
 people.
 Is
 Tim


Cook
 stepping
 down?
 I
 don't
 think
 so.


That
 headline
 would
 be
 pretty
 wild.
 Tim


Cook.
 Now,
 there
 was
 a
 uh
 there
 was
 a


report
 from
 Bloomberg
 last
 week
 that
 um


one
 of
 Apple's
 VPs,
 this
 guy
 right
 here,


John
 Turnis,
 is
 getting
 ready
 to
 replace


Tim
 Cook.


I
 don't
 think
 they
 would
 announce
 that


until
 the
 beginning
 of
 next
 year
 if
 it


does
 happen.
 If
 they
 announced
 it
 on
 the


earnings
 call,
 that
 would
 be
 kind
 of


crazy.
 I
 mean,
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of


investors
 would
 need
 some
 time
 to
 be


associate
 or
 learn
 how
 to
 associate


themselves
 with
 a
 new
 C.
 I
 mean,
 Apple's


an
 important
 company.
 It's
 6.2%
 of
 the


S&P
 500.


So,
 that
 would
 be
 a
 big
 change.
 So,
 I


feel
 like
 they
 would
 make
 that


announcement
 in
 a
 different
 way.
 He's


You
 guys
 are
 saying
 he's
 retiring.
 I


mean,
 I
 don't
 see
 the
 headline
 of
 him.
 I


feel
 like
 Apple
 stock
 would
 give
 us
 a


reaction
 if
 he's
 retiring.


I
 mean,
 eventually
 he
 is,
 but
 probably


not
 today.


At least
 we
 don't
 see
 that
 news
 today.


But
 we
 will
 keep
 an
 eye
 on
 what
 goes
 on


with
 Apple.
 Apple
 stock
 right
 there


at
 24750.


Um,


Bit
 Farms
 won't
 quit,
 dude.
 Bit
 farms,


this
 thing
 was
 below
 $5
 in
 the


pre-markets.
 was
 like
 450
 continuing
 to


move
 after
 hours.
 Now,
 see,
 here's
 the


thing.
 Like,
 is
 this
 just
 a
 sympathy


trade
 with
 Cipher
 and
 Iran?
 For
 all
 the


people
 that
 miss
 Cipher,
 I
 ran
 Terolf,


are
 they
 just
 jumping
 into
 Bit
 Farms?
 Or


did
 Bit
 Farms
 announce
 something
 that
 is


making
 the
 stock
 go
 parabolic
 after


hours?
 I
 mean,
 I
 don't
 see
 I
 didn't
 see


a
 headline
 all
 day
 from
 Bit
 Farms.


I
 don't
 see
 a
 headline
 after
 hours
 on


Bit
 Farms.


So,
 what
 is
 it?


I
 mean,
 I
 think
 it
 could
 be
 a
 mixture
 of


both,
 but
 just
 the
 sheer
 excitement
 I


think
 is
 getting
 more
 and
 more
 people


excited.


A
 mid
 to
 use
 stock
 lending
 feature
 on


Hood.
 I
 think
 I
 have
 that
 enabled.
 It


gets
 you
 like,
 you
 know,
 30
 40
 bucks
 a


month
 if
 you
 loan
 out
 your
 shares
 to


short.
 So,
 I
 have
 to
 check
 if
 it's
 even


enabled
 or
 not,
 but
 it's
 not
 uh
 it's
 not


the
 biggest
 feature
 for
 me.
 But
 if
 you


have
 a
 lot
 of
 shares
 of
 a
 stock,
 then


it,
 you
 know,
 stock
 lending
 definitely


does
 add
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 yield
 to
 your


to
 your
 shares.
 Wolf
 right
 here,
 are
 we


18
 after
 hours?
 Terowolf
 1396.


Not
 there
 yet.


Uh
 I
 have
 not
 looked
 into
 NKLR.
 I
 know


this
 is
 the
 alternative
 to
 Oaklo
 that


people
 are
 thinking
 of.
 This
 is
 a
 this


is
 um


this
 is
 another
 nuclear
 name.
 NKLR.


It
 was
 up
 today
 just
 with
 like
 just
 like


Oaklo.
 Isn't
 this
 a
 spa?
 Yeah,
 this
 is
 a


spa
 company.
 So,
 it's
 up
 84%.


It
 It
 spacked
 on
 Thursday.


And
 the
 reason
 it's
 up
 is
 probably


because
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 think
 it's
 going


to
 spack
 into
 some
 massive
 nuclear
 name.


And
 that's
 why
 that's
 green.


I
 mean,
 again,
 dude,
 a
 lot
 of
 these


names,
 they're
 just
 like
 they're
 running


for
 the
 hell
 of
 running
 with
 it,
 which
 I


think
 deserve
 some
 caution,
 but
 they're


also
 in
 sectors
 that
 matter,
 and
 it's


hard
 to
 deny
 that
 those
 sectors
 are


going
 to
 continue
 to
 matter.
 This
 was


Trump
 today.
 He
 was
 at
 uh
 Egypt


announcing
 the
 Israel
 Hamas
 deal,
 and


here's
 what
 he
 said
 about
 World
 War
 II.


>> Means
 so
 much.
 There
 was
 so
 many
 people


who
 said
 the
 Middle
 East,
 and
 this
 has


been
 going
 for
 many,
 many
 decades.
 I've


read
 it
 many
 times
 that
 World
 War
 III


will
 begin
 in
 the
 Middle
 East.
 It's
 not


going
 to
 happen.
 That's
 not
 going
 to


happen.
 It
 was
 a
 time
 that
 you
 would


have
 thought
 it
 could
 have,
 but
 it's
 not


going
 to
 happen.
 There
 won't
 be
 World


War
 II
 hopefully
 at
 all,
 but
 it's
 not


going
 to
 start
 in
 the
 Middle
 East.
 We're


not
 going
 to
 have
 a
 World
 War
 II
 if


we're
 smart.
 Never
 be
 a
 World
 War
 II.


Means
 so
 much.
 It
 was
 so
 many
 people
 who


said


>> it
 was
 a
 pretty
 long
 peace
 summit.
 You


had
 a
 bunch
 of
 European
 leaders


including
 the
 UK
 prime
 minister,


uh,
 Italy's
 president
 Mcronone
 was


there.
 So
 you
 had
 a
 bunch
 of
 the


Europeans
 that
 were
 there.
 And
 um,
 look,


Trump
 is
 getting
 the
 credit
 from
 a
 lot


of
 different
 parties.
 I
 mean,
 even
 Time


magazine
 put
 him
 on
 the
 front
 cover
 and


said
 that
 underneath
 this
 president
 is


when
 you
 finally
 got
 some
 peace
 in
 the


Middle
 East.
 So
 from
 a
 market


perspective,
 the
 question
 is
 going
 to


be,
 hey,
 do
 the
 markets
 interpret
 this


as
 positive
 just
 because
 there's
 going


to
 be
 less
 geopolitical
 instability


outside
 of
 what's
 going
 on
 with
 Russia


and
 Ukraine?
 And
 we're
 going to
 see
 over


the
 coming
 months,
 but
 it's
 definitely


not
 a
 bearish
 thing


to
 see
 happen
 in
 the
 in
 the
 broader


markets.


Um,


I
 think
 Carney
 was
 there.
 Not
 sure
 if


Carney
 was
 there,
 but
 I
 think
 I
 think
 he


was.


Uh,
 H
 O
 N
 D.
 Have
 I
 looked
 into
 that?


No.
 I've
 heard
 of
 this
 name.
 Oh,
 this
 is


another
 Spack.
 Goodness
 gracious,
 bro.


Who
 put
 Who's
 sponsoring
 HD?
 That
 That


Spack
 was
 up
 10%
 today.
 When
 did
 this


one
 even
 go
 live?
 I
 mean,
 Tom
 Lee
 still


has
 a
 spack
 that
 hasn't
 officially
 gone.


Oh,
 this
 has
 been
 live
 since
 like


January.


So,
 who
 who's
 sponsoring


HD
 D?


Um,
 it's
 Priestback.


I
 have
 no
 idea
 who's
 a
 sponsor
 for
 that,


but
 whoever
 is,
 I
 mean,
 see,
 look,
 this


is
 so,
 okay,
 so
 one
 thing
 that's
 really


important
 as
 we
 get
 into
 this
 time
 of


the
 year,
 and
 you
 know,
 some
 people


might
 like
 hearing
 this,
 some
 people


might
 not
 not
 might
 not
 like
 hearing


this,
 but
 you
 don't
 have
 to
 chase


everything.
 You
 really
 don't
 have
 to


chase
 anything.
 I
 mean,
 I
 have
 not


really
 been
 into
 the
 rare
 earth
 metals


or
 the
 the
 the
 super
 super
 speculative


energy
 names
 like
 an
 EOS
 or
 an
 Oll
 or


stuff.
 And
 I'm
 like,
 honestly,
 bro,
 I'm


not
 really
 feeling
 that
 much
 FOMO


because
 it's
 been
 a
 good
 year.
 I
 kind
 of


don't
 want
 to
 mess
 it
 up
 by
 getting


super
 excited
 about
 Ollo
 at
 171.
 It's


like,
 you
 know,
 if
 it
 goes
 to
 250,
 God


bless,
 but
 like
 I
 don't
 know if
 I
 want


to
 take
 that
 risk.


So,


I
 already
 kind
 of
 fumbled
 into
 Iran
 at


28.
 should
 have
 should
 have
 fomoed
 way


harder
 at
 28.
 But
 like
 at
 64,
 I
 don't


know
 if
 I'm
 going
 to
 easily
 be
 able
 to


FOMO
 into
 it.
 I
 just
 don't.
 Even
 though


I
 think
 there's
 a
 really
 good


fundamental
 thesis
 and
 you
 have
 a
 lot
 of


price
 targets
 at
 that
 $7,500
 range.
 It's


just
 a
 question
 of
 do
 you
 buy
 a
 stock


that's
 up
 6x
 in
 five
 months.
 And
 do
 you


need
 to,
 right?
 Like
 is
 is
 your


performance
 so
 bad
 towards
 the
 end
 of


the
 year
 that
 it
 needs
 to,
 you
 know,
 run


up
 by
 by
 chasing
 a
 lot
 of these
 like
 the


question
 is
 do
 you
 need
 to
 chase?
 And
 if


you
 don't
 need
 to,
 then
 you
 know,
 maybe


you
 don't.


And
 you
 don't
 have
 to
 feel
 bad
 about
 not


chasing
 either.
 Bit
 farms
 right
 here


trying
 to
 run
 up
 to
 six
 after
 hours.
 I


don't
 see
 any
 headlines
 after
 hours,


folks.
 So,
 Bit
 Farms,
 whatever
 run


that's
 happening
 on
 Bit
 Farms,
 that


looks
 like
 retail
 is
 just
 piling
 in.
 Uh,


yeah,
 I
 see
 nothing.
 I
 see
 zero


headlines.
 Absolutely
 nothing.
 That


that's
 got
 to
 be
 people
 chasing
 Irene,


chasing
 Cipher,
 chasing
 Terwolf,
 and


using
 BitForms.
 a
 $5
 stock
 as
 their


proxy
 to
 chase.
 If
 someone
 has
 a


headline,
 let
 me
 know.
 But


I
 do
 not
 see
 it.


Sam
 says,
 "You
 don't
 need
 to
 chase
 these


stocks.
 Maybe
 a
 trade
 but
 not
 long


term."
 Yeah,
 I
 agree.
 And
 also,
 it's


like,
 look,
 if
 you're
 going
 to
 buy
 Bit


Farms
 right
 here,
 like
 you
 got
 to
 know


something
 about
 Bit
 Farms.
 You
 have
 to


know
 about
 their
 mining
 facilities
 and


their
 ability
 to
 how
 many
 GPUs
 do
 they


have,
 all
 this
 stuff.
 I
 I
 I'm
 pretty


sure
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 are
 buying
 it
 not


knowing
 any
 of
 that
 stuff
 because
 it's
 a


sympathy
 trade
 because
 they
 missed
 Iran,


which
 is
 fair,
 but
 you
 just
 have
 to
 be


honest
 with
 yourself.
 Like
 when
 I
 bought


Iran,
 I
 didn't
 know
 that
 much
 about
 it,


but
 I
 saw
 the
 Neb's
 deal
 and
 I
 was like,


you
 know what,
 Iran
 probably
 is
 going
 to


run
 and
 I
 should
 have
 bought
 a
 lot
 more,


but
 I
 bought
 it
 at
 28
 and
 I
 was
 like,


all right,
 it
 is
 what
 it
 is.


But
 I
 was
 honest
 with
 myself
 and
 if
 it


fell,
 I
 would
 also
 have
 to
 be
 honest


with
 like
 I,
 you
 know,
 I
 probably


deserve
 to
 bag
 hold
 if
 I
 didn't
 know


that
 much
 about
 it.
 So,
 I
 think
 you're


seeing
 a
 lot
 of
 that
 excitement
 right


now,
 definitely
 after
 hours
 with
 a
 bunch


of
 these
 names
 in
 the
 data
 center
 space.


And
 the
 question
 is,
 do
 you
 want
 to


participate
 in
 that?
 And
 do
 you
 need
 to


participate
 in
 that
 or
 do
 you
 just


freaking
 buy
 Amazon,
 which
 maybe
 is


going
 to
 barely
 move
 a
 couple
 cents
 a


day,
 but
 you'll
 sleep
 better
 at
 night


because
 it's
 Amazon.
 What
 was
 the
 good


news?
 Okay,
 the
 hood
 news
 is
 we
 got
 a


quote
 from
 the
 VP.
 Uh,
 by
 the
 way,
 there


were
 75.5
 million
 calls
 on
 the
 Mag
 7


stocks
 today.
 So,
 he
 had
 a
 lot
 of


bullish
 momentum
 on
 MAG7.
 Uh
 uh
 Reuters


reported
 that
 trading
 platform
 Robin


Markets
 is
 open
 to
 potential


acquisitions
 in
 the
 fast
 growing


prediction
 market
 space.
 Uh
 one
 of
 the


vice
 presidents
 and
 general
 managers
 of


futures
 at
 Robinet
 said,
 "We
 as
 a
 firm


are
 going
 to
 be
 looking
 to
 see
 if


there's
 an
 acquisition
 that's


available."
 That
 being
 said,
 what
 we


also
 know
 is
 we
 have
 really
 good


engineers
 that
 build
 great
 products


here.
 So
 what
 we're
 doing
 is
 trying
 to


balance
 the
 two.


Uh
 essentially
 Robin
 had
 saying,
 "Hey,


we
 are
 interested
 in
 getting
 deeper
 into


the
 prediction
 markets."
 Now
 this
 is
 a


little
 confusing
 to
 me
 because
 they're


already
 partnered
 with
 Khi
 and
 they


didn't
 invest
 to
 my
 knowledge
 in
 Khi's


latest
 funding
 round.
 Khi
 just
 raised


that
 5
 billion.
 I
 don't
 think
 they've


invested
 in
 Poly
 Market
 either.
 Poly


Market
 just
 raised
 that
 10
 billion.
 So


they
 must
 be
 looking
 at
 other
 prediction


market
 companies
 that
 are
 out
 there
 that


they
 want
 to
 expand
 their
 work
 with.
 And


as
 a
 result
 they
 may
 be
 thinking,
 hey


this
 is
 a
 big
 opportunity
 just
 the


prediction
 markets
 itself
 which
 is
 you


know
 probably
 going
 to
 produce
 a
 couple


hundred
 million
 of
 revenue
 for
 them


every
 year
 at
 this
 point.


And
 as
 a
 result,
 they
 are
 continuing
 to


go
 deeper
 into
 that.
 Um,
 I'm
 surprised


they
 don't
 have
 an
 equity
 stake
 in


Koshi,
 you
 know,
 I
 mean,
 like
 they
 they


account
 for
 25
 to
 35%
 of
 KHI
 volume.
 So,


you
 maybe
 they
 do
 and
 maybe
 we
 just


don't
 know
 about
 it.
 But
 it
 would
 be


interesting
 to
 see
 if
 they
 end
 up


partnering
 with
 them
 more
 deeply
 or


taking
 an
 equity
 stake
 or
 even
 buying


them
 out.
 Although,
 I
 don't
 think
 Khi


would
 want
 to
 be
 bought
 out.
 So,
 Robin


might
 be
 looking
 at
 other
 companies
 that


are
 out
 there.
 Prize
 Pix
 has
 a
 $2.5


billion
 valuation.
 Prize
 Pix,
 do
 they
 do


prediction
 markets?
 I've
 heard
 of
 them


many
 times.


I
 know
 they
 do
 a
 lot
 of
 different
 types


of
 sports
 betting.
 Yeah,
 maybe
 Robin


wants
 to
 expand
 completely
 to
 sports


betting.
 So
 maybe
 it's
 not
 just


prediction
 markets,
 but
 they
 want
 to
 do


a
 variety
 of
 verticals.
 But
 yeah,


exactly.
 Prize
 Pix
 is
 one
 of
 the


companies
 I
 could
 see
 them
 potentially


be
 more
 interested
 in.
 Yeah,
 they
 do


prediction
 markets.
 Okay,
 so


that
 makes
 sense
 as
 well.


Bit
 farms
 open
 AI
 deal
 coming.
 Dude,


open
 AI
 touches
 your
 stock
 just
 says


your
 name
 and
 it
 goes
 to
 the
 moon.
 It's


pretty
 incredible.
 Amit,
 is
 the
 Golden


Dome
 priced
 in
 for
 Palanteer?
 I
 don't


think
 so.
 I
 think
 the
 Golden
 Dome
 is


something
 that
 is
 not
 priced
 in
 for
 a


lot
 of
 the
 stocks
 that
 are
 associated


with
 it.
 SpaceX,
 Andrew,
 Rocket
 Lab,


Palanteer,
 but
 also
 we
 don't
 have
 much


clarity
 on
 how
 much
 of
 the
 I
 think
 it's


like
 68
 billion
 those
 companies
 are


going
 to
 get.
 So
 no,
 I
 would
 I
 would
 say


the
 government
 growth
 is
 very
 strong
 and


you
 know
 we
 don't
 have
 any
 updates
 on


Golden
 Dome
 so
 I
 wouldn't
 say
 it's
 fully


fully
 priced
 in
 DL
 thanks
 for
 the
 super


chat.
 Does
 WorldCoin
 have
 utility
 or


would
 you
 go
 with
 the
 stock
 buying
 it?


So
 again
 orbs
 is
 the
 treasury
 that's


turning
 worldcoin
 into
 their
 uh
 core


digital
 asset.
 I
 don't
 know
 much
 about


world
 co.
 I
 know
 that
 they
 have
 17


million
 users
 on
 the
 platform.
 I've


never
 used
 it.
 I
 saw
 a
 couple
 people
 on


Twitter
 that
 went
 to
 the
 world
 coin


location
 and
 they
 got
 the
 biometric


scan.
 I
 mean
 um
 I
 don't
 know
 obviously


there's
 utility
 of
 17
 really
 in
 South


Korea
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 are
 using
 it
 more


and
 more
 and
 in
 Japan
 but
 the
 question


is
 does
 that
 utility
 result
 in
 like
 a


massive
 revenue
 opportunity
 and
 maybe
 it


does
 but
 I
 think
 it's
 a
 little
 too
 early


to
 tell
 but
 if
 you're
 bullish
 on
 it
 you


know
 orbs
 is
 probably
 one
 of
 the
 best


ways
 to
 get
 exposure
 or
 just
 buying
 the


world
 coin
 flat
 out


yeah
 Beyond
 Meat.
 Okay,
 so
 this
 one
 got


hit
 today.
 Okay,
 this
 one
 was
 down
 like


80%,
 no
 49%.
 Okay,
 recovered.
 It
 was
 at


50
 cents
 at
 one
 point.
 Um,
 they
 they


filed


not
 for
 bankruptcy,
 but
 they
 filed
 for


something
 else


and
 uh


and
 that's
 what
 got
 the
 street
 to
 be


upset.
 They
 had
 like
 a
 a
 debt
 swap


for
 the
 convertibles
 that
 they
 put
 out
 a


while
 ago
 that
 they
 reported
 this


morning.


Yeah.
 So,
 uh,
 Beyond
 shares
 are
 tumbling


after
 the
 company
 announced
 early


results
 for
 its
 exchange
 offer
 of
 a
 0%


convertible
 note
 due
 2027.
 Roughly
 96%


of
 the
 notes
 were
 tendered,
 well
 above


the
 85%
 threshold.
 That
 is
 not
 good.
 In


return,
 Beyond
 Me
 will
 issue
 28
 million


of
 new
 7%
 convertible
 notes
 due
 in
 2030


and
 about
 316
 million
 new
 shares.
 So,


more
 dilution,
 way
 above
 their
 previous


threshold.
 And
 that's
 why
 this
 stock


took
 a
 nasty
 beating
 today.


So,
 you
 know,
 they
 got
 to
 call
 up
 Open


AI
 and
 figure
 out
 how
 they
 can
 work


together.
 But
 until
 then,
 you
 got
 Beyond


Meat


down
 50%.
 Next
 decade,
 was
 that
 down


more
 today?
 Next
 decade
 was
 down
 even


more,
 5%.
 I
 have
 not
 taken
 a
 stake
 in


this.
 Again,


this
 is
 this
 is
 again,
 this
 is
 the


problem
 with
 some
 of
 these
 tickers,


right?
 It's
 like
 Matt
 has
 said
 over
 and


over
 again,
 you
 buy
 this
 and
 you
 hold
 it


and
 you
 don't
 worry
 about
 it
 for


literally
 the
 next
 decade.
 But
 I
 think


all
 of
 us
 are
 so
 inundated
 with
 the


short-term
 updates
 on
 this.
 Like
 I
 don't


know
 why
 it's
 down
 4%,
 but
 if
 you
 asked


Matt,
 who
 kind
 of
 got
 most
 people


thinking
 about
 this,
 I
 don't
 think
 he


would
 care
 if
 it's
 down
 4%.
 Like
 it


really
 is
 a
 long-term
 play
 for
 some
 of


these
 people.
 So
 I
 I
 think
 people
 have


to
 be
 honest
 with
 themselves.
 So,
 if


you're
 buying
 next
 decade,
 think
 it's


going to
 go
 to
 eight
 bucks
 soon,
 like


don't
 buy
 it
 because
 that
 that's
 not
 the


thesis
 from
 any
 of
 the
 people
 you
 heard


it
 from,
 which
 is,
 hey,
 you
 literally


have
 to
 hold
 this
 for
 a
 long
 time.


You're
 not
 going
 to
 get
 that
 move.
 And


then,
 you
 know,
 down
 4%,
 you
 should
 be


buying.
 That
 should
 be
 the
 if
 it's
 if


it's
 truly
 a
 decade
 long
 hold,
 it
 should


be
 something
 you
 buy.


NAT
 gas
 is
 tough
 to
 own.
 Yeah.
 And
 like,


you
 know,
 you
 don't
 get
 into
 a
 ticker


just
 because
 it's
 at
 six,
 seven
 bucks


and
 you
 think
 it's
 going
 to
 go
 up.
 Uh,


Nat
 Gas
 is
 not
 an
 easy
 industry
 and
 NEX


is
 not
 even
 producing
 revenues
 yet.
 VG


is
 producing
 revenues
 and
 they
 got
 their


ass
 sued
 by
 BP
 which
 is
 why,
 you
 know,


they
 continue
 to
 fall.
 So,
 I
 think,
 you


know,
 and
 this
 is
 when
 people
 are
 like,


oh,
 Amit,
 well,
 you
 missed
 this,
 you


missed
 that.
 It's
 like,
 well,
 I
 don't


understand
 the
 sector
 and
 I'd
 rather


like
 Oscar
 at
 12
 it
 was
 a
 great
 buy
 and,


you
 know,
 it's
 at
 20
 and
 that's


phenomenal,
 but
 I
 don't
 understand


healthcare,
 so
 why
 would
 I
 put
 capital


at
 risk
 at
 12
 in
 a
 sector
 that
 I
 don't


know
 about
 that
 it
 could
 have
 blown
 up


in
 my
 face?
 You
 have
 to
 be
 honest
 with


yourself.
 Some
 of
 this
 [ __ ]
 if
 you
 just


don't
 know
 about,
 you
 just
 don't
 invest


in
 it.


It's
 really
 not
 that
 that
 complicated.


Like
 even
 for
 Bitmine,
 dude,
 I
 was
 late


on
 Bitmine.
 I
 mean,
 I
 could
 have
 got


this
 thing
 in
 the
 30s.
 I
 got
 it
 at
 ended


up
 getting
 it
 at
 like
 45,
 but
 it
 took
 me


a
 while
 to
 understand
 this.
 And
 I
 love


Tom
 Lee.
 I
 mean,
 he's,
 you
 know,
 he's
 an


awesome
 guy.
 He's
 been
 on
 the
 channel
 a


bunch
 of
 times.
 We've
 done
 podcasts


together,
 but
 I
 wasn't
 going
 to
 buy
 it


just
 for
 the
 fact
 that
 I
 like
 Tom
 Lee.


Like,
 it
 really
 took
 me
 some
 time
 to
 be


like,
 what
 the
 hell
 is
 he
 even
 doing


with
 BitM?
 Like,
 what
 is
 happening
 here


before
 I
 even
 bought
 it?
 So,
 I
 just
 feel


like
 you
 have
 to
 have
 peace
 of
 mind
 with


a
 lot
 of
 these
 investments


in
 order
 to
 to
 be
 excited
 about
 them.


Speaking
 of
 peace
 of
 mind
 and
 retail


investors,
 here
 is
 Wall
 Street
 Journal's


Gungjan
 Banerjee
 who
 was
 on
 the
 channel


about
 a
 year
 and
 a
 half
 ago
 and
 here
 is


what
 she's
 reporting
 on
 what's
 going
 on


with
 retail
 investors
 and
 their


psychology
 or
 buying
 the
 dip.


>> It's
 been
 a
 record
 year
 for
 this
 very


popular
 buy
 the
 dip
 trade.
 S&P
 500
 has


rebounded
 around
 2%
 after
 one
 day
 drops


of
 that
 much
 this
 year.
 That
 makes
 it


the
 best
 year
 for
 the
 buy
 the
 drip
 trade


since
 2019
 and
 the
 second
 best
 year


since
 the
 1980s.


>> It's
 those
 are
 incredible
 stats.
 I
 mean,


going
 back
 to
 my
 time,
 the
 1980s
 and
 and


it's
 we
 saw
 it
 in
 deepseat
 day
 in


January.
 We
 saw
 it
 again
 with
 tariff


liberation
 that
 took
 a
 couple
 days,
 but


the
 markets
 came
 roaring
 back.
 We
 saw
 it


again
 from
 Friday,
 i.e.
 today.
 Who
 are


these
 people?
 Do
 we
 know
 why
 they're


buying?


>> Well,
 I
 think
 they've
 seen
 that
 this


trade
 has
 worked.
 You
 know,
 as
 as
 you


mentioned,
 we
 have
 not
 seen
 that
 much


volatility
 this
 year,
 but
 every
 time
 we


have,
 people
 have
 plowed
 money
 into
 the


markets.
 And
 what's
 really
 remarkable
 is


that
 I
 do
 think
 that
 this
 recent
 leg
 of


the
 rally
 has
 been
 driven
 by
 Americans


of
 many
 different
 income
 levels
 and
 of


many
 different
 ages.
 As
 the
 Journal


recently
 reported,
 25
 year olds,
 around


a
 third
 of
 them
 are
 in
 the
 markets


today.
 In
 2015,
 that
 figure
 was
 6%.


>> Was
 this
 the
 story
 I
 read
 and
 everything


kind
 of
 gets
 mushed
 together
 on
 the


weekends
 when
 I
 read
 my
 Apple
 News
 Plus?


There's
 a
 Sorry,
 I
 was
 referenced
 the


previous
 segment
 um
 about
 how
 people


aren't
 buying
 homes
 in
 part
 because


they're
 buying
 so
 much
 in
 stocks.


They're
 putting
 their
 money
 into
 the


stock
 market,
 not
 the
 housing
 market.


>> And
 it's
 worked.
 Take
 a
 look
 at
 share


prices,
 right,
 compared
 to
 home
 prices.


And
 I
 think
 that's
 why
 Americans
 of
 all


income
 levels
 are
 also
 putting
 money


into
 the
 markets.
 Income
 levels
 between


$30,000
 and
 $80,000
 a
 year.
 More
 of


those
 Americans
 are
 in
 the
 market
 than


ever
 before.
 And
 many
 of
 them
 have


entered
 during
 this
 bull
 market.


>> That
 is
 the
 the
 true
 retail
 investor.


That's
 we
 want
 market
 participation.
 We


want
 everybody
 to
 feel
 that
 they
 can


access
 this
 market.
 You
 don't
 need
 to
 be


a
 multi-millionaire.


>> And
 they
 feel


>> but
 and
 here's
 where
 here's
 there's


always
 a
 butt.
 when
 I
 see
 leveraged


crypto
 trades,
 when
 I
 see
 3x
 ETFs
 up
 or


down,
 you
 know,
 I'm
 not
 setting
 up
 a


warning
 flag,
 but
 at
 the
 same
 time,


these
 are
 instruments
 where
 if
 they


work,
 they're
 going
 to
 work
 really
 well.


They
 don't
 work,
 there
 is
 a
 lot
 more


risk
 here,
 right?
 Talk
 to
 us
 about


leveraged
 crypto.


>> I
 mean,
 I
 think
 it's
 leverage
 across
 the


board.
 I
 was
 shocked
 to
 see
 that


leverage
 ETFs
 tied
 to
 the
 NASDAQ.
 Nvidia


saw
 some
 of
 their
 biggest
 inflows
 on


record
 last
 week
 during
 this
 volatility


and
 stock
 investors
 who
 entered
 the


markets
 on
 Friday
 are
 probably
 taking
 a


look
 at
 their
 accounts
 and
 they're


pretty
 happy
 right
 now.
 Cryptole


leveraged
 traders
 are
 still
 nursing


losses.


>> So
 the
 so
 to
 be
 clear
 and
 if
 I'm
 wrong


please
 tell
 me
 the
 leverage
 here
 is


basically
 it's
 not
 one
 to
 one.
 You
 buy
 a


share
 of
 Nvidia
 goes
 up
 you
 make
 some


money
 goes
 down
 you
 lose
 a
 little
 bit
 of


money
 when
 you
 sell.
 These
 are
 ex


multiples
 right.


>> Exactly.
 This
 is


>> borrowed
 money
 10x


>> 10x
 20x
 100x
 leverage
 and
 these
 trades


are


>> 100x
 leverage


>> well
 that's
 abroad
 that's
 on
 offshore


exchanges
 but


>> but
 it
 does
 ex
 but
 that
 exists


>> it
 exists


>> 100
 times
 leverage
 offshore
 stuff
 crypto


trades
 exist


>> and
 I
 would
 bet
 that
 US
 exchanges
 and


brokerages
 will
 keep
 amping
 up
 the


leverage
 on
 Coinbase
 you
 can
 access
 10x


leverage
 on
 Bitcoin
 and
 Ethereum
 that


was
 for
 the
 first
 time
 over
 this
 summer


and
 I
 think
 they're
 going
 to
 keep


pushing
 the
 envelope.


>> If
 these
 crypto
 assets
 continue
 to
 go


up,
 those
 people
 are
 going
 to
 make
 a
 lot


of
 money,


>> right?
 But
 take
 a
 look
 at
 what
 happened


on
 Friday,
 right?
 People
 in
 these
 trades


can
 also
 lose
 a
 lot
 of
 money,
 lose


everything
 on
 days
 like
 Friday.
 I
 called


it
 the
 get-rich
 or
 get
 wiped
 out
 trade.


>> Yeah.
 Do
 we
 know


how
 much
 of
 that
 leverage
 may
 contribute


to


sort
 of
 the
 more
 volatile
 declines
 that


we
 see,
 right?
 So
 the
 stock
 market
 won't


go
 down,
 you
 know,
 a
 quarter
 of
 a


percent.
 It'll
 go
 down
 3%.


>> Yep.


>> And
 then
 it
 comes
 back
 roaring
 right


back.
 that
 ex
 those
 extreme
 movements
 or


at least
 my
 perception
 sitting
 here
 of


extreme
 movements
 has
 to
 be
 tied
 if
 it's


real
 to
 those
 leveraged
 trades
 or
 no


>> look
 what
 what
 I
 often
 hear
 from
 traders


especially
 the
 past
 few
 years
 as
 we've


seen
 the
 rise
 of
 options
 trades
 one
 day


options
 trades
 leveraged
 ETFs
 right
 a


lot
 of
 these
 trades
 rebalance
 around
 the


close
 so
 a
 lot
 of
 traders
 do
 think
 that


that
 can
 exacerbate
 volatility
 on
 big
 up


days
 and
 big
 down
 Is
 this
 is
 this
 you


said
 offshore
 I
 would
 imagine
 that


there's
 not
 just
 US
 retail
 investors


buying
 in.
 I've
 heard
 a
 lot
 about


investors
 in
 other
 places
 like
 South


Korea.
 This
 is
 a
 global
 market.
 Correct.


>> This
 is
 a
 global
 phenomenon
 and
 you
 will


be
 shocked
 at
 how
 much
 activity
 is


taking
 place
 in
 these
 so-called


perpetual
 futures
 around
 68%
 of
 Bitcoin


volumes.


>> Perpetual
 future.


>> So


>> again,
 Robin
 Hood
 is
 also
 bringing


perpetual
 futures
 to
 uh
 to
 their


platform
 soon.
 We
 talked
 about
 it
 in
 the


morning,
 but
 perpetual
 futures
 just


basically
 let
 you
 go
 long
 and
 do
 the


sort
 of
 20,
 30,
 50x
 leverage
 that
 Gon


was
 talking
 about.
 You
 guys
 are


hilarious
 in
 the
 chat.
 You
 guys
 are


genuinely
 genuinely


are
 genuinely
 hilarious
 in
 the
 chat.
 But


uh
 the
 point
 is,
 look,
 her
 argument
 is


retail
 is
 continuously
 engaged
 in
 this


market.
 They're
 not
 going
 away.
 They're


continuing
 to
 buy
 the
 dip.
 The
 top
 three


stocks
 that
 were
 bought
 on
 Friday
 were


Metahood
 and
 Nvidia.
 And
 um
 you
 know
 the


like
 it's
 almost
 the
 end
 of
 the
 year.
 Do


you
 take
 a
 shot
 and
 pile
 into
 some
 of


these
 harder
 harder
 retail
 trades
 that


have
 continued
 to
 gain
 excitement
 even


if
 you're
 not
 in
 them
 or
 do
 you
 add
 to


your
 normal
 positions
 add
 to
 something


that's
 relatively
 cheap
 and
 hasn't
 moved


like
 an
 Amazon
 and
 call
 it
 a
 day?
 I


don't
 know.
 It
 really
 depends
 on
 how


much
 you
 want
 to
 up
 the
 risk
 ante.
 But


with
 rates
 coming
 down,
 is
 it
 crazy
 to


say
 IRN
 breaks
 through
 7580
 by
 the
 end


of
 the
 year,
 especially
 if
 they
 get


another
 deal?
 Like,
 no,
 it's
 not
 crazy.


Cost
 of
 capital's
 coming
 down,
 earnings


growth
 is
 good,
 and
 you
 know,
 they
 could


announce
 something
 overnight
 that


changes
 the
 company.
 It's
 just,
 do
 you


want
 to
 take
 the
 risk?
 And
 based
 on
 what


Gun
 John's
 saying,
 obviously
 a
 lot
 of


people
 are
 continuing
 to
 want
 to
 take


take
 that
 risk.


Dude,
 you
 guys
 need
 to
 go
 outside,
 bro.


You
 guys
 saying
 I
 need
 to
 go
 outside.


You
 guys
 need
 to
 go
 outside.
 Goodness


gracious,
 bro.


I
 feel
 like
 I
 feel
 like
 we
 want
 to
 get


engagement
 up
 on
 the
 channel.
 We
 just


need
 a
 co-host
 at
 this
 point.
 Like,
 and


I
 know
 exactly
 what
 type
 of
 co-host
 to


get.
 Goodness.


These
 are
 some
 good
 comments
 though.


These
 are
 some
 good
 comments.


Roger,
 thanks
 for
 the
 super
 chat.


Reuters
 Gun
 Jun
 is
 a
 midst
 dentist.
 Yes,


you
 know,
 she
 was
 on
 the
 channel,
 right?


A
 lot
 of
 you
 guys
 are
 new.
 A
 lot
 of
 you


guys
 don't
 remember
 when
 uh
 she
 actually


came
 on
 the
 channel.


She
 uh
 she
 was
 on


Yeah,
 she
 was
 on,
 bro.
 She
 was
 This
 is


old
 video,


but
 she
 was
 there.
 I'm
 looking
 at
 that


right
 now.
 Look
 at
 that.
 I
 gotta
 get
 her


back
 on.
 I
 got
 to
 get
 her
 back
 on.
 She


was
 on
 a
 while
 ago,
 but
 it
 was
 fun.
 It


was
 fun.
 She's
 dope.
 She's
 up.
 She's
 on


the
 Wall
 Street
 Journal
 and
 uh
 yeah,
 she


covers
 a
 lot
 of
 what's
 going
 on
 for
 the


the
 retail
 ecosystem.


Anyway,
 so
 those
 were
 some
 of
 the
 main


headlines.
 What
 else
 do
 we
 have
 after


hours?
 Do
 we
 have
 anything
 else?
 Oh,
 a


couple
 things.
 So,
 Kali
 is
 reporting


government
 shutdown
 is
 going
 to
 be


worse,
 bro.


Colossi
 is
 reporting
 we
 are
 going
 to


have
 the
 longest
 government
 I
 mean


they're
 not
 reporting
 but
 the
 prediction


market
 is
 saying
 that
 we
 are
 likely
 to


have
 the
 longest
 government
 shutdown
 of


all
 time
 which
 would
 be
 kind
 of
 crazy
 if


that
 ends
 up
 actually
 happening
 but
 uh


that
 is
 the
 argument
 from
 Kshi
 and
 if


that's
 the
 case
 then
 obviously
 you
 know


it's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 little
 wonky
 in
 terms


of
 where
 we're
 going to
 get
 that


government
 data
 Navas
 by
 the
 way
 it's
 up


18%
 after
 hours
 not
 sure
 why
 what
 the


heck
 is
 the
 headline
 pushing
 this
 stock


up.
 This
 stock
 I
 think
 Jose
 is
 a
 fan
 of.


It's
 in
 the
 semiconductor
 space.


Oh,
 there
 you
 go.


Na'vias
 supports
 800
 VDC
 power


architecture
 for
 Nvidia's
 next


generation
 AI
 factory
 computing


platforms.


Boom.
 There
 you
 go.
 This
 was
 actually


the
 same
 headline
 for
 power


integrations,
 this
 800
 VDC
 power


architecture.
 So
 it
 looks
 like
 Nvidia
 is


working
 with
 multiple
 companies
 to
 make


sure
 that
 the
 uh
 architecture
 they
 need


for
 the
 nextgen
 AI
 factory
 computing


platforms,
 Jensen
 has
 talked
 about
 these


AI
 factories
 for
 a
 while
 has
 momentum


and
 looks
 like
 Na'vi
 is
 playing
 a
 role


there.
 Wow.
 $12.
 Take
 a
 look
 at
 that.


1230
 after
 hours.
 It
 was
 already
 up
 21%


during
 the
 day.
 So
 I
 guess
 someone
 knew


that
 there
 was
 going
 to
 be
 probably
 some


level
 of
 collaboration
 and
 now
 you
 got


the
 official
 press
 release
 after
 hours.


as
 that
 continues
 to
 go
 higher.


Kane
 said,
 "I
 I
 almost
 sold
 some
 of
 my


Na'vias
 today."
 Almost.
 Or
 did
 you?
 If


you
 didn't,
 then
 you
 should
 be
 happy.
 If


you
 almost
 did,
 then
 um
 you
 should
 just


be
 grateful
 you
 didn't.
 But
 goodness,


bro.
 I
 could
 understand
 selling
 it


today,
 though,
 right?
 Because
 it
 was
 up


20%.
 So,
 you
 might
 say,
 "Hey,
 I'm
 going


to
 take
 some
 profits."


There
 you
 go.


That
 is
 green.
 The
 top
 20
 stocks
 that


were
 trading
 in
 the
 options
 market


today,
 Nvidia,
 Tesla,
 IBIT,
 AMD,
 Amazon,


Apple,
 Broadcom,
 Pounder,
 Beyond
 Meat,


Marathon,
 Intel,
 Open

 SoFi,


Microgy,
 Regetti,
 which
 crossed
 50


today,
 Big
 Bear
 AI,
 EOS,
 Energy
 Play,


MP,
 Rare
 Earth
 Metals,
 Ethereum
 ETF,
 and


then
 IN.
 So,
 look
 at
 that.
 In
 the
 top
 20


stocks
 that
 were
 traded
 today,
 Marathon


Bitcoin
 miner
 turn

 play,

 then


you
 got

 A
 lot
 of
 these
 names
 are
 not


Netflix
 or


um
 Marll,
 you
 know,
 or
 or
 SMCI.
 I
 mean,


these
 are
 names
 that
 are
 relatively


smaller
 companies,
 but
 they're
 getting
 a


lot
 more
 excitement.
 Navitas
 right
 there


11.84
 84


after
 hours.
 Denian
 says,
 "My
 average


price
 on
 Na'viS
 is
 258."
 Someone
 says,


"I
 have
 5,000
 shares
 at
 five
 bucks."
 I


mean,
 this
 stock
 year
 to
 date
 has
 to
 be


up
 more
 than
 100%
 year
 to
 date.
 185.


Now,
 it's
 basically
 200
 with
 the
 after


hours
 move.


There's
 been
 a
 lot
 of
 good
 opportunities


this
 entire
 year.
 There's
 been
 a
 lot
 of


good
 opportunities
 this
 entire
 year.
 And


you
 don't
 have
 to
 mean
 all
 of
 them,
 but


even
 if
 you
 got
 one
 or
 two
 of
 them,
 I


mean,
 last
 week,
 Rocket
 Lab
 and
 AS
 lot


of
 people
 that
 are
 heavy
 in
 those
 names,


you've
 done
 well.
 The
 week
 before
 that,


AMD,


um,
 obviously
 the
 hood,
 the
 Palunteers,


like
 all
 these
 names
 have
 just
 really


begun
 to
 make
 some
 Google
 a
 month
 ago,


right?
 A
 lot
 of
 people
 were
 stuck
 in


Google
 at
 150
 for
 nine
 months
 until
 it


broke
 out.
 So
 I
 you
 really
 I
 mean
 Tesla


wrecked
 a
 lot
 of
 portfolios
 until
 it


finally
 pivoted
 at
 330
 when
 the
 whole


Elon
 compensation
 package
 started
 coming


out.
 So


it
 is
 seeming
 to
 be
 an
 everything
 rally


across
 the
 board.
 Precious
 metals
 are


leading
 it
 along
 with
 these
 data
 center


plays


and
 as
 long
 as
 we
 get
 a
 meaningful
 Q3


earnings
 report


hopefully
 it
 continues.


Hopefully
 it
 continues.
 Apply
 digital.


Yeah.
 Did
 that
 break
 40
 today?
 APLD.


APLD
 35.
 It
 almost
 broke
 40.
 35.
 Yes.


Google
 is
 investing
 10
 billion
 in
 India.


We
 talked
 about
 that
 last
 week.
 They're


also
 investing
 9
 billion
 in
 South


Carolina.
 Um
 so
 I
 mean
 they're,
 you


know,
 Google
 is
 getting
 ready
 to
 spend


as
 much
 money
 as
 they
 possibly
 can
 on


these
 data
 centers


and
 they're
 obviously
 trying
 to
 do
 it
 in


a
 way
 that
 continues
 to
 increase


momentum.
 Here
 was
 Mr.
 Ryan
 Dietrich


today
 speaking
 about


navigating
 October
 volatility.


>> You
 look
 just
 at
 the
 last
 two
 days.
 Yes,


probably
 two
 days
 now
 of
 1%
 moves.
 Just


October
 13th,
 a
 little
 history
 for


everybody.
 At
 89,
 the
 S&P
 dropped
 like


6%
 on
 the
 UL
 LBO
 deal
 that
 fell
 apart.


And
 then
 on
 uh
 in
 2008,
 this
 day,


October
 13th,
 gained
 11%.
 Mike,
 I'm
 not


sure
 why,
 but
 there
 are
 more
 1%
 moves
 in


October
 than
 any
 other
 month
 after
 the
 I


guess
 I'll
 say
 we've
 been
 spoiled
 with


this
 rally.
 Maybe
 some
 October


spookiness
 and
 volatility
 is
 perfectly


normal.


>> Certainly
 normal.
 I
 guess
 the
 question


is
 um
 did
 it
 kind
 of
 break
 the
 market


stride
 in
 any
 notable
 way?
 I
 mean,
 it's


essentially,
 you
 know,
 once
 you've
 got


the
 people
 who
 are
 in
 it
 because
 you


can't
 get
 the
 market
 down
 and
 this
 is
 a


low
 volatility
 grind
 higher
 and
 there's


no
 real
 use
 uh
 in
 in
 waiting
 for
 a
 dip


to
 say,
 "Okay,
 maybe
 we're
 going
 to
 get


a
 deeper
 pullback."


>> You're
 right.
 I
 love
 that
 this
 guy


shared
 with
 Paul
 a
 little
 before
 I
 came


on.
 He
 talked
 about
 some
 of
 the


internals
 that
 are
 weakening.
 You
 know,


I
 look
 at
 things
 like
 regional
 banks,


those
 are
 lagging
 big
 time.
 Housing
 is


lagging
 big
 time.
 Look
 at
 high
 yield


credit,
 right?
 That's
 starting
 to
 crack.


So,
 by
 no
 means
 are
 we
 saying
 there's


this
 big
 monster
 under
 the
 bed,
 but


Mike,
 there
 are
 some
 little
 things
 that


have
 me
 concerned.
 And
 the
 last
 one,
 put


to
 call
 ratios,
 you
 know,
 they're
 quite


optimistic.
 And
 from
 that
 contrarian


point
 of
 view,
 I
 just
 think
 it
 makes


sense
 after
 a
 36%
 rally
 in
 6
 weeks,


maybe
 we're
 due
 for
 just
 some,
 I
 guess,


a
 Charlie
 Brown
 shirt
 type
 of


volatility.


>> You
 know,
 you
 mentioned
 35%
 up
 in
 6


months,
 right?
 So,
 I
 wondered
 if
 we
 were


also
 suffering
 from
 a
 little
 bit
 of


anniversary
 itis
 in
 the
 sense
 of,
 wow,


look
 at
 this
 massive
 six-month
 move.


Obviously,
 also
 just
 hit
 the
 three-year


mark
 of
 the
 current
 bull
 market,
 uh,


with
 some
 great
 gains,
 although
 maybe


not,
 you
 know,
 I
 mean,
 kind
 of
 middle
 of


the
 pack
 on
 on
 the
 three-year


anniversary,
 but
 what
 can
 we
 expect
 from


here
 uh,
 as
 the
 the
 bull
 market
 matures?


>> Yeah,
 we're
 still
 pretty
 optimistic.


Have
 been
 for
 a
 while.
 You
 know,
 you


look
 at
 there's
 been
 five
 other
 times


we've
 gained
 more
 than
 35%
 on
 the
 S&P
 in


6
 months.
 one
 year
 later
 higher
 every


single
 time
 up
 like
 13%
 average.
 I
 know


some
 other
 guests
 have
 pointed
 this
 out.


I'll
 just
 mention
 it.
 Once
 you
 get
 a


bull
 market
 that
 gets
 to
 this
 point
 on


its
 third
 birthday,
 there's
 been
 five


other
 ones
 back
 to
 1950.
 All right.
 The


shortest
 any
 of
 those
 other
 bull
 markets


went
 was
 5
 years.
 The
 average
 Mike
 was
 8


years.
 So
 listen,
 the
 reality
 is
 this
 is


a
 strong
 bull
 market
 still.
 And
 to
 think


it's
 just
 going
 to
 be
 over
 because
 we're


here
 and
 it's
 1929
 or
 stocks
 are


overvalued.
 We're
 not
 minimizing
 that,


right?
 Earnings
 are
 still
 strong,
 profit


margin
 strong,
 a
 dovish
 Fed.
 There
 are


still
 reasons
 to
 think
 that
 this
 bull


market's
 alive
 and
 well
 and
 it
 might


last
 longer
 than
 a
 lot
 of
 investors


expect.


>> Yeah,
 look,
 earnings
 growth
 is
 on
 the


side
 of
 the
 bull
 market
 continuing
 to


last
 and
 when
 you
 see
 a
 lot
 of
 these


names
 get
 more
 and
 more
 deals,
 they're


still
 breaking
 over
 12
 bucks.
 Um,


it
 doesn't
 look
 like
 it
 has
 to
 slow


down.
 It
 really
 doesn't
 look
 like
 it
 has


to
 slow
 down.
 Uh,
 I
 think
 Bit
 Farms


right
 here,
 uh,
 this
 could
 possibly
 be


the
 reason
 for
 it.
 Eightball,
 thanks
 for


the
 super
 chat.
 Bit
 farms,
 right
 before


the
 crash
 on
 Friday,
 secured
 a
 $300


million
 project
 financing
 in
 a
 debt


facility.
 So,
 it
 looks
 like
 they
 raised


300
 million,
 which
 is
 bullish.
 I
 think


they
 got
 a
 price
 target
 today
 as
 well.


Northland
 increased
 them
 to
 seven
 bucks,


but
 the
 magnitude
 of
 the
 move
 today,
 I


mean,
 that
 just
 seems
 like
 you're


getting
 a
 lot
 of
 new
 investors


interested
 in
 the
 stock.
 Mind
 you,
 this


thing
 was
 at
 like,
 wasn't
 this
 thing
 two


bucks
 like
 a
 couple
 weeks
 ago?


Yeah,
 it
 was
 literally
 two
 bucks
 on


September
 29th.
 It
 was
 250
 on
 September


15th.
 It's
 up
 117%
 in
 the
 past
 month.


So,
 a
 price
 target
 increase.
 Like
 if


you're
 a
 stock
 inside
 of
 the
 data
 center


space
 or
 the
 energy
 space
 or
 the
 nuclear


space
 or
 the
 rare
 earth
 metal
 space


right
 now
 and
 you
 have
 an
 analyst


upgrade,
 you
 have
 some
 level
 of


financing
 whether
 it's
 through
 debt,


equity,
 raise
 capital,
 however
 it
 is.


And
 then
 you
 have
 like
 one
 thing
 that


you
 can
 point
 to
 about
 capacity
 for
 data


centers,
 licensing,
 GPUs,
 whatever.
 You


need
 some
 type
 of
 tailwind
 that
 is
 more


specific
 to
 your
 industry.
 Your
 stock
 is


going
 to
 go
 up.
 I
 mean
 that
 we've
 se


just
 seen
 example
 after
 example
 after


example
 over
 the
 past
 couple
 weeks


whether
 it's
 a
 cipher
 terolf
 bit
 farms


clean
 spark
 marathon
 all
 these
 names
 EOS


you
 get
 any
 upgrade
 and
 you
 get
 a
 little


bit
 of
 juice
 boom


we
 move
 higher


and
 I
 think
 that's
 what
 we're
 seeing


right
 now
 where
 was
 open
 door
 on
 the
 day


open
 door
 open
 door
 was
 down
 open
 door


down
 about
 4%
 on
 the
 day
 PayPal
 got


downgraded
 to
 sell
 from
 JP
 Morgan
 and


you
 know
 I
 think
 that's
 what
 kind
 of


wrecked
 some
 of
 this
 momentum
 today


68.90
 they
 did
 unveil
 their
 ads
 manager


last
 week
 which
 got
 them
 above
 76


but
 right
 here
 back
 below
 70
 and
 look
 it


can
 be
 really
 annoying
 for
 people
 that


think
 they're
 in
 really
 good
 high


quality
 companies
 that
 aren't
 moving
 as


much
 as
 like
 a
 Bit
 farms
 or
 a
 EOSC.
 I


think
 the
 important
 thing
 there
 is
 to


not
 get
 resentment.
 Like
 the
 worst
 thing


you
 can
 do
 for
 for
 your
 mentality
 as
 an


investor
 is
 be
 resentful
 of
 someone
 who


got


in
 US
 AR
 and
 is
 up
 27%
 of
 the
 day
 or
 NP


and
 is
 up
 500%
 for
 the
 year.
 Like
 look,


at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day,
 if
 you
 pulled
 the


trigger
 and
 you
 bought
 MP
 at
 20
 and
 it's


at
 97,
 like
 hats
 off
 to
 you,
 right?
 So


it's
 one
 of
 those
 things
 where
 I


wouldn't
 get
 resentful
 for
 it.
 I
 would


just
 try
 to
 analyze,
 hey,
 like
 how
 could


you
 have
 done
 a
 better
 job?
 And
 this
 is


me
 talking
 to
 myself
 as
 well
 to
 try
 to


find
 that
 trend
 before
 it
 took
 off.


And
 then
 the
 question
 becomes,
 do
 you


want
 to
 risk
 the
 capital
 at
 these


prices?


And
 that
 is
 a
 personal
 decision,
 but


everyone's
 got
 to
 make
 their
 own


conclusion
 on
 is
 it
 worth
 like
 the


reason
 I
 like
 AMKR
 is
 because
 it's


cheap.
 It's
 a
 semiconductor
 name
 that


hasn't
 run.
 It's
 in
 a
 sector
 that


obviously
 is
 growing
 massively
 with


capex.
 And
 then
 there's
 actual
 company


specific
 tailwinds
 on
 AMKR
 that
 are


really
 easy
 for
 me
 to
 understand.
 And


it's
 cheap.
 Like
 the
 most
 important


thing
 is
 it's
 cheap,
 bro.
 Like
 I
 I
 I


don't
 want
 to
 buy
 stocks
 that
 are
 super


super
 expensive.
 I'll
 put
 the
 one
 pager


on
 AMKR
 right
 there
 in
 the
 chat
 that
 I


that
 I
 shared
 last
 week.


And
 so
 I
 think
 the
 question
 to
 ask


yourself
 is,
 do
 you
 think
 a
 bit
 farms
 is


cheap?
 I
 know
 at
 like
 five
 bucks
 it


could
 look
 like
 it's
 cheap,
 but
 you're


paying
 three
 billion
 for
 this
 company.


Is
 that
 cheap
 or
 not?
 I
 think
 that's
 the


question
 that
 people
 have
 to
 ask


themselves


when
 looking
 at
 getting
 into
 these


names.


Bought
 MP
 at
 45.
 I'm
 up
 100%
 now.
 See,


and
 the
 thing
 about
 MP
 is
 they
 had


actual
 tailwinds
 that
 didn't
 even
 have


anything
 to
 do
 with
 like
 a
 bull
 market.


They
 just
 had
 tailwinds
 in
 regards
 to
 a


Trump
 decoupling
 from
 China
 when
 it


comes
 to
 rare
 earth
 metals
 and
 then
 b


Apple,
 the
 department
 of
 war,
 all
 these


entities
 investing
 in
 them,
 the


Pentagon,
 like
 those
 are
 catalysts
 that


are
 hard
 to
 deny


and
 that's
 why
 MP
 ended
 up
 getting
 a


really
 really
 decent
 run.
 LAC
 lithium


America's
 that
 one
 was
 also
 up
 another


13.5%
 on
 the
 day.
 Yeah,
 Regetti
 150
 to


56.
 I
 mean,
 dude,
 you
 guys
 know


Palenteer
 owned
 Regetti
 at
 like
 two


bucks.
 I
 think
 they
 sold
 it
 back
 in
 the


end
 of
 23,
 early
 24,


but
 um
 they
 owned
 it.


If
 they
 held
 on,
 they
 would
 have
 had
 a


20
 bagger,
 but
 you
 know,
 they
 they


didn't.
 So,
 I
 I
 don't
 think
 Ballinger


saw
 the
 quantum
 computing
 ecosystem


growing
 as
 much
 as
 it
 did,
 but
 it
 it


did.
 And
 as
 a
 result,
 you
 know,
 now


you're
 here.


So,
 I
 don't know.
 I
 think
 at
 these


moments,
 it's
 very
 important
 to
 not
 get


super
 super super
 euphoric,
 but
 also


it's
 important
 to
 look
 at
 these


opportunities
 that
 present
 themselves


and
 then
 ask
 yourself
 towards
 the
 end
 of


the
 year,
 do
 you
 actually
 want
 to


invest?
 Now,
 speaking
 of
 investing,
 the


EU
 came
 out
 today
 and
 they
 rolled
 out
 a


$ 1.1
 billion
 plan
 to
 ramp
 up
 AI
 in
 key


industries
 amid
 sovereignty
 drive.
 Uh
 I


think
 this
 headline
 was
 trolled
 by
 a
 lot


of
 investors
 today
 because
 they
 were


like
 Europe's
 thinking
 of
 investing
 a


billion
 dollars
 which
 is
 simply
 not


enough
 to
 actually
 compete
 meaningfully


in
 AI
 especially
 when
 you
 have


Salesforce
 committing
 15
 billion
 today


into
 a
 San
 Francisco
 investments
 over


five
 years.
 Google's
 putting
 10
 billion


into
 India.
 So
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 ramping


up
 the
 investment
 spend,
 you
 got
 a
 lot


of
 investors
 thinking,
 hey,
 Europe's
 not


really
 doing
 it
 at
 a
 super
 competitive


level,
 which
 is
 also
 feeding
 the


momentum
 for
 American
 stocks
 because
 a


lot
 of
 these
 American
 AI
 names
 are
 ready


to
 spend
 and
 they're
 not
 afraid
 of


spending.
 I
 mean,
 literally
 JP
 Morgan


today
 announced
 a
 $ 1.5
 trillion


security
 and
 resiliency
 initiative
 to


boost
 critical
 industries.
 A
 lot
 of
 that


having
 to
 do
 with
 rare
 earth
 metals,


crypto,
 quantum,
 tons
 of
 different


things
 were
 mentioned.
 energy
 obviously


I
 mean
 you
 got
 the
 EU
 saying
 we're
 going


to
 invest
 a
 billion
 and
 you
 have
 JP


Morgan
 saying
 we're
 going
 to
 invest
 1.5


trillion
 so
 there's
 obviously
 a
 sort
 of


dichotomy
 on
 where
 the
 money
 is
 coming


from
 and
 ultimately
 how
 much
 of
 an


impact
 that
 money
 would
 have


the
 quantum
 bubble
 pop
 well
 dude
 I
 mean


it's
 important
 ask
 yourself
 is
 it
 even
 a


bubble
 that
 is
 going
 to
 pop


right
 like
 is
 it
 I
 look
 obviously
 the


valuations
 are
 aggressive
 and
 some
 of


these
 stocks
 are
 getting
 insane
 premiums


But
 if
 quantum
 computing
 grows
 into
 an


industry
 and
 there's
 something
 real


behind
 the
 technology,
 you
 know,
 maybe


these
 stocks
 are
 not
 at
 as
 at
 the
 levels


there
 are
 today.
 But
 do
 they
 have
 to
 go


back
 down
 to
 zero,
 which
 is
 or
 at least


go
 down
 50
 to
 60%,
 which
 I
 think
 would


be
 the
 definition
 of
 the
 bubble?
 I
 don't


think
 so.
 It
 really
 depends
 on
 how
 much


it
 grows.


So
 I
 I
 think
 the
 the the
 sort
 of


takeaway
 from
 this
 is
 you
 can't
 get
 too


bearish
 on
 the
 broader
 market
 if
 you're


seeing
 froth
 and
 you're
 seeing
 these


things
 that
 are
 that
 are
 running
 that


you
 know
 maybe
 you
 have
 no
 idea
 why


they're
 running
 but
 you
 also
 can't
 FOMO


into
 them
 and
 that
 this
 is
 a
 hard
 part


of
 market
 psychology.
 Can
 you
 be
 okay


with
 enough
 of
 the
 gains
 you
 put
 up
 for


on
 the
 year
 to
 not
 yolo
 into
 critical


metals
 CRML
 which
 is
 up
 72%
 on
 the
 day?


Because
 when
 something
 goes
 up
 72%
 on


the
 day,
 you
 start
 asking
 yourself
 why


the
 hell
 are
 you
 not
 in
 it
 and
 it's
 up


72%.
 Right?
 Like
 well
 maybe
 maybe
 you


just
 didn't
 do
 enough
 research
 in
 that


space.
 Maybe
 you
 didn't
 care
 to
 take


that
 risk.
 But
 is
 it
 worth
 buying
 it


after
 it's
 up
 72%.


FOMOing
 into
 Amazon
 and
 Google.
 See,


that's
 the
 type
 of
 that's
 the
 type
 of


FOMO
 that
 I
 think
 is
 worth
 happening.


I
 mean,
 look,
 it
 really
 is
 a


psychological
 like
 Amazon
 might
 be
 stuck


at
 220
 for
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 year,
 but


buying
 into
 Oaklo
 might
 go
 down
 30%
 for


the
 rest
 of
 the
 year
 or
 it
 might
 go
 up


30%
 or
 it
 might
 be
 flat.


Do
 you
 feel
 better
 sleeping
 at
 night


with
 Amazon
 or
 Oaklo?


And
 and and
 maybe
 it's
 Oaklo.
 And
 if


that's
 the
 case,
 then
 you
 buy
 some


Oaklo.
 But
 if
 it's
 easier
 to
 sleep
 at


night,
 you're
 talking
 about,
 you
 know,


hard-earned
 money
 in
 a
 name
 that
 hasn't


really
 run
 all
 year
 and
 you're
 not


worried
 about
 its
 revenues
 or
 its
 profit


margins
 or
 its
 earnings
 because,
 you


know,
 there's
 like
 something
 of


substance
 there.
 Yeah,
 you're
 not
 going


to
 get
 those
 astronomical
 gains,
 but


you're
 also
 not
 going
 to
 have
 to
 worry


about
 losing
 it.


And
 I
 think
 that
 is
 important.
 But


obviously
 it's
 aggressive
 to
 see
 a
 lot


of
 these
 names
 pump
 every
 single
 day
 and


good
 quality
 companies
 are
 kind
 of


stuck.
 But
 at
 the
 same
 time,
 ironically,


it
 is
 really
 important
 that
 Amazon,


Google,
 Nvidia,
 Meta,
 Microsoft
 aren't


pumping
 like
 [ __ ]
 right?
 Like
 in
 Oaklo,


which
 I'm
 not
 saying
 is
 a
 [ __ ]
 code,
 but


you
 know,
 obviously
 the
 perception
 is


$25
 billion
 market
 cap,
 no
 revenue,
 like


people
 are
 assuming
 this
 thing
 is
 just


egregiously
 expensive.
 It
 would
 not
 make


sense
 for
 like
 an
 Amazon
 to
 be
 worth5


trillion
 dollars
 today
 and
 be
 pumping


every
 other
 day
 four
 or
 five
 percent.


Like
 people
 would
 say
 we
 are
 legit
 in
 a


bubble
 if
 there's
 that
 much
 euphoria


that
 that
 much
 money
 is
 coming
 into
 a


blue
 chip
 stock
 every
 single
 day.
 But
 if


$2
 billion
 out
 of
 a
 $
 35
 trillion
 US


stock
 market
 wants
 to
 go
 into
 Oaklo,
 I


mean
 that's
 like
 that's
 just
 not
 a


bubble.
 Like
 it's
 it's
 it's
 frothy.


Yeah.
 and
 Oklahoma
 might
 get
 a
 deal


tomorrow
 that
 turns
 that
 zero
 revenue


into
 $5
 billion
 of
 revenue,
 which
 is
 why


that's
 multiples
 being
 pulled
 forward.


But
 it's
 not
 a
 top
 in
 the
 sort
 of


conventional
 sense.
 If
 Amazon
 legit
 was


gaining
 hundreds
 of
 billions
 of
 market


cap
 every
 day
 for
 no
 reason,
 that
 would


be
 pretty
 toppy
 because
 it
 would
 make
 no


sense,
 which
 is
 exactly
 what
 happened
 in


2021.


So,
 ironically,
 as
 annoying
 as
 it
 is
 to


see
 some
 of
 these
 names
 gap
 up,
 it's


also
 important
 that
 the
 most
 important


companies
 in
 the
 world
 aren't
 doing
 that


because
 a
 it
 means
 there's
 an


opportunity
 in
 them,
 but
 b
 it
 means
 that


they're
 likely
 not
 as
 bubbleicious
 as


some
 of the
 other
 names
 that,
 you
 know,


catch
 a
 bid
 for
 whatever
 reason
 they're


catching
 a
 bid
 for.
 And
 at
 the
 same


time,
 the
 other
 thing
 that
 everyone
 has


to
 remember
 is
 we
 might
 be
 in
 the


greatest
 revolution
 of
 technology
 of
 all


time,
 which
 means
 it
 would
 be
 one
 of the


greatest
 decades
 for
 investing
 of
 all


time.
 And
 there
 are
 going
 to
 be
 hundreds


of
 opportunities
 across
 the
 board,


potentially
 thousands
 of
 opportunities.


And
 if
 there
 are
 those
 massive
 thousands


of
 opportunities,


um,
 you're
 going
 to
 get
 names
 that


randomly
 take
 a
 run.
 And
 you
 can't
 be


too
 afraid
 when
 they
 do
 run
 because
 that


is
 a
 function
 of
 a
 bull
 market,


especially
 if
 the
 most
 important
 names


are
 not
 in
 a
 bubble.
 You're
 going
 to
 get


other
 names
 that
 end
 up
 getting
 a
 bit
 of


a
 bid
 there.


Yeah,
 just
 looking
 at
 gold
 proves
 to
 you


that
 the
 wall
 of
 worry
 continues
 to
 be


there.


But
 I
 mean
 I
 I
 I
 I
 I


cannot
 deny
 it
 is
 incredible
 to
 see
 the


data
 center
 names
 gap
 up
 the
 way
 they're


gapping
 up
 every
 day.
 It
 is
 incredible


to
 see
 Oaklow
 move
 up
 18%
 in
 a
 day.
 And


like
 realistically,
 your
 gut
 tells
 you


this
 isn't
 sustainable.
 But
 then
 again,


who
 knows?
 like
 we
 had
 a
 3%
 draw
 down,


$20
 billion
 of
 leverage
 in
 the
 crypto


markets
 got
 wiped
 out
 and
 the
 next
 thing


that
 happens
 72
 hours
 later,
 Oaklo
 goes


up
 18%.
 I
 mean,
 it's
 it's
 a
 hard
 sort
 of


place
 in
 the
 cycle
 to
 define
 what


exactly
 is
 happening,
 but
 I
 think
 you


have
 to
 come
 to
 the
 conclusion
 that
 as


long
 as
 the
 most
 important
 companies
 in


the
 world
 aren't
 getting
 to
 the
 point


where
 they
 seem
 egregiously
 valued,
 then


it's
 okay
 because
 whatever
 happens
 to


the
 other
 parts
 of
 the
 market
 don't


really
 have
 an
 impact
 on
 the
 the
 broader


bull
 trend.


Greatest
 technology
 revolution
 of
 all


time
 does
 not
 equal
 straight
 up
 every


day.
 There
 will
 be
 losers.
 We
 just
 need


to
 stay
 long
 the
 winners.
 Yes,
 I
 would
 I


would
 agree
 with
 that
 as
 well.
 I
 haven't


looked
 at
 TAC.
 I
 know
 Camilo's
 bullish


on
 it.
 Uh
 TRA
 Trans
 Trans
 Alta
 Corp.
 I


know
 it's
 an
 energy
 name
 for


uh
 Calgary,


but
 I've
 got
 to
 watch
 their
 podcast
 on


it
 because
 I
 haven't
 looked
 too
 much


into
 it.
 Said,
 "Yes,
 I'm
 fine
 missing


the
 Oaklo
 like
 socks.
 Just
 not
 for
 me.


Got
 to
 be
 able
 to
 sleep."
 Yeah,


I
 agree.
 Put
 in
 the
 chat
 if
 you're
 in
 an


Oaklo
 or
 something.
 I
 mean,
 put
 in
 the


chat
 if
 you're
 in
 one
 of
 these
 names


that
 doesn't
 have
 any
 revenue
 but
 is


massively
 moving
 because
 like
 and
 what


are
 you
 doing?
 Are
 you
 selling?
 Are
 you


buying
 more?
 Are
 you
 just
 holding?
 Like,


if
 you
 bought
 Oklahoma
 at
 $10,
 I
 mean,


look,
 it's
 at
 170.
 Like,
 should
 you
 take


some
 off
 the
 top?
 Sure.
 But
 like
 also,


it's
 your
 margin
 of
 safety
 is
 so
 strong


where
 it's
 like,
 if
 it
 goes
 down
 20%,


like
 would
 you
 even
 care,


right?


Does
 BMR
 count?


Um,


does
 it
 count?
 I
 mean,
 this
 I
 I
 guess


so.
 I
 guess
 Well,
 it's
 in
 the
 meme
 stock


ETF,
 so
 BMR
 has
 to
 count,
 right?
 It's


it's
 a
 meme
 stock
 as
 per
 round.
 No,
 I


mean,
 look,
 BMR
 is
 more
 of
 a
 crypto
 play


that's
 leveraged
 against
 Ethereum.
 So,


I'm
 talking
 more
 about
 companies
 that


like
 are
 supposed
 to
 have
 revenue
 and


earnings
 and
 don't.
 I
 mean,
 I
 don't


think
 anyone's
 expecting
 revenue
 out
 of


BMR.
 They're
 just
 expecting
 Ethereum
 to


go
 up.


A
 lot
 of
 those
 names
 again
 have


continued
 to
 run.


Um
 I
 see
 a
 decent
 amount
 of
 Oakloss


450%
 up
 on
 Open.
 Well,
 Open's
 going
 to


have
 revenue
 even
 if
 they
 don't
 have


profits.
 So
 you're
 you
 are
 going
 to
 see


some
 revenue
 on
 Oaklow
 or
 on
 Open
 Door,


which
 is
 not
 too
 crazy.


I
 mean,
 all
 the
 rare
 earth
 names
 that


don't
 have
 any
 revenue,
 US,
 CRML.
 The


funny
 thing
 about
 CRML
 is
 we
 saw
 it
 at


$10
 two
 Fridays
 ago
 when
 the
 Reuters


rumor
 came
 out
 that
 Trump
 was
 going
 to


be
 buying
 them
 and
 it
 went
 up
 to
 14
 and


then
 the
 Reuters
 rumor
 came
 out
 and
 said


Trump's
 not
 buying
 them
 or
 sorry
 the


Secretary
 of
 Energy
 came
 out
 and
 said


we're
 not
 buying
 them
 and
 it
 went
 down


to
 11
 and
 now
 it's
 at
 freaking
 25.
 Why?


I
 don't
 know.
 Well,
 I
 do
 know
 it's


because
 Rare
 Earth
 Minerals
 like
 that


entire
 sector
 is
 taking
 off.
 So
 CRML
 is


just
 going
 to
 go
 up


$26
 after
 hours,
 74%.


Regettia
 10,
 Na'vias.


All right,
 so
 look,
 a
 decent
 amount
 of


people
 that
 are
 in
 these
 names.
 You
 got


to
 ask
 yourselves,
 do
 you
 want
 to
 take


some
 profits
 here
 or
 do
 you
 want
 to
 let


this
 play
 out
 over
 the
 next
 coming


years?
 And
 ironically,
 dude,
 again,
 like


letting
 this
 stuff
 play
 out
 over
 the


next
 five
 years
 might
 end
 up
 being
 the


best
 decision.
 Like
 just
 because
 these


names
 are
 frothy
 does
 not
 mean
 they
 are


an
 automatic
 cell
 because
 we
 might
 need


a
 lot
 more
 demand
 for
 these
 industries


that
 are
 getting
 more
 excitement.


Quantum
 might
 actually
 become
 a
 thing.


Um
 nuclear
 energy
 might
 become
 more


important
 than
 it
 is
 today
 and
 like
 all


those
 sectors
 might
 take
 up.
 Now
 maybe


that
 doesn't
 happen
 in
 2026
 when
 you
 get


a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 draw
 down,
 a
 little


bit
 of
 a
 pullback
 and
 the
 market
 kind
 of


realizes
 these
 companies
 don't
 have
 much


to
 show
 for
 those
 get
 hit.


But
 if
 there's
 any
 indication
 that
 it's


a
 very
 real
 industry
 that's
 not
 slowing


down,
 I
 mean,
 maybe
 those
 stocks
 really


don't
 have
 to
 slow
 down.
 Even
 if
 they


don't,
 you
 know,
 continue
 surging
 the


way
 they're
 surging
 four
 or
 five
 percent


every
 day.


So,
 it's
 a
 question
 of
 how
 do
 you


individually
 analyze
 it?


Um,


now
 there's
 decent
 amount
 of
 people
 in


Regetti.
 11
 bucks,
 12
 bucks.
 That
 was


the
 average
 that
 people
 got
 into.
 I


remember
 looking
 at
 Regetti
 at
 50
 cents


because
 as
 a
 Palanteer
 was
 owned
 them


and
 so
 I
 was
 looking
 a
 little bit
 at


their
 balance
 sheet
 but
 I
 was
 like
 dude


I
 don't
 I
 don't
 really
 understand


quantum
 I
 don't
 understand
 what's


happening
 and
 regardless
 whether
 you


understood
 it
 or
 not
 those
 stocks
 have


started
 to
 do
 very
 well.
 Uh
 Tom
 Lee
 did


give
 a
 talk
 at
 the
 token
 2049
 Singapore


conference
 and
 that
 talk
 is
 finally
 out.


Here's
 a
 part
 of
 it
 that
 I
 thought
 was


actually
 really
 important.
 Speaking


about
 the
 most
 important
 financial


institutions
 and
 the
 market
 caps
 of
 how


those
 institutions
 are
 continuing
 to


grow
 above
 600,


they'll
 say
 that
 banks
 work
 fine.
 Uh


what
 I
 don't
 see
 how
 JP
 Morgan
 can


become
 more
 profitable.


Well,
 actually
 companies
 that
 are


natively
 built
 on
 the
 blockchain
 are


inherently
 more
 profitable.
 For


instance,
 Tether
 is
 raising
 capital
 at
 a


$500
 billion
 valuation.


Look
 at
 the
 list
 of
 the
 12
 largest
 banks


in
 the
 world.
 Tether
 is
 the
 second


largest.
 I
 mean,
 think
 about
 that.


Tether
 is
 50%
 bigger
 than
 Bank
 of


America.
 And
 Bank
 of
 America
 is
 a
 giant.


It's
 twice
 the
 size
 of
 Cityroup,
 twice


the
 size
 of
 Morgan
 Stanley.
 It's
 even


bigger
 than
 Goldman
 Sachs.
 Okay,


but
 here's
 what's
 interesting.


If
 you
 look
 at
 the
 number
 of
 employees


at
 Tether,


okay,
 JP
 Morgan
 is
 a
 $869
 billion
 market


cap
 company
 with
 $317,000


employees.


That's
 a
 market
 value
 of
 $2.8
 million


per
 employee.
 Tether
 has
 150
 employees.


That's
 less
 than
 JP
 Morgan's
 analyst


class.
 you
 know,
 um
 it's
 probably
 like


the
 June
 analyst
 class.
 And
 so
 that


means
 Tether
 has
 a
 market
 value
 of
 $3.3


billion
 per
 employee.
 I
 think
 that's


what
 you
 have
 to
 realize.
 Tether,
 which


is
 a
 native
 blockchain
 company


using
 public
 chains,


has
 a
 value
 nearly
 the
 size
 of
 JP
 Morgan


and
 with
 only
 150
 employees.
 So
 as


exhibit
 A
 in
 my
 opinion
 clearly
 building


companies
 and
 rebuilding
 Wall
 Street
 on


the
 blockchain
 is
 very
 profitable.


>> So
 he
 kind
 of
 went
 on
 to
 make
 the


argument
 that
 the
 reason
 companies
 are


incorporating
 with
 blockchains
 is


because
 it
 makes
 them
 more
 efficient.


And
 the
 fact
 that
 Tether
 can
 get
 a


valuation
 almost
 the
 size
 of
 JP
 Morgan


and
 have
 you
 know
 1/100th
 of
 the


employees
 is
 a
 big
 deal.
 And
 I
 think


more
 and
 more
 companies
 are
 recognizing


that
 not
 only
 can
 AI
 make
 them
 more


efficient,
 not
 only
 can
 blockchains
 make


them
 more
 efficient,
 but
 the


intersection
 of
 both
 of
 them,
 which
 is


kind
 of
 the
 point
 of
 of
 what
 Tom
 Lee
 was


saying
 in
 that
 talk
 is
 something
 as
 a


macro
 trade
 cannot
 be
 denied.


And
 as
 a
 result,
 you
 know,
 that's
 why
 he


continues
 to
 be
 excited
 for
 Ethereum.


Jose
 says,
 "Can
 we
 have
 days
 like
 this


forever?"
 Jose,
 we
 got
 to
 get
 you
 on
 the


channel
 tomorrow.
 I
 think
 you're
 back


from
 Arizona
 now,
 right?
 We
 got
 to
 get


your
 take
 on
 all
 this.
 AMD,
 Open
 AAI,


Oracle
 Open
 AI,
 Broadcom
 Open
 AAI.


Open
 AAI
 is
 just
 being
 passed
 around,


bro.
 Open
 Open
 AI
 is
 the
 entity
 that
 is


central
 to
 making
 all
 these
 stocks
 get


some
 love.
 But,
 uh,
 yes,
 I
 would
 love
 to


get
 your
 take,
 Jose,
 on
 it
 tomorrow.


Again,
 10
 gigawatt
 deal
 with
 Broadcom.
 I


did
 not
 expect
 to
 see
 that
 this
 morning,


but
 you
 got
 that.


And
 that's
 what
 got
 Broadcom
 really


moving.
 Is
 Navitas
 still
 moving
 after


hours?
 MP
 is
 still
 moving.
 Na'vias.
 Wow.


Almost
 hitting
 13.


I
 think
 Jose's
 in
 that
 one.
 This
 is
 one


of
 uh
 one
 of
 the
 ones
 he
 likes.


This
 one
 also
 continuing
 to
 go
 green.
 I


saw
 a
 video
 where
 Tom
 said
 Tether
 is


buying
 up
 gold.
 Yeah,
 it
 looks
 like


Tether
 is
 tokenizing
 gold,
 which
 I
 mean


it
 makes
 sense
 they
 would
 do
 that,
 but
 I


didn't
 even
 think
 of
 it.
 And
 that
 could


be
 one
 of
 the
 reasons
 we're
 getting


a
 ton
 of
 this
 uh
 gold
 demand.
 Richard,

 We'll
 end
 off
 on
 this


super
 chat
 from
 Daniel.
 If
 you
 were


going
 to
 start
 a
 long-term
 portfolio


today,
 what
 five
 stocks
 would
 you
 pick?


It's
 a
 great
 question.


What
 five
 stocks
 would
 you
 pick


long-term
 portfolio
 today?


I
 mean,
 I'm
 biased,
 but
 I'm
 going
 to


name
 the
 names
 that,
 you
 know,
 I'm


continuing
 to
 hold
 for
 the
 next
 10


years.
 Long
 term,
 I'm
 assuming
 is
 10


years.
 Got
 to
 put
 Nvidia
 in
 there.
 Got


to
 put
 Palin
 in
 there.
 Got
 to
 put
 Hood


in
 there.


I
 have
 two
 left.


Uh,


I
 feel
 like
 it's
 got
 to
 be
 Google
 or


Amazon.
 One
 of
 those
 at
 least.


I
 don't
 know.
 Fifth
 one
 could
 be
 Grab.


It
 could
 also
 be
 IBIT
 with
 Bitcoin,


right?
 Just
 like
 long
 Bitcoin.
 It
 could


also
 be
 Tesla.
 Easy
 long
 T.
 Like,
 it's


hard
 to
 narrow
 it
 down
 to
 five,


but
 I
 know
 my
 three
 for
 sure
 would
 be
 a


Hood
 and
 Paler.
 Those
 three
 for
 sure.
 I


mean,
 BMR
 could
 be
 up
 there
 as
 well,


right?
 Like
 if
 ETH
 and
 Bitcoin
 do
 what


they
 do
 over
 the
 next
 few
 uh


few
 few
 years,
 you
 would
 imagine
 those


take
 on.


Now,
 would
 I
 want
 freaking
 Oaklo
 in


there?
 Would
 I
 want
 EOS
 E
 Energy?
 Would


I
 want
 Bit
 Farms
 in
 there?
 Like,
 it's


hard
 to
 definitively
 be
 like,
 "Yeah,


those
 would
 be
 in
 my
 long-term


portfolio."


But
 you
 know
 the
 names
 that
 have
 done


well
 already
 I
 think
 it'd
 be
 easy
 to


have
 them.
 Desi
 says
 I'm
 so
 happy
 when


Nebius
 Stock
 talks
 told
 me
 on
 that
 month


ago.
 Yeah.
 See
 I
 was
 talking
 to
 Stock


Talk
 about
 Nebius
 and
 he
 got
 into
 that


when
 it
 was
 25
 and
 he's
 like
 bro
 at
 140


this
 [ __ ]
 makes
 no
 sense.
 He's
 like
 this


[ __ ]
 is
 stupid
 at
 140.
 And
 he's
 like
 all


the
 bulls
 that
 are
 screaming
 Nebius
 is
 a


buy
 at
 140.
 He's
 like
 I'm
 the
 one
 who


bought
 it
 at
 24.
 I
 was
 one
 of
 the
 only


names
 on
 Twitter
 talking
 about
 it.
 these


bulls
 are
 out
 of
 their
 mind
 screaming


that
 it's
 a
 deal
 at
 140.
 Now
 there
 may


be
 a
 legitimate
 argument
 for
 why
 Nebius


is
 a
 deal
 at
 140
 if
 they
 get
 another


deal
 with
 Microsoft
 that
 was
 to
 the
 tune


of
 20
 billion.
 But
 he
 was
 just
 like


people
 are
 going
 crazy.
 It's
 like
 that


valuation
 does
 not
 make
 sense.
 It
 made
 a


lot
 of
 sense
 at
 20.
 It
 doesn't
 make
 a


lot
 of
 sense
 at
 140.


And
 I
 would
 say
 the
 same
 thing
 for
 Hood.


I
 love
 Hood
 but
 at
 150
 no
 I'm
 not
 buying


that
 [ __ ]
 Like
 no.
 Like
 and
 I
 think


Tanner
 would
 say
 the
 same
 thing.
 I
 think


Roy
 would
 say
 the
 same
 thing.
 We're
 some


of the
 most
 bullish
 people
 on
 Hood.


They're
 like,
 "Bro,
 this
 is
 like
 like


no,
 we
 were
 we
 were
 buying
 this
 thing


much
 below
 this
 price
 for
 a
 reason."
 So,


I
 think
 the
 moral
 of
 the
 story
 is,
 is


the
 earnings
 growth
 enough
 to
 get
 you
 to


buy
 in
 to
 these
 all-time
 highs
 expecting


more
 all-time
 highs?
 And
 maybe
 it
 is.


But
 if
 it's
 not
 and
 you're
 already
 up
 a


lot
 this
 year,
 maybe
 you
 don't
 need
 to


take
 that
 risk.


It's
 just
 a
 question
 of,
 you
 know,
 how


you
 navigate
 it.


So,
 that's
 what
 we
 got.


I'm
 getting
 to
 be
 the
 same
 with
 AS.


Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 look,
 if
 you've
 been
 in
 AS


for
 a
 long
 time,
 even
 if
 you
 got
 it
 at


20
 or
 30
 bucks
 at
 91,
 is
 AS
 the
 best?


This
 is
 a
 $
 35
 billion
 company.
 They


don't
 do
 any
 revenue.
 And
 I
 don't
 say


they
 don't
 do
 any
 revenue
 as
 a
 disc


against
 them.
 It's
 just
 like
 the
 facts.


They
 don't
 have
 any
 revenue.


That
 is
 not
 a
 reason
 to
 say
 the


company's
 a
 horrible
 company.
 That's


just
 one
 of
 those
 things
 where
 you
 have


to
 be
 at
 some
 point
 come
 to
 grips
 with


reality
 of
 like,
 okay,
 how
 much
 am
 I


really
 willing
 to
 pay
 for
 this
 type
 of
 a


name
 unless
 you're
 expecting,
 you
 know,


1015
 billion
 dollars
 of
 revenue


overnight
 when
 the
 deals
 start
 pouring


in.
 But
 as
 an
 amazing
 narrative,
 it
 has


an
 incredible
 moat.
 It
 has
 a
 passionate


community
 and
 it
 deserves
 the
 premium.


It's
 just
 is
 it
 a
 deal
 at
 90?
 And
 it
 was


at
 36
 3
 weeks
 ago.
 So
 if
 you
 missed
 it


like
 myself,
 you
 missed
 it.
 if
 you
 miss


the
 dip
 and
 it
 sucks
 to
 suck,
 but
 like


do
 you
 cry
 so
 much
 about
 it
 that
 you


that
 you
 FOMO
 in
 at
 90?


Maybe
 it
 works
 out,
 maybe
 it
 doesn't,


but
 like
 I
 think
 those
 are
 the
 questions


a
 lot
 of
 people
 have
 to
 ask
 themselves


now.
 But
 look,
 I'd
 rather
 ask
 these


questions
 than
 freaking,
 you
 know,


seeing
 the
 S&P
 down
 10%
 and
 having
 to


worry
 about
 other
 types
 of
 questions,


which
 it
 felt
 like
 on
 Friday
 there


potentially
 was
 a
 trajectory
 to
 see
 how


far
 that
 would
 go
 and
 seems
 like
 that


pivoted,
 which
 is
 okay.
 So,
 I
 think


these
 are
 good
 questions
 to
 ask
 versus


the
 opposite,
 which
 could
 have,
 you


know,
 potentially
 happened
 if
 we
 really


had
 some
 issues.


That's
 what
 we
 got.
 That's
 what we
 got


in
 the
 market.
 Stock
 talks
 not
 selling


at
 140
 either.
 I
 agreed.
 So,
 again,
 I'm


not
 selling
 my
 hood
 at
 140
 either,
 but


I'm
 not
 buying
 more.
 So,
 it
 comes
 down


to
 how
 much
 exposure
 do
 you
 have
 or
 do


you
 want
 to
 have
 if
 you
 don't
 have
 any


exposure
 versus,
 you
 know,
 if
 you
 want


to
 start
 some
 type
 of
 a
 long-term


position.


All
 right.
 I
 think
 that's
 it
 for
 us


today.
 We
 are
 done.
 We'll
 be
 back


tomorrow
 on
 the
 uh
 market
 open.
 Two


things
 for
 today.
 So,
 number
 one,
 uh


daily
 recaps
 are
 back.
 Daily
 recaps
 are


back.
 It'll
 probably
 posted
 around
 7:30,


8:00
 p.m.
 Eastern.
 So,
 uh
 the
 daily


recap
 I'm
 going
 to
 try
 to
 keep
 it
 to
 15


minutes
 because
 usually
 if
 I
 end
 up


talking
 it
 ends
 up
 becoming
 like
 30


minutes.
 I'm
 going
 to
 try
 to
 do
 five


stories,
 three
 minutes
 each.
 That's


going
 to
 be
 the
 structure.
 Five
 stories,


three
 minutes
 each.
 the
 most
 important


stories,
 three
 minutes
 per
 each
 story,


five
 of
 them.
 And
 I'm
 really
 gonna
 try


to
 keep
 it
 to
 15
 minutes
 or
 below


because,
 you
 know,
 if
 it
 ends
 up
 being


20,
 30
 minutes,
 it
 kind
 of
 defeats
 the


point
 of
 a
 daily
 recap.
 So,
 we're
 going


to
 have
 that
 come
 out
 today.
 That's


starting
 um
 I
 think
 the
 longest
 daily


recap
 was
 37
 minutes.
 It's
 like
 two


months
 ago,
 and
 someone
 commented,


they're
 like,
 "Hey,
 dude.
 I
 really
 love


the
 format,
 but
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 it's
 a


recap
 in
 37
 minutes."
 I
 was
 like, "Yeah,


you're
 right.
 I
 just
 I
 just
 ended
 up


talking
 too
 much
 on
 this
 one."
 But
 uh
 so


that
 we're
 going
 to
 do
 that
 and
 then


Tech
 Bros
 tonight
 with
 Tanner
 and
 Roy.


Tech
 Bros
 with
 Tanner
 and
 Bro.
 Tanner


and
 Roy.
 So
 uh
 I
 will
 be
 back
 at
 9:30


and
 we'll
 talk
 about
 everything
 else


that's
 going
 on
 in
 the
 market
 as
 well.


Technical
 Tuesday
 tomorrow.
 Yes,


technical
 Tuesday
 tomorrow.
 So
 Tech
 Bros


today
 with
 Tanner
 and
 Roy.
 TT
 tomorrow


with
 Jason.
 Daily
 recap
 probably
 will
 be


out
 in
 about
 2,
 three
 hours.
 It'll
 be


call
 it
 8:00
 PM
 Eastern
 every
 day.


That's
 when
 you
 can
 count
 on
 it
 to
 be


uploaded.


And
 uh
 I
 think
 that
 should
 be
 pretty


much
 it
 today.
 And
 then
 the
 deep
 dives


for
 the
 Substack
 launched
 this
 week
 as


well.
 So
 it'll
 be
 out
 towards
 the
 end
 of


this
 week
 and
 we
 will
 get
 the
 first
 deep


dive
 deep
 dives
 up
 on
 that
 Substack


and
 you
 guys
 will
 be
 able
 to
 read
 it.
 Uh


Chris
 will
 be
 on
 for
 Macro
 Thursday.
 We


couldn't
 do
 last
 week.
 By
 the
 way,
 my


tooth
 for
 those
 that
 have
 been
 asking
 is


like
 feeling
 a
 lot
 better.
 So,
 the
 root


canal,
 the
 antibiotics
 really
 helped.


Um,
 but
 yeah,
 Chris
 will
 be
 on
 on


Thursday


and
 we'll
 probably
 get
 Steve
 on
 later


throughout
 the
 throughout
 the
 week.
 I


was
 on
 Steve's
 show
 yesterday.
 We
 did
 an


episode
 on
 um
 on
 alternative
 assets.


I'll
 link
 it
 right
 here
 for
 anyone
 who


wants
 to
 watch
 it.
 But,
 uh,
 I
 think
 it


was
 it
 was
 a
 fun
 episode.
 We
 got
 to
 talk


to
 one
 of
 his
 buddies
 who
 making
 a


killing
 off
 selling
 Pokemon
 cards.
 And


you
 know,
 you're
 starting
 to
 see
 a
 lot


more
 excitement
 in
 that
 overall


ecosystem
 for


alternative
 assets.
 Steve
 is,
 you
 know,


a
 big
 fan
 of
 big
 fan
 of
 that
 industry
 as


well.
 So
 that's
 the
 link
 right
 there
 in


the
 chat.


Get
 on.
 Dude,
 you
 guys
 are
 wild,
 bro.


Like
 I
 can't
 even
 imagine


having
 a
 girl
 on
 stream
 if
 you
 got
 like


we're
 watching
 a
 freaking
 clip
 and
 you


guys
 are
 going
 crazy,
 bro.
 Someone's


like,
 "Amid,
 where
 are
 your
 hands?
 Show


your
 hands."
 I
 mean,
 like,
 dude,
 what
 is


wrong
 with
 people?
 Goodness.


I
 I
 think
 I
 dude
 I
 mean
 it
 makes
 sense


though,
 right?
 You
 get
 a
 you
 get
 in
 you


get
 a
 beautiful
 woman
 on
 the
 like
 it's


just
 it
 just
 keeps
 people's
 attention,


but
 like
 goodness
 gracious,
 dude.


That
 means
 I've
 got
 to
 be
 really
 good
 at


talking,
 bro,
 because
 I'm
 not
 a


beautiful
 woman,
 but
 you
 guys
 continue


to
 show
 up
 every
 day.
 So,
 there
 there's


got
 to
 be
 something
 in
 the
 way
 I


communicate
 that's
 getting
 it's
 got
 to


be
 the
 humor,
 bro.
 I'm
 I'm
 telling
 you,


it's
 the
 like
 you
 guys
 don't
 want
 to


admit
 it,
 but
 it's
 the
 humor
 because
 you


guys,
 if
 you
 go
 that
 damn
 bad
 for
 a
 girl


on
 the
 screen,
 there's
 got
 to
 be


something
 else


that
 keeps
 you
 here.


You
 are
 handsome.
 It's
 because
 we're


gay.
 Oh
 my
 goodness.
 Oh,
 dudes.
 All


right,
 last
 story
 of
 the
 day,
 dude.


Grinder
 is
 going
 private.


What
 a
 freaking
 story
 with
 this
 stock.


Apparently,
 Grinder,
 they
 came
 out
 today


and
 they
 said,
 "Yeah,
 we're
 uh
 we're


going
 private."


Um,


let
 me
 get
 the
 exact
 headline
 for
 you


guys,
 but


you
 know,
 this
 is
 just
 it's
 one
 of
 those


it's
 one
 of
 those
 stories
 where


sometimes
 public
 companies
 aren't
 able


to
 end
 up
 fully
 doing
 it.
 So,
 the
 the


headline
 was
 Grinder
 insiders
 are


exploring
 a
 take
 private
 deal
 after
 the


stock's
 recent
 slide
 triggered
 a
 forced


sale
 of
 pledge
 shares.
 A
 deal
 could
 draw


national
 security
 scrutiny
 due
 to


Grinder's
 past
 ownership
 by
 a
 Chinese


firm,
 all
 these
 other
 details
 that
 are


associated
 with
 it.
 But
 the
 point
 is,


they're
 probably
 going
 private.


So
 I
 said,
 "Well,
 back
 in
 the
 closet.


Back
 in
 the
 closet
 for
 Grinder."
 It's


not
 an
 original
 joke,
 but
 still.
 Like,


they're
 basically
 going
 back
 in
 the


closet,
 bro.
 They
 were
 not
 able
 to
 make


it
 as
 a
 public
 company,
 but
 that's
 what


you
 got


for
 Grinder.
 So,
 there
 you
 go.


Oh,
 is
 this
 the
 actual
 Tom
 Lee
 just


responded
 to
 this.
 Is
 this
 the
 actual


Tom
 Lee
 drummer?


Is
 that
 how
 to
 I'm
 not
 I
 didn't
 look
 how


the
 other
 the
 Tom
 Lee
 drummer
 guy
 looks.


Okay.
 Well,
 there
 you
 go.
 That's
 Tom
 Lee


the
 drummer.


There
 you
 go.


Um


All right,
 cool.
 So,
 I
 think
 that's
 it.


What
 happens
 to
 stockholders?
 They
 get


liquidated
 at
 whatever
 price.
 I
 think


it's
 like
 15
 bucks
 a
 share
 or
 something.


So,
 you
 know,
 if
 you
 had
 leaps
 for
 like


20
 bucks,
 those
 kind
 of
 go
 to
 zero.
 But


that's
 what
 you
 got.
 Same
 hair.
 Yeah,
 he


has
 the
 same
 hair.
 He
 has
 the
 same
 hair.


Trump
 is
 not
 live,
 but
 Trump
 was
 live
 in


the
 morning.
 He
 was
 in
 Israel,
 then


Egypt.
 I
 think
 he's
 back
 on
 Air
 Force


One
 coming
 to
 the
 United
 States.
 Um,


look,
 peace
 in
 the
 Middle
 East.
 We're


going
 to
 see
 how
 it
 ultimately
 plays


out,
 but
 the
 market
 so
 far
 is
 not
 too


upset
 by
 it.
 And
 if
 that
 continues,
 then


obviously
 it
 could
 be
 a
 broader
 tailwind


for
 less
 geopolitical
 instability.
 Wow.


Taylor
 Swift
 broke
 the
 2025
 streaming


record
 with
 1.5
 billion
 streams
 and
 5


million
 albums
 sold
 so
 far
 in
 2025.


That's
 her
 newest
 album.
 Goodness


gracious,
 bro.
 That
 album
 came
 out
 last


week.
 1.5
 billion
 streams
 in
 a
 week.


We
 didn't
 even
 listen
 to
 it
 together.
 We


said
 we
 were
 going
 to
 listen
 to
 it


together
 here.


That's
 massive,
 bro.
 Music's
 been
 kind


of
 dead
 this
 year.
 I
 don't
 know
 how
 much


people
 keep
 up
 with
 music.
 I
 mean,
 I'm


not
 the
 biggest
 music
 guy,
 but
 music's


been
 kind
 of
 dead.
 So,
 I
 guess
 he
 needed


something
 like
 Taylor
 Swift
 to
 revise
 it


a
 little
 bit.


All right,
 so
 I
 think
 that's
 it.
 I
 think


we're
 done.
 Na'vias,
 are
 we
 still
 moving


after
 hours?
 That
 one
 big
 one
 after


hours.
 Congrats
 for
 anyone
 who's
 in


that.
 Congrats
 for
 anyone
 who's
 in


Broadcom.
 Wow.
 1317
 60%
 for
 the
 day.


Absolutely
 incredible.


that
 continuing
 to
 make
 a
 move.


All right,
 congrats
 if
 you're
 in
 it.


You
 are
 doing


very,
 very,
 very
 well.


And
 again,
 every
 day
 it's
 a
 new
 name


that's
 kind
 of
 moving,
 which
 is
 a
 good


thing.
 So,
 tomorrow
 the
 most
 important


thing
 for
 everybody
 are
 earnings.
 Um,
 we


got
 before
 the
 open
 JP
 Morgan,
 Goldman


Sachs,
 J&J,
 Black
 Rock
 City,
 Wells


Fargo,
 and
 Domino's.
 So,
 we
 have
 some


massive
 names
 tomorrow.
 I'll
 be
 live
 at


8:45.
 We'll
 cover
 those
 names
 and
 we'll


get
 into
 all
 the
 earnings
 growth
 and


hopefully
 we
 get
 some
 good
 earnings.
 And


if
 we
 do,
 then
 we
 can
 start
 out
 Q3


earnings.
 Not
 be
 too
 bad.


All
 right,
 that's
 it.
 Daily
 recap.
 We'll


be
 out
 in
 a
 couple
 hours
 and
 um


Tech
 Bros.
 We'll
 be
 out
 later
 tonight


with
 Tanner
 and
 Roy.
 Powell
 is
 also


speaking
 tomorrow.
 I'm
 not
 sure
 what


time
 exactly
 Powell
 is
 speaking,
 but


Powell
 is
 speaking.
 So,
 we'll
 see


whatever
 Powell
 says
 as
 well.
 What
 are


you
 doing
 for
 your
 birthday?
 I
 am
 doing


nothing.
 I'm
 working.
 It'll
 be
 a


Tuesday,
 I
 think,
 my
 birthday
 or
 Monday.


Doing
 the
 market
 open,
 market
 close.


Yeah,
 it's
 a
 Monday.
 Dude,
 honestly,
 I


don't
 feel
 like
 doing
 anything
 this


year.
 Like,
 I
 really
 I
 am
 so
 tired
 of


like
 this
 year
 has
 been
 a
 busy
 busy


year.
 I
 would
 very
 much
 like
 to
 just


stay
 home
 and
 do
 nothing.
 Like
 I


genuinely
 don't
 want
 to
 do
 anything.
 So


I'll
 be
 live
 market
 open,
 market
 close,


and
 that's
 where
 Call,


you
 know,
 I
 do
 have
 a
 number,
 dude.
 I
 uh


I
 texted
 our
 boy
 Jay
 Kush
 over
 the


weekend,
 and
 I
 was
 just
 like,
 "Congrats


on
 uh
 you
 know,
 the
 peace
 deal."
 I


didn't
 know
 he
 was
 that
 big
 of
 a


negotiator
 in
 the
 deal.
 I
 mean,
 he
 told


me
 he
 was
 still
 working
 with
 the


administration,
 but
 I
 didn't
 know
 he
 was


like
 that
 pivotal.
 I
 mean,
 he
 was
 one
 of


the
 guys.
 He
 was
 one
 of
 the
 two


negotiators
 that
 got
 the
 job
 done.


I
 didn't
 think
 he
 would
 text
 back,
 but


he
 texted
 back.
 So,
 we
 got
 the
 uh
 we
 got


the
 we
 got
 the
 Jay
 Kush
 name
 drop.


Hope
 hopefully
 we
 have
 different
 name


drops
 over
 the
 coming
 over
 the
 coming


years.
 I
 really
 didn't
 think
 he
 would


text
 back,
 bro.
 I'm
 like,
 dude,
 the
 guy


must
 have
 hundreds
 of
 thousands
 of


people
 texting
 him
 right
 now
 or


something.
 But
 he
 texted
 back.
 So,
 he's


a
 dope
 guy.


He's
 a
 dope
 guy.


All right,
 that's
 it.
 Thank
 you


everybody.
 Um,
 we'll
 be
 back.
 I
 didn't


think
 he
 text
 back.
 Sounds
 so
 gay.
 Okay,


I
 am
 done.
 Thank
 you
 everybody.
 Goodness


gracious.
 That
 was a
 good
 one
 though.


That
 was
 a
 good
 one.
 That
 was
 hilarious.


That
 was
 freaking
 hilarious.
 All right,


I'm
 out.
 Daily
 recap
 will
 be
 out
 in
 a


couple
 hours.
 And
 Tech
 Bros
 later


tonight.


I
 just
 can't
 beat
 the
 allegations,
 bro.


I
 really
 can't
 beat
 the
 allegations.
 All


right,
 bye
 everybody.
 Have
 a
 good
 one.
