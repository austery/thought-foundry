[Music]


hi
 everybody
 I'm
 Nicola
 tangan
 and
 today


I'm
 here
 with
 one
 of
 the
 most
 incredible


Tech
 entrepreneurs
 Of
 All
 Times
 who


started
 off
 in
 his
 freshman
 dorm
 room


and
 built
 his
 company
 to
 one
 of
 the


largest
 technology
 companies
 in
 the


world
 now
 onethird
 of
 you
 will
 have
 a
 PC


with
 his
 name
 on
 Michael
 D
 welcome
 thank


you
 so
 much
 great
 to
 be
 with
 you


normally
 Michael
 I
 would
 kind
 of
 start


with
 the
 present
 but
 I
 think
 when
 it


comes
 to
 you
 we
 have
 to
 go
 all
 the
 way


back
 you
 know
 with
 the
 beginning
 you


were
 very
 young
 and
 you
 bought
 an
 IBM


computer
 and
 most
 most
 people
 would
 kind


of
 start
 to
 do
 computer
 things
 but
 you


took
 it
 apart


instead
 what
 did
 you
 how
 did
 that
 happen


what
 did
 what
 did
 you
 see
 inside
 that


computer
 well
 you
 know
 you
 can't


actually
 understand
 things
 unless
 you
 uh


take
 them
 apart
 and
 know
 how
 they
 work


and
 uh
 yeah
 I
 was
 very
 interested
 in


electronics
 and
 kind
 of
 what
 was
 inside


right
 and
 you
 know
 microprocessors


memory
 chips
 and
 disc
 drives
 and
 power


supplies
 and
 I
 kind
 of
 wanted
 to


understand
 all
 this
 and


so
 um
 I
 was
 curious
 and
 I
 was
 interested


and
 one
 of
 the
 things
 that
 I
 found
 was


that
 the
 the
 parts
 that
 were
 in
 this
 uh


IBM
 PC
 you
 know
 was
 introduced
 in
 August


of


1981
 uh
 none
 of
 the
 parts
 were
 made
 by


IBM
 and
 I
 was
 I
 was
 upgrading
 computers


but
 you
 were
 what
 were
 you
 like
 15
 years


old
 or
 something
 I
 was
 16
 years
 old
 16


and
 how
 could
 you
 how
 did
 you
 buy
 it
 I


mean
 did
 you
 get
 some
 money
 from
 your


parents
 or
 you've
 made
 your
 own
 money
 or


well
 I
 I
 I
 had
 when
 I
 was
 12
 I
 worked
 in


a
 Chinese


restaurant
 and
 uh
 had
 a
 bunch
 of


different
 jobs
 I
 was
 like
 you
 know


trading
 stocks
 and
 currency
 and
 when
 I


was
 14
 and
 um
 I
 got
 a
 job
 at
 uh
 at
 a


newspaper
 not
 delivering
 the
 newspapers


selling


newspapers
 and
 it
 just
 kind
 of
 had
 all


the
 these
 little
 businesses
 right
 to
 to


make
 money
 and
 it
 was
 fun
 right
 when
 you


took
 it
 apart
 the
 the
 IBM
 what
 where


were
 you
 were
 you
 in
 your
 room
 or
 living


room
 or
 I
 was
 I
 was
 uh
 in
 my
 parents


house
 you
 know
 where
 I
 lived
 in
 my
 room


yeah
 so
 you
 you
 get
 a
 screwdriver
 and


you
 just
 screw
 it
 apart
 sure
 yeah
 but


what
 and
 what
 did
 you
 see
 inside
 what


what
 was
 the
 how
 what
 did
 you
 learn
 when


you
 open
 it
 well
 back
 then
 you
 could


actually
 learn
 a
 lot
 because
 you
 didn't


have


these
 large
 chips
 that
 we
 have
 today


that
 are
 an
 amalgamation
 of
 lots
 of


small
 chips
 yeah
 and
 so
 you
 could


literally
 uh
 get
 a
 book
 that
 would


explain
 what
 each
 chip
 did
 and
 you
 could


understand
 the
 circuits
 and
 as
 I
 said
 I


was
 upgrading
 computers
 to
 make
 them
 do


more
 right
 you
 know
 more
 memory
 more


storage
 uh
 make
 them
 go
 faster
 right
 and


so
 what
 I
 found
 in
 this
 IBM
 personal


computer
 was
 that
 none
 of
 the
 parts
 were


made
 by
 IBM
 M
 and
 then
 I
 sort
 of


discovered
 that
 that
 the
 uh
 cost
 that


they
 were
 uh
 you
 know
 the
 price
 they


were
 charging
 for
 the
 computer
 was


roughly
 six
 times
 the
 cost
 of
 the
 parts


right
 and
 so
 it
 didn't
 really
 seem
 like


it
 was
 fair
 to
 me
 that
 that
 it
 was
 that


expensive
 IBM
 was
 the
 most
 valuable


company
 in
 the
 world
 at
 that
 stage
 and


you
 were
 16y
 old
 they
 they
 were
 the
 most


valuable
 company
 in
 the
 world
 and
 they


were
 about
 80%
 of
 the
 value
 of
 the


sector
 you
 know
 called
 technology
 at
 the


time
 so
 they
 were
 more
 dominant
 in
 their


sector
 than
 any
 company
 maybe
 in
 any


time
 in
 history
 I
 mean
 are
 there
 any


companies
 today
 that
 are
 80%
 of
 one


sector
 of
 the
 S&P
 500
 no
 not
 even
 close


so
 yeah
 they
 they
 were
 incredibly


successful
 company
 what
 did
 you
 think
 at


the
 time
 when
 you
 did
 you
 have
 any


longer
 term
 plans
 so
 was
 this
 uh
 uh
 what


do
 you
 think
 well
 when
 you're
 16
 years


old
 you
 don't
 you
 don't
 have
 long-term


plans
 right
 and
 I
 didn't
 I
 I
 I
 I
 was


just
 having
 fun
 you
 know
 with
 computers


and
 upgrading
 them
 and
 you
 know
 went


through
 High
 School
 sort
 of
 doing
 that


and
 I
 was
 programming
 computers
 and
 I


was
 tutoring
 other
 kids
 on
 how
 to
 use


computers
 and
 very
 interested
 in
 the


idea
 that
 the
 personal
 computer
 was
 very


empowering
 you
 know
 you
 could
 program
 it


to
 do
 things
 and
 some
 of
 the
 parents
 of


the
 kids
 I
 was
 tutoring
 said
 well
 you


know
 I'd
 like
 a
 computer
 can
 can
 you


help
 me
 get
 one
 like
 sure
 you
 I'll
 get


you
 one
 I'll
 set
 it
 up
 for
 you
 and
 and


I'll
 upgrade
 it
 for
 you
 and
 I'll
 you


know
 uh
 do
 do
 all
 that
 and
 so
 it
 kind
 of


became
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 of
 a
 business


while
 I
 was
 going
 to
 high
 school


upgrading
 these


computers
 and
 then
 um
 I
 went
 off
 to


college
 I
 was
 uh
 Texas
 University
 of


Texas
 I
 was
 a
 biology
 major
 I
 was


supposed
 to
 be
 a
 doctor
 cuz
 your
 parents


wanted
 you
 to
 study
 Premed
 my
 parents


wanted
 me
 to
 to
 be
 a
 doctor
 my
 father's


a
 doctor
 my
 brother's
 a
 doctor
 many
 of


my
 cousins
 are
 doctors
 and
 so
 it
 was


sort
 of
 the
 family
 business
 you
 know
 be


a


doctor
 and
 uh
 strong
 en
 encouragement


from
 the
 parents
 so
 I'm
 not
 in
 in
 my


parents
 house
 anymore
 I'm
 in
 the
 dorm


room
 I've
 got
 a
 lot
 of
 time
 right
 you


know
 University
 of
 Texas
 is
 a
 big
 school


some
 of
 the
 classes
 are
 enormous
 if
 if


you
 show
 up
 or
 you
 don't
 show
 up
 they


don't
 really
 notice
 all
 the
 time
 right


so
 you
 so
 you
 didn't
 always
 show
 up
 so


I'm
 kind
 of
 doing
 this
 computer
 thing


and
 and
 it's
 getting
 bigger
 and


bigger
 and
 um
 my
 parents
 found
 out
 about


it
 they
 got
 very
 upset
 they
 kind
 of
 made


me


stop
 I
 stopped
 for
 10


days
 and
 uh
 and
 that's
 when
 I
 decided


that
 actually
 this
 was
 something
 more
 so


how
 did
 it
 scale
 how
 quickly
 do
 you
 did


you
 scale
 it
 cuz
 growth
 rates
 in
 the


beginning
 were
 tremendous
 right
 so
 um
 in


early
 May
 of


1984
 uh
 I
 the
 company
 was
 incorporated


Del
 computer
 Corporation
 became
 a


corporation
 uh
 and
 it
 was
 about
 a
 week


or
 two
 before
 my
 final
 exams
 of
 my


freshman
 year
 and
 so
 the
 first
 year
 we


had
 $6
 million
 in
 revenue
 and
 uh
 the


second
 year
 was
 about
 uh
 33
 million
 and


we
 we
 grew
 about
 80%
 per
 year


for
 the
 first
 eight
 years
 compounded
 and


then
 for
 the
 six
 years
 after
 that
 we


grew
 about
 60%
 per
 year
 so
 you
 know
 if


you
 put
 any
 number
 in
 there
 and
 you
 do


that
 kind
 of
 compounding
 all
 of
 a
 sudden


you've
 got
 tens
 of
 billions
 of
 dollars


and
 and
 so
 that's
 what
 happened
 we
 we


started
 um
 originally
 making
 upgrade


kits
 for
 the
 IBM
 computers
 then


designing
 our
 own
 computers
 and
 then
 uh


expanding


geographically
 we
 expanded
 from
 desktop


computers
 into
 notebook
 computers
 then


into
 servers
 and
 storage
 and
 services


and
 here
 we
 are
 today
 40
 years
 how
 much


how
 much
 did
 you
 work
 uh
 what
 does
 it


take
 all
 the
 time
 I
 mean
 what
 else
 is


there
 to
 do
 I
 mean
 if
 you're
 starting
 I


mean
 uh
 yeah
 when
 when
 you
 when
 you


start
 a
 company
 and
 you're
 19
 years
 old


that's
 all
 you
 do
 is
 you
 work
 it's
 fun


it's
 your
 life
 right
 yeah
 so
 so
 what
 is


the
 entrepreneurial
 mindset
 what
 is
 it


what
 is
 it
 that
 makes
 some
 people
 do


these
 kind
 of
 things
 they're
 not
 many
 of


them
 they're
 not
 many
 of
 you
 what
 do
 you


think
 it
 is
 for
 me
 it


was
 curiosity
 and
 and
 just
 interest
 in


technology


and
 uh
 the
 possibility
 that
 these


machines
 you
 know
 could
 could
 enable


people
 to
 do
 things


and
 I
 was
 interested
 in
 in
 business
 and


also
 I
 saw
 that
 that
 uh
 you
 know
 wow


when
 when
 people
 get
 these
 machines
 you


know
 they
 can
 do
 amazing
 things
 with


them
 and
 the
 technology
 is
 improving
 so


much
 and
 uh
 you
 know
 always
 looking
 to


find
 a
 better
 way
 to
 do
 it
 you
 know
 can


we
 can
 we
 beat
 the
 other
 guys
 right
 can


we
 can
 we
 can
 we
 build
 a
 machine
 that
 is


more
 has
 more
 performance
 than
 our


competitors
 can
 we
 offer
 better
 value
 to


our


customers
 and
 you
 know


grow
 grow
 the
 business
 and
 ultimately


grow
 the
 impact
 of
 what
 we're
 able
 to
 do


with
 with
 technology
 why
 do
 you
 think


there
 are
 more
 entrepreneurs
 in
 America


than
 elsewhere
 I
 think
 there's
 something


in
 the
 in
 the
 culture
 that
 you
 know
 is


is
 accepting
 uh
 risk
 even
 embracing
 risk


in
 a
 good
 way
 right
 um
 that
 says
 well


okay
 if
 you
 try
 something
 and
 it
 doesn't


quite
 work
 and
 you
 fail
 it's
 okay
 try


something
 else
 right
 and
 maybe
 that
 that


is
 not
 as
 accepted
 everywhere
 I
 think


there's
 you
 know
 a
 combination
 of


factors
 right
 it's
 this
 risk
 acceptance


It's
 Capital
 that
 will
 invest
 behind


that
 there's
 a
 history
 of
 other


entrepreneurs
 that
 you
 can
 look
 to
 that


I
 look
 to
 and
 others
 look
 to
 and
 said


well
 yeah
 they
 did
 it
 so
 maybe
 I
 could


do
 it
 did
 you
 think
 it
 would
 risk
 at
 the


time
 did
 you
 did
 you
 have
 a
 hair
 no
 no


so
 if
 you
 have
 nothing
 nothing
 to
 lose


right
 so
 uh
 it
 didn't
 see
 like
 a
 big


risk
 I
 mean
 the
 risk
 for
 me
 was
 if
 it


didn't
 work
 I
 go
 back
 to
 college
 so
 not


that
 big
 of
 a
 risk
 now
 obviously
 you


know
 as
 the
 business
 grow
 grows
 you're


like
 wow
 now
 I've
 got
 you
 know
 hundreds


of
 people
 working
 for
 me
 I'm
 responsible


for
 them
 you
 know
 some
 of
 them
 have


families
 and
 they
 have
 kids
 and
 so
 every


night
 when
 you
 sort
 of
 put
 your
 head


down
 on
 the
 pillow
 you're
 thinking
 I've


got
 a
 big
 responsibility
 now
 I
 better


not
 screw
 this
 up
 right
 all
 these
 people


are
 depending
 on
 me


but
 I
 think
 there's
 also
 a
 lot
 of


opportunity
 that
 is
 unrealized
 because


people
 aren't
 uh
 maybe
 as
 willing
 to


take
 risks
 but
 I
 never
 really
 thought


about
 it
 as
 oh
 I'm
 taking
 this
 massive


risk
 you


know
 you
 also
 uh
 changed
 the
 way
 uh


people
 thought
 about
 supply
 chain
 how


was
 your
 thinking
 differently
 than
 what


was
 normally
 at
 the
 time
 so
 you
 know
 we


um
 started
 the
 business
 as
 a


a
 as
 a
 selling
 directly
 to
 the
 customer


right


and
 you
 know
 when
 I
 say
 that
 there's
 a


there's
 generally
 a
 perception
 that
 the


customer
 is
 an
 individual
 consumer
 it's


true
 we
 sell
 to
 Consumers
 but
 actually


the
 vast
 majority
 of
 our
 business
 has


always
 been
 even
 from
 the
 beginning


businesses
 uh
 governments
 institutions


you
 know
 of
 all
 sizes
 large
 and
 small


and
 so
 we
 we
 had
 this
 direct
 model


that's
 how
 that's
 how
 the
 company


started


and
 uh
 if
 you
 contrast
 that
 to
 others


where
 you
 had
 let's
 say
 retail
 stores


and
 a
 and
 a
 series
 of
 people
 that
 were


kind
 of
 in
 the
 middle
 between
 the


manufacturer
 and
 the
 ultimate
 customer


you
 have
 you
 know
 this
 kind
 of
 classical


system
 of
 guessing
 what
 the
 demand
 is


going
 to
 be
 and
 then
 putting
 inventory


in
 these
 various
 locations
 and
 so
 uh


something
 interesting
 occurred
 with
 with


uh
 the
 the
 the
 personal
 computer
 and


still
 very
 much
 the
 case
 in
 this


industry
 and
 many
 others
 there's
 always


new
 technology
 right
 and
 the
 cost
 of
 the


material
 is
 generally
 coming
 down
 yeah


and
 so
 if
 one
 company
 has
 you
 know
 let's


say
 90
 days
 of
 collective
 inventory
 in


its
 various
 stages
 going
 from
 the


manufacturer
 to
 the
 ultimate
 customer


and
 another
 company
 has
 let's
 say
 5
 days


of


inventory
 between
 the
 manufacturer
 and


the
 customer
 and
 the
 material
 costs
 are


coming
 down
 like
 this
 there's
 only
 one


company
 that's
 going
 to
 win
 yeah
 right


because
 it
 has
 a
 structural
 cost


Advantage
 so
 that's
 what
 we
 had
 it
 also


had
 an
 way
 better
 return
 on
 Capital


right
 because
 we
 didn't
 have
 to
 have
 all


the
 capital
 employed
 there
 so
 um
 how
 did


we
 come
 about
 this
 well
 one
 way
 we
 came


about
 it
 is
 we
 didn't
 have
 any
 capital


right
 so
 so
 we
 had
 to
 invent
 something


that
 was
 way
 more
 efficient
 and
 we
 had


this
 direct
 to
 the
 customer
 model
 which


also
 gave
 us
 incredible
 Fidelity
 in
 the


signal
 of
 the
 demand
 yeah
 right
 because


you
 know
 if
 somebody
 walks
 into
 a
 store


well
 you
 have
 to
 have
 guessed
 before


what
 it
 is
 they're
 going
 to
 buy
 but
 if


somebody
 calls
 us
 on
 the
 phone
 or
 now


you
 know
 we
 have
 the
 internet
 right
 they


go
 online
 they
 buy
 something
 we
 know


exactly
 what
 they
 want
 right
 because


they're
 tell
 us
 yeah
 and
 that
 signal
 can


go
 back
 to
 our
 supplier
 you
 know
 in
 a


nanc
 and
 so
 you
 get
 this
 very
 efficient


supply
 chain
 that
 you
 know
 is
 also
 very


efficient
 in
 in
 in
 capital
 return
 you


mentioned
 it
 was
 important
 to
 have
 a


role
 models
 and
 of
 course
 uh
 some
 people


have
 football
 players
 and
 baseball


players
 as
 their
 role
 models
 I
 believe


you
 more
 had
 people
 like
 Bill
 Gates
 and


Steve
 Jobs
 and
 so
 on
 uh
 how
 important
 is


that
 yeah
 well
 and
 and
 you
 met
 Steve


Jobs
 when
 you
 were
 very
 young
 I
 did
 and


and
 you
 know
 you
 had
 you
 had
 uh
 you
 know


people
 like
 Fred
 Smith
 who
 started
 FedEx


and
 Charles
 Schwab
 and
 others
 you
 know


you
 could
 see
 entrepreneurs
 that
 were


out
 there
 you
 know
 starting
 businesses


you
 like
 that's
 pretty
 cool
 right
 what


what
 what
 what
 they're
 doing
 and
 um
 you


know
 it
 it
 was
 never
 like
 I
 want
 to
 be


exactly
 like
 that
 it's
 like
 well
 what


can
 I
 learn
 from
 that
 they
 did
 something


really
 cool
 and
 interesting
 and
 yeah
 I


think
 it's
 I
 think
 it's
 important


to
 have
 those
 examp


it's
 interesting
 because
 um
 when
 I


prepared
 for
 this
 I
 spoke
 to
 a
 lot
 of


people
 who
 know
 you
 and
 and
 they
 all
 say


you
 know
 what
 Michael
 Dell
 he's
 like
 a


he's
 like
 a
 real
 businessman
 he
 loves


business
 I
 mean
 there
 are
 few
 like
 dieh


hard
 businessmen
 and
 if
 it
 hadn't
 been


computers
 it
 would
 have
 been
 something


else
 just
 why
 do
 you
 love
 business
 I


think
 I
 think
 it's
 fun
 be
 because
 you


know
 uh
 it's
 it's
 an
 interesting
 puzzle


right
 to
 to
 solve
 right
 it's
 like
 why
 do


certain
 businesses
 grow
 and
 succeed
 why


do
 other


fail
 you
 know
 how
 do
 you
 position
 how
 do


you
 create
 the
 right
 products
 how
 do
 you


align
 the
 the
 people
 and
 the
 teams
 you


know
 to
 to
 to
 drive
 success
 and


ultimately
 progress
 in
 the
 world
 my
 view


is
 generally
 not
 from
 the


government
 it's
 from
 it's
 from
 the


private
 sector
 it's
 from
 individuals
 and


businesses
 that
 are
 propelling
 uh


Innovations
 and
 driving
 driving
 forward


and
 so
 you
 know
 to
 be
 a
 to
 be
 a
 part
 of


that
 in
 the
 technology
 sector
 in
 the


most
 exciting
 time
 in
 the
 world
 I
 don't


know
 anything
 that
 would
 be
 more
 fun
 and


interesting
 than
 that
 just
 off
 the
 year


2000
 you
 became
 the
 biggest
 brand
 in
 the


world
 did
 you
 celebrate
 that
 I
 mean
 are


you
 are
 you
 a
 believer
 in
 celebration


you
 know
 we
 kind
 of
 have
 this
 uh
 phrase


you
 know
 celebrate
 for
 a
 nanc
 so
 we
 not


we
 do
 some
 celebrations
 but
 not
 too
 big


into
 that
 we
 we
 mostly
 think
 about
 where


are
 we
 going
 in
 the
 future


how
 do
 we
 continue
 to
 grow
 and
 expand


and
 provide
 more
 to
 our
 customers
 and


you
 know
 we're
 in
 a
 business
 where
 it's


always
 changing
 there's
 always
 something


new
 coming
 what's
 been
 the
 biggest


surprise
 for
 you
 in
 terms
 of
 Technology


development
 so
 when
 you
 go
 back
 what
 has


been
 like
 wow
 this
 is
 I
 never
 expected


this
 to
 happen
 it
 kind
 of
 happens
 in
 a


bit
 a
 slow
 motion
 so
 it's
 not
 all
 that


surprising
 um
 I
 think
 certainly
 you
 know


in
 the
 last
 two
 or
 three
 years


the


tremendous
 uh
 progress
 in
 in
 Ai
 and


particularly
 large
 language
 models
 and


the
 speed
 at
 which
 that's
 happened
 and


how
 it's
 been
 diffused
 you
 know
 into


open
 source
 and
 you
 know
 is
 I
 think


really
 a
 revolution
 in
 a
 lot
 of
 areas
 I


was
 surprised
 by
 it
 um
 in
 in
 in
 the


instant
 that
 that
 it
 started
 to
 to


happen
 as
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 were


what
 is
 your
 take
 on
 the
 current
 state


of
 AI
 development
 I
 think
 we're
 in
 the


the
 the
 first
 10%
 of
 the
 scurve
 you
 know


and
 uh
 most
 of


the
 uh
 world
 has
 not
 really
 figured
 out


how
 to
 use
 all
 these
 tools
 although
 we


have
 access
 you
 know
 very
 broadly
 the


tools
 that
 we
 have
 are
 pretty
 amazing


but
 they're
 the
 worst
 they'll
 ever
 be


right
 they're
 going
 to
 get
 way
 way


better
 in
 5
 years
 and
 most
 of
 the
 data


that
 exists
 in
 the
 world
 hasn't
 even


been
 touched
 as
 it
 relates
 to
 uh
 these


kinds
 of
 tools
 and
 and
 and
 and
 there


will
 also
 be
 compounding
 improvements


that
 layer
 on
 top
 of
 the
 existing


improvements
 and
 yeah
 I
 think
 it's
 a


it's
 a
 it's
 a
 revolution
 in
 terms
 of
 the


productivity
 and
 efficiency
 that
 it


unlocks
 inside
 existing
 businesses
 more


than
 that
 I
 think
 it's
 an
 opportunity


for
 growth
 and
 for
 reimagining
 how
 a
 lot


of
 things
 are
 done
 in
 the
 world
 that


ultimately


will
 uh
 Propel
 you
 know
 Humanity
 forward


so
 when
 you
 look
 at
 because
 you
 have


insights
 into
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 Enterprises


and
 what
 what
 are
 the
 most
 exciting
 uh


changes
 and
 developments
 you're
 seeing


there
 I
 think
 we're
 I
 think
 we're
 still


very
 much
 at
 the
 beginning
 of
 this
 and


what's
 happening
 is
 businesses


Enterprises
 are
 realizing
 that
 they
 can


fundamentally
 rethink
 a
 number
 of
 their


processes
 and
 ultimately
 become
 much


better
 at
 the
 things
 that
 are
 important


to
 them


and
 uh
 automate
 a
 lot
 of
 things
 that
 are


wrote
 or
 not
 as
 interesting
 you
 know
 for


for
 humans
 to
 do
 and
 you
 know
 we
 had


this
 sort
 of
 uh
 shumer
 creative


Destruction
 for
 a
 long
 time
 right
 where


some
 new
 technology
 or
 model
 comes
 along


and
 and
 it
 you
 know
 replaces
 old
 ones


this
 is
 just
 that
 but
 turbocharged
 to
 an


extreme
 but
 is
 it
 slower
 than
 you
 had


expected
 is
 the
 uptake
 from
 normal


companies
 slower
 it
 doesn't
 feel
 very


slow
 to
 to
 from
 from
 where
 I
 see
 it


because
 people
 people
 are
 slow
 when
 it


comes
 to
 changing
 the
 way
 they
 work


right
 there
 there's
 definitely
 there's


definitely
 a
 cultural
 element
 there


right
 you
 you
 have
 to
 you
 have
 to
 want


to
 change
 and
 you
 have
 to
 have
 a
 culture


that
 Embraces
 change


and
 that's
 not
 always
 the
 case
 in
 all


organizations
 but
 I
 think
 what's


generally
 happening
 is
 you
 know
 you
 have


again
 a
 kind
 of
 s-curve
 adoption
 where


you
 have
 some
 early
 leaders
 in
 just


about
 every
 industry
 that
 kind
 of
 say


wow
 you
 know
 we
 can
 have
 10
 or
 20%


productivity
 Improvement
 not
 it's
 not


very
 hard
 to
 get
 that
 and
 there
 have


been
 sightings
 of
 30%
 or
 40%
 we
 better


go
 do
 that
 right
 and


if
 one
 firm
 does
 that
 and
 another
 firm


in
 the
 same
 industry
 hears
 about
 that


like
 well
 maybe
 we
 better
 do
 that
 too
 if


they
 don't
 you'll
 see
 firms
 more
 quickly


separating
 themselves
 succeeding
 faster


or
 failing
 faster
 which
 has
 generally


been
 a
 trend
 for
 a
 long
 time
 right
 the


the
 pace
 of
 business
 cycle
 been
 been


speeding
 up
 and


so
 uh
 I
 think
 we're
 I
 think
 we're


starting
 to
 see
 that
 and
 there
 there
 are


tons
 of
 use
 cases
 that
 are
 obvious
 from


software


development
 you
 know
 enhancing
 the
 the


the
 productivity
 of
 software


developers
 making
 the
 code
 actually


better
 Sam
 Sam
 Oldman
 told
 us
 that
 we


should
 improve
 over
 productivity
 by
 20%


so
 that's
 the
 target
 we
 have
 well
 there


you
 go
 I
 and
 I
 think
 that
 is
 a


completely
 reasonable
 Target
 that's
 not


a
 crazy
 Target
 at
 all
 given
 the
 tools


that
 are
 out
 there
 now
 I
 think
 it's
 it's


easier
 for
 larger
 firms
 than
 smaller


firms
 because
 there
 are
 way
 more
 people


involved
 in
 the
 processes
 that
 go
 on


inside
 larger
 firms
 yeah
 right
 but
 they


also
 have
 you
 know
 cultural


inertia
 and
 you
 know
 things
 that
 can
 get


in
 the
 way
 but
 you
 know
 this
 is
 this
 is


why
 leaders
 differentiate
 they're
 able


to
 make
 changes
 that
 Propel


organizations
 forward
 yeah
 talking
 about


tools
 who
 do
 you
 think
 will
 um
 will
 win


the
 hardware
 race
 the
 chip
 race
 clearly


we
 we
 have
 one
 company
 you
 know
 Nvidia


that
 has
 uh
 got
 an
 incredible
 early
 lead


right
 and
 and
 they're
 they're
 they're


they're
 in
 a
 great


position
 uh
 lots
 of
 companies
 have


entered
 the
 space
 I
 don't
 think
 of
 it
 as


as
 uh
 as
 you
 know
 one
 company
 wins


everything


so
 you
 know
 first
 of


all
 AI
 itself
 will
 occur
 anywhere
 where


there
 is
 data
 right
 so
 on
 your
 PC
 on


your
 phone
 in
 your
 car
 every
 thing
 in


the
 world
 is
 becoming
 more
 intelligent


and
 more
 connected
 you
 know
 and
 is


generating
 data
 and
 so
 the
 AI
 is
 going


to
 go
 to
 where
 the
 where
 the
 data
 is
 and


you
 know
 some
 of
 it
 will
 occur
 in
 big


training
 you
 know
 data
 centers
 like
 the


kind
 we're
 building
 and
 and
 uh
 you
 know


talking
 about
 but
 most
 of
 it
 will


actually
 occur
 in
 the
 real
 physical


world
 so
 I
 think
 there
 will
 be
 many


companies
 that
 that
 succeed
 in
 in
 that


space
 certainly
 we
 have
 been
 you
 know


probably
 the
 leading
 company
 in
 the


world
 now
 building
 these


large
 AI
 uh
 server
 farms
 for
 uh
 training


and
 inference
 to
 to
 fuel
 these
 AI


engines
 some
 people
 think
 that
 uh


eventually
 uh
 compute
 will
 be


free
 you
 think
 computer
 will
 be
 free


eventually
 sure
 you
 can
 have
 a
 free


computer
 just
 doesn't
 do
 very
 much
 right


if
 you
 want
 the
 latest
 one
 that
 cost
 a


little
 more
 than
 free
 right
 um
 but
 I


mean
 the
 cost
 you
 know
 of
 of
 a
 given


unit
 of
 computing
 certainly
 is
 ASM


totically
 approaching
 zero
 for
 sure
 it's


just
 that
 what
 you
 want
 to
 do
 that's


interesting
 and


valuable
 uses
 more
 computing
 power


moving
 into
 uh
 consumer
 PCS
 so
 um
 a


third
 of
 your
 income
 is
 from
 commercial


PC


um
 like
 the
 one
 I
 have
 on
 at
 my
 desk


what
 are
 the
 important
 Innovations


taking
 place
 here
 now
 they
 look
 a
 bit


like
 they
 don't
 change
 that
 much
 right
 I


mean
 they
 look
 a
 bit
 like
 the
 one
 I
 had


last
 year
 and
 last
 year
 yeah
 this
 is


kind
 of
 the
 deceptive
 thing
 right


because
 if
 I
 said
 here's
 a
 PC
 right
 well


you
 could
 have
 a
 PC
 from
 40
 years
 ago
 or


30
 years
 ago
 you
 know
 10
 years
 ago
 still


a
 PC
 right
 well
 actually
 what
 the
 PC


does
 is
 very
 very
 different
 than
 it
 used


to
 do
 and
 so
 we
 keep
 asking
 to
 do
 more


and
 more
 things
 right
 now
 the
 big
 thing


that's
 that's
 you
 know
 going
 in
 the
 PC


is
 AI
 and
 you
 know
 we
 used
 to
 have
 the


the
 CPU
 right
 then
 we
 had
 the
 GPU
 now
 we


have
 something
 called
 the
 npu
 a
 neural


processing
 unit
 and
 it
 is
 a
 part
 of
 the


processor
 that
 speeds
 up
 the
 AI


activities
 that
 occur
 on
 the
 PC
 to
 an


incredible
 degree
 and
 pretty
 much
 all


the
 soft
 software
 that
 you're
 using
 is


being
 Rewritten
 so
 that
 anytime
 there's


a
 prompt
 uh
 or
 some
 you
 know
 user


interaction
 that
 is
 that
 experience
 is


enhanced
 and
 made
 better
 using
 Ai
 and


most
 of
 that
 AI
 maybe
 85
 90%
 of
 it
 will


run
 locally
 on
 your
 PC
 and
 so
 we
 talk


about
 the
 AI
 PC
 and
 there
 are
 1.5


billion
 PCS
 in
 the
 world
 rough


and
 about
 750
 million
 of
 them
 are
 more


than
 four
 years
 old
 obviously
 they're


not
 going
 to
 be
 able
 to
 do
 this
 even
 the


ones
 from
 last
 year
 don't
 really
 do
 it


so
 all
 the
 new
 ones
 have


these
 npu
 the
 this
 this
 ability
 to


enhance
 AI
 software
 on
 them
 and
 that's


probably
 the
 biggest
 thing
 that's
 going


on
 in
 addition
 to
 you
 know
 longer


battery
 life
 we
 have
 you
 know
 more
 than


24hour
 battery
 life
 you
 know
 super
 super


bright
 dis
 super
 thin
 super
 light
 very


secure
 you
 know
 all
 the
 things
 that


you'd
 want
 in
 a
 in
 a
 in
 a
 new
 machine
 to


replace
 the
 one
 that's
 that's
 several


years
 old
 there's
 so
 we
 will
 continue
 to


buy
 new
 ones
 basically
 yeah
 I
 mean
 if


you
 want
 to
 be
 in
 the
 in
 the
 future


right
 you
 we
 sell
 a
 product
 in
 in
 in
 the


PC
 which
 is
 actually
 not
 our
 main


business
 by
 by
 profits
 right
 uh
 that


would
 be
 the
 cloud
 and
 the
 data
 center


um
 we
 sell
 a
 product
 that
 is
 a
 fine
 life


Appliance
 okay
 what
 that
 means
 is
 that


when
 we
 create
 a
 new
 one
 that
 is


significantly
 better
 than
 the
 old
 one


you'll
 want
 to
 replace
 it
 uh
 now
 if
 we


don't
 create
 one
 that's
 that
 much
 better


then
 you
 won't
 want
 to
 replace
 it
 so


that's
 our
 job
 is
 to
 make
 it
 so


compelling
 that
 you
 don't
 want
 your
 old


one
 anymore
 now
 moving
 on
 to
 um
 uh
 uh
 to


the
 company
 so
 in
 you
 were
 listed
 on
 a


so
 exchange
 for
 25
 years
 and
 then
 in


2013
 you
 took
 Del
 private
 to
 get
 off
 the


stock
 exchange
 correct
 why
 why
 did
 you


do
 that
 so


um
 you
 know
 around


2010
 we


started
 uh
 evolving
 the
 company


in
 uh
 into
 new
 areas
 and
 we
 were
 making


Acquisitions
 and
 we
 were
 building
 uh
 you


know
 cloud
 data
 center
 networking


storage
 capability
 and
 kind
 of
 the
 more


we
 did
 that
 the
 less
 the
 market
 liked
 it


at
 the
 same
 time
 something
 else
 was


going
 on
 you
 had
 the
 the
 smartphone
 and


the
 tablet
 right
 were
 sort
 of
 On
 The


Rise
 and
 so
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 looked
 at


the
 smartphone
 and
 the
 tablet
 they
 said


well
 that
 that's
 the
 new
 thing
 we
 don't


need
 the
 PC
 anymore
 because
 we
 have
 we


have
 these
 other
 things
 and
 Dell
 even


though
 it
 has
 all
 these
 other
 businesses


it's
 kind
 of
 a
 PC
 company
 so
 the
 PC's


dead
 so
 therefore
 Dell's
 dead
 right
 so


so
 the
 stock
 kept
 going
 down
 we're


buying
 back
 the
 stock
 at
 one
 point
 the


stock
 is
 like
 really
 low
 and
 I'm


thinking
 this
 is
 kind
 of
 crazy
 I
 this


company's
 generating
 lots
 of
 free
 cash


flow
 billions
 of
 dollars
 of
 free
 cash


flow
 every
 year
 it
 had
 generated
 $150


billion
 dollar
 of
 cash
 flow
 in
 in
 its


lifetime
 let's
 just
 do
 a
 huge
 buyback


let's
 buy
 back
 all
 the
 shares
 okay
 and


and
 and
 we'll
 accelerate
 the


transformation
 of
 the


company
 uh
 faster
 because
 we
 won't
 be


thinking
 about
 the
 quarterly
 you
 know
 uh


uh
 you
 know
 gyration
 we'll
 be
 thinking


more
 about
 the
 fiveyear
 and
 the
 10year


outcome
 so
 that's
 what
 we
 did
 but
 you


also
 bought
 so
 when
 it
 was
 Private
 you


also
 bought
 EMC
 very
 big
 deal
 yeah
 we
 so


so
 when
 we
 when
 we
 when
 we
 took
 SP
 like


67
 billion
 right
 so
 biggest
 technology


acquisition
 correct
 the
 world
 had
 ever


seen
 right
 so
 when
 when
 when
 we
 took
 Del


private
 it
 was
 the
 largest
 take
 private


ever
 in
 technology
 yeah
 and
 then
 a


private
 company
 uh
 bought


a$
 67
 billion
 public
 company
 and
 took
 it


private


too
 which
 was
 kind
 of
 fun
 and
 um
 that


significantly
 accelerated
 our


transformation
 now
 we
 kind
 of
 became
 uh


like
 a
 public
 company
 then
 because
 we


had
 a
 tracking
 stock
 associated
 with


emc's
 ownership
 in


VMware
 and
 uh
 and
 then
 ultimately
 we
 we


became
 a
 fully
 public
 company
 again
 at


the
 end
 of
 2018
 so
 it's
 the
 most


profitable
 private
 deal
 ever
 I
 think


that's
 what
 I'm
 told
 it
 it's
 worked
 it's


worked
 out
 well
 could
 have
 been
 a
 lot


worse
 but
 it
 worked
 out
 well
 so
 you


characterize
 it
 as
 as
 fun
 still
 did
 you


have
 any
 fear
 uh
 when
 you
 were
 doing


that
 or
 not
 really
 a
 little
 bit
 a
 little


bit
 you
 know
 there
 there
 were
 certainly


uh
 periods
 where
 there
 was
 uncertainty


right
 like
 okay
 how's
 all
 this
 going
 to


work
 right
 you
 know
 we're
 uh
 this
 is
 a


fairly
 big
 company
 we're
 we're
 buying


and
 combining
 with
 our
 company
 and
 and


you
 had
 some
 activist
 investors
 who


didn't
 make
 life
 easier
 for
 you
 we
 did


we
 did
 yeah
 um
 so
 there
 was
 there
 was


there
 was
 definitely
 there
 were


definitely
 some
 moments
 but
 we
 worked


through
 through
 all
 that
 had
 a
 lot
 of


great
 people
 helping
 me
 and
 you
 know
 we


we
 had
 a
 we
 had
 a
 theory
 about
 how
 it


would
 work


and
 uh
 it
 actually
 turned
 out
 better


than
 we
 thought
 in
 in
 almost
 all
 areas


not
 not
 everyone
 and
 we
 were
 able
 to


create
 you
 know
 a
 a
 much
 broader
 set
 of


capabilities
 for
 customers
 that


customers
 thought
 you
 know
 was
 very


attractive
 what
 was
 the
 one
 thing
 that


went
 particularly
 much
 better
 than
 you


had
 expected
 well
 we
 we
 we
 believe
 that


if
 we
 went
 to
 our
 large
 Enterprise


customers
 and
 we
 said
 well
 you
 know
 in


the
 past
 you
 you
 would
 buy
 the
 servers


from
 Dell
 and
 you
 would
 buy
 the
 storage


from
 EMC
 and
 you
 would
 buy
 you
 know
 some


software
 here
 and
 You'
 put
 all
 this


stuff
 together
 and
 that
 if
 we
 said
 well


hey
 you
 know
 we're
 number
 one
 in
 all


these
 areas
 including
 commercial


PCS
 would
 you
 rather
 have
 fewer


suppliers
 than


more
 that
 they
 would
 like
 that
 and
 we


didn't
 really
 need
 heroic


assumptions
 uh
 for
 for
 the
 the
 you
 know


the
 combination
 with
 EMC
 to
 work
 and
 so


we
 didn't
 really
 have
 heroic
 assumptions


but
 it
 turned
 out
 that
 it
 worked
 even


better
 than
 we
 thought
 and
 so
 there
 was


you
 know
 $20
 billion
 in
 organic
 Revenue


growth
 uh
 in
 the
 first
 several


years
 and
 uh
 customers
 really
 liked
 what


we
 were
 doing
 so
 we
 you
 know
 cranked
 up


the
 Innovation
 engine
 we
 kept
 applying


you
 know
 uh
 new
 capabilities


and
 uh
 customers
 liked
 it
 well


congratulations
 it's
 incredible
 what
 are


the
 positiv
 was
 a
 lot
 of
 fun
 still
 is


yeah
 I
 know
 I
 can
 see
 that
 what
 um
 what


are
 the
 positives
 and
 negatives
 of
 being


a
 private
 being
 a
 public
 company
 are
 you


having
 a
 stock
 market
 listing
 you
 know
 I


think
 I
 think
 you
 you
 could
 do
 it
 either


way
 uh


honestly
 you
 know
 back
 in
 2012
 2013
 we


had
 kind
 of
 gotten
 ourselves
 into
 a
 into


a
 bad
 situation
 really
 where
 we
 were


overly
 short-term
 focused
 and


so
 you
 know
 going
 private
 was
 a
 was
 a


great
 reset
 for
 us
 and
 it
 allowed
 us
 to


kind
 of
 reignite
 the
 entrepreneurial


culture
 and
 reset
 the
 time
 Horizon
 to
 a


longer
 one
 and
 we've
 been
 able
 to


maintain
 that
 you
 know
 even
 as
 we've


come
 public


again
 um
 and
 so
 yeah
 I
 mean
 everybody


understands
 the
 the
 kind
 of
 pluses
 and


minuses
 um
 but
 you
 know
 for
 us
 th
 those


were
 those
 were
 the
 main
 things
 and
 and


you
 know
 how
 do
 you
 maintain
 a
 longer


term


orientation
 you
 know
 even
 as
 you're
 a


public
 company
 and
 you
 you
 you
 mentioned


resetting
 Cora
 culture
 what
 is
 the
 Cora


culture
 at
 Dell
 how
 would
 you
 describe


it
 it's
 winning
 it's
 it's
 it's
 it's


delivering
 value
 for
 our
 customers
 it


is
 understanding
 their
 requirements
 and


solving
 them
 it
 is
 uh
 a
 results


orientation
 um
 it
 is
 uh
 play
 nice
 but


win
 yeah
 so
 kind
 of
 brings
 brings
 us
 to


the
 book
 you
 you
 wrote
 there
 yes
 play


nice
 but
 win
 what
 what
 does
 it
 mean
 it


means
 that
 you
 know
 we
 we
 can
 be
 fair


and
 ethical
 and
 honest
 in
 our
 approach


and
 also
 win
 um
 and
 um
 you
 know
 it's


just
 it's
 something
 I
 learned
 from
 from


my
 parents
 from
 my
 mother


specifically
 um
 that
 she
 taught
 me
 and


my
 my
 two
 brothers
 when
 we
 were
 when
 we


were
 little
 kids
 and
 kind
 of
 stuck
 with


me
 and
 uh
 it's
 kind
 of
 uh
 in
 the
 book
 I


talk
 a
 lot
 more
 about
 the
 less
 it's
 a


great
 book
 I
 I
 love
 the
 book
 thank
 you
 I


had
 a
 lot
 of
 fun
 writing
 the
 book
 too
 I


did
 that
 during
 during
 Co
 but
 what's
 the


key
 to
 winning
 I
 mean
 how
 do
 you
 win
 in


this
 industry
 it's
 a
 complicated
 uh


mixture
 of
 things
 right
 it's
 part


strategy
 it's
 part
 uh
 engaging
 and


understanding
 you
 know
 new
 customer


requirements
 I
 mean
 at
 one
 level
 what
 we


do
 is
 we
 solve
 problems
 that
 customers


have
 that
 are
 valuable
 and
 important
 to


them
 now
 and
 in
 the
 future
 and
 if
 we
 do


that
 successfully
 they
 give
 us
 more


business
 and
 we
 grow
 and
 we
 Thrive
 as
 a


as
 a
 business
 and
 if
 we
 don't
 we
 you


know
 we're
 gone
 right
 just
 the
 way
 it


works
 and
 so
 our
 job
 is
 to
 listen
 with


big
 ears
 and
 understand
 the
 customer


requirements
 what
 are
 those
 challenges


are
 uh
 now
 there's
 more
 to
 it
 than
 that


right
 we
 have
 to
 also
 understand
 and


what
 are
 the
 molecular
 ingredients
 of


technology
 that
 are
 coming
 around
 the


corner
 uh
 and
 all
 the
 Innovations
 in


science
 that
 are
 going
 to


enable
 uh
 the
 the
 new
 capabilities
 that


that
 can
 be
 built
 in
 software
 hardware


and
 everything
 else
 and
 so
 how
 do
 you


have
 the
 biggest
 impact
 on
 the
 company


now
 I
 spend
 my
 time
 on
 on
 strategy
 on
 uh


products
 on
 customers
 on
 you
 know
 de


developing
 uh
 our
 our
 team
 and
 and
 our


leaders
 um
 you
 know
 and
 and
 certainly
 a


big
 part
 of
 strategy


is
 where
 are
 we
 going
 to
 focus
 our
 our


resources
 and
 uh
 what
 is
 our
 path
 to


continuing
 to
 win
 and
 create
 value
 when


you
 speak
 to
 other
 CEOs
 do
 you
 see
 a


difference
 between
 the
 founders
 the


people
 who
 have
 founded
 and
 St
 CEOs
 and


other
 CEOs
 not


always
 um
 but
 certainly


you
 know
 it
 is
 personal
 right
 when
 you


when
 you
 found
 when
 you
 found
 a
 company


and
 you
 it's
 been
 your
 life's
 work
 right


and
 you
 you've
 been
 doing
 doing
 it
 uh


for
 all
 of
 your
 adult
 conscious


life
 uh
 yeah
 I
 think
 there's
 something


different
 there
 but
 but
 I
 I've
 seen


plenty
 of
 non-founders
 who
 who
 are
 also


incredibly
 passionate
 about
 what
 they're


doing
 uh
 so
 I
 don't
 think
 there's
 a
 hard


and
 fast
 rule
 about
 that
 do
 people
 dare


to
 disagree
 with
 you
 well
 if
 they
 don't


disagree
 with
 me
 then
 I
 get
 very
 worried


right
 and
 so
 you
 know
 we
 we
 we
 we
 we
 try


to
 create
 an
 environment
 that
 we
 make


sure
 uh
 that
 we
 have
 active
 debate
 and


discussion
 first
 of
 all
 I
 don't
 try
 to


make
 all
 the
 decisions
 myself
 that
 would


be
 disastrous
 would
 slow
 the
 company


down
 but
 to
 your
 point
 you
 need
 you
 need


a
 a
 team
 that's
 able
 to
 have
 a
 a


rigorous
 debate
 and
 you
 know
 I
 mean


I'm
 often
 very
 uh
 unsure
 about
 a
 lot
 of


things
 right
 because
 things
 are
 moving


around
 all
 the
 time
 things
 are
 changing


and


so
 you
 know
 we
 we
 often
 have
 this
 notion


of
 uh
 okay
 we've
 got
 an
 idea
 and
 a


belief
 but
 they
 could
 change
 right
 new


information
 new
 data
 new
 facts
 uh


something
 different
 happened
 we
 change


our
 mind
 so
 uh
 this
 friend
 of
 mine
 he


went
 to
 a
 conference
 at
 a
 hotel
 in
 uh


in
 Texas
 and
 there
 was
 his
 notepad
 on


the
 table
 and
 you
 there's
 a
 quote
 from


you
 at
 the
 bottom
 of
 the
 notepad
 and
 it


says
 try
 never
 to
 be
 the
 smartest
 person


in
 the
 room
 and
 if
 you
 are
 I
 suggest
 you


invite
 smarter
 people
 or
 find
 a


different
 room
 yeah
 I
 mean
 you
 you
 you


want
 to
 surround
 yourself
 with
 really


smart
 people
 that
 that
 can
 you
 know
 help


Propel
 whatever
 it
 is
 you're
 doing


forward
 and
 uh
 I
 I
 believe
 that
 and
 what


is
 it
 that
 keep
 you
 hungry
 now
 I
 mean


you
 are
 you
 you
 have
 this
 incredbly


successful
 company
 you're
 one
 of
 the


richest
 people
 in
 the
 world
 just
 what


makes
 you
 excited
 you
 know
 uh
 we
 just
 we


you
 know
 last
 week
 was
 the
 superc


Computing
 24
 show
 right
 we
 showed
 off


this
 rack
 where
 we
 can
 put
 50
 trillion


transistors
 in
 one
 rack
 okay
 and
 if
 you


if
 you
 step
 back
 and
 you
 think
 about


that
 amount
 of
 computing
 power
 and
 what


can
 be
 done
 in
 uh
 drug
 Discovery
 as
 it


relates
 to
 cancer
 or
 in
 solving
 all
 the


unsolved
 problems
 in
 the


world
 uh
 that
 is
 what
 excites
 me
 what


excites
 me
 is
 the
 impact
 that
 technology


has
 on
 the
 world
 in
 a
 in
 a
 very
 positive


way
 and
 that's
 what
 we
 do
 any
 particular


areas
 you
 excited
 about
 I
 mean
 I
 know


your
 philanthropy
 for
 instance
 goes


into
 health
 education
 yeah


definitely
 I
 definitely
 I
 think
 health


is
 is
 an
 area
 where
 technology
 has
 yet


to
 make
 the
 impact
 that
 it
 could
 and


we're
 starting
 to
 see
 some
 signs
 that


you
 know
 it
 it
 can
 have
 an
 enormous


impact
 in
 in
 the
 next
 decade
 or
 so
 and


uh
 you
 know
 that's
 incredibly
 exciting
 I


think
 education
 you
 know
 this
 idea
 of
 an


infinitely
 patient
 tutor
 that
 can
 help


you
 know
 a
 student
 learn
 exactly
 the


thing
 that
 they
 need
 to
 learn
 to
 to


advance


and
 ultimately
 you
 know
 technology
 has


always
 been
 about
 enabling
 human


potential


and
 the
 last
 you
 know
 uh
 40
 years
 have


been
 incredibly
 exciting
 but
 I
 think


it's
 just
 a
 pregame
 show
 I
 think
 we're


we're
 just
 getting
 to
 the
 the
 more


interesting
 part
 where
 technology
 is
 is


going
 to
 have
 a
 much
 bigger
 role
 in


progressing
 the
 world
 forward
 and
 so
 you


know
 we're
 not
 doing
 everything
 there's


a
 lot
 of
 we
 have
 to
 work
 with
 a
 lot
 of


other
 companies
 to
 make
 all
 this
 happen


but
 to
 be
 a
 part
 of
 that
 is
 incredibly


exciting
 fascinating
 interesting
 and
 fun


at
 the
 same
 time
 as
 you
 have
 done
 uh


built
 the
 technology
 company
 you
 also


have
 built
 MSD
 Capital
 which
 is
 well


which
 was
 in
 a
 way
 a
 family
 office
 but


has
 become
 much
 bigger
 right
 um
 and
 one


of
 the
 most
 successful
 investment


boutiques
 on
 Wall
 Street
 you
 hire
 Greg


lmow
 from
 Goldman
 is
 a
 an
 extremely


accomplished
 investment
 bankers
 you


merged
 it
 with
 uh
 BDT
 and
 other
 a
 very


strong
 firm
 how
 do
 you
 see
 this
 going


forward
 MSD
 BDT
 right
 so
 you
 know
 it


really
 started
 out
 as
 investing
 you
 know


for
 our
 foundation
 and
 for
 our
 family


and
 then
 you
 know
 I
 had
 a
 bunch
 of


friends
 that
 said
 well
 you
 know
 hey


looks
 like
 you're
 uh
 doing
 this
 pretty


well
 can
 we
 come
 and
 take
 a
 look
 sure


yeah
 come
 and
 take
 a
 look
 and
 then
 and


they
 said
 we
 want
 to
 build
 the
 same


thing
 you
 know
 okay
 fine
 great
 go
 build


the
 same
 thing
 and
 uh
 they
 came
 back
 a


couple
 years
 later
 and
 said
 well
 we
 we


tried
 it's
 it's


hard
 uh
 can
 we
 invest
 with
 you
 said
 no


no
 we
 don't
 want
 to
 do
 that
 uh
 they
 came


back
 a
 you
 know
 few
 times
 and
 a
 couple


years
 later
 we
 said
 okay
 fine
 so
 so
 we


we
 sort
 of
 set
 up
 a
 firm
 to
 help
 other


Founders
 usually
 and
 some
 some


families
 and
 uh
 and
 then
 merging
 with


BDT
 now
 we
 have
 something
 much
 greater


which
 essentially
 provides
 you
 know


aligned
 advice
 and
 aligned
 capital
 and


uh
 aligned
 investment


Solutions
 uh
 not
 just
 for
 our
 family
 but


for
 lots
 of
 families
 and
 and
 um
 as
 I


said
 I
 love
 business
 I
 love
 investing


it's
 all
 very
 interesting
 and
 fun
 what


what
 is
 your
 role
 in
 this
 I
 am
 mostly


still
 running
 Delta
 Technologies
 as
 the


chairman
 CEO
 uh
 but
 I'm
 you
 know


chairman
 of
 The
 Advisory
 Board
 of
 the


firm
 and
 I
 help
 the
 firm
 you
 know
 in


areas
 where
 I
 you
 know
 maybe
 know
 a


little
 bit
 more
 than
 than
 some
 other


areas
 and
 you
 know
 Greg
 and
 Byron
 Trot


are
 doing
 a
 great
 job
 leading
 the
 firm


they
 don't
 really
 need
 my
 help
 that
 much


but
 you
 know
 I'll
 pitch
 in
 from
 time
 to


time
 when
 I
 when
 I
 can
 help
 you


mentioned
 uh
 fun
 uh
 a
 few
 times
 and


clearly
 you
 are
 more
 fun
 than
 most
 cosos


that's
 uh
 that's
 a
 very
 that's
 very


clear
 what
 what
 place
 does
 humor
 play
 in


your
 company
 I
 think
 Humber
 is
 is
 very


important
 yeah
 I
 mean
 if
 you
 can't
 laugh


joke
 around
 uh
 play
 tricks
 on
 people
 you


know
 you're
 doing
 it
 wrong
 right
 so
 you


you
 have
 you
 have
 to
 be
 able
 to
 laugh
 at


yourself
 and
 you
 know
 and
 uh
 and
 humor


is
 incredibly
 important
 do
 you
 look
 for


it
 when
 you
 hire
 do
 you
 hire
 fun
 people


are
 people
 in
 in
 Dell
 more
 fun
 than
 than


anywhere
 else
 I
 don't
 know
 about
 that


um
 um
 me
 personally
 I
 have
 not
 spent
 a


lot
 of
 time
 in
 recent
 years
 um
 hiring


from
 the
 outside
 most
 of
 the
 the
 work


that
 I've
 done
 in
 the
 company
 has
 been


developing
 and
 training
 the
 next


generation
 of
 leaders
 inside
 the
 company


yeah
 I'm
 spending
 time


developing
 uh
 our
 team
 figuring
 out
 you


know
 who
 who
 who
 who
 speaks
 up
 right
 who


has
 a
 different
 perspective
 who
 can
 see


around
 corners
 and
 who
 has
 new


interesting
 ideas
 and
 who's
 not
 afraid


to
 challenge
 the
 way
 we
 did
 it


before
 uh
 those
 are
 the
 people
 that
 I


want
 to
 have
 more
 responsibility
 how'


you
 relax
 uh
 well
 I
 learned
 a
 long
 time


ago
 that
 there's
 a
 diminishing
 return
 to


the
 number
 of
 hours
 worked
 in
 any
 given


day
 right
 and
 if
 you're
 going
 to
 do


something
 for
 a
 long
 time
 you
 better


find
 the
 right
 sort
 of
 you
 know
 balance


it's
 maybe
 not
 exactly
 the
 right
 word


but
 but
 uh
 what's
 the
 right
 mixture


right
 of
 working
 and
 playing
 and


relaxing


I
 go
 to
 sleep
 pretty
 early
 you
 know
 like


when
 when
 do
 you
 go
 uh
 like
 8:30
 9:00
 I


get
 up
 I
 you
 know
 like
 to
 work
 out


exercise
 when
 did
 you
 get
 up
 four


something
 maybe
 five
 something
 and
 you


work
 out
 every
 day
 yeah
 pretty
 much
 yeah


so
 you
 go
 to
 gym
 at
 home
 yeah
 you
 won't


find
 me
 at
 the
 night
 cap
 um
 I'll
 be


asleep
 do
 barbecue
 you
 fromat
 you
 were


from
 Texas
 I
 would
 have
 expected
 you
 to


be
 a
 big
 barbecue
 I
 I
 I
 eat
 barbecue
 um


I
 believe
 in
 the
 theory
 of
 labor


specialization
 so
 I
 personally
 am
 not


cooking
 a
 lot
 of
 barbecue
 but
 I


definitely
 eating
 barbecue
 and
 what's


your
 favorite
 cut
 uh
 well
 in
 in
 Austin


we
 have
 a
 a
 great
 place
 called
 Terry


blacks
 and
 they
 have
 these
 incredible


ribs
 that
 are
 just
 amazing
 so
 I


recommend


that
 um
 now
 we
 got
 a
 TENS
 of
 of


thousands
 of
 young
 people
 listening
 to


this
 what
 is
 your
 advice
 to
 young
 people


uh
 experiment
 take
 risks
 fail
 find


difficult


problems
 do
 something
 valuable
 Don't
 Be


Afraid
 uh
 and
 uh
 you
 know
 be
 be
 bold
 and


don't
 listen
 to
 your
 parents
 because
 if


you
 had
 you
 wouldn't
 have
 been
 there


today
 well
 yeah
 your
 your
 your
 parents


aren't
 always
 right
 uh
 but
 they're
 not


always
 wrong
 either
 so
 um
 yeah
 I
 your


mileage
 may
 vary
 on
 on
 the


parents
 well
 Michael
 what
 an
 incredible


journey
 it's
 been
 wonderful
 to
 have
 you


on
 the
 podcast
 a
 big
 thanks
 thanks
 thank


you
 great
 to
 be
 with
 you
