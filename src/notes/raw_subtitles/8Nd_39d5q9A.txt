Hey,
 I'm
 Nathaniel
 Johnson.
 I'm
 the


co-founder
 and
 CEO
 here
 at
 Series.
 I'm


21
 years
 old.
 I'm
 currently
 a
 junior
 at


Yale
 University,
 studying
 computer


science
 and
 economics.
 I
 love
 playing


basketball
 on
 the
 side.
 Of
 course,
 I'm


also
 powerlifting,
 but
 most
 importantly


startups,
 which
 is
 why
 I'm
 here.
 Series


is
 the
 first
 AI
 social
 network.
 We
 are


essentially
 using
 AI
 friends
 to
 make


warm
 introductions
 via
 iMessage
 to
 help


you
 meet
 new
 people
 based
 on
 a
 want
 or


need
 you
 have.
 For
 message
 count,
 I


think
 we're
 at
 around
 like
 a
 quarter
 of


a
 million,
 which
 is
 really
 exciting
 to


see.
 We
 raised
 $3.1
 million
 in
 14
 days,


which
 is
 now
 the
 largest
 round
 of
 any


startup
 that
 is
 currently
 in
 the
 Ivy


League


[Music]


series
 was
 honestly
 a
 really
 I
 think


interesting
 story.
 It
 actually
 started


when
 Sean,
 my
 co-founder,
 and
 I
 started


a
 podcast
 our
 freshman
 year
 at
 Yale.


This
 is
 interviewing
 founders
 and
 CEOs


from
 23
 and
 me
 to
 genius
 lyrics
 to


Runway.
 We're
 very
 actually
 curious
 on


how
 exactly
 they
 used
 their
 own
 warm


network
 to
 build
 successful
 businesses.


We
 know
 how
 hard
 it
 is
 to
 get
 access
 to


the
 right
 people,
 especially
 for


professional
 reasons,
 whether
 that
 is


raising
 capital
 or
 that's
 getting
 a
 new


job.
 I'd
 imagine
 that
 anyone
 who
 goes
 to


a
 swear
 IB
 internship,
 there's


definitely
 five
 people
 that
 were


probably
 just
 equal,
 if
 not
 better,
 of
 a


candidate
 that
 didn't
 make
 it.
 college


internship
 that
 aren't
 able
 to
 have
 say


like
 dad's
 golf
 buddy
 to
 get
 them
 into


the
 IB
 internship.
 I'd
 say
 connections


but
 more
 importantly
 I
 guess
 perceived


value
 is
 something
 that
 usually
 requires


a
 warm
 network
 to
 be
 able
 to
 get
 into.


This
 is
 a
 problem
 that
 we
 need
 to
 be


able
 to
 help
 solve
 and
 that
 can
 be


solved
 through
 essentially
 using
 agentic


matchmaking
 to
 make
 those
 connections


more
 accessible.
 So
 what
 happened
 is
 we


ended
 up
 experimenting
 with
 AI,
 right?
 I


come
 from
 a
 CS
 background
 and
 was
 able


to
 initially
 construct
 this
 like
 early


version
 chatbot
 that
 used
 emails
 to
 make


warm
 intros.
 We
 blasted
 that
 to
 Yale's


email
 list
 to
 Princeton
 I
 think
 a
 day


later
 and
 it
 kind
 of
 had
 some
 sort
 of


variety
 kind
 of
 blew
 up
 within
 that


student
 community.
 People
 were
 using


this
 for
 like
 startup
 ideas,
 art
 gallery


ideas,
 kind
 of
 a
 specific
 range
 like


mainly
 professional
 reasons
 to
 realize


that
 this
 should
 be
 the
 future
 how
 we


network.
 I
 don't
 think
 we're
 competing


against
 anyone
 and
 the
 most
 common


reason
 why
 is
 all
 of
 them
 have
 in
 common


a
 number
 a
 number
 of
 your
 immediate


follower
 connection
 like
 account
 we
 have


no
 numbers
 on
 this
 platform
 because
 it's


purely
 agent
 to
 agent
 that's
 something


that
 I
 think
 series
 will
 actually
 solve


and
 then
 hopefully
 myself
 can
 solve
 as


well


cool
 thing
 about
 what
 we're
 doing
 with


this
 series
 race
 which
 obviously
 a
 lot


of
 people
 are
 talking
 about
 is
 we're


doing
 something
 a
 bit
 unconventional


right
 by
 creating
 this
 house
 what
 we
 did


is
 we
 figured
 out
 a
 way
 to
 incentivize


people
 to
 one
 of
 course
 grow
 our
 product


and
 use
 that
 but
 two
 tie
 to
 something


that
 I
 think
 is
 a
 bit
 social
 instead
 of


us
 trying
 to
 focus
 on
 organic
 way
 of


having
 interns
 be
 paid
 remotely
 an


organic
 way
 of
 being
 able
 to
 market
 your


product
 with
 UGC
 content
 which
 everyone


does
 why
 not
 have
 our
 interns
 come
 into


a
 house
 right
 instead
 of
 them
 just
 being


online
 to
 do
 the
 same
 work
 they're
 going


to
 do
 previously
 that's
 kind
 of how
 the


idea
 occurred
 and
 I
 think
 what
 makes


company
 go
 viral
 is
 do
 something
 a
 bit


controversial
 but
 having
 the
 right
 facts


behind
 and
 what
 they're
 doing.
 If
 you
 do


something
 controversial
 that
 was
 stupid,


right,
 it's
 not
 going
 to
 go
 viral
 for


the
 right
 reason,
 nor
 is it's
 going to


make
 you
 call
 a
 viral
 company.
 You're


going
 to
 just
 look
 stupid
 in
 public.
 I


think
 if
 you
 build
 something
 product
 or


system
 and
 you
 have
 some
 sort
 of
 like


underlying
 reason
 that
 people
 can
 pick


up
 on,
 even
 if
 it's
 like
 5%
 10%,
 that's


what
 creates
 the
 virality
 because
 it's


like,
 okay,
 why
 do
 they
 actually
 do


this?
 Was
 this
 for
 a
 reason?
 And
 like
 it


creates
 this
 like
 cool
 spiral
 of
 thought


and
 that's
 what
 leads
 people
 to
 share


that
 because
 there's
 sort
 of
 uncertainty


people
 like
 to
 see
 like
 that's
 what
 gets


them
 excited
 even
 if
 it
 is
 controversial


or
 crazy
 I
 don't
 think
 it
 matters
 take


what
 they
 have
 amplify
 the
 depth
 of
 what


they're
 doing
 and
 how
 it's
 unique
 and


then
 use
 that
 as
 a
 base
 on
 the


controversial
 then
 you
 get
 eyes
 on
 you


and
 like
 it
 all
 supports
 back
 a
 reason


that
 you
 intentionally
 have


grew
 up
 as
 a
 single
 mom
 in
 Irvine,


California.
 I
 would
 say
 very
 much
 grew


up
 with
 like
 a
 inclination
 towards


obviously
 like
 doing
 things
 on
 the


technological
 side.
 So
 like
 this
 was


building
 like
 a
 walking
 stick
 called


smart
 step.
 I
 called
 it
 in
 eighth
 grade.


They
 use
 ultrasonic
 sensors
 and
 our
 dun


microprocessors
 in
 order
 to
 essentially


scan
 objects
 in
 front
 of
 it.
 But
 of


course,
 you
 know,
 I
 was
 playing
 varsity


basketball,
 right?
 So
 like
 I
 love
 the


kind
 of
 duality.
 I
 think
 that
 was
 my


biggest
 thing
 around
 growing
 up
 is
 like


can
 I
 really
 do
 things
 that
 maybe
 are


expected
 of
 me
 around
 like
 you
 know


being
 able
 to
 hoop
 being
 able
 to
 dunk


all
 those
 fun
 things
 but
 like
 also
 at


the
 same
 time
 balancing
 that
 with
 the


duality
 of
 like
 being
 the
 most
 crack
 in


the
 room.
 I
 think
 after
 especially


becoming
 a
 valtor
 in
 my
 high
 school
 like


that
 was
 where
 I
 realized
 that
 yeah
 I


think
 I
 can
 change
 the
 norm.
 I
 think


that
 although
 Yale
 University
 does
 have


a
 few
 famous
 entrepreneurs,
 there
 wasn't


much.
 That
 was
 like
 one
 of
 the
 bigger


problems.
 And
 I
 think
 that's
 because


there's
 a
 big
 encouragement
 to
 rather


wait
 until
 you
 finish
 school
 to
 start


building
 a
 company
 or
 there
 is
 this


notion
 that
 you
 immediately
 have
 to
 drop


out
 to
 do
 so.
 It's
 very
 rare
 to
 be
 able


to
 kind
 of
 pair
 both
 together.
 Now
 that


series
 has
 been
 able
 to
 raise
 the


largest
 round
 in
 the
 current
 IV
 League


of
 students,
 we're
 trying
 to
 stand
 for


the
 point
 that
 you
 can
 build
 a


successful
 venture,
 right?
 or
 maybe


while
 staying
 in
 class
 or
 at least
 while


keeping
 things
 that
 are
 closer
 to
 you


and
 that's
 because
 you
 can
 use
 them
 as


an
 advantage
 instead
 of
 a
 disadvantage.


A
 lot
 of
 people
 see
 school
 as
 something


that
 takes
 time
 away,
 which
 maybe
 it


does
 for
 late
 homework
 assignments
 or


tests,
 but
 the
 benefit
 is
 you're
 able
 to


connect
 with
 your
 community,
 especially


if
 that's
 your
 marketing,
 too.
 And
 we


recently
 did
 a
 marketing
 initiative
 that


I
 think
 being
 a
 student
 has
 a
 tremendous


impact
 on
 in
 a
 positive
 direction


because
 we
 know
 the
 value
 of
 staying
 in


school
 and
 being
 able
 to
 communicate


with
 these
 people
 while
 being
 in
 class


with
 them.


>> As
 a
 founder,
 you
 already
 know
 ideas
 are


the
 easy
 part.
 It's
 the
 execution,


actually
 building
 the
 product
 that
 slows


everything
 down.
 That's
 where
 Lovable


comes
 in.
 It's
 not
 just
 an
 AI
 tool.
 It's


your
 ondemand
 engineering
 team.
 Simply


describe
 your
 idea.
 Lovable
 then
 builds


a
 full
 front-end,
 backend,
 and
 database.


So,
 you
 can
 launch
 real
 productionready


software
 without
 writing
 code.
 It's


already
 powering
 over
 a
 100,000
 new


products
 a
 day,
 helping
 2.5
 million


builders
 turn
 ideas
 into
 software
 just


by
 describing
 what
 they
 want.
 No
 devs,


no
 delays,
 no
 excuses.


They're
 launching
 in
 weeks,
 not
 months.


And
 guess
 what?
 These
 teams
 are
 still


tiny.
 In
 fact,
 team
 EO
 is
 also
 using


Lovable
 to
 build
 their
 upcoming
 EOS


school
 platform,
 and
 we're
 loving
 it.
 If


you're
 a
 non-technical
 founder

We've
 had
 talks
 with
 VCs
 of
 course


before
 the
 raise
 of
 like
 what
 do
 you


think
 about
 this
 idea?
 What
 do
 you
 think


about
 this
 MVP
 we
 made?
 But
 often
 times


people
 were
 very
 skeptical
 actually


pointing
 out
 to
 say
 like
 this
 wouldn't


work.
 This
 is
 an
 industry
 that
 will
 be


able
 to
 proliferate
 long
 term
 because
 we


weren't
 building
 something
 that
 people


have
 seen
 before.
 This
 wasn't
 like
 uh


anything
 on
 the
 B2B
 side
 which
 was
 like


very
 hot
 I
 think
 around
 like
 January


which
 is
 when
 like
 we
 were
 thinking


about
 actually
 seriously
 pitching.
 We


actually
 had,
 I
 think,
 a
 meeting
 with
 a


former
 Andrew
 Horward's
 partner,
 decided


to
 take
 the
 trip
 to
 SF
 just
 to
 pitch
 it


for
 the
 second
 time,
 which
 ended
 up
 into


a
 million-dollar
 dinner.
 One
 of
 the


biggest,
 most
 important
 things
 is
 really


just
 like
 focusing
 on
 how
 you
 tell
 the


story.
 Here's
 what's
 happened
 in
 the


market.
 Here's
 why
 it's
 changing.
 Here's


what
 I'm
 going
 to
 be
 on
 top
 of
 that


change.
 Or
 even
 better,
 here's
 how
 I'm


creating
 a
 new
 market
 on
 top
 of
 that.


That
 was
 a
 story
 that
 we
 pitched
 that
 we


are
 creating
 a
 new
 market.
 We'll
 be
 the


first
 industry
 standard
 of
 that
 market.


We
 knew
 there
 was
 a
 shift
 in
 consumer


AI.
 there
 was
 a
 shift
 in
 like
 this


called
 a
 technology
 window
 that
 people


are
 more
 enticed
 to
 invest
 or
 more


important
 than
 that
 I
 guess
 give
 AI
 a


chance
 in
 the
 social
 space.
 This
 has
 not


been
 done
 before
 to
 black
 guys
 who
 go
 to


an
 Ivy
 League
 to
 raise
 this
 amount
 of


capital.
 After
 that
 we've
 seen
 so
 many


other
 companies
 raise
 money
 very
 fast


because
 okay
 if
 those
 guys
 can
 do
 it
 I


definitely
 can
 do
 it
 which
 is
 another


norm
 to
 break.
 So
 it's
 like
 whenever
 you


do
 something
 first,
 it's
 like
 equally


fun
 and
 exciting
 as
 fearful
 because
 you


don't
 know
 how
 the
 world's
 going
 to
 take


it,
 but
 shouldn't
 stop
 you
 from
 doing


it.


Speed
 has
 been
 our
 biggest
 asset.
 A
 lot


of
 people
 are
 scared
 to
 move
 at
 fast


speeds
 because
 things
 break.
 We're
 not


scared
 of
 that.
 It's
 not
 about
 a
 certain


battle,
 right?
 It's
 about
 like,
 you


know,
 the
 war,
 right?
 It's
 about
 you


being
 able
 to
 like
 all
 time
 have
 sort
 of


a
 capture
 or
 share
 around
 your
 own


industry
 and
 your
 own
 niche.
 The
 faster


you
 do
 that,
 you
 got
 to
 do
 that
 at
 all


cost.
 But
 building
 something
 that
 has


like
 depth,
 right?
 And
 that
 can
 be
 depth


through
 how
 you
 have
 innovative
 some


sort
 of
 like
 unique
 technology
 that
 can


be
 depth
 of
 how
 you're
 approaching
 like


your
 consumerism.
 Once
 you
 can
 like


amplify
 that
 depth
 and
 showcase
 that
 to


the
 world
 through
 your
 marketing,
 that's


what
 makes
 something
 stick
 because


that's
 something
 that
 people
 remember
 as


a
 new
 iteration
 of
 whatever
 industry


they're
 in.
 The
 perfect
 example
 is
 of


course
 I
 love
 the
 knowledge
 of
 like
 the


horses
 to
 cars.
 People
 always
 say
 they


want
 a
 faster
 horse.
 Maybe
 some
 people


heard
 that
 quote
 before.
 It's
 because


like
 they're
 very
 used
 to
 like
 a
 10x
 of


what
 they
 have
 instead
 of
 going
 in
 the


next
 iteration
 of
 what's
 actually


needed.
 I
 think that's
 like
 something


that
 at least
 we
 pride
 ourselves
 in
 is


like
 we're
 not
 thinking
 of
 like
 a
 better


LinkedIn
 or
 a
 better
 social
 platform.


We're
 thinking
 of
 what's
 the
 next


iteration
 of
 what
 can
 actually
 be
 a


useful
 product
 for
 people
 to
 utilize
 to


build
 better
 relationships
 and


connections.
 Putting
 yourself
 in
 a


position
 where
 you
 look
 up
 to
 say
 I
 want


to
 be
 like
 that
 one
 day.
 It's
 not
 a
 bad


thing
 to
 do.
 that's
 like
 having
 some


sort
 of
 like
 idol
 or
 roadblock.
 But
 I


like
 to
 have
 a
 variety
 of
 like
 saying


I've
 seen
 these
 different
 trends
 from


companies
 that
 doing
 like
 SpaceX
 to


Facebook
 to
 like
 all
 these
 different


social
 platforms.
 How
 can
 I
 take
 all


that
 knowledge
 and
 go
 in
 a
 new


direction?
 Because
 that's
 how
 you
 really


build
 innovation.
 I
 think
 all
 the


stories
 of
 all
 the
 social
 platforms


inspire
 me
 in
 some
 way.
 But
 to
 take
 all


that
 together
 leads
 me
 to
 say
 I
 want
 the


story
 to
 inspire
 myself
 in
 the
 next
 10


years
 versus
 saying
 I
 see
 one
 company


that
 I
 want
 to
 straight
 shoot
 for
 and


become
 that
 in
 the
 next
 10
 years.
