 with


managing
 almost
 $2
 trillion
 dollar
 of


nor
 West

 history


and

 nicolai's
 background
 is


unique
 he
 has
 been
 a
 chef


Russian


translator
 and
 even
 worked
 in


intelligence
 but
 his
 expertise
 in


economics
 hored
 at
 Borton
 lay
 the


groundwork
 for
 his
 success
 as
 a
 hedge


fund
 manager
 for
 the
 past
 four
 years
 he


has
 been
 at
 the
 helm
 of
 Norway
 Sovereign


wealth
 fund
 guing
 guiding
 it
 with


integrity
 and


skill
 joining
 him
 is
 Dr
 Adam
 poen


president
 of
 the
 pet
 Institute
 for


international


economics
 the
 Atlantic
 once
 suggested


Adam
 belongs
 in
 an
 Allstar
 $10
 billion


lineup
 if
 there
 were
 a
 Central
 Banking


fantasy
 league
 he's
 one
 of
 the
 most


respected
 voices
 in
 international
 e


economics
 today
 so
 we
 are
 grateful
 to


Adam
 and
 the
 Peterson
 Institute
 for


partnering
 us
 on
 this
 event
 and
 I
 look


forward
 to
 hearing
 nikolai's
 opening


remarks


please
 thank
 you
 uh
 Ambassador
 and


ladies
 and


gentlemen
 to
 understand
 um
 the
 Norwegian


subn
 wealth
 fund
 we
 need
 to
 uh
 go
 back


in
 time
 and
 um
 we
 need
 to
 go
 back
 in


time
 to


1969
 and
 uh
 roughly
 the
 same
 time
 of
 the


year
 as
 we
 are
 now
 but
 not
 in
 uh
 Sunny


warm
 Washington
 we
 are
 out
 on
 the


Norwegian
 shelf
 it's
 cold
 and
 we
 are
 on


board
 ocean


Viking
 and
 this
 is
 Phillips
 Drilling
 and


they
 have
 been
 drilling
 for
 quite
 some


time
 they
 haven't
 found
 a
 single
 drop
 of


oil
 and
 they're
 now
 drilling
 the
 last


well
 and
 if
 they
 don't
 find
 any
 oil
 they


have
 to
 pack
 up
 the
 toys
 and
 go
 home


and
 then
 two
 in
 the
 morning
 um
 the
 um


this
 guy
 called
 salvon
 is
 asked
 to
 wake


up
 the
 platform
 Chief
 at


Seaborn
 and
 at
 Seaborn
 is
 like
 salvon


it's
 two
 in
 the
 morning
 you
 better
 have


a
 good
 reason
 for
 waking
 me


up
 and
 did
 he
 have
 a
 good
 reason
 they


had
 just
 struck
 oil
 they
 found
 the
 echo


FIS
 field
 and
 it
 was
 a
 largest
 field
 the


world
 had
 ever


seen
 then


this
 was
 presented
 to
 the
 Norwegian


people
 the
 day
 before
 Christmas
 Eve


69


and
 the
 question
 was
 was
 this
 a


Christmas
 gift
 or
 not
 because
 we
 had


seen
 in
 many
 countries
 that
 finding
 oil


and
 these
 incredible
 resources
 had
 just


been
 a
 curse
 you
 know
 it
 had
 led
 to


crowded
 out
 of
 Industries
 led
 to
 huge


amount
 of
 corruption
 it
 had
 just
 not


been
 very


good
 and
 so
 then
 the
 Norwegian


politicians
 decided
 on
 something
 really


clever
 let's
 put
 it
 into
 a
 fund
 and
 this


is
 the


first
 deposit
 into
 the
 fund
 in
 96
 two


billion
 Norwegian
 coroner
 you
 know
 a


small
 deposit
 and
 nobody
 thought
 the


fund
 was
 going
 to
 be
 particularly


big
 and
 the
 idea
 of
 course
 with
 the
 fund


was
 to
 take
 the
 the
 uh
 the
 the
 the


wealth
 from
 the
 shelf
 and
 put
 it
 into


Financial
 assets
 and
 that's
 what
 be


done
 so
 now
 it's
 gone
 from
 two
 billion


Norwegian
 Groner
 to
 more
 than
 18,000


billion
 as
 you
 can
 see
 the
 dark
 blue
 is


the
 money
 that
 uh
 we
 put
 into
 the
 fund


and
 the
 light
 blue
 is
 the
 returns
 that


we
 have
 made
 in
 financial


markets
 and
 then
 we
 have
 some
 currency


effects
 at
 the
 top
 but
 you
 see
 that
 the


returns
 that
 we
 made
 in
 the
 financial


markets
 are
 now
 twice
 as
 large
 as
 the


money
 we
 put
 in
 so
 in
 a
 way
 we
 found
 oil


twice
 once
 on
 the
 continental
 shelf
 and


then
 again
 in
 financial


markets
 the
 governance
 structure
 of
 the


fund
 is
 very


important
 so
 the
 money
 is
 owned
 by
 the


Norwegian
 people
 of
 course
 uh
 taken
 care


of
 by
 the
 the
 parliament


the
 parliament
 have
 uh
 given
 the
 mandate


to
 the
 Ministry
 of
 Finance
 so
 it's
 the


Ministry
 of
 Finance
 which
 is
 our
 client


and
 we
 have
 a
 representative
 here
 from


the
 ministry
 today
 Espen
 who
 is
 uh
 you


know
 in
 a
 way
 my


boss
 um
 and
 then
 they
 have
 given
 the


Mandate
 again
 to
 norus
 bank
 to
 the


central
 bank
 and
 they
 again
 have
 hired


us
 the
 Norwegian
 uh
 norus
 Bank


investment
 management
 to
 run
 the


fund
 there
 are
 um
 some
 very
 important


reasons
 why
 this
 why
 this
 has
 worked
 out


really


well
 um
 I
 would
 say
 one
 of
 the
 things
 is


a
 very
 strict
 and
 good
 mandate
 that
 we


have
 from
 the
 ministry
 it's
 quite


detailed
 about
 how
 we
 should
 invest
 and


I'm
 coming
 back
 to
 that
 uh
 but
 it
 is


important
 to
 have
 a
 strict


mandate
 and
 that
 has
 worked
 really


really
 well
 it's
 useful
 to
 be
 situated


inside
 the
 central
 bank
 and
 I
 think
 it


will
 be
 increasingly
 important


potentially
 going


forward
 um
 and
 then
 we
 have
 uh
 then
 is


of
 course
 it's
 important
 that
 we
 work


with
 the
 board
 the
 board
 works
 with
 the


ministry
 that
 we
 have
 contact
 at
 all


levels
 but
 of
 course
 that
 we
 also
 at
 the


same
 time
 understand
 what
 the
 roles
 are


and
 who
 is
 accountable
 for
 what
 so
 I


think
 this
 has
 been
 um
 a
 really
 really


good


model
 another
 reason
 why
 it
 has
 worked


so
 well
 is
 because
 of
 wide
 political


anchoring
 and
 here
 this
 is
 from
 a


seminar
 we
 had
 this
 summer
 three
 um


ministers
 they
 had
 been
 Ministers
 of


Finance
 uh
 all
 three
 of
 them
 or


treasurers
 and
 um
 they
 span
 a
 very
 broad


political
 span
 we
 here
 have
 from
 uh
 from


kind
 of
 uh
 the
 Socialist
 left
 party
 to


uh
 the
 rtist
 party
 to
 The
 Agrarian
 party


and
 um
 they
 have
 all
 agreed
 on
 the
 main


uh
 uh
 kind
 of
 characteristics
 of
 the


fund
 they
 have
 agreed
 on
 the
 risk


profile
 and
 every
 year
 we
 have
 a
 white


paper
 that
 goes
 to
 the
 uh
 to
 the


parliament
 so
 that
 all
 changes
 in
 the


Mandate
 is
 agreed
 on
 by
 all
 political


parties
 I
 think
 it's
 totally
 key
 so
 that


when
 you
 change
 Parliament
 or
 government


there
 is
 no
 change
 in
 the
 main


ramifications
 for
 the


fund
 we


invest
 a
 across
 the
 world
 and
 I
 think
 a


fund
 of
 this
 size
 needs
 to
 be
 really


widely
 Diversified
 we
 have
 uh
 now
 half


the
 money
 in
 uh
 America
 actually
 a
 bit


more
 a
 third
 in
 Europe
 and
 then
 the
 rest


is
 spread
 across
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 world


we
 started
 off
 by
 a
 larger
 proportion
 in


Europe
 that
 was
 kind
 of
 closer
 to
 home


and
 it
 was
 a
 bit
 less
 risky
 then
 uh


gradually
 we
 have
 moved
 more
 assets


across
 uh
 to
 the
 US
 that's
 also
 of


course
 because
 the
 US
 market
 has


developed
 particularly
 strongly
 now


lately
 driven
 by
 uh
 you
 know
 all
 your


wonderful
 technology


companies
 and
 in
 terms
 of
 the
 asset


split
 we
 have
 now
 70%
 equities
 and
 the


rest
 is
 uh
 spread
 mainly
 fixed
 income


but
 also
 uh
 real
 estate
 we
 own
 some


amazing
 properties
 here
 in
 DC
 we
 have


main
 Holdings
 in
 New
 York
 Boston
 uh
 in


London
 Berlin
 Paris
 and
 so
 on
 um
 and
 the


uh
 it
 it
 started
 off
 by
 being
 purely
 in


bonds
 then
 during
 the
 financial
 crisis


the
 equity
 ratings
 went
 from
 40%
 to
 60%


and
 has
 subsequently
 moved
 to
 uh
 to


70%
 and
 then
 three
 four
 years
 ago
 we


also
 got
 the
 unlisted
 renewable


infrastructure
 mandate
 which
 in
 the


beginning
 we
 were
 pretty
 slow
 to
 deploy


because
 we
 thought
 uh
 that
 valuations


were
 very
 high
 now
 we
 think
 it's
 much


more
 attractive
 like
 there
 is
 less


demand
 for
 uh
 renewable
 infrastructure


projects
 we
 think
 returns
 are
 better
 and


so
 now
 we
 are
 have
 accelerated
 the
 the


deployment
 of
 a
 money
 into
 that
 asset


class
 so
 we
 are
 one
 of
 the
 largest


single
 shareholders
 in
 the
 world
 we
 own


one
 and
 a
 half%
 of
 all
 the
 listed


equities
 and
 you
 know
 I
 kind
 of
 think


every
 time
 you
 buy
 a
 Starbucks
 or
 new


sneakers
 or
 uh
 you
 know
 new
 car
 or


whatever
 I
 feel
 pretty
 happy
 about
 it


because
 we
 get
 1
 and
 a
 half%


back


um
 in
 Europe
 we
 own
 uh
 just
 under
 3%
 of


uh
 of
 all
 the


equities
 now
 how
 do
 we
 think
 as
 an
 owner


owner
 well
 we
 have
 um
 very
 clear


expectations
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 companies


and
 I
 think
 when
 you
 engage
 with
 the


companies
 what
 is
 important
 important
 is


that
 you


are
 predictable
 I
 think
 predictable
 is


the
 most
 important
 thing
 um
 we
 um
 have


clear
 expectations
 we
 have
 expectation


documents
 on
 the
 most
 important


parameters
 we
 have
 expectation
 documents


when
 it
 comes
 to
 how
 companies
 should
 uh


treat
 corruption
 how
 they
 should
 think


about
 uh
 labor
 how
 they
 should
 think


about
 uh
 human
 rights
 issues
 and
 so
 on


and
 so
 we
 have
 10
 expectation
 documents


which
 lay
 out
 in
 in
 great
 detail
 how
 we


think
 they
 should
 uh


behave
 we
 also
 um
 engage
 with


companies
 um
 and
 we
 have
 more
 than
 3,000


company
 meetings
 a
 year
 we
 have


portfolio
 managers
 who
 are
 Specialists


on
 this
 companies
 they
 meet
 with
 them
 on


a
 regular
 basis
 and
 have
 conversations


about
 all
 kinds
 of
 things
 from
 labor


rights
 um
 to
 uh
 disclosure
 levels
 um


climate
 plans
 and
 so
 on
 and
 then
 lastly


voting
 what
 voting
 is
 in
 a
 way
 one
 of


the
 most
 important
 ways
 we
 can
 influence


companies
 and
 so
 we
 attend
 um
 nearly


10,000
 agms
 every
 year
 agms
 is
 a
 bit


like
 this
 uh
 meeting
 where
 all
 the


shareholders
 come
 together
 and
 we
 vote


on
 more
 than
 100,000
 100,000
 proposals


every
 year
 now
 we
 of
 course
 have
 the


votes
 that
 we
 own
 ourselves
 one
 and
 a


half%
 but
 what
 is
 interesting
 is
 that
 we


have
 so
 many
 other
 shareholders
 across


the
 world
 who
 look
 at
 how
 we


vote
 and
 now
 we
 disclose
 our
 voting


intentions
 5
 days
 ahead
 of
 time
 so
 we


have
 an
 additional
 three
 percentage


points
 of
 votes
 which
 follow
 us
 so
 close


to
 5%
 of
 against
 votes
 in
 the
 world


would
 be
 influenced
 by
 uh
 our
 decisions


so
 it's
 a
 huge
 responsibility
 and
 it


means
 that
 we
 uh
 take
 well
 care
 on
 how


we
 vote
 that
 it
 is
 consistent
 that
 it's


well


communicated
 uh
 to
 the
 companies


lastly
 um


transparency
 very
 very


important
 we
 are
 the
 most
 transparent


Fund
 in
 the
 world
 and
 that's
 not
 just
 a


claim
 because
 actually
 there
 is
 a
 world


championship
 in


transparency


uh
 now
 for
 several
 years
 we
 were
 lagging


uh
 the
 Canadians
 we
 thought
 we
 think


it's
 kind
 of
 okay
 to
 be
 beaten
 by
 the


Canadians
 in
 ice
 hockey
 but
 not
 in


transparency
 so
 last
 year
 we
 cranked
 up


the
 efforts
 uh
 we
 won
 for
 the
 first
 time


and
 then
 last
 week
 uh
 we
 won
 again
 and


it's
 it's
 really
 really
 important


because
 what
 we
 see
 is
 that
 transparency


and
 knowledge
 creates


trust
 and
 so
 we
 are
 transparency
 with


the
 Norwegian
 people
 we
 are
 the
 only


fund
 which
 closes
 all
 of
 our
 Holdings


twice
 a
 year
 and
 pretty
 much
 everything


we
 do
 is
 out
 there
 so
 to
 conclude
 in
 my


mind
 this
 is
 sex
 Factor
 for
 the
 fund
 has


been
 you
 know
 a
 clear
 and
 good
 mandate


from
 the


ministry
 it's
 been
 broad
 political


anchoring
 it's
 been
 a
 spending
 rule


which
 decides
 how
 much
 we
 can
 take
 out


of
 the
 fund
 every
 year
 and
 that's


Limited
 at
 uh
 3%
 and
 then
 lastly
 it
 is


the


transparency
 thank
 you
 and
 then
 Adam
 we


going
 to
 have
 a
 chat
 here
 thank
 you


[Applause]


well
 I
 think
 you're
 supposed
 to
 sit
 over


here
 okay
 sorry
 I
 just
 couldn't
 make
 it


in
 one
 stride
 I'm
 not
 as


you
 okay
 thank
 you
 Nikolai
 um
 thank
 you


all
 for
 coming
 out
 when
 the
 embassy


approached
 uh
 the
 Peterson
 Institute
 to


host
 Nikolai
 we
 were
 all
 like
 oh
 my
 God


yeah
 sure
 great
 um
 and
 then
 then
 the


embassy
 was
 like
 and
 we'll
 pay
 for
 the


food
 I
 was
 like
 oh
 yeah
 sure
 great
 um


but
 then
 they
 said
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 on


Monday
 November
 11th
 and
 I
 was
 like


you're
 bloody
 kidding
 me
 right
 um
 but


obviously
 the
 fund
 their


CEO
 uh
 the
 prospects
 for
 long-term


thinking
 uh
 this
 is
 all
 very
 attractive


to
 people
 and
 so
 that's
 why
 we
 have
 such


a
 distinguished
 crowd
 and
 such
 a
 full


crowd
 tonight
 so
 thank
 you
 all
 for


coming
 out
 I'm
 going
 to
 ask
 ncai
 a
 few


questions
 and
 uh
 have
 a
 bit
 of
 a


discussion
 and
 then
 we'll
 open
 it
 up
 to


the
 audience
 uh
 I
 see
 a
 lot
 of
 familiar


faces
 and
 I
 fail
 to
 recognize
 some


others
 that
 I
 should
 probably
 recognize


and
 we'll
 try
 to
 pretend
 otherwise


Nikolai
 why
 don't
 we
 dive
 right
 into
 it


um
 you
 and
 I
 were
 talking
 briefly
 before


your
 remarks
 and
 you
 were
 saying
 how


this
 is
 a
 really
 interesting
 time
 to
 be


an


investor
 um
 there's
 geopolitics
 there's


technological
 change
 there's
 climate


change
 how
 does
 is
 come
 together
 for
 you


I
 mean


if
 in
 a
 sense
 you
 could
 just
 index
 and


just
 buy
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 everything
 but


that's
 not
 what
 you
 do
 so
 how
 do
 you
 how


does
 this
 Confluence
 of
 forces
 affect


your
 thinking
 yeah
 I
 think


um
 um
 climate
 geopolitics
 technology
 and


finance
 are
 intertwined
 in
 a
 way
 that
 we


have
 never
 seen
 before
 and
 it
 started
 to


happen
 probably
 four
 five
 years
 ago


where
 for
 the
 first
 time
 we
 saw
 if
 we


just
 take
 the
 various
 links
 here


um
 first
 of
 all
 the
 link
 between
 uh


climate
 and
 finance
 is
 becoming


increasingly
 clear
 and
 it's
 mainly


because
 of
 harvests
 which
 are
 getting


worse
 and
 worse
 and
 so
 you
 are
 seeing


increasing
 prices
 for
 everything
 from


you
 know
 cocoa
 beans
 uh
 chocolate
 olive


oil
 orange
 juice
 all
 these
 kind
 of


things
 is
 really
 underpinning
 inflation


which
 of
 course
 is
 one
 of
 the
 biggest


threats
 to
 you
 know
 stock
 markets
 so


that's
 a
 new
 that's
 a
 new
 one
 and
 I


think
 the
 link
 is
 just
 becoming
 stronger


and
 stronger


then
 we
 see
 technology
 and
 finance
 we


see
 it
 of
 course
 because
 what
 is
 driving


the
 markets
 these
 days
 is
 mainly
 the


technology
 companies
 and
 they
 are
 just


getting
 bigger
 and
 bigger
 and
 so
 we
 are


seeing
 a
 concentration
 in
 the
 stock


market
 which
 is
 bigger
 than
 we've
 ever


seen
 before
 and
 it's
 driven
 by
 many


things
 I
 mean
 one
 is
 that
 in
 society


generally
 we
 have
 a
 Winner
 Takes
 It
 All


situation
 you
 know
 that
 are
 more
 people


now
 listening
 to
 Taylor
 Swift
 than


everybody
 listening
 to
 Jazz
 and


classical
 music
 combined
 right


so
 you
 see
 it
 in
 sport
 and
 you
 see
 it
 in


finance
 you
 see
 it
 in
 technology


companies
 more
 than
 in
 other
 companies


because
 just
 the
 fact
 that
 you
 are
 big


makes
 you
 even
 bigger
 the
 reason
 why
 you


order
 an
 Uber
 is
 because
 there
 are
 so


many
 of
 them
 they
 come
 straight
 away
 the


reason
 why
 you
 on
 Facebook
 is
 because


there's
 so
 many
 people
 on
 and
 then
 in
 AI


you
 kind
 of
 turbocharge
 that
 again


because
 these
 models
 are
 so
 expensive
 to


develop
 that
 you
 need
 to
 be
 very
 big
 to


really
 make
 something
 out
 of
 it
 so


that's
 kind
 of
 the
 technology
 impact
 on


the
 stock
 market
 now
 then
 you
 have


technology
 impacting
 geopolitics
 you


know
 the
 relationship
 between
 China
 and


the
 US
 very
 much
 uh
 impacted
 by


technology
 export
 controls
 uh
 these
 kind


of
 things
 and
 um
 impacting
 now
 um


research
 in
 so
 many
 new
 areas
 two
 of
 the


Nobel
 prizes
 over
 the
 last
 few
 weeks


have
 been
 driven
 by
 AI
 both
 uh
 physics


and
 chemistry
 so
 uh
 it's
 really
 just


changing
 the
 Landscapes
 and
 then
 of


course
 you
 have
 the
 the
 geopolitical


situation
 which
 is
 new
 so
 all
 this
 is


coming
 together
 in
 in
 a
 totally
 new
 way


right
 which
 means
 that
 when
 I
 wake
 up
 in


the
 morning
 I'm
 just
 like
 spinning
 out


of
 bed
 because
 you
 don't
 want
 to
 spend


time
 in
 bed
 when
 you
 can
 read
 the
 papers


and
 look
 into
 what's
 going
 on
 because


it's
 just
 so


exciting
 I
 don't
 know
 about
 you
 but
 I'm


I'm
 I'm
 I'm
 thinking
 about
 that
 look


like
 SK
 yeah
 no
 exactly
 well
 it's
 partly


I
 don't
 have
 $2
 trillion
 dollar
 to


manage
 but
 it's
 also
 there's
 that
 emoji


you
 know
 with
 the
 clinch
 teeth
 um
 but


let
 let
 let's
 try
 to
 transl
 that


excitement


so
 if
 the
 trends
 are
 clear
 in
 a
 sense


that
 the
 incumbents
 the
 large
 players


the
 the
 already
 technologically
 advanced


the
 already
 networked
 are
 going
 to
 get


bigger
 and


bigger
 why
 are
 you
 reading
 the
 papers
 I


mean
 is
 there
 any
 possibility
 of


deconcentration
 um
 is
 there
 disruption


the
 US
 can
 do
 to
 China
 or
 vice
 versa


that
 would
 change
 the
 game
 um
 I
 mean


there
 there
 seems
 to
 be
 a
 bit
 of
 a


tension
 between
 the
 way
 you
 describe
 the


trends
 and
 your
 excitement
 to
 get
 up
 and


do


something
 now
 what
 is
 what
 is
 of
 course


um
 in
 a
 way


uh
 interesting
 here
 as
 well
 is
 that
 the


largest
 companies
 are
 linked
 into
 the


same
 geopolitical
 risks
 right
 um
 now
 you


look
 at
 the
 for
 instance
 the
 biggest


gainers
 we
 had
 in
 the
 portfolio
 in
 the


first
 half
 of
 this
 year
 so
 you
 have
 asml


in
 Holland
 they
 make
 the
 machines
 to


produce
 microchips
 they
 sell
 them
 to
 uh


to
 you
 know
 one
 Taiwanese
 company
 uh
 the


chips
 are
 uh
 the
 most
 advanced
 chips
 are


designed
 by
 Nvidia
 of
 course
 and
 I
 sell


them
 to
 the
 super
 uh
 you
 know
 scalers
 So


Meta
 um
 you
 know
 Amazon
 and
 so
 on
 and
 so


um
 it's
 very
 concentrated
 in
 terms
 of


the
 risks
 we
 are
 seeing
 you
 know
 it's


um
 geographically
 quite
 concentrated
 and


if
 something
 happened
 it
 impact
 most
 of


the
 uh
 Supply
 chains
 for
 most
 of
 the


kind
 of
 things
 that
 we


consume
 so
 it's
 um
 at
 a
 time
 where
 we


have
 in
 a
 way
 more
 concentration
 than


ever
 before
 it's
 linked
 to
 one


geopolitical
 situation
 in
 a
 way
 that
 we


also
 haven't
 seen
 before
 so
 that's


that's
 uh
 exciting
 how
 can
 a
 fund
 like


yours
 in
 a
 sense
 hedge
 or
 take
 advantage


of
 these
 geopolitical
 risks
 I
 mean
 or
 is


it
 like
 the
 weather
 you
 know
 where


climate
 is
 and
 you
 just
 have
 to
 reset


your
 expectations
 no
 you
 want
 to
 there


um
 the
 important
 things
 here
 is
 one
 that


you
 have
 uh
 that
 you
 are
 broadly


Diversified
 across
 the
 world
 across


asset
 classes
 uh
 very
 important
 the


second
 thing
 is
 you
 need
 to
 have
 a


long-term
 time
 Horizons
 so
 that
 if
 you


do
 have


um
 volatility
 in
 the
 market
 you
 can
 take


advantage
 of
 it
 so
 I
 think
 the
 uh
 I


think
 those
 are
 the
 the
 most
 important


things
 um


Norway
 another
 part
 of
 the
 Norwegian


government
 as
 it
 were
 um
 as
 the


Ambassador
 represents
 here
 um
 has
 been


pursuing
 a
 pretty
 strong
 foreign
 and


security
 policy
 woring
 about
 Russia


leadership
 in
 NATO
 alliance
 with
 the
 US


it's
 part
 of
 that


um
 what
 what
 happens
 down
 the
 road
 what


happens
 if
 there


are
 great
 opportunities
 in
 China
 or


Russia
 and
 the
 foreign
 policy
 of
 Norway


is
 let's
 say
 concerned
 about
 the


behavior
 of
 Russia
 or
 China
 how
 do
 you


how
 do
 you
 is
 there
 a
 statute
 on
 how
 you


have
 to
 deal
 with
 that
 or
 is
 this
 a


judgment
 thing
 how
 do
 you
 think
 about


that
 yeah
 so
 um
 one
 another
 important


thing
 is
 that
 um
 the
 fund
 is
 not
 a


political
 tool
 very
 very
 important
 we


have
 one
 goal
 and
 that
 is
 to
 make
 money


right
 in
 a
 responsible
 way
 and
 with
 a


set
 level
 of
 risk
 but
 it's
 very
 very


important
 that
 we
 are
 not
 used
 as
 a


political
 tool
 as
 long
 when
 you
 start
 to


get
 like
 several
 goals
 you
 are
 not


really
 accountable
 anymore
 and
 you
 can


always
 blame
 uh
 lack
 of
 results
 on


something
 else
 so
 I
 think
 that's
 uh
 I


think
 that's
 really
 key
 now
 when
 it


comes
 to
 to
 Russia
 um
 in
 a
 way
 that
 was


the
 first
 time
 that
 um
 that
 the


parliament
 uh
 made
 a
 political
 decision


about
 the
 fund
 we
 were
 told
 that
 we
 were


to
 sell
 out
 of
 Russia
 but
 I
 think
 that


was
 quite
 an
 extreme
 situation
 we
 don't


expect
 uh
 that
 to
 be
 repeated
 anytime


soon
 just
 more
 broadly
 maybe
 it's
 the


parliament
 in
 your
 case
 but
 there's
 also


consumer
 investor
 demands
 for
 more


concern
 about
 green
 issues
 about


investment
 in
 so-called
 dirty


Industries
 one
 of
 the
 issues
 one
 of
 the


many
 issues
 where
 uh
 the
 incoming
 Trump


Administration
 is
 likely


to
 differ
 from
 the
 past
 administration


is
 trying
 to
 diminish
 some
 of
 the


environmental
 regulations
 and
 standards


in
 the
 US


um
 how
 does
 how
 do
 pressures
 over
 green


affect
 you
 does
 that
 count
 as
 political


so
 you
 it's
 only
 if
 the
 parliament


overrides
 or
 do
 you
 mention
 the


importance
 of
 the
 climate


transition
 I
 mean
 how
 do
 you
 think
 about


this
 when
 there's
 demands
 for
 response


yeah
 I
 would
 say
 that
 we


um
 um
 we
 follow
 the
 instructions
 from


the
 parliament
 um
 the
 Norwegian


Parliament
 is
 uh
 unified
 in
 believing


that
 climate
 is
 important


and
 that
 we
 should
 uh
 in
 constructive


dialogue
 with
 the


companies
 um
 try
 to
 be
 supportive
 for


their
 um
 for
 their
 work
 uh
 towards
 an
 n


z
 world
 and
 so
 that's
 what
 we
 are


doing
 so
 we
 um
 have
 not
 changed
 our
 mind


or
 our
 way
 of
 working
 we
 continue
 to
 be


uh
 persistent
 and
 um
 and


predictable
 it
 was
 very
 striking
 in
 your


opening
 remarks
 at
 least
 to
 me
 um
 your


slide
 talking
 about
 active
 but
 not


activist
 and
 you're
 saying
 that
 you
 want


to
 be
 predictable
 and
 you
 just
 said
 it


again


where
 I
 mean
 since
 you
 are
 the
 most


transparent
 fund


congratulations
 where
 are
 some
 examples


of
 where
 that
 kind
 of
 interaction
 with


companies
 you
 have
 stake
 in
 have
 made
 a


difference
 I
 mean
 where
 have
 you
 been


active
 but
 not
 activist
 that
 you
 think


you've
 had
 a
 good
 influence
 I
 me
 good


however
 you
 define
 it
 but
 where
 you've


had
 an
 impact


yeah
 um
 oops
 well
 we
 do
 see
 um
 we
 do
 see


that
 where
 we
 engage
 and
 where
 we
 talk


to
 companies
 about
 uh
 the
 importance
 of


having
 a
 um
 you
 know
 a
 carbon
 production


plan
 we
 see
 that
 more
 companies
 have


plans
 um
 and
 so
 that's
 a
 development


that
 of
 course
 we
 are
 we
 are
 not
 the
 so


reason
 for
 that
 but
 we
 we
 can
 see
 a


relationship
 between
 engagement
 and


results
 we
 see
 it
 again
 we
 have
 been


advocating
 the
 fact
 that
 the
 chair
 and


the
 CEO
 should
 not
 be
 the
 same
 person
 we


think
 it's
 good
 governance
 and
 we
 are


used
 to
 that
 from
 Europe
 that
 it
 should


be
 to
 different
 people
 uh
 in
 the
 US
 over


the
 last
 10
 years
 it's
 gone
 from
 45%
 of


companies
 who
 have
 I
 mean
 which
 have


kind
 of
 the
 combined
 uh
 function
 in
 one


to
 35
 so
 45
 to
 35
 over
 10
 year
 period
 so


that's
 have
 had
 some
 impact
 where
 we


have
 had
 no
 progress
 whatsoever
 is
 on
 uh


pay
 packages
 mhm
 um
 now
 what
 we
 do
 we


are
 not
 uh
 we
 are
 not
 uh
 against
 High


salaries
 but
 they
 need
 to
 be
 uh
 they


need
 to
 be
 in
 line
 with
 our
 interest


they
 should
 be
 long-term
 they
 should
 be


tied
 to
 results
 they
 should
 be
 Equity


based
 and
 so
 on
 and
 so
 we
 got
 pretty


clear
 uh
 expectations
 for
 how
 that


should
 be
 structured
 but
 um
 but
 you
 know


pay
 packages
 are
 continuing
 to
 move
 up


yeah
 um
 another
 one
 of
 the
 slides
 you


put
 up
 you
 you
 had
 a
 pie
 chart
 about
 the


uh
 asset
 allocation
 across
 four
 classes


uh
 equities
 fixed
 income
 real
 estate
 and


unlisted
 energy
 I
 think
 it
 was
 um
 we


have
 seen
 in
 recent
 years
 another


Financial
 trend
 is
 more
 and
 more


companies
 going
 private
 at
 least
 in
 the


US
 but
 I
 think
 elsewhere
 as
 well
 um


fewer
 and
 fewer
 companies
 listing


publicly
 how
 does
 this
 affect
 the
 funds


thinking
 is
 this
 something
 that
 you're


going
 to
 react
 to
 by
 taking
 more
 private


investment
 placements
 is
 this
 something


you
 view
 as
 an
 opportunity
 because
 you


have
 thinner
 public
 markets
 and
 you
 can


get
 more
 of
 what
 you
 want
 I'm
 not
 trying


to
 feed
 words
 in
 your
 mouth
 I'm
 trying


to
 ask
 you
 know
 so
 just
 as
 one
 of
 the


world's
 leading
 investors
 how
 do
 you


think
 about
 this
 trend
 yeah
 well
 you're


right
 there
 are
 fewer
 companies
 being


listed
 on
 a
 socket
 ex
 change
 and
 amongst


the
 ones
 listed
 it's
 more
 concentrated


yeah
 so
 fewer
 companies
 account
 for
 more


and
 more
 of
 the
 index
 and
 so
 there
 is
 a


much
 higher
 risk
 in
 the
 stock
 market


from
 that
 point
 of
 view
 than
 what's
 been


the
 case
 before
 I
 would
 probably
 argue


that
 there
 is
 more
 risk
 in
 the
 listed


market
 now
 than
 in
 the


unlisted
 we
 are
 not
 uh
 it's
 not
 in
 our


mandate
 to
 be
 in
 uh
 private
 Equity
 it's


something
 that
 the
 fund
 has
 suggested


several
 times
 and
 there
 is
 now
 a


political
 process
 where
 um
 they
 will


investigate
 further
 whether
 we
 should
 be


allowed
 to
 do
 that
 there's
 been


questions
 about
 fee
 structures


the
 general
 opinion
 in
 Norway
 is
 that


the
 fees
 are
 very
 high
 and
 that


transparency
 has
 been
 low
 and
 that
 esfg


considerations
 have
 been
 low
 now
 I
 think


for
 sure
 transparency
 has
 been
 improving


and
 ESG
 considerations
 have
 been


improving
 and
 corporate
 governance
 have


been
 improving
 so
 we'll
 see
 what
 um


we'll
 see
 what
 they
 come
 up
 with
 I
 mean


it's
 a
 it's
 a
 good
 process
 um
 I
 actually


think
 personally
 it's
 probably
 a
 good


time


to
 scale
 into


uh
 you
 know
 private
 private
 Market


because
 um
 they
 they
 are
 they
 are
 having


a
 tough
 time
 I
 think
 you
 can
 get
 pretty


good
 uh
 fee
 deals
 and
 um
 and
 you
 can


also
 get
 get
 positions
 in
 the
 in
 the


secondary
 market
 so
 it
 feels
 a
 bit
 like


increasing
 the
 uh
 equity
 share
 during


the
 financial
 crisis
 that's
 the
 way
 it


feels
 to
 me
 potentially
 with
 private


Equity
 right
 but
 we'll
 see
 nothing
 is


decided
 very
 good
 um
 I'm
 going
 to
 come


to
 the
 audience
 for
 questions
 in
 the


next
 few
 minutes
 and
 um
 I
 believe
 we're


trying
 to
 record
 this
 so
 I
 don't
 know
 if


there's
 a
 traveling
 mic
 or
 yes
 it
 looks


like
 there's
 a
 tall
 person
 with
 a


traveling
 mic
 so
 that's
 good
 um
 but
 just


a
 couple
 more
 questions
 before
 that
 if
 I


could
 please
 um
 we
 have
 with
 us
 tonight


Ted
 Truman
 who
 was
 one
 of
 the
 leaders
 in


the
 effort
 to
 get
 Sovereign
 wealth
 funds


to
 have
 standards
 of


transparency


um
 obviously
 there
 are
 some
 very
 large


funds
 that
 do
 not
 not
 get
 a
 successful


rating
 and
 transparency
 as
 you
 or
 the


Canadians
 um
 not
 asking
 you
 to
 name


names
 um
 but
 in
 general
 I
 mean
 is
 is
 the


transparency
 something


that
 makes
 you
 more
 accountable
 is
 the


transparency
 something
 that
 makes
 you


more
 palatable
 in
 when
 you're
 investing


abroad
 is
 the
 transparency
 something


that
 humor
 the


parliament
 I
 mean
 you
 you
 don't
 you


don't
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 investors
 right
 you


have
 one


investor


so
 I
 is
 transparency
 an
 unalloyed
 good


for
 a
 fund
 yeah
 I
 mean
 on
 the
 one
 hand


we
 got
 one
 investor
 on
 the
 other
 on
 the


other
 hand
 we
 kind
 of
 got
 five
 million


investors
 right
 because
 um
 it's
 owned
 by


the


citizens
 uh
 I
 think
 it's
 key
 to
 trust
 I


think
 it's
 key
 to
 trust


um
 I
 just
 love
 transparency
 you
 know
 I


think
 it
 means
 that
 you
 you
 stick
 to


what
 you're
 supposed
 to
 do
 you
 are


accountable
 you
 get
 everybody
 to
 run
 in


the
 same
 direction
 everybody
 knows
 knows


what
 we
 are


about
 um
 so
 I
 I
 I
 see
 no
 the
 only
 the


only
 reason
 why
 why
 transparency
 could


be
 negative
 would
 be
 if
 people
 started


to
 trade
 against
 your
 positions
 and


that's
 why
 we
 think
 disclosing
 them


every
 every
 six
 months
 is
 is
 right
 but


more
 frequent
 than
 that
 would
 not
 be


would
 not
 be
 very
 sensible
 very
 clear
 so


my
 final
 question
 before
 I
 open
 it
 to


the
 audience
 is
 about
 the
 purposes
 and


the
 capacities
 to
 make
 a
 sovereign


wealth
 fund
 work
 for
 our
 country
 I
 mean


you
 spoke
 about
 you
 have
 the
 beautiful


repeat
 image
 of
 was
 it


1969
 discovering
 oil
 in
 the
 last
 well
 at


2
 am.
 um
 but
 so
 then
 there's
 a
 very


compelling
 story
 right
 that
 the
 oil
 is


going
 to
 run
 out
 sometime
 our
 country


needs
 to


accumulate
 people
 have
 started
 talking


about
 the
 US
 should
 have
 a
 Sovereign


wealth
 fund
 um
 which
 strikes
 me
 as
 kind


of
 odd
 because
 we
 don't
 have
 the


surpluses
 you


do
 um


but
 maybe
 I'm
 missing
 something
 so


without
 commenting
 directly
 on
 that
 I


mean
 when
 is
 a
 sovereign
 wealth
 fund
 a


good
 idea
 for
 a
 country
 could
 it
 be
 a


country
 that
 you
 know
 like
 Denmark


doesn't
 have
 oil
 but
 has
 uh
 anti-obesity


drugs
 and
 they
 should
 run
 a
 sovereign


wealth
 fund
 off
 that
 I
 mean
 what
 what


what
 what
 countries
 should
 be
 following


your
 example
 yeah
 I
 mean
 in
 way
 they


have
 a
 so
 wealth
 Fund
 in
 Denmark
 as
 well


but
 it's
 called
 the
 Nova
 Nordisk


Foundation
 right
 which
 funds
 uh
 research


and
 a
 lot
 of
 incredible


things
 um
 and
 in
 a
 way
 they
 kind
 of
 have


them
 in
 Sweden
 too
 through
 the


woolenberg
 sphere
 and
 some
 of
 their
 uh


foundations
 but
 um
 well
 where
 it
 works


the
 best
 is
 if
 you
 have
 some
 kind
 of


windfall
 profit
 uh
 that
 you
 want
 to
 save


uh
 and
 Save
 card
 for
 future
 Generations


right
 so
 that's
 kind
 of
 the
 starting


point
 and
 then
 I
 would
 say
 what's
 worked


for
 for
 us
 in
 Norway
 is
 um
 uh
 broad


anchoring
 of
 the
 Mandate
 a
 spending
 rule


which
 by
 the
 way
 was
 made
 by
 by
 Yen


stoltenberg
 um
 ex
 um
 Secretary
 General


of
 NATO
 when
 he
 was
 the
 Minister
 of


Finance
 and
 prime
 minister
 um
 and
 then


and
 then
 the
 um
 and
 then
 the


transparency
 I
 would
 say
 yeah
 sorry
 one


final
 question
 then
 um


a
 number
 of
 us
 uh
 economists
 at
 least


and
 some
 Finance
 people
 have
 commented


on
 the
 idea
 that
 the
 equilibrium


interest
 rate
 the
 let's
 say
 the
 10


average
 10year
 interest
 rate
 on
 safe


government
 debt
 is


rising
 partly
 because
 of
 fiscal
 excess


partly
 because
 of
 productivity
 growth


but
 variety
 views
 it's


rising
 if
 we're
 going
 to
 be
 in
 a


persistent
 High
 rate
 or
 high
 higher
 rate


environment
 how
 does
 that
 affect
 your


thinking
 about
 your
 allocations
 your


investment
 how
 does
 that
 affect
 the
 draw


rule
 I
 mean
 should
 Parliament
 be


revisiting
 the
 3%
 three
 and
 a
 half%


based
 on
 what
 the
 interest
 rate
 is
 or
 is


that
 something
 should
 just
 remain


fixed
 well
 sometimes
 um
 having
 uh
 an


unchanged
 rule
 in
 itself
 has
 a
 very


strong
 value
 right
 so
 instead
 of
 kind
 of


fine-tuning
 it
 changing
 it
 often
 to
 have


something
 kind
 of
 set
 in
 stone
 it's
 a


really
 good
 thing
 so
 I'll
 be
 surprised


if
 that
 rule
 was
 Revisited
 anytime
 soon


okay
 not
 going
 to
 get
 a
 conceptual


answer
 but
 a
 very
 clear
 answer
 um
 let
 me


open
 it
 up
 uh
 who
 would
 like
 to
 ask
 a


question
 okay
 seems
 like
 the
 left
 side


of
 the
 panel
 if
 you
 could
 get
 the


gentleman
 there
 third
 row
 please
 say


your
 name
 and
 identify
 yourself
 when


asking
 a
 question
 my
 name
 it's
 an
 X


World
 Bank


one
 question
 related
 to
 what
 your
 answer


was
 but
 context
 is
 how
 is
 the
 different


what
 is
 the
 difference
 between
 your


governance
 and
 objective
 from
 some
 of


the
 Middle
 Eastern
 fronts
 like
 the
 Saudi


fund
 or
 the
 UAE
 qat
 or
 the
 other
 side


which
 is
 very
 much
 in
 the
 news
 here


University
 end
 government
 funds
 which


are
 also
 public
 just
 to
 make
 it
 more


specific
 to
 the
 current
 debate
 you


talked
 about


ESG
 the
 financial
 sector
 has
 latched
 on


to
 ESG
 indicators
 but
 almost
 all
 the


academic
 research
 including
 two
 NBR


papers
 this
 week
 show
 that


ESG
 is
 used
 more
 as
 an
 enrichment
 of
 the


CEO
 rather
 than
 having
 any
 real
 impact


so
 what
 is
 your
 view
 on
 that
 maybe
 we'll


collect
 two
 questions
 at
 a
 time
 so
 if


you
 can
 hand
 out
 there
 was
 there
 was


kind
 of
 two
 there
 already
 so
 yeah
 yeah


yeah
 but
 let
 me
 let
 me
 I
 don't
 think
 I


can
 remember
 all
 this
 I'll
 remember
 for


you
 the
 person
 in
 front
 of
 you
 if
 you


could
 go
 to
 the
 gentleman
 in
 front
 of


him
 that's
 actually
 a
 good
 piggy
 back
 on


my
 question
 Dorth
 from
 the
 mil
 Institute


my
 question
 specifically
 was
 I
 think


most
 us
 asset
 managers
 and
 allocators


share
 your
 strong
 convictions
 on
 climate


over
 the
 long
 term
 but
 they
 bought
 up


against
 fiduciary
 duty
 here
 in
 the


United
 States
 you
 can't
 generate
 or


demonstr
 unless
 you
 can
 demonstrate


quantifiable
 Alpha
 you
 can't
 say
 climate


investing
 generates
 Alpha
 so
 if
 you


could
 speak
 to
 maybe
 the
 US
 managers


allocators
 who
 might
 want
 to
 allocate


more
 towards
 climate
 but
 but
 up
 against


rfcc
 but
 up
 against
 fiduciary
 duty
 what


are
 some
 of
 the
 tangible
 specifics
 in


terminal
 value
 or
 multiple
 expansion


whatever
 it
 is
 uh
 when
 you
 make
 your


assessment
 probably
 more
 towards
 the


med
 okay
 so
 um
 comparison
 with
 other


soan
 wealth
 fund
 it's
 fair
 to
 say
 that


uh
 some
 of
 the
 funds
 we
 don't
 know
 so


much
 about
 it
 right
 because
 they
 are


quite
 secretive
 and
 not
 very
 transparent


and


uh
 you
 know
 even
 a
 fantastic
 fund
 like


GIC
 in
 Singapore
 they
 they
 report
 their


Returns
 on
 a
 rolling
 20-year
 basis
 and


they
 don't
 disclose
 assets
 right
 so
 so


it's
 difficult
 to
 know
 sometimes
 but
 um


no
 many
 of
 them
 are
 really
 really
 great


firms
 um
 it's
 uncertain
 to
 me
 sometimes


whether
 they
 are
 part
 of
 the
 foreign


policy
 of
 the
 country
 or
 whether
 they


are
 uh
 have
 a
 goal
 of


just
 uh
 trying
 to
 generate
 the
 highest


possible
 Financial
 returns
 uh
 we
 don't


know
 some
 of
 them
 are
 spending
 money


domestically
 we
 don't
 do
 that
 we
 only


spend
 money
 outside
 of
 Norway
 um
 the


whole
 point
 was
 to
 to
 kind
 of
 keep
 the


capital
 outside
 not
 to
 distort
 uh
 the


domestic
 economy
 and
 uh
 and
 the
 currency


how
 we
 compare
 with
 us
 endowments
 well


you
 have
 some
 amazing
 endowments
 in
 this


country
 right


um
 and
 I
 have
 in
 my
 previous
 life
 been


managing
 capital
 for
 many
 of
 them
 I


would
 say
 the
 main
 difference
 they


probably
 um
 they
 are
 more
 into


alternative
 assets


uh
 they
 are
 using
 more
 external
 managers


they
 are
 they
 are
 uh
 you
 know
 quite


comfortable
 by
 paying
 uh
 quite
 High
 fees


because
 they
 really
 look
 at
 net
 returns


and
 in
 our
 part
 of
 the
 world
 we
 have
 a


problem
 paying
 big
 fees
 right
 it's
 just


something
 we
 really
 don't


like
 and
 then
 uh
 ESG
 yeah
 well
 for
 sure


I
 would
 say
 that
 ESG
 has
 nothing
 to
 do


with
 enriching
 CEOs
 I
 I
 I
 really
 don't


see
 that
 link
 um
 and
 also
 kind
 of
 um


combining
 that
 the
 thing
 is
 that
 if
 you


if
 you
 own
 20
 companies
 you
 don't
 really


necessarily
 have
 to
 care
 so
 much
 but
 if


you
 own
 the
 whole
 world
 like
 we
 do
 you


know
 one
 and
 a
 half%
 of
 the
 whole
 world


if
 you
 have
 one
 company
 polluting
 ha
 you


pick
 it
 up
 in
 all
 your
 other
 Holdings


you
 have
 to
 care
 and
 if
 you
 hear
 if
 you


have
 like
 a
 5200
 year
 investment
 Horizon


you
 definitely
 have
 to


care
 uh
 and
 as
 we
 talked
 about
 earlier


you
 know
 the
 link
 between
 climate
 and


inflation
 is
 is
 clearly
 there
 uh
 we
 see


it
 now
 in
 we
 do
 see
 it
 in
 reinsurance


rates
 they're
 going
 up
 we
 do
 see
 it
 in


productivity
 in
 some
 parts
 of
 the
 world


you
 cannot
 work
 in
 the
 middle
 of
 the
 day


because
 it's
 too
 Hal
 right
 so
 you
 are


you
 are
 seeing
 it
 in
 many
 in
 many


different
 ways
 and
 I
 uh
 you
 know
 we


argue
 that
 uh
 that
 it
 is
 a
 Financial


Risk
 thank
 you
 um
 hey
 great
 all
 these


question
 yeah
 I
 know
 it's
 fine
 by
 me
 um


can
 we
 get
 the
 two
 l
 in
 the
 second
 row


please
 friend
 the
 atletic
 Council
 of


Mardy
 Associates
 I
 was
 struck
 by
 the


difference
 of
 your
 level
 of
 investments


in
 the
 United
 States
 versus


Europe
 um
 and
 I
 wondered
 if
 you
 could


explain
 a
 bit
 what
 you
 find
 lacking
 in


Europe
 in
 terms
 of
 investment
 and
 uh


what
 you
 would
 suggest
 that
 Europe
 do
 as


you
 know
 discussion
 about
 this
 with


Botha
 and
 dring
 reports
 saying
 how


important
 additional
 investment
 would
 be


in


Europe
 my
 name
 is
 constan
 SCH
 I
 run
 the


central
 on
 the
 US
 inter
 bookings


institution
 um
 you
 presented
 uh
 the
 work


of
 your
 fund
 as
 very
 transparent


admirably
 so
 um
 fundamentally
 apolitical


but
 we
 live
 in
 a
 time
 uh


when
 very
 wealthy
 billionaires
 Tech


billionaires
 are
 taking
 overtly


political
 positions
 and
 positions
 that


are
 anti-democratic
 and
 in
 fact
 are


exhibiting
 a
 distinct
 fness
 for


autocratic
 political
 models
 how
 do
 you


feel
 about
 that
 and
 what
 do
 you
 think
 is


the
 responsibility
 the
 civic


responsibility
 of
 people
 in
 your


position
 in
 that
 context
 thank


you
 um


Europe
 um
 so
 I'm
 a
 proud
 European
 okay


um
 but
 um
 we
 see
 we
 see
 that


productivity
 growth
 in
 Europe
 has
 been


not
 very
 strong
 and
 for
 sure
 uh
 less


than
 what
 we
 see
 in
 America
 and
 it
 is
 um


it's
 really
 worth
 reading
 the
 drau


report
 because
 it
 lays
 out
 in
 great


detail
 why
 that
 is
 the
 case
 and
 it
 has


to
 do
 with
 um
 the
 industry
 mix
 we
 have


little
 technology
 which
 has
 been
 driving


growth
 we
 have
 quite
 a
 lot
 of
 kind
 of


old


Industries
 uh
 uh
 and
 that's
 where
 a
 lot


of
 the
 research
 money
 is
 still
 going
 in


you
 know
 into
 the
 car
 industry
 for


instance


um
 there
 is
 something
 with
 mentality
 in


Europe
 um
 we
 take
 less
 risks
 you
 know
 if


you
 go
 bankrupt
 in
 Europe
 you
 are
 you


normally
 don't
 get
 a
 second
 chance
 here


it's
 part
 of
 your
 learning
 right
 um
 so


there
 is
 a
 higher
 willingness
 for
 making


mistakes
 and
 for
 taking
 risks
 and
 it's


something
 really
 positive
 about
 that
 and


then
 it's
 just
 the
 mentality
 right
 I


mean
 hey
 I
 went
 to
 business
 school
 here


you
 know


5%
 is
 that
 a
 high
 or
 a
 low
 number
 in


Europe
 they
 think
 it's
 a
 high
 number
 in


America
 it's
 a
 really
 low
 number
 right


it's
 just
 something
 with
 how
 you
 are
 how


you
 anchor
 your
 Ambitions
 so
 there
 are
 a


lot
 of
 things
 there
 I
 think
 for
 the


moment
 now
 it's
 what
 we
 seeing
 is
 uh
 and


it's
 also
 of
 course
 regulation
 and
 we


have
 we
 meet
 with
 cosos
 uh
 across
 the


various
 countries
 um
 there
 is
 a
 lot
 of


Regulation
 um
 and
 that's
 really
 holding


back
 uh


you
 know
 R&D
 establishments
 Innovation


uh
 and
 so
 on
 what
 would
 it
 take
 to
 to


get
 it
 to
 move
 uh
 well
 drai
 claims
 that


it
 takes
 uh
 quite
 a
 bit
 of
 money
 and
 it


takes
 takes
 leadership


right
 then
 is
 it
 our
 responsibility
 to


think
 about
 um
 extremely
 wealthy
 people


who


um
 like
 auts
 yeah
 who
 like
 a
 I
 don't


think
 that's
 our
 task
 to
 sort
 out
 I


think
 that's
 somebody
 else
 who
 needs
 to


look
 at


that
 okay
 that
 was
 clear
 um
 all
 right
 we


got
 two
 this
 is
 nice
 when
 people
 sit


together
 for
 questions
 so
 we
 got
 two


another
 pair


here
 T
 form
 appear
 Institute
 uh
 thank


you


uh
 when
 I
 first
 started
 studying
 s


wealth
 funds
 one
 of
 my
 colleagues
 said


that


uh
 Sovereign
 wealth
 Fund
 in
 Norway
 has


been
 a
 political
 issue
 at
 all
 times


every
 election
 is
 about
 the
 Sovereign


wealth
 fund
 now
 you
 emphasize
 that
 the


consensus
 among
 politicians
 in
 in
 Norway


at
 least
 at
 the
 Pres
 so
 has
 that
 changed


or
 is
 the
 question
 of
 what
 you're
 doing


with
 the
 money
 or
 how
 much
 is
 spent
 now


rather
 later
 which
 I
 think
 Jo's
 question


um
 uh
 uh
 is
 that
 still
 an
 issue
 in
 uh
 in


in
 Norway
 and
 you
 have
 a
 problem
 I
 guess


in
 some
 sense
 so
 much
 of
 the
 budget
 is


paid
 out
 of
 the
 out
 of
 the
 Sovereign


weal
 fund
 is
 that
 a
 is
 that
 a
 problem
 in


terms
 of
 the
 domestic


politics
 Joe
 Peterson
 insute
 uh
 actually


T
 that
 wasn't
 a
 my
 question
 but
 I
 I
 like


your
 question
 I
 I'm
 looking
 forward
 to


the
 answer
 my
 question
 is
 about
 the
 is


Success
 raising
 it
 its
 own
 problems
 in


the
 sense
 that
 uh
 the
 purpose
 of
 the


fund
 is
 to
 save
 resources
 for
 the
 future


Generations
 as
 you
 pump
 the
 oil
 out
 but


almost
 no
 countries
 in
 the
 world
 have


ever
 done
 that
 uh
 most
 all
 exporters


never
 said
 anything
 inre
 you
 know
 in
 in


recent
 decades
 there's
 been
 some
 efforts


and
 a
 few
 have
 have
 exceeded
 and
 are
 up


there
 with
 Norway
 inul
 and
 maybe


Singapore
 so
 wellls
 but
 most
 it
 would
 be


hard
 to
 say
 not
 so
 does
 this
 growing


inequality
 sort
 of
 sort
 of
 Gap
 between


those
 who
 a
 few
 who
 have
 succeeded


Beyond
 anyone's
 dreams
 and
 I
 think
 it's


quite
 fair
 to
 say
 that
 over
 the
 years


the
 fund
 has
 grown
 much
 bigger
 than


projected
 every
 10
 years
 it's
 bigger


than
 projected
 uh
 does
 that
 success


raise
 tensions
 or
 issues
 either
 inside


Norway
 or
 outside
 in
 terms
 of
 the


inequality
 uh
 that
 it


presents
 there
 is
 a
 very


um
 there
 there
 is
 a
 very
 uh
 clear


um
 split
 uh
 in
 terms
 of
 the
 roles
 we


have
 in
 no
 way
 right
 so
 we
 spend
 no
 time


on
 how
 the
 money
 is
 going
 to
 be
 spent


that's
 the
 politicians
 the
 only
 thing
 we


care
 about
 is
 to
 make
 money
 and
 then
 it


goes
 into
 the
 budget
 next
 year
 is


projected
 at
 2
 and
 a
 half%
 of
 the
 fund


and
 it
 will
 cover
 something
 like
 23%
 of


the


budget
 uh
 but
 how
 it's
 going
 to
 be


dispersed
 and
 spent
 that's
 we
 have


nothing
 to
 do
 with
 it
 and
 we
 would
 never


talk
 about
 that
 because
 we
 will
 not


uh
 be
 seen
 to
 try
 to
 interfer
 political


matters
 um
 does
 it
 create
 increased


inequality
 within
 the
 country
 no
 I
 mean


U
 the
 fund
 uh
 decrease
 inequality
 within


the
 country
 because
 it's
 being
 used
 on


education
 uh
 you
 know
 health
 care
 and
 uh


and
 so
 on
 does
 it
 increase


uh
 you
 know
 the
 wealth
 of
 Norway


relative
 to
 other
 countries
 um
 yes
 I


guess
 it
 it
 does
 but
 it's
 interesting


what
 you
 say
 that
 countries
 generally


have
 not
 kept
 large
 uh
 wealth
 for
 a
 long


time
 you're
 right
 there
 has
 never
 been


there
 has
 never
 been
 a
 successful
 fund


for
 a
 very
 long
 time
 never
 in
 the


history
 of
 the


world
 now
 how
 um
 how
 could
 this
 fund


disappear
 well
 it
 could
 disappear
 if
 uh


if
 you
 had
 a
 massive
 draw
 down
 in


financial
 markets
 caused
 by
 something


which
 is
 really
 bad
 and
 so
 therefore
 you


would
 not
 adjust
 down
 the
 spending
 of


the
 fund
 so
 you
 um
 and
 at
 the
 same
 time


you
 sack
 management
 and
 close
 investment


positions
 at
 the
 wrong
 time
 then
 the


fund
 doesn't
 last
 for
 long
 that's
 the


main


risk
 thank
 you
 I've
 been
 leaning
 to
 my


left
 without
 symbolism
 is
 there
 some
 one


or
 two
 people
 who'
 like
 to
 ask
 a


question
 on
 this
 side
 of
 the
 room
 yeah


and
 back


please
 cther
 Lynch
 with
 black
 rock
 fixed


income
 you
 a
 more
 about
 how
 you
 see
 that


10
 basis
 point
 allocation
 to
 unlisted


infrastructure
 evolving
 over


time
 yeah
 I
 think
 it
 will
 um
 I
 think
 it


will
 go
 up
 um
 well
 we
 when
 we
 got
 it


into
 our
 mandate
 um
 in
 21
 I
 well
 we
 we


thought
 that
 the
 returns
 in
 that
 part
 of


the
 market
 was
 they
 were
 not
 very


attractive
 it's
 got
 of
 really
 difficult


to
 remember
 back
 to
 the
 days
 but
 you


know
 Green
 investment
 that
 it
 was
 so
 hot


you
 couldn't
 get
 in
 uh
 or
 all
 the
 boards


told
 all
 the
 investment
 managers
 you


have
 to
 increase
 your
 green
 Investments


because
 otherwise
 we
 look
 stupid
 and
 we


won't
 get
 any
 clients
 massive
 massive


pressure
 to
 make
 investments
 at
 very
 low


returns
 huge
 competition
 he
 was
 just


really
 not
 attractive
 so
 we
 made
 one


investment
 and
 then
 we
 just
 paused
 and


didn't
 do
 much
 for
 a
 long
 period
 of
 time


now
 I
 think
 it's
 very
 different
 right
 um


much
 less
 Focus
 I
 mean
 clearly
 in
 the


states
 uh


the
 The
 View
 started
 to
 change
 first


it's
 coming
 to
 Europe
 to
 a
 certain


extent
 uh
 there
 is
 less
 competition
 for


uh
 for
 renewable
 infrastructure


projects
 and
 they
 are
 more
 attractive


they
 we
 they
 are
 you
 know
 we
 we
 have


done
 a
 few
 lately
 and
 we
 think
 we'll
 do


more
 anyone
 else
 from
 this
 side
 like
 to


raise
 their


hand
 okay
 back
 over
 here
 I
 got
 five
 okay


so
 uh
 the
 two
 in
 the
 back
 row
 the
 lady


and
 the
 gentleman
 there
 I
 don't
 care


which


order
 for
 mono
 Associates
 to
 see
 you


question
 about
 fixed
 income
 we
 talked


about
 the
 equity
 side
 of
 the
 portfolio


but
 curious
 about
 the
 role
 of
 fixed


income
 in
 your
 portfolio
 uh
 in
 a
 world


where
 correlations
 have
 gotten
 tighter


is
 it
 liability
 management
 is
 it


duration
 positioning
 how
 do
 you
 think


about
 the
 role
 of
 fixed
 income
 in
 this


in
 the
 fund
 and
 before
 he
 answers
 it
 if


you
 could
 go
 to
 the
 lady
 over
 there


please
 thank


you
 thank


you
 I
 have
 a
 followup
 question
 on
 the


gentl
 and
 your
 answer
 I
 would
 like
 to


know
 uh
 your
 views
 of
 sovereign
 we
 funds


investing
 domestically
 we
 see
 other
 than


some
 countries
 at
 the
 Middle
 East
 and


the
 developing
 countries
 now
 governments


wanting
 to
 establish
 such
 funds
 what
 do


you


think
 benefits
 RIS
 thank
 you
 well
 I
 I


think
 I'm
 me
 whether
 uh
 wealth
 funds


should
 spend
 money
 domestically
 or


abroad
 I
 think
 that
 totally
 depends
 on


the
 function
 of
 the
 fund
 and
 why
 it
 was


established
 right
 you
 could
 make
 a
 good


argument
 for
 both
 but
 for
 us
 it
 was
 to


keep
 uh
 to
 keep
 the
 money
 outside
 the


country
 so
 very
 clear
 uh
 very
 clear
 part


of
 the
 structure
 fixed
 income
 is
 there


to
 balance
 returns


um
 and
 we
 also
 have
 a
 very
 good


rebalancing
 rule
 so
 that
 when
 um
 when


equities
 go
 up
 a
 lot
 and
 come
 uh
 and
 go


uh
 you
 know
 above
 where
 they
 should
 be


we


rebalance
 and
 and
 vice
 versa
 so
 uh
 when


stocks
 are
 high
 we
 sell
 them
 and
 put


more
 into
 bonds
 and
 the
 other
 way
 around


so
 it's
 a
 rebalancing
 rule
 which
 again


has
 been
 made
 by
 the
 Minister
 of
 Finance


and
 which
 works
 really


well
 um
 okay
 so
 that
 dealt
 with
 the


second
 question
 okay
 and
 the
 first


question
 yeah
 all
 right


so
 the
 grayhair
 gentleman
 there
 and
 the


grayhair
 gentleman
 there
 there
 so
 I


don't


discriminate
 I'm
 the
 hairless
 gentleman


here
 so
 it's
 okay
 Wilson
 Center
 when
 you


were
 talking
 about
 risk
 uh
 we're
 running


enormous
 deficits
 here
 in
 the
 country


where
 you
 have
 a
 half
 your
 Investments


and
 they
 don't
 look
 like
 they're
 going


down
 anytime
 soon
 at
 at
 some
 point
 is


there
 a
 risk
 of
 a
 bond
 holder
 rolt
 or


anything
 like
 that
 that
 would
 affect


overall
 your
 invests
 here
 in
 the
 US
 and


that
 gentlemen


yeah
 thank
 you


um
 I
 have
 two
 closely
 related
 inter
 you


get
 one


Mark
 no
 you
 get
 one
 question
 not
 two
 all


right
 I'll
 phrase
 it
 down
 to
 one
 then


you'll
 get
 cut
 off
 if
 you


cheat
 so
 you
 have
 $2
 trillion
 for
 a


country
 of
 five
 million
 people
 it's
 a


self-
 sustaining
 Fund
 in


perpetuity
 um
 and


um
 you
 transfer
 3%
 of
 GDP
 as
 you
 said
 to


the
 budget
 every
 year
 but
 why
 do
 you


need
 a
 fund
 that
 um
 exists
 into
 eternity


and
 why
 not
 provide
 for
 example
 tax
 cuts


or
 something
 like
 that
 more
 money
 to


benefit
 citizens
 in
 nor
 way
 currently


thank
 you
 that
 was
 a
 good
 one


question
 well
 uh
 tax
 taxes
 that
 I
 mean


that's
 a
 political
 decision
 that


politicians
 have
 to
 answer
 for
 um


yeah
 I
 haven't
 got
 a
 view
 on
 on


taxes


um
 is
 there
 a
 a
 debt
 scenario
 public


debt
 scenario
 in
 the
 US
 that
 would
 cause


you
 to
 rethink
 your


overweight
 allocation
 you
 know
 I
 think


it's
 a
 it's
 a
 it's
 a
 very
 very
 good


question
 of
 course
 and
 the
 budget


deficit
 situation
 is
 uh
 is
 in
 a
 way


front
 of
 front
 of


mind
 uh
 it's
 a
 very
 and
 I'm
 asking
 a
 lot


of
 of
 the
 the
 biggest
 brains
 in
 this


country
 to
 try
 to
 figure
 out
 what
 they


think
 and
 where
 is
 the
 where
 is
 the
 pain


point
 and
 where
 do
 you
 start
 to
 get


start
 to
 get
 worried
 and
 at
 which
 level


will
 investors
 certainly
 start
 to
 demand


a
 much
 higher
 rate
 to
 uh
 to
 buy


government
 debt
 I
 I
 don't
 think
 I
 have
 a


good
 answer
 but
 it's
 certainly
 something


uh
 we
 watch
 of
 course
 the
 we
 hear
 the


same
 from
 IMF
 right
 they
 have
 been
 very


clear
 and
 loud
 about
 it
 and
 and
 the


World
 Bank
 and
 so
 on
 so
 um
 there
 are


many
 very
 clever
 people
 who
 are
 worried


about
 it


okay
 uh
 back
 there
 again
 I'm
 looking


over
 here
 looking
 over
 here
 no
 okay
 back


then
 Washington


University
 um
 the
 environmental
 shock
 is


clearly
 a
 global
 systemic


shock
 at
 the
 same
 time
 with
 besides


getic
 risks
 we
 know
 recent
 the
 have
 put


out
 most
 countries
 have
 very
 high


government
 debts
 as
 well
 as
 priv


so
 going


forward
 are
 you
 expecting
 lower
 returns


given
 the


situation
 yeah
 I
 do
 expect
 lower
 returns


going
 forward
 um
 because
 um
 we've
 had
 a


very
 long
 period
 of
 falling
 interest


rates
 from
 high
 levels
 down
 to
 zero
 and


now
 they
 back
 up
 a
 bit
 but
 you
 know
 um


not
 huge
 we
 do
 see
 underlying


inflationary
 uh
 forces
 we
 mentioned
 in


the
 food
 market
 for


instance


um
 valuations
 in
 a
 stock
 markets
 are


higher
 so
 I
 think
 we
 should
 expect
 uh


returns
 to
 be
 lower
 going
 forward
 I


think
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 difficult
 to
 make


a
 lot
 of


money
 so
 I
 think
 the
 ements
 um
 need
 to


be
 very
 careful
 with
 their
 exp
 they
 need


to
 be
 uh
 focused
 in
 on
 exportation


management


that's
 no
 fun


um
 it's
 probably
 right
 but
 it's
 no
 fun


um
 one
 last
 question
 unless
 you're
 I


think
 we
 have
 four
 minutes
 left
 till
 the


witching
 hour
 going
 once
 yes
 that


gentlemen
 thank
 you
 uh
 Ashraf
 H
 from


Ravenswood
 Partners
 uh
 one
 of
 the
 big
 uh


Trends
 in
 the
 US
 has
 been
 the
 passive


versus
 active
 uh
 Trend
 and
 you
 used
 to


run
 an
 active
 fund
 now
 you're
 you
 know


2%
 owner
 of
 all
 world's
 asset
 where
 is


your
 view
 of
 where
 this
 all
 shakes
 out


uh
 at
 least
 in
 US
 markets
 well
 I
 think


it's
 very
 interesting
 the
 passive
 versus


uh


active
 debate
 um
 we
 we
 what
 we
 do
 is


that
 we
 run
 the
 capital
 uh
 close
 to
 the


index
 and
 so
 we
 have
 index
 weights
 from


the
 ministry
 and
 then
 we
 have
 a
 risk


budget
 which
 tells
 us
 how
 far
 from
 the


index
 week
 can
 be
 um
 there's
 clearly
 um


more
 and
 more
 money
 going
 into
 passive


and
 um
 but
 the
 problem
 is
 somebody


somebody
 needs
 to
 be
 active
 because
 you


need
 to
 establish
 prices
 in
 the
 market


and
 somebody
 needs
 to
 be
 responsible
 and


vote
 uh
 and
 so
 on
 so
 I
 suspect
 that
 the


development
 will
 continue
 in
 the


direction
 of
 passive
 uh
 and
 we
 will


continue
 to
 do
 a
 combination
 of


both
 great
 one
 of
 the
 great
 things
 about


I
 believe
 you
 already
 had
 a
 question
 one


of
 the
 great
 things
 about
 doing
 an
 event


with


a
 Norwegian
 a
 financial
 Visionary


someone
 who
 has
 a
 reporting
 relationship


inside
 a
 central
 bank
 all
 these
 aspects


along
 with
 nikolai's
 obvious
 personal


talents
 mean
 you
 do
 get
 Frank
 answers


clear
 answers
 brief
 answers
 it's
 a
 real


learning
 experience
 for
 me
 and
 I
 believe


everyone
 in
 the
 audience
 uh
 thank
 you


for
 including
 this
 form
 of


transparency
 in
 your
 Wast
 visit

thanks
 to
 the
 Ambassador

Norwegian

 proud
 and

 a
 lot
 from
 the
 relationship
 and


we
 hope
 we'll
 continue


to
 enable
 learning
 in
 both


directions
 thank
 you
 all
 very
 much
 thank


you
