Do
 Ontario's
 former
 premers
 still
 stand


by
 the
 policies
 they
 became
 known
 for?


The
 Premier
 Files
 explores
 all
 of
 that


and
 much
 more.


[Music]


I,
 Dalton
 McGinty,


swear
 that
 I
 will
 duly
 and
 faithfully


and
 to
 the
 best
 of
 my
 skill
 and


knowledge,
 execute
 the
 powers
 and
 trusts


proposed
 in
 me
 as
 Premier
 and
 President


of
 the
 Executive
 Council
 and
 Minister
 of


Intergovernmental
 Relations
 of
 the


Province
 of
 Ontario.
 So
 help
 me
 God.


>> Daltton
 McGinty
 brought
 the
 Liberals


back
 to
 power
 in
 2003,
 becoming


Ontario's
 24th
 premier.
 He
 won
 three


straight
 elections,
 making
 him
 the
 most


successful
 liberal
 premier
 in
 more
 than


a
 century.
 His
 approach,
 never
 too
 high,


never
 too
 low,
 just
 relentless.
 We
 spoke


here
 at
 Queens
 Park.
 Premier
 McGinty,


I'm
 curious
 as
 to
 what
 it
 was
 like


walking
 back
 into
 this
 building
 today


after
 so
 many
 years.
 Well,
 I
 was
 met
 by


um
 capable,


friendly,
 accommodating
 security


personnel
 who
 wouldn't
 know
 me
 from
 any


other
 passer
 by.


>> You
 really
 think
 they
 didn't
 know
 you?


>> They
 did
 not
 know
 me.
 No.
 No.
 But
 time


marches
 on,
 right?
 And


>> it's
 been
 12
 years
 since
 you
 were


premier.


>> 12
 years.
 And
 uh
 but
 I
 have
 all
 kinds
 of


warm
 memories
 uh
 from
 this
 building.


Well,
 let's
 go
 back
 because
 we're
 going


to
 go
 we'll
 eventually
 get
 to
 this


building,
 but
 I
 do
 want
 to
 start
 at
 the


beginning.
 And
 I
 want
 to
 start
 with
 the


home
 you
 grew
 up
 in.


>> Yeah.


>> With
 two
 parents
 and
 10
 kids.


>> Was
 that
 the
 mayhem?
 It
 sounds
 like


>> I
 think
 it
 was
 kind
 of
 organized
 mayhem.


Uh
 there
 was
 there
 was
 my
 my
 parents
 I


think
 it
 allowed
 for
 a
 comfortable


accommodation
 so
 that
 we
 could
 be
 kids


and
 crazy.
 Uh
 but
 there
 were
 also
 some


some
 rules
 uh
 that
 we
 had
 to
 um
 to
 to


stick
 by.
 You
 know,
 one
 of
 one
 of
 my


dad's
 routines


uh
 if
 you
 want
 to
 he
 was
 a
 university


professor.
 It's
 hard
 to
 feed
 10
 kids
 on


an
 academic
 salary.
 So
 he
 was
 very


entrepreneurial
 and
 he
 did
 all
 kinds
 of


things.
 But
 one
 of
 the
 things
 he
 did
 is


he
 taught
 summer
 courses
 and
 he
 taught


evening
 school.
 So
 he'd
 come
 home
 to
 be


with
 us
 during
 dinner
 and
 then
 he'd


stretch
 out
 immediately
 after
 dinner
 on


a
 lazy
 boy
 chair
 and
 just
 cover
 himself


with
 the
 newspaper.


We
 would
 run
 around
 like
 idiots
 high
 on


ice
 cream
 that
 we
 bought
 by
 the
 two


gallon
 barrels


and
 uh
 and
 if
 we
 got
 too
 loud
 uh
 he'd


let
 out
 a
 a
 howl
 or
 a
 shriek
 that
 would


scare
 the
 you
 know
 what
 out
 of
 us.
 and


we
 knew
 we
 had
 to
 kind
 of
 temper
 our
 our


our
 fun.
 So
 there
 were
 there
 we
 had
 a


lot
 of
 fun,
 but
 there
 was
 also
 a
 lot
 of


discipline
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 um
 expectation.


>> Were
 you
 expected
 though
 as
 one
 of
 the


older
 kids
 to
 be
 a
 kind
 of
 a
 co-parent


to
 the
 younger
 ones?


>> Yeah,
 there
 was
 a
 um
 a
 heavy


expectation.
 It's
 not
 something
 that
 I


felt
 at
 the
 time
 though,
 Steve,
 that
 was


heavy.
 It
 was
 just
 how
 I
 was
 growing
 up.


It
 was
 what
 I
 knew.
 I
 was
 the
 oldest
 of


uh
 six
 boys


and
 uh
 um
 so
 my
 job
 was
 to
 my
 mother
 and


father
 expected
 me
 to
 set
 a
 good


example.


>> A
 lot
 of
 multitasking
 here.


>> A
 lot
 of
 multitasking.
 Yeah.
 And
 the


other
 thing
 of
 course
 you
 learn
 in
 this


large
 uh
 big
 family
 environment
 is
 um


how
 to
 manage
 different
 personalities.


>> Does
 that
 come
 in
 helpful
 when
 you've


got
 a
 caucus
 of
 absolutely
 70
 plus


people?


>> Absolutely
 it
 does.


>> Absolutely.
 I
 like
 to
 say
 a
 caucus
 is
 a


football
 team
 consisting
 entirely
 of


quarterbacks.
 Um
 they
 all
 want
 to
 call


the
 play
 and
 they
 are
 all
 leaders
 in


their
 own
 right.
 They
 are
 leaders
 and


have
 been
 seen
 as
 such
 in
 their


communities.


>> So
 you
 know
 I'm
 sure
 we
 might
 find
 some


time
 to
 come
 back
 to
 these
 kinds
 of


things.
 But
 one
 of
 the
 things
 I've


learned
 about
 leadership
 is
 it's
 there's


kind
 of a
 simple
 formula.
 Get
 the
 best


people.
 Get
 the
 best
 out
 of
 them.


>> Not
 much
 more
 complicated
 than
 that.


Provincial
 politics
 is
 so
 much
 about


healthcare
 and
 education.
 And
 your
 mom


was
 a
 nurse.
 your
 dad
 was
 in
 the


post-secary
 world.
 I
 mean,
 there
 it
 is


right
 there.


>> Do
 I
 assume
 that
 a
 large
 part
 of
 the


reason
 why
 you
 went
 into
 public
 life
 is


because
 of
 the
 example
 they
 set?


>> Um,
 not,
 you
 know,
 I've
 never
 really


thought
 of
 it
 that
 way,
 in
 fact,
 ever.


Um,
 but
 I
 think
 there
 was
 just
 an


expectation,
 um,
 mostly
 unwritten.
 It's


never
 going
 to
 be
 good
 enough
 to
 grow


up,
 get
 a
 job,
 and
 pay
 taxes.
 Everybody


does
 that.
 That's
 kind
 of
 the
 minimum


expectation.


They
 would
 also
 would
 have
 conveyed
 that


the
 quality
 of
 life
 that
 we
 enjoyed
 is


nothing
 short
 of
 extraordinary
 and
 it


didn't
 just
 happen.
 But
 um
 previous


generations
 did
 something
 and
 I'm
 going


to
 use
 a
 word
 we
 rarely
 use
 today.
 They


sacrificed


right
 for
 the
 younger
 generations.


um
 and
 uh
 handed
 handed
 down
 to
 us
 on
 a


silver
 platter.
 Um
 wonderful
 things
 like


great
 schools
 and
 great
 health
 care
 and


safe
 and
 strong
 communities
 and
 a
 safe


and
 clean
 environment.
 All
 those
 kinds


of
 things
 didn't
 just
 happen.
 Um
 so


there
 was
 an
 expectation
 we
 would
 find
 a


way
 each
 in
 our
 own
 way
 to
 make
 a


contribution.
 When
 did
 you
 first
 get
 the


notion
 that
 maybe
 going
 into
 politics
 at


some
 point
 in
 your
 life
 was
 a


consideration?


Well,
 I
 kind
 of
 um
 um
 approached
 it,


then
 pulled
 away
 from
 it,
 and
 then
 came


back
 to
 it.
 So,
 I
 approached
 it
 at
 the


outset
 uh
 when
 we
 were
 younger.
 You


know,
 my
 dad
 was
 John
 Turner's
 writing


association
 president,
 and
 we
 worked
 on


campaigns
 even
 be
 before
 then.
 We'd
 show


up
 with
 a
 modest
 crew
 of
 five
 or
 six


kids.
 Uh
 we
 would
 stuff
 envelopes,
 um


make
 some
 calls
 when
 we
 got
 a
 little
 bit


older,
 knock
 on
 doors
 and
 came
 to
 see


campaigning
 as
 as
 a
 lot
 of
 fun.


Um
 and
 then
 um
 um
 later
 on
 my
 dad
 got


into
 politics.


Um
 he
 I
 could
 see
 that
 he
 found
 it
 very


challenging.
 He
 wanted
 to
 be
 in
 cabinet.


He
 never
 got
 into
 cabinet.
 Uh
 I
 could


see
 the
 the
 long
 hours,
 the
 time
 away


from
 family.
 You're
 called
 upon
 to


reconcile
 the
 irreconcilable.
 It's
 so


difficult
 at
 times
 to
 make
 progress.


There
 are
 frustrations
 and
 there's


cynicism.
 It
 can
 be
 a
 toxic
 environment


at
 time.
 So
 that
 kind
 of
 repelled
 me


from
 it.
 And
 then
 he
 passed
 away.
 And


then
 I
 thought,
 you
 know,
 hey,
 time
 to


step
 up.
 I
 want
 to
 go
 back
 to
 one
 of
 the


worst
 nights
 of
 your
 life,
 the
 16th
 of


March,
 1990.
 and
 your
 father
 is


shoveling
 the
 snow
 on
 the
 driveway.


>> What
 do
 you
 remember
 about
 that
 evening?


>> I
 got
 a
 call
 from
 my
 mother


and
 my
 mom's
 a
 very
 uh
 calm
 and


collected
 uh
 was
 a
 cal
 and
 collected
 uh


person.
 So,
 she
 said,
 "Mickey,
 you


better
 get
 over
 here."


So,
 I
 thought,
 "Okay,
 all
 right.
 I'll


take
 some
 time
 and
 uh
 you
 know
 pull
 some


things
 together,
 make
 sure
 the
 kids
 are


good
 and
 all
 that.


And
 then
 3
 minutes
 later,
 my
 brother


Michael
 phones
 and
 he
 says,
 "Jamie,
 get


the
 hell
 over
 here."


So
 I
 knew
 something
 was
 up.
 So
 I
 u
 get


in
 the
 car.
 My
 mom
 and
 dad's
 place
 was


only
 like
 five
 or
 six
 minutes
 away.


Drove
 as
 quickly
 as
 I
 could.
 I
 get
 there


and
 found
 my
 mom
 giving
 my
 dad
 uh
 melt


mouth
 resuscitation.


So,
 um


>> outdoors.


>> Outdoors.
 Yeah.


>> On
 the
 ground
 in
 the
 winter.


>> On
 the
 ground.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 So,
 um
 I
 took


over
 uh
 and
 she
 proceeded,
 she
 was
 a


nurse
 to
 give
 him
 chest
 compressions


and
 um
 but
 it
 was
 too
 late.
 Uh
 it
 was


too
 late.
 So,
 we
 waited
 for
 the
 u
 uh


ambulance
 to
 come.
 and
 they
 took
 him
 to


the
 hospital.
 We
 followed
 immediately


behind
 and
 uh
 but
 it
 was
 it
 was
 uh
 it


was
 too
 late.
 Yeah.


>> 63


>> 63
 years
 of
 age.


>> Let
 me
 circle
 back
 to
 something
 you
 said


a
 moment
 ago,
 which
 is
 your
 mother


called
 you
 Mac.


>> Mick.


>> Mick.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 you
 had
 a
 brother
 call
 you
 Jamie.


>> Yeah.


>> Your
 name's
 Daltton
 James
 Patrick


McGinty
 Jr.
 You're
 the
 same
 name
 as
 your


dad.


>> Yeah.


>> What's
 with
 all
 the
 different
 names
 that


everybody
 calls
 you?
 So
 well
 this
 is
 a


bit
 complicated.
 Uh
 first
 of
 all
 um
 yeah


so
 um
 um
 I
 was
 known
 as
 Jamie
 uh
 growing


up
 and
 my
 family
 still
 calls
 me
 Jamie.


>> Dalton
 was
 my
 father.


>> Right.


And
 then
 later
 on
 my
 parents
 um


christristened
 me
 uh
 Mick.
 That
 became


my
 nickname.


>> Gotcha.
 His
 death
 besides
 being
 a


personal
 tragedy
 for
 your
 family.
 I


mean,
 I
 guess
 the
 reality
 is
 he's
 an


elected
 member
 at
 the
 time
 and
 his
 death


means
 there's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 bi-election


to
 replace
 him
 in
 the
 legislature,


>> right?


>> How
 long
 did
 it
 take
 before
 your
 family


kind
 of
 sat
 down
 and
 started
 to
 think


about
 whether
 one
 of
 the
 kids
 would
 run


in
 hisstead?


>> So,
 David
 um
 Peterson
 delivered
 the


eulogy
 at
 my
 dad's
 funeral
 and
 then
 we


hosted
 uh
 a
 gathering
 at
 my
 mom's
 house


afterwards.
 And
 I
 remember
 David
 saying


to
 me
 and
 my
 brothers,


"Which
 one
 of
 you
 is
 going
 to
 run?"


>> He
 put
 it
 like
 that.


>> Yeah.


>> So
 the
 expectation
 was
 it
 was
 going
 to


be
 somebody
 from
 the
 family.


>> Yeah.
 There
 was
 kind
 of
 an
 expectation


there.
 And
 I
 think
 even
 had
 he
 not
 said


that,
 I
 think
 we'd
 all
 seriously


considered
 it.
 And
 I
 I
 felt
 a
 yearning


something
 to
 get
 to
 get
 at
 this
 now.
 And


um
 and
 the
 joke
 I
 used
 to
 make
 was,


"Well,
 look,
 my
 name's
 already
 on
 the


signs,
 so
 we've
 got
 a
 a
 financial


argument
 in
 favor
 of
 my
 candidacy."


Anyway,
 two
 weeks
 after


the
 funeral,
 I
 said
 to
 Terry,
 "I
 think
 I


uh


I
 think
 I
 got
 to
 run."


She
 says,
 "We
 have
 four
 kids
 under


eight.
 You're
 not
 running."


>> Yes.


>> I
 said,
 "That
 is
 so
 sensible."
 Um,
 but


for
 me,
 as
 for
 everything
 that
 I
 have


ever
 pursued
 in
 politics,
 it
 was
 always


much
 more,
 Steve,
 an
 affair
 of
 the
 heart


than
 the
 head.
 It's
 been
 said
 that
 the


heart
 has
 its
 reasons.
 Reason
 alone
 will


never
 know.
 And
 I
 felt
 a
 calling.
 I
 felt


a
 responsibility
 to
 pick
 up
 where
 my
 dad


had
 left
 off.
 And
 that's
 the
 long
 and


the
 short
 of
 it.
 How
 I
 got
 in.
 The
 1990


election
 comes
 and
 you
 are
 the
 one


liberal
 who's
 new
 at
 Queens
 Park.


>> I
 am
 the
 class
 of
 1990.


>> You
 are
 the
 liberal
 class
 of
 1990.
 59


Liberal
 MPPPs
 lost
 their
 seats
 in
 that


election.
 This
 was
 the
 election
 Bob
 Ray


won
 in
 a
 shocking
 upset.


>> How
 do
 you
 think
 you
 managed
 to


withstand
 the
 tide
 that
 was
 slaying


liberals
 all
 over
 the
 province?


>> Um


the
 sheer
 quality
 of
 my
 candidacy.
 But


seriously,
 folks,
 um
 I
 think
 that
 um
 my


dad
 had
 an
 excellent
 reputation.
 I
 think


there's
 no
 doubt
 about
 that.
 I
 think


that
 there
 was
 um


um
 some


let's
 give
 this
 kid
 a
 shot,
 right?
 His


dad
 was
 in
 office.
 Um
 he


was
 an
 upstanding


contributor
 to
 our
 community
 life.
 Let's


give
 the
 kid
 a
 shot.
 So
 I
 think
 there's


there's
 undoubtly
 some
 sympathy
 there


associated
 with
 that.
 Um
 and
 the
 other


thing
 I
 like
 to
 think
 was
 we
 we
 ran
 a


good
 campaign
 and
 um
 uh
 we
 ran
 an
 honest


campaign.
 I
 you
 know
 one
 of
 the
 things
 I


did
 I
 think
 I
 even
 put
 this
 in
 my
 book


you
 know
 like
 three
 days
 after


I've
 been
 knocking
 on
 doors


I
 had
 discovered
 that
 Bloom
 had
 really


come
 off
 the
 liberal
 roles.


So
 came
 back
 to
 campaign
 headquarters.
 I


said,
 "We
 have
 to
 remove
 all
 posters
 of


my
 leader.
 Have
 to
 take
 them
 out
 of
 my


pamphlets."


You
 know,
 some
 people
 might
 consider


this
 heretical.


But
 I
 figured
 the
 single
 most
 important


um
 obligation
 I
 owed
 to
 my
 leader
 was


win
 my
 seat.
 Win
 my
 seat.
 So
 um
 that's


what
 I
 did
 and
 worked
 very
 hard
 and
 was


able
 to
 uh
 win.
 And
 I
 know
 that
 our


party
 took
 a
 kicking
 and
 I
 recall
 our


first
 meeting
 in
 this
 building,
 Steve.
 I


was
 the
 only
 newly
 elected
 MPP
 and
 at


the
 time
 it
 was
 a
 gathering
 of
 all
 the


the
 u
 the
 MPPPs
 who
 had
 run
 in
 that


election
 and
 lost
 and
 lost.
 So
 I
 felt


like
 I
 was
 sitting
 in
 on
 a
 wake.
 I


thought,
 "What
 the
 hell?
 I
 just
 won
 this


thing.
 This
 is
 I'm
 I'm
 I'm
 riding
 a
 wave


here."
 I
 was
 excited
 to
 be
 here
 and
 u


grateful
 uh
 for
 the
 opportunity
 but
 of


course
 I
 had
 to
 you
 know
 bite
 my
 tongue


and
 feel
 the
 the
 reality
 of
 what
 was


being
 experienced
 by
 my
 colleagues.


There's
 no
 way
 you
 will
 remember
 this


but
 I
 have
 never
 forgotten
 it.


you
 and
 I
 had
 a
 lunch
 not
 too
 long
 after


you
 won
 your
 seat
 because
 I
 thought
 I


got
 to
 meet
 this
 one
 new
 Liberal
 MPP
 and


find
 out
 what
 he's
 all
 about.
 So,
 we
 had


lunch
 in
 the
 basement
 of
 this
 building


and
 somehow
 during
 the
 course
 of
 that


lunch,
 you
 mentioned
 to
 me
 when
 I
 asked


you,
 you
 know,
 what
 are
 your
 plans
 for


around
 here?
 You
 said,
 "Well,
 I
 think


I'd
 like
 to
 lead
 this
 party
 someday."


You
 said
 that
 having
 probably
 no
 idea


where
 the
 bathrooms
 in
 this
 building


even
 were
 yet.


Did
 you
 really


what
 what
 gave
 you
 the
 hutzbah
 to
 start


thinking
 you
 could
 be
 the
 leader
 of
 this


party
 given
 the
 blood
 bath
 your
 party


just
 been
 through
 and
 you're
 a
 brand
 new


person
 here?


>> Yeah.
 Um
 I
 was
 probably
 just
 full
 of


blie
 uh
 at
 the
 time.


>> I
 love
 that
 you're
 not
 denying
 the


story.
 So
 probably
 just
 full
 of
 blie.


Um,
 but
 I
 think
 that
 I
 didn't
 give
 it


really
 serious
 consideration
 until
 um,


much
 later.
 Um,
 but
 I
 thought,
 you
 know,


maybe
 I
 can
 bring
 something
 to
 the
 table


here
 that'll
 be
 different
 from
 what


others
 might
 be
 offering.


>> The
 crazy
 thing
 about
 the
 conversation


you
 and
 I
 had
 over
 lunch
 is
 that
 six


years
 later,
 you
 ran
 for
 the
 leadership


and
 won.


>> Yeah.


>> What
 made
 you
 think
 at
 the
 age
 of
 41


years
 old
 in
 1996
 that
 you
 were
 ready


actually
 to
 be
 the
 leader
 of
 the
 party?


>> Right.
 Well,
 I
 felt
 we
 needed
 to


kickstart
 a
 party,
 right?
 It
 was
 um


languishing
 and
 uh
 we
 had
 won
 one
 in
 50


years,
 I
 guess
 it
 was.
 Um
 and
 I
 thought


I
 could
 bring
 forward
 some
 um
 some
 new


ways,
 some
 new
 ideas,
 some
 new
 um


methods.


And
 um
 I
 thought,
 what
 the
 heck,
 give


give
 it
 a
 shot.
 And
 um
 I
 you
 know
 there


was
 no
 there
 was
 no
 provincewide
 draft


Dalton
 movement
 I
 can
 assure
 you.


>> Um
 and
 again
 there
 was
 a
 uh
 struggle
 uh


on
 the
 home
 front


>> when
 you
 told
 your
 wife
 you
 wanted
 to


run
 for
 the
 leadership


>> leadership.
 Yeah.


>> How'd
 that
 go?


>> Well
 uh
 about
 as
 well
 as
 it
 did
 when
 I


told
 her
 I
 wanted
 to
 get
 into
 politics


in
 in
 the
 first
 instance.


>> But
 she
 didn't
 veto.


>> She
 did
 not
 veto.
 But
 she
 she
 raised
 all


the
 usual
 legitimate
 concerns.


>> What
 did
 you
 consider
 your
 chances
 for


victory
 to
 be
 during
 the
 course
 of
 the


campaign
 running
 for
 leader?


>> I
 felt
 the
 longer
 I
 was
 out
 there,
 the


more
 uh
 the
 more
 optimistic
 I
 was,
 the


more
 I


was
 growing,
 the
 more
 I
 was
 connecting,


the
 more
 I
 was
 learning.
 So
 I
 felt
 I


felt
 optimistic.


We
 are
 almost
 30
 years
 since
 you
 ran
 in


that
 leadership
 convention
 as
 we
 sit


here
 today
 in
 June
 of
 2025


and
 you
 gathered
 at
 Maple
 Leaf
 Gardens,


all
 the
 troops,
 the
 results
 of
 the
 first


ballot
 come
 in
 and
 you
 are
 in
 fourth


place.


>> Yep.


>> What
 did
 you
 think
 of
 your
 chances
 at


that
 point?


I
 thought
 I
 thought
 you
 know
 what
 I


wasn't
 I
 wasn't
 put
 out
 by
 that
 because


um


my
 ambition


was
 to
 be
 everybody's
 favorite
 second


choice.
 I
 knew
 that
 in
 this
 I
 think
 were


there
 six
 of
 us
 or
 seven
 of
 us
 I
 can't


recall


>> uh
 a
 fair
 number
 of
 of
 leadership


candidates
 seven
 all
 told.
 Yeah.


>> So
 um
 I
 had
 made
 an
 effort
 to
 it
 was
 a


it
 was
 an
 old-fashioned
 delegated


convention.
 the
 best
 the
 best
 kind.
 You


got
 that
 right.


>> And
 so
 you
 get
 to
 know
 who
 the
 delegates


are.
 So
 I
 made
 a
 point
 of
 phoning
 every


single
 one
 before
 that
 convention


personally.


>> 5,000
 delegates.
 Phone
 them
 all.
 And
 the


purpose
 of
 the
 call
 was
 simply
 to
 say,
 I


see
 you're
 supporting
 so
 and
 so.


Fabulous.
 So
 and
 so's
 an
 an
 excellent


candidate.
 However,
 should
 he
 or
 she


drop
 off
 the
 ballot,
 I'd
 be
 honored
 to


have
 your
 support.
 Just
 a
 soft
 cell
 like


that,
 right?
 So,
 um
 that
 was
 my


objective
 to
 be
 everybody's
 favorite
 um


uh
 second
 choice.


>> Except
 when
 the
 results
 of
 the
 second


ballot
 came
 in,
 you
 were
 still
 in
 fourth


and
 a
 worse
 fourth.
 So,
 what
 did
 you


think
 at
 that
 point?


>> Yeah.


>> The
 conventional
 wisdom
 says
 when
 you


come
 a
 worse
 fourth
 on
 the
 second


ballot,
 you
 drop
 out
 and
 you
 go
 Yeah.


>> you
 go
 endorse
 another
 candidate,
 right?


Did
 you
 consider
 that?


>> No.
 No.
 I
 think
 there
 were
 still
 people


behind
 me
 at
 that
 time.


>> There
 were.
 Yeah.
 So,
 um,
 no,
 as
 long
 as


there
 are
 people
 behind
 you,
 you
 live
 to


hopefully
 secure,
 um,
 that
 support
 when


they
 fall
 off.


>> Well,
 that
 was
 the
 crazy
 thing.
 The


people
 behind
 you
 who
 dropped
 off
 didn't


go
 to
 one
 of
 the
 top
 three
 candidates.


They
 went
 to
 you.


>> Yeah.


>> How
 did
 that
 happen?


>> Favorite
 second
 choice.
 Favorite
 second


choice.
 You
 know,
 um,
 did
 you
 know
 that


was
 going
 to
 happen?


>> No.
 No.
 But
 that
 was
 my
 objective
 uh,
 at


the
 outset.
 It
 was,
 you
 know,
 I
 wasn't
 I


wasn't
 trying
 to
 be
 like
 a
 superstar


candidate.
 I
 hope
 that
 people
 say,
 you


know,
 we
 could
 live
 with
 that
 McGinty


guy.
 We
 could
 do
 worse
 than
 that
 McGinty


guy.
 Compromised
 candidate.


>> Compromised
 candidate,
 right?
 I'm
 okay


with
 that.
 You
 got
 to
 get
 the
 job.


Right.
 So,
 um,
 and
 that
 uh
 that's
 how
 it


kind
 of
 unfolded.
 This
 was
 an


extraordinary
 convention
 because
 of


course
 it
 it
 started
 it
 not
 only
 started


on
 one
 day
 and
 ended
 on
 another
 day.
 It


started
 in
 one
 month
 and
 ended
 in


another
 month.
 Right.
 It
 was
 November
 30


over
 December
 1st.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 fifth
 ballot
 4:30
 in
 the
 morning
 and


Joe
 Cordiano
 was
 the
 kingmaker.


>> Yeah.


>> Did
 you
 talk
 to
 Joe
 personally
 in


between
 the
 fourth
 and
 fifth
 ballots
 in


order
 to
 try
 to
 secure
 his
 delegates?


>> No.
 No.
 Did
 you
 know
 he
 was
 going
 to


come
 to
 you?
 No,
 I
 hoped
 that
 he
 would.


Uh,
 the
 good
 news
 I
 felt
 going
 into
 the


campaign
 I
 was
 free
 and
 easy
 and
 I
 had


no
 obligations.
 The
 bad
 news,
 no


alliances.


So,
 I
 was
 really
 on
 my
 own.
 Anyway,
 I


was
 delighted
 when
 Joe
 uh
 came
 over
 and


um


and
 then
 I
 can
 recall
 u
 Steve
 they
 uh


what
 they
 that
 they
 did
 the
 organizers


of
 the
 of
 the
 uh
 of
 the
 uh
 convention.


They
 um
 uh
 they
 sent
 around
 some
 people


to
 quietly
 whisper
 into
 our
 ears
 that
 we


what
 the
 results
 were.
 So
 it
 was
 me
 and


Jory
 Kennedy
 on
 the
 last
 vote.
 Yeah.


So
 I
 turn
 to
 Terry
 and
 say,
 "Honey,


we
 won."


>> You
 knew
 before
 they
 made
 the


announcement.


>> We
 knew
 before
 they
 made
 the


announcement.
 She
 whispered
 back,
 "You


said
 you
 weren't
 going
 to
 win."


So
 anyway,
 um,
 and
 then
 the
 adventure


began.


>> Indeed.


You
 then
 become
 the
 leader
 of
 the


official
 opposition
 at
 Queens
 Park.


>> Yeah.
 Let
 me
 just
 tell
 you
 one
 story.
 So


sure,


>> it
 took
 me
 a
 while
 to
 kind
 of
 grow
 into


the
 job.
 So,
 um,
 I
 had
 to
 at
 4:30
 in
 the


morning
 when
 nobody
 wanted
 to
 hear


anything,
 go
 to
 the
 make
 my
 way
 to
 the


podium,
 get
 leave
 my,
 uh,
 set
 of
 seats,


whatever,
 up
 uh,
 and
 and
 walk
 down
 and,


uh,
 make
 my
 way
 to
 the,
 uh,
 to
 the
 stage


and,
 uh,
 there's
 people
 everywhere,
 you


know,
 and
 lots
 of
 media
 and
 all
 that


stuff.
 And
 at
 some
 point,
 somebody
 says,


um,


stand
 back
 and
 make
 room
 for
 the
 leader.


So
 I
 stood
 back


yet
 to
 grow
 accustomed
 to
 the
 notion


that
 somehow
 I
 was
 a
 leader.


So
 I
 went
 up
 there,
 gave
 some
 modest


remarks
 and
 then
 uh
 I
 think
 crazily


there
 was
 a
 a
 breakfast
 the
 next
 morning


and
 I
 had
 to
 give
 a
 speech
 at
 breakfast


and
 then
 uh
 then
 the
 party
 was
 over
 and


everybody
 went
 home


and
 Terry
 and
 the
 kids
 got
 on
 a
 plane


and
 went
 back
 home.
 And
 then
 I
 recall
 I


was
 exhausted
 walking
 up
 Young
 Street
 on


my
 own
 thinking,


"What
 the
 hell
 have
 I
 gotten
 myself


into?"


And
 I
 was
 feeling
 the
 weight
 of
 not
 of


office,
 of
 expectation.


How
 am
 I
 going
 to
 live
 up
 to
 my
 party's


expectations?
 How
 am
 I
 going
 to
 pull


them
 together?
 How
 am
 I
 going
 to
 form
 a


a
 decent
 opposition?
 How
 am
 I
 going
 to


inspire
 the
 confidence
 of
 Ontarians?
 How


am
 I
 going
 to
 um
 keep
 my
 family
 tight


and
 safe
 throughout
 all
 of
 this?
 So,


that's
 that's
 what
 I
 was
 feeling


honestly
 at
 at
 that
 time.


>> That's
 a
 lot.


>> Yeah.


>> How
 did
 you
 not
 sort
 of
 sink
 under
 the


burden
 of
 all
 of
 that?


>> Day
 at
 a
 time.


>> Just
 a
 day
 at
 a
 time.
 And
 uh
 I
 recall
 I


recall
 when
 I
 first
 got
 into
 this


building
 and
 I
 had
 um
 I
 got
 an
 office,


it
 had
 a
 um
 a
 security
 button
 on
 it
 and


um
 I
 pressed
 it.


Nothing
 happened.
 And
 I
 thought
 to


myself,
 welcome
 to
 the
 powerlessness
 of


leader
 of
 the
 opposition.


And
 but
 I
 just
 took
 it
 just
 took
 it
 one


day
 at
 a
 time.
 Just
 take
 it
 one
 day
 at
 a


time.
 And
 you
 know,
 my
 personal
 mantra


has
 always
 been
 never
 too
 high,
 never


too
 low,
 just
 relentless.


You've
 got
 to
 um
 they're
 going
 to
 be


smarter
 people.
 They're
 going
 to
 be
 um


uh
 people
 who
 are
 have
 more
 capability


in
 different
 ways.
 But
 I
 always
 told


myself,
 nobody
 will
 outwork
 me.


>> I
 will
 keep
 doing
 what
 I
 need
 to
 do
 to


grow
 and
 to
 learn,
 to
 understand,
 and
 to


become
 stronger
 and
 more
 capable
 of


meeting
 the
 needs
 of
 Ontarians.
 They
 say


being
 the
 leader
 of
 the
 opposition
 is


the
 worst
 job
 in
 public
 life.
 It
 is.


>> Well,
 on
 the
 other
 hand,
 Mike
 Harris
 was


the
 premier.
 So,
 you
 had
 a
 guy
 to
 oppose


who
 was
 an
 incredibly
 polarizing
 figure


in
 Ontario
 political
 history.


>> Did
 that
 make
 the
 job
 more
 invigorating


for
 you?


Um,


in
 some
 ways
 he
 was
 a
 formidable
 folk,


right?
 He
 had


um
 tapped
 into
 um
 a
 vein


in
 Ontario
 post
 um
 the
 Bob
 Ray
 years
 and


people
 were
 um
 certainly
 at
 the
 outset


were
 more
 of
 the
 view
 that
 maybe
 the


best
 government
 is
 the
 least
 government.


Maybe
 if
 you
 just
 allow
 us
 to
 keep
 more


of
 our
 tax
 money
 and
 make
 our
 own
 way
 in


life
 um
 that's
 what
 we're
 looking
 for


right
 now.
 I
 had
 a
 different
 philosophy,


ideology,
 um,
 and,
 um,
 based
 on
 the


notion
 that
 we're
 at
 our
 best
 when
 we
 do


things
 together.


>> He
 said
 something
 to
 you
 during
 one


particularly
 tough
 exchange
 during


question
 period.
 I
 have
 to
 say
 this.
 I


think
 your
 father
 would
 be
 embarrassed


to
 see
 you
 stand
 here
 day
 after
 day


after
 day
 in
 the
 gutter
 ruining
 ruining


the
 reputation
 of
 your
 father
 and
 your


>> How
 did
 you
 take
 that?
 Not
 well.
 Did
 you


ever
 talk
 to
 him
 about
 it
 afterwards?


No,
 I
 never
 did.
 I
 just
 let
 it
 I
 let
 it


pass
 by.
 Julius
 Caesar


2,000
 years
 ago


once
 said,
 "Nobody
 has
 ever
 successfully


consulted
 their
 reason
 and
 their
 passion


at
 the
 same
 time."


Or
 as
 my
 mother
 would
 say,
 "You
 can't
 be


smart
 and
 angry,
 Mick.
 Which
 one
 do
 you


want
 to
 be?"


Okay.
 So,
 um
 I
 tried
 to
 be
 smart,
 right?


And
 tried
 not
 to
 get
 uh
 lured
 into
 these


um
 personal
 combats.
 It
 wasn't
 always


successful


uh
 and
 probably
 over
 time
 I
 may
 have


even
 launched
 a
 few
 of
 my
 own


uh
 which
 I
 would
 have
 subsequently


regretted.
 I
 think
 we
 are
 at
 less
 than


our
 best
 when
 we
 stoop
 to
 those
 kinds
 of


things.
 Your
 first
 election
 as
 leader
 is


1999
 and
 as
 I
 think
 about
 it
 was
 a
 lot


like
 the
 last
 federal
 election
 we
 just


had
 in
 this
 country.
 You
 got
 40%
 of
 the


vote
 which
 on
 most
 days
 of
 the
 week
 is


enough
 to
 win
 a
 majority
 government.


They
 ran
 ads
 against
 you
 saying
 he's
 not


up
 to
 the
 job.
 Yep.


>> Were
 they
 right?
 Um
 I
 was
 certainly
 much


better
 prepared
 for
 my
 second
 provincial


election
 as
 leader.
 I
 was
 um
 learning
 on


the
 fly.
 Some
 days
 I
 felt
 like
 I
 was


just
 hanging
 on.


Uh
 but
 uh
 you
 know
 where
 I
 kind
 of
 felt


I
 turned
 the
 corner
 after
 the
 debate


which
 I
 felt
 I
 did
 not
 do
 particularly


well
 in
 but
 I
 felt
 Steve
 oddly


liberated.


I
 thought
 I
 have
 nothing
 to
 lose
 now.


And
 then
 my
 big
 learning
 from
 that
 loss


was
 that


in
 an
 election,
 as
 in
 public
 life


generally,
 conviction
 counts.
 Stop


trying
 to
 tell
 people
 what
 you
 think


they
 want
 to
 hear.


Act
 as
 a
 leader
 and
 tell
 them
 what
 you


think
 they
 need
 to
 hear.
 They
 may
 like


it
 and
 they
 may
 not
 like
 it.
 What's


important
 is
 that
 you
 are
 honest
 with


them.
 I
 like
 to
 say
 you
 got
 to
 worry


about
 what
 people
 think
 about
 you,
 but


you
 got
 to
 worry
 even
 more
 about
 what


you
 think
 about
 you.


>> Did
 you
 and
 Premier
 Harris
 have
 a
 kind


of
 a
 private
 call
 after
 the
 election
 was


over?


>> We
 did.
 Do
 you
 remember?


>> We
 did.


>> Anything
 that
 was
 said
 in
 that
 call?


>> Yeah.
 He
 was
 kind.


>> What'd
 he
 say?


>> He
 said,
 if
 I
 can
 recall,
 um,


hang
 in
 there.
 I've
 been
 there.


I
 remember
 you
 telling
 me
 this
 many


years
 ago,
 which
 is
 why
 I
 asked
 the


question.


>> Yeah.


>> Because
 my
 recollection
 was
 he
 said
 to


you,
 you
 know,
 you're
 going
 to
 be
 a
 much


better
 candidate
 next
 time
 out.


>> Yeah.
 So,
 hang
 in
 there.


>> Right.
 Right.


>> Did
 I
 mean
 that's
 not
 the
 kind
 of
 call
 I


would
 have
 expected
 Mike
 Harris
 to
 make


to
 a
 guy
 he'd
 just
 defeated.


>> Yeah.
 With
 glee.


>> But
 he
 did.


>> Yeah.
 He
 did.
 He
 did.


>> Uh
 2002,
 he
 steps
 down.
 Ernie
 Ees
 takes


over,
 calls
 an
 election
 for
 October
 2nd,


2003.
 You
 have
 been
 an
 MPP
 at
 this
 point


for
 13
 years.
 You
 have
 been
 the
 leader


of
 your
 party
 for
 seven.
 How
 are
 you


feeling
 going
 into
 that
 campaign?


>> Feeling
 good.


Feeling
 good.
 uh
 not
 only
 in
 terms
 of


how
 I
 felt
 I
 was
 going
 to
 be
 stronger
 as


a
 campaigner,
 Steve,
 I
 felt
 I
 had
 um


amassed
 an
 arsenal
 of
 really
 good
 ideas


and
 I
 had
 spent
 you
 know
 the
 the
 the
 um


being
 leader
 of
 the
 opposition
 is
 a


terrible
 job
 as
 you
 mentioned.
 Uh
 but
 it


also
 affords
 you
 the
 luxury
 of
 taking


time.
 I
 had
 traveled
 to
 Ireland
 to
 look


at
 the
 the
 uh
 the
 Celtic
 tiger,
 the


Irish
 economic
 turnaround
 miracle.
 What


the
 hell
 was
 that
 all
 about?
 What
 did


they
 do
 and
 how'
 they
 do
 it?
 And
 then
 I


went
 to
 the
 UK
 and
 looked
 at
 u
 Tony


Blair
 and
 what
 they
 were
 doing
 and
 why


that
 was
 working
 so
 well.
 And
 then
 I


looked
 at,
 you
 know,
 the
 internet
 was


finally
 kicking
 around.
 Looked
 at
 other


other
 um
 experiences
 across
 the
 world.


So,
 I
 felt
 I
 was
 coming
 to
 the
 table


with
 um
 um
 some
 great
 plans
 and
 a
 and
 a


strong
 vision
 for
 what
 Ontario
 could
 be.


>> There
 was
 a
 moment
 in
 the
 campaign
 when


the
 PC
 party
 put
 out
 a
 press
 release


calling
 you
 an
 evil
 reptilian
 kitten


eater
 from
 another
 planet.
 You're


laughing
 now,
 but
 your
 campaign
 reacted


with
 fury
 when
 that
 came
 out.
 How
 did


you
 react
 to
 it?


I
 thought
 I
 thought
 it
 was
 u


I
 thought
 it
 was
 I
 thought
 it
 was
 funny.


I
 thought
 it
 was
 funny.
 And
 you
 know


what
 I
 did?
 I
 was
 I
 I
 didn't
 vent


um
 at
 a
 farm


shortly
 after
 this
 happened.
 I
 was
 in
 a


barn.


There
 was
 a
 stray
 kitten
 making
 its
 way


across.
 I
 thought,
 "Do
 I
 pick
 this
 thing


up?
 What
 if
 it
 scratches
 my
 face?"


Right?
 There's
 a
 bit
 of
 risk
 here.


Anyway,
 I
 picked
 the
 thing
 up.
 It
 was


extremely
 cuddly
 and
 I
 gave
 I
 gave
 him
 a


picture
 which
 um
 was
 well
 shared
 um
 in


uh
 in
 Ontario
 by
 Ontarians.
 So,
 yeah,


it's
 you
 know,
 these
 things
 happen.
 It


was
 silly.
 I
 I
 saw
 it
 as
 more
 of
 of
 a
 u


they
 kind
 of
 gave
 me
 um
 a
 bit
 of
 an


opportunity,
 right?
 It
 was
 it
 was
 so


silly
 a
 a
 criticism.
 Um
 and
 then
 that


kitten
 uh
 presented
 itself.
 So,
 I
 kind


of
 I
 was
 able
 to
 kind
 of
 tie
 a
 bow.


>> And
 for
 the
 record,
 you
 did
 not
 eat
 the


cat.


>> I
 did
 not
 eat
 the
 cat.
 Patted
 it
 and


then
 put
 it
 down.


>> Just
 checking.
 Okay.


>> What
 do
 you
 remember
 from
 election
 night


when
 you
 won
 46%
 of
 the
 total
 vote,
 72


seats,
 and
 the
 first
 Liberal
 majority


government
 since
 1987?


>> Well,
 just
 feeling
 really
 good,
 very


proud.
 I
 felt
 very
 grateful.
 And
 but,


you
 know,
 because
 it's
 kind
 of
 the


McGinty
 way,
 this
 is
 the
 way
 my
 dad
 used


to
 react
 to
 these
 kinds
 of
 things.
 I


also
 began
 thinking
 immediately
 now
 we


got
 to
 deliver.


So
 um
 I
 immediately
 began
 to
 turn
 my


mind
 to
 what
 what
 kind
 of
 a
 a
 construct


we
 need
 to
 put
 in
 place
 in
 order
 to


ensure
 that
 I
 got
 the
 best
 out
 of
 my
 my


people
 whoever
 those
 might
 be.
 The
 first


really
 tough
 moment
 in
 your
 premiership


uh
 came
 when
 you
 realized
 that
 if
 you


were
 going
 to
 keep
 all
 the
 promises
 you


made
 about
 healthcare
 and
 education
 and


reinvesting
 in
 the
 system,
 you
 were


going
 to
 have
 to
 break
 your
 pledge
 not


to
 raise
 taxes,
 which
 you
 had
 famously


looked
 into
 the
 camera
 and
 said,


>> "I'm
 telling
 Ontario
 families


that
 their
 taxes
 will
 not
 go
 up
 tomorrow


or
 any
 day
 under
 Liberal
 government."


give
 us
 some
 sense
 about
 how
 you
 and


your
 team
 weighed
 those
 options
 about


whether


to
 break
 the
 health
 and
 education


promises
 about
 reinvesting
 in
 the
 system


or
 do
 I
 break
 my
 promise
 not
 to
 raise


taxes,


>> right?
 Yeah.
 Okay,
 let's
 just
 back
 off


for
 a
 moment.


So,
 the
 uh
 Ontario
 Taxpayers
 Federation,


I
 think
 it
 was,
 uh
 wanted
 me
 to
 sign
 a


pledge,
 and
 you
 did.
 And
 I
 did
 in
 a


flourish
 a
 big
 it
 was
 a
 big
 pledge
 on


TV.


Now
 before
 I
 did
 that,
 of
 course,
 uh
 I


said
 to
 my
 team,
 are
 we
 sure
 um
 that
 we


can
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 the
 um
 economic


wherewithal
 to
 make
 the
 kinds
 of


investments
 that
 we
 want
 to
 make
 to


restore
 health
 and
 vitality
 to
 our


public
 services,
 i.e.
 healthcare
 and


education.
 They
 said,
 "No
 worries.
 We're


all
 over
 this.
 We've
 had
 independent


economists
 take
 a
 look
 at
 this.
 It's
 all


good."
 I
 said,
 "Okay,
 great.


So
 I
 get
 in
 the
 government
 couple
 days


later
 the
 uh
 u
 senior
 bureaucrats
 say


premier
 we
 need
 we
 need
 to
 let
 you
 in
 on


something.
 I
 said
 yeah
 what
 is
 that?


Well
 you're
 running
 close
 to
 a
 $6


billion
 deficit.


>> So
 you
 know
 I
 kind
 of
 went
 into
 a
 shock.


>> Can
 I
 push
 back
 on
 that
 right
 now?


>> Yeah.


>> Because
 you
 had
 a
 very
 smart
 finance


critic
 named
 Jerry
 Phillips
 who
 used
 to


write
 his
 own
 newsletter
 about
 the
 state


of
 the
 province's
 finances.


>> And
 in
 that
 newsletter


>> Yeah.
 He
 forecast
 a
 five
 and
 a
 half
 to6


billion
 dollar
 deficit.
 So
 you
 tell
 me


you
 were
 in
 shock.


>> Yeah.


>> He
 wasn't.
 Okay.
 Why
 were
 you?


>> Well,
 I
 don't
 recall
 Jerry's
 um
 uh


prediction,
 but
 I
 do
 recall
 independent


economists
 telling
 us
 we
 were
 going
 to


be
 okay.


So,
 um,
 I've
 learn
 so
 I
 kind
 of
 I
 had
 to


grapple
 with
 this,
 you
 know,
 this
 um
 um


huge
 challenge
 and
 and
 and
 it
 taught
 me


a
 few
 things.
 One
 is
 um
 if
 you
 have
 to


swallow
 a
 toad,


>> don't
 stare
 at
 it
 for
 too
 long.


>> All right.
 It's,
 you
 know,
 do
 it
 all
 at


once.


>> You're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 Yeah.
 If
 the


other
 expression
 in
 politics
 is
 if
 you


know
 you're
 going to
 go
 there,
 go
 there.


Don't
 get
 dragged
 there
 kicking
 and


screaming.
 do
 what
 you
 have
 to
 do
 in
 a


way
 that
 is
 assertive
 of
 what
 you


believe
 we
 need
 to
 do
 under
 the


circumstances.


So
 my
 choices
 were
 to
 um


reneg
 on
 my
 promise
 to
 invest
 in


healthcare
 and
 education
 or
 reneg
 on
 my


promise
 not
 to
 raise
 taxes.
 I
 decided
 to


go
 with
 uh
 raising
 taxes
 which
 I
 did.
 We


called
 it
 a
 uh
 health
 premium.
 It
 was
 a


tax
 hike.
 Um,
 and
 we
 uh
 dedicate
 all


that
 money
 to
 health
 care
 in
 fairness


and
 we
 made
 um
 massive
 investments
 in


healthcare
 and
 education
 over
 the
 next


four
 years.
 Now,
 I
 might
 as
 well
 have


given
 my
 um
 um
 opposition
 and
 the
 media


a
 2x4
 so
 that
 they
 could
 hit
 me
 about


the
 head
 and
 shoulders
 for
 the
 next
 four


years,
 which
 they
 happily
 did.


>> They
 did.


>> Right.


>> Mhm.


>> And
 then
 I
 got
 another
 majority.
 If


you're
 doing
 something
 for
 the
 right


reason
 that
 you
 honestly
 believe
 is
 the


right
 reason,
 right,
 and
 it's
 not
 easy


and
 it's
 not
 convenient
 and
 it
 may
 not


even
 be
 popular.
 If
 you
 take
 the
 time
 to


explain
 that,
 and
 we
 did
 that
 over
 the


ensuing
 uh,
 you
 know,
 three
 or
 four


years,
 then
 you
 will
 um
 discover
 that


people
 are
 more
 understanding
 than
 you


might
 otherwise
 have
 thought.
 Just
 for


fun,
 I'm
 going
 to
 push
 back
 a
 little
 bit


on
 this
 because
 I
 recall
 June
 9th,
 2007,


you
 and
 your
 future
 opponent,
 John
 Tory,


who
 was
 leading
 the
 PC
 party
 at
 the


time,
 were
 dead
 even
 in
 the
 polls.


>> And
 then
 he
 came
 out
 with
 the


faith-based
 funding
 promise
 to
 give


public
 money
 to
 all
 faiths,
 not
 just
 the


Catholic
 faith,
 for
 their
 education


systems,
 right?
 And
 that's
 when
 the


polls
 went
 like
 that
 and
 you
 pulled


ahead.


>> So,
 yes,
 you
 stuck
 with
 your
 conviction.


You
 were
 blunt
 with
 people.
 You're


honest
 about
 the
 way
 you
 thought
 you


needed
 to
 go
 back
 on
 the
 tax
 hike


promise.


>> You
 got
 really
 lucky,
 too.
 Somebody
 made


an
 ill-advised
 promise
 and
 you
 got


lucky.


>> Is
 that
 fair
 to
 say?


>> Yep.
 Yeah.
 I
 think
 there's
 sure
 there's


there's
 some
 truth
 to
 that.
 Uh,
 Steve,


but
 I
 also
 think
 that
 um
 I
 wasn't
 in
 the


eyes
 of
 Ontarians,
 in
 the
 eyes
 of
 the


electorate,
 fatally
 flawed
 for
 having


broken
 that
 uh
 promiser.


>> Your
 government
 created
 the
 green
 belt.


So,
 I
 want
 to
 ask
 a
 couple
 of
 questions


about
 that.
 This
 is
 the
 swath
 of
 land


all
 the
 way
 from
 the
 Oakg's
 marine
 just


north
 of
 Toronto
 around
 the
 Golden


Horseshoe
 all
 the
 way
 to
 Niagara
 Falls.


It
 was
 an
 historic
 decision
 of
 the
 time.


Why
 do
 it
 knowing
 that
 you
 were
 going
 to


get
 into
 a
 whole
 heap
 of
 trouble
 with
 a


lot
 of
 developers
 and
 home
 potential


home
 buyers,
 right,


>> who
 wanted
 to
 build
 and
 buy
 homes
 on


that
 land,


>> right?
 If
 you
 visit
 places
 like
 London


and
 Paris
 and
 Madrid
 and
 New
 York,


nobody
 there
 is
 complaining
 that


previous
 generations
 set
 aside
 too
 much


green
 space.


So
 I
 think
 I
 felt
 a
 certain


accountability
 to
 generations
 yet
 to


come


and
 I
 thought
 we
 need
 to
 be
 bold.
 We


need
 be
 need
 to
 be
 ambitious
 uh
 on


behalf
 of
 of
 future
 generations


so
 that
 they'll
 have
 some
 green
 space
 to


enjoy
 um
 in
 days
 in
 days
 to
 come.


>> But
 when
 the
 rich
 developers
 who
 often


gave
 money
 to
 your
 party
 came
 to
 you
 and


said,
 "Get
 my
 bloody
 land
 out
 of
 the


green
 belt.
 I
 want
 to
 build
 there."


>> Yeah.


>> How
 did
 you
 push
 back
 on
 that?


>> I
 get
 it.
 No,
 I
 understand
 it.
 and
 and


you
 know
 there
 are
 are
 um
 there
 are


always
 going
 to
 be
 pressing
 immediate


financial
 imperatives


and
 the
 responsibility
 of
 leadership
 is


to
 weigh
 those
 against
 um
 other


responsibilities
 and
 other


accountabilities.
 So
 we
 set
 this
 up.


It's
 the
 biggest
 urban
 greens
 green
 belt


um
 in
 the
 world.


They
 came
 to
 me
 originally
 and
 said,


"Here's
 a
 proposal
 for
 600,000
 acres."


And
 I
 said,


"Let's
 take
 a
 look
 at
 this
 now
 and
 let's


let's
 consult
 some
 people
 and
 see
 how
 we


might
 make
 it
 bigger."
 And
 we
 we
 we
 got


it
 to
 1.8
 million
 acres.


>> Okay.
 Let
 me
 circle
 back
 to
 the
 2007


election.
 Now,
 we
 talked
 about
 John
 Tori


and
 the
 faith-based
 funding
 promise.


>> When
 that
 promise
 came
 out,
 and
 as
 I


say,
 you
 two
 were
 tied
 in
 the
 polls
 when


that
 promise
 came
 out,
 and
 then
 the
 you


know
 what
 hit
 the
 fan
 for
 him.
 The
 only


issue
 with
 any
 traction,
 it
 seemed,
 was


faith-based
 funding,
 and
 eventually
 John


Tory
 backed
 off.


>> They
 said
 it
 turned
 out
 to
 be
 more


divisive
 than
 I
 thought.
 Uh,
 the
 depth


of
 feelings
 was
 very
 strong
 and
 so
 I


listened
 to
 the
 people.
 Did
 you


immediately
 understand
 that
 that
 was
 an


opening
 for
 you?


>> Probably
 not
 at
 the
 outset.
 The
 concern


I
 had
 was
 as
 I
 thought
 about
 it
 is
 that


the
 theory
 behind
 publicly
 funded


education
 is
 that
 uh
 we
 bring
 all
 our


kids
 from
 all
 backgrounds,
 all


socioeconomic
 circumstances,
 all


religions
 together
 so
 that
 they
 can


learn
 from
 each
 other
 and
 grow
 together.


>> I
 remember
 you
 making
 speeches
 during


that
 campaign
 and
 you
 went
 to
 a


Catholic,
 you
 know,
 school
 system
 when


you
 were
 a
 kid.


>> Yeah.
 Did
 you
 I
 mean
 when
 the
 words
 came


out
 of
 your
 mouth,
 did
 you
 realize
 I


might
 be
 sounding
 a
 bit
 hypocritical


here?


>> Well,
 that's
 our
 constitutional
 reality.


Um
 would
 we


rebuild
 a


um


two
 school
 system


for
 our
 Ontario
 education
 um
 if
 we
 had


to
 do
 it
 over
 from
 scratch
 today?
 I
 I
 I


don't
 know
 if
 we
 would.
 I
 I
 don't
 think


we
 would,
 but
 it's
 our
 reality.
 But
 I


can
 say
 that
 knowing
 what
 I
 know
 of
 the


Catholic
 schools
 today,
 you're
 going
 to


find
 all
 kinds
 of
 face
 now
 going
 to
 into


our
 Catholic
 schools.


>> Yeah.


>> You
 won
 a
 second
 consecutive
 majority


government
 on
 the
 10th
 of
 October
 2007.


Did
 you
 know
 at
 the
 time
 you
 were
 the


first
 Liberal
 premier
 in
 70
 years
 to
 win


back-to-back
 majorities?


>> No,
 I
 didn't
 think
 about
 those
 things.


>> Thank
 you,
 Ontario.
 My
 friends,
 those


are
 the
 first
 words
 of
 the
 next
 four


years.


>> Now
 that
 you
 know
 it,
 how
 cool
 do
 you


think
 it
 is?


>> You
 were
 probably
 the
 guy
 that
 told
 me


about
 it
 because
 you
 pay
 attention
 to


those
 things.
 Um
 I
 thought
 it
 was
 it
 was


uh
 it
 was
 it
 was
 great,
 right?
 And
 I
 I


felt
 for
 my
 uh
 team
 and
 uh
 yeah,
 sure,


you
 know,
 um
 I'm
 the
 leader
 of
 the
 party


and
 I'm
 the
 head
 of
 the
 government.
 Um


but
 you're
 only
 as
 good
 as
 your
 team.


and
 I
 had
 a
 strong
 team
 and
 I
 worked


hard
 to
 get
 the
 best
 um
 out
 of
 my
 team.


And
 uh
 to
 hearken
 back
 to,
 you
 know,
 one


of
 the
 early
 life
 experiences,
 you
 know,


my
 dad
 6'4,
 240
 pounds,
 PhD,
 kind
 of,


you
 know,
 um
 towering
 over
 us
 at
 the


dinner
 table.
 And
 one
 of
 one
 of
 the


lessons
 he
 would
 offer,
 he
 says,
 "Kids,


I
 want
 you
 to
 remember
 something.
 Nobody


here
 is
 as
 strong
 as
 all
 of
 us.
 Nobody


here's
 as
 smart
 as
 all
 of
 us.
 So,
 we're


here
 today
 and
 we're
 talking
 a
 lot
 about


my
 leadership
 and
 my
 premiership


uh
 and
 what
 I
 did,
 but
 the
 truth
 of
 the


matter
 is,
 and
 I'm
 not
 saying
 this
 to


be,
 you
 know,
 uh
 unduly,
 um
 modest


>> modest,
 I
 had
 a
 great
 team
 and
 I
 stood


on
 their
 shoulders
 and
 you
 know,
 if
 I


ever
 thought,
 for
 example,
 that
 um
 I
 was


I
 was
 meeting
 with
 foreign
 dignitaries


maybe
 here
 in
 my
 office
 and
 I
 thought


for
 a
 moment,
 I
 may
 be
 the
 best
 vers
 on


this
 subject
 right
 now
 in
 this
 room.
 I


thought
 to
 myself,
 Ontarians
 are
 now
 in


deep
 trouble
 because
 they're
 relying
 on


this
 brain
 alone.


So,
 I
 I
 really
 worked
 hard
 to
 um


leverage
 collective
 uh
 wisdom.
 Your


third
 election,
 October
 6,
 2011,
 was
 in


some
 respects
 the
 most
 fascinating
 one


because
 of
 course
 you
 came
 one
 seat


short
 of
 a
 third
 consecutive
 majority


government.
 And
 I
 wonder
 at
 what
 point


does
 the
 premier
 of
 the
 day
 stop
 asking


himself
 the
 question,
 damn
 it
 all,
 if


only
 we
 could
 have
 won
 one
 more
 seat,


how
 different
 that
 third
 term
 might
 have


been.


>> Yeah,
 it's
 amazing.
 It's
 amazing,
 Steve.


And
 I
 recall
 talking
 to
 um
 Steven


Harper.
 He
 said,
 "Too
 bad
 you
 didn't


have
 the
 minority
 first."


I
 didn't
 understand
 how
 challenging
 I


didn't
 really
 understand
 how
 challenging


a
 minority
 government
 was
 going
 to
 be.


>> You'd
 never
 been
 part
 of
 one.


>> I'd
 never
 been
 part
 of
 one.
 Right.
 There


was
 the
 Ray
 years,
 the
 Harris
 years,
 my


first
 two
 governments.
 It
 was
 like,
 you


know,
 easy
 breezy,
 smooth
 sailing
 here,


right?
 You
 want
 something,
 then
 you
 get


it
 done.
 We
 got
 the
 numbers.


So,
 uh,
 talk
 about
 a
 cold
 shower.
 Um,
 I


quickly
 came
 to
 understand
 how
 and
 it


was
 not
 just
 the
 the
 um
 uh
 the
 the
 um


the
 the
 parliamentary
 rules,
 but
 the


opposition
 was
 sick
 of
 me.
 They
 were


sick
 of
 me.
 I'd
 been
 around.
 They
 had


won
 two
 in
 a
 row,
 two
 big
 majorities
 in


a
 row.
 They
 thought,
 okay,
 you
 know,


it's
 time
 for
 a
 change
 up
 here,
 right?


It's
 time
 for
 me
 to
 sit
 over
 there
 and


McGinty
 to
 sit
 ideally
 elsewhere
 outside


of
 this
 place.
 So
 um
 yeah,
 we
 didn't


have
 the
 best
 um
 kind
 of
 a
 emotional


platform
 upon
 which
 to
 build
 um
 warm
 and


fuzzy
 relationships.


>> I
 I
 like
 to
 note
 in
 history
 as
 well
 that


by
 winning
 three
 in
 a
 row,
 you're
 the


most
 successful
 liberal
 premier
 since


Oliver
 Mitt
 in
 the
 19th
 century.
 Yeah.


>> Did
 you
 know
 that
 as
 well
 at
 the
 time?


>> Once
 you
 told
 me.


>> Seriously,
 you
 didn't
 know
 that
 before


then?


>> No.
 Really?


>> Okay.
 Yeah.


What
 did
 one
 seat
 short
 of
 a
 majority


mean
 though
 in
 terms
 of
 your
 ability
 to


get
 whatever
 program
 you
 wanted
 to


through
 the
 house?
 It
 was
 hell.
 It
 was


hell.
 Like
 from
 budgets
 to
 committees,


right?
 It
 meant
 that
 the
 opposition
 was


by
 and
 large
 in
 charge
 and
 any
 progress


we
 wanted
 to
 make
 uh
 required
 the


support
 of
 somebody
 on
 the
 other
 side.


So
 it
 became
 uh
 slow
 and


frustrating.


There
 was
 um
 a
 lot
 of
 animosity.


Um
 we
 were
 at
 you
 know
 I
 think
 I
 would


say
 in
 fairness
 as
 a
 group
 all
 all
 the


members
 of
 provincial
 parliament
 we
 were


at
 less
 than
 our
 best
 in
 terms
 of
 making


progress
 uh
 for
 Ontarians.


Um
 and
 um
 so
 I
 I
 you
 know
 that
 that
 was


my
 reality
 and
 so
 we
 just
 worked
 as
 hard


as
 we
 could
 to
 find
 a
 way
 to
 you
 know
 we


got
 a
 budget
 through
 at
 the
 outset.
 I


think
 one
 of
 the
 things
 that
 the


expectations
 that
 in
 order
 to
 secure
 the


support
 of
 the
 NDP
 they
 wanted
 a
 um
 tax


on
 the
 wealthiest
 Ontarians
 which
 we
 u


put
 in
 place.
 Uh
 and
 then
 it
 was
 kind
 of


a
 um
 you
 know
 uh
 kind
 of
 an
 a


an
 asis
 basis
 to
 see
 what
 you
 could
 get


tabled
 in
 the
 house
 pass
 through


committee
 and
 then
 eventually
 become
 you


know
 law.
 So
 it
 was
 is
 a
 lot
 of
 work.


>> You
 will
 be
 disappointed
 if
 I
 don't


raise
 a
 few
 of
 the
 difficult
 times
 that


you
 had.
 I


>> think
 I
 got
 to
 go
 now
 Steve.


>> No
 not
 yet.
 Not
 yet.
 got
 comfortable.
 In


fact,
 because
 I
 do
 want
 to
 put
 a
 few
 of


them
 on
 the
 record
 here.


>> There
 was
 a
 problem
 around
 e-
 health


where
 certain
 corners
 were
 cut
 in
 order


to
 create
 a
 digitized
 health
 record


system.
 Your
 health
 minister
 resigned


over
 that
 one.
 There
 was
 the
 orange
 air


ambulance
 problem
 where
 they
 were


engaging
 in
 some
 questionable
 spending


and
 business
 practices.
 Your
 favorite


without
 question
 was
 the
 two
 gas
 plants


that
 you
 ended
 up
 cancelling
 in
 Oakville


and
 Missaga,
 but
 whose
 contracts


>> ultimately
 um
 had
 to
 be
 paid
 out
 and


therefore
 at
 considerable
 expense
 those


plants
 were
 cancelled.


>> I
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 relitigate
 all
 those


issues
 and
 go
 through
 chapter
 and
 verse.


But
 I
 but
 I
 am
 interested
 in
 the
 bigger


question
 which
 is
 when
 a
 premier
 is
 in


the
 midst
 of
 scandal
 and
 every
 day
 he
 or


she
 comes
 to
 office


the
 papers
 are
 awful,
 the
 opposition
 is


awful,
 you
 can't
 get
 away
 from
 it.
 What


are
 the
 lessons
 one
 takes
 away
 from


succeeding
 under
 those
 circumstances?


So
 um
 there
 are
 a
 few
 thousand
 agencies,


boards
 and
 commissions
 for
 which


governments
 of
 all
 stripes
 are


responsible.
 If
 you
 take
 your
 eye
 off


those
 things,
 uh
 they
 can
 come
 back
 and


bite
 you.
 And
 that's
 what
 happened
 with


e-
 health
 uh
 and
 with
 orange
 and
 with


the
 OPA
 when
 it
 came
 to
 locating
 gas


plants.
 Do
 I
 bear
 responsibility
 for


those?
 Of
 course.
 That's
 how
 our


democracy
 works.
 those
 boards
 are


ultimately
 accountable
 to
 me,
 my


government,
 our
 cabinet.
 So,
 yeah,


that's
 the
 challenge
 though
 is
 you've


got
 so
 many
 you
 got
 so
 many
 balls
 in
 the


air
 uh
 that
 it's
 just
 a
 matter
 of
 time.


I
 don't
 care
 who
 you
 are
 uh
 what
 your


political
 stripe
 is,
 at
 some
 point
 in


time


there's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 slip.
 And
 I
 think


the
 issue
 is
 not
 whether
 there's
 going


to
 be
 a
 slip,
 it's
 how
 you
 react
 uh
 when


there
 is
 that
 slip.


>> Let
 me
 ask
 about
 that.
 Did
 you
 ever
 come


into
 the
 office
 one
 day
 and
 look
 at
 your


team
 on
 maybe
 day
 87
 of
 the
 gas
 plant


scandal
 and
 say,
 you
 know,
 guys,
 what


the
 hell
 are
 we
 doing
 here?
 Can
 we


please
 get
 our
 act
 together?
 And
 like,


did
 you
 lose
 your
 you
 know
 what
 with
 the


with
 the
 team?


>> I'm
 not
 a
 screamer.
 I'm
 not
 a
 screamer,


Steve.
 You
 know,
 um
 I
 might
 have,
 you


know,
 um
 undoubtedly
 pulled
 together
 my


senior
 team
 and
 said,
 "Hey,
 you
 know,


are
 we
 are
 we
 going
 to
 are
 we
 going
 to


drown
 in
 this
 forever?
 I
 mean,
 uh
 is


there
 any
 Does
 anybody
 here
 see
 land?


Are
 we
 are
 we
 gonna
 get
 out
 of
 this
 body


of
 water
 and
 dry
 off
 at
 some
 point
 in


time?
 These
 things
 come
 and
 go.
 Um
 and


I'm
 not
 trying
 to
 diminish
 their


importance.
 Uh
 but
 they
 are
 part
 of
 a


healthy,
 vibrant,
 dynamic
 democracy.


And
 um
 uh
 and
 people
 the
 opposition
 has


right
 and
 indeed
 the
 obligation
 to
 point


out
 shortcomings.
 No
 government
 is
 going


to
 do
 things
 perfectly.
 Ideally,
 they're


going
 to
 do
 some
 good
 things.
 uh
 and
 the


public
 uh
 is
 entitled
 to
 see
 um
 you
 know


the
 government
 being
 held
 to
 account.


>> How
 does
 though
 how
 does
 the
 first


minister
 show
 up
 for
 work
 every
 day
 when


you
 can't
 get
 away
 from
 it?
 It's
 in
 the


papers
 all
 the
 time.
 People
 are
 yelling


at
 you
 presumably
 at
 protests
 and


demonstrations,


>> right?


>> How
 how
 do
 you
 keep
 your
 sense
 of
 sanity


under
 those
 circumstances?


>> Um
 for
 me,
 it's
 just
 a
 strong
 sense
 of


duty.


>> It's
 your
 job.
 You
 signed
 on
 for
 it.


There
 going
 to
 be
 some
 easy
 days.
 There


going
 to
 be
 some
 hard
 days.
 Uh
 you
 can't


just


sign
 on
 for
 sunshine.
 They're
 going
 to


be
 there
 going
 to
 be
 storms
 on
 occasion.


And
 I
 think
 the
 other
 thing,
 Steve,
 is


um
 I
 also
 took
 a
 lot
 of
 pride
 in


um
 what
 we
 were
 able
 to
 achieve.
 Um
 we


we
 were
 said
 to
 have
 the
 best
 schools
 in


the
 OECD.
 We
 had
 we've
 gone
 we
 went
 from


Canada's
 longest
 healthc
 care
 way
 times


to
 its
 shortest
 healthcare
 way
 times.
 We


found
 family
 doctors
 for
 1.2
 million


more
 Ontarians.
 We
 adopted
 the
 HST,


right?
 That
 was
 that
 was
 said
 to
 be
 the


third
 rail.
 You
 touched
 that
 one,


McGinty,
 you're
 dead.


>> You're
 the
 only
 guy,
 I
 think,
 who


brought
 in
 that
 kind
 of
 tax
 reform
 and


won
 the
 next
 election.
 Everybody
 else


lost,


>> right?
 And
 it
 saves
 still
 today,
 it


saves
 Ontario
 businesses
 over
 five


billion
 dollars
 um
 every
 year.
 You
 know,


we
 talk
 about
 the
 coal
 the
 uh
 coal


plants.
 When
 I
 left
 when
 at
 their
 worst,


Steve,
 we
 had
 52
 smog
 days
 a
 year
 in


southern
 Ontario.
 Since
 we
 shut
 down
 the


last
 one,
 we've
 had
 zero.


So,
 um,
 every
 government
 is
 going
 to


screw
 up
 from
 time
 to
 time.
 It's
 not


whether
 you
 do,
 it's
 whether
 you


acknowledge
 it
 and
 take
 steps
 to
 ensure


it
 doesn't
 recur.
 For
 example,
 just
 to


go
 back
 to
 um
 me
 changing
 my
 mind
 and


raising
 taxes
 uh
 in
 2003
 after
 I
 said
 I


I
 I
 wouldn't.


We
 we
 passed
 a
 law
 in
 Ontario
 saying


that
 the
 books
 effectively
 have
 to
 be
 uh


made
 transparent
 before
 every
 election.


That
 was
 adopted
 by
 every
 other
 province


and
 the
 federal
 government.
 Right?
 So


you
 can
 learn
 from
 these
 things
 and
 take


steps
 to
 ensure
 they
 don't
 recur.
 You


know,
 somebody
 asked
 me,
 you
 know,
 of


which


um


initiative
 are
 you
 most
 proud?


I
 think
 it
 might
 be
 full
 day


kindergarten.
 250,000
 kids
 um
 every
 year


since
 we've
 had
 that
 in
 place
 uh
 who
 are


benefiting
 from
 uh
 an
 early
 start.
 When


I
 think
 back
 of
 my
 time
 as
 leader,
 17


years
 as
 leader
 of
 my
 party,
 Jacquu
 said


that
 I'm
 the
 longest
 serving
 party


leader
 alive
 today.


>> Out
 of
 any
 party?


>> Out
 of
 any
 party.


>> Federal
 or
 provincial?


>> Yes.


>> Huh.


>> 17
 years.
 It's
 a
 long
 time.


>> Um,
 so
 it
 gives
 me
 a
 bit
 of
 depth
 of
 an


experience
 there.
 Um,
 I
 love
 the


experience.


>> I
 want
 to
 finish
 up
 with
 a
 few
 uh


personal
 questions
 if
 I
 can.


>> Starting
 with
 the
 fact
 that
 you
 are
 a


few
 weeks
 away
 from
 turning
 70,


>> right?


>> Can
 you
 believe
 it?


>> No.


>> Are
 you
 where
 you
 want
 to
 be
 for
 a


70-year-old
 person?


>> Yeah,
 I
 feel
 very
 lucky.
 I
 feel
 very


lucky.
 I've
 I've
 I've
 I've
 um


for
 me,
 Steve,
 I've
 reduced
 it
 to
 u
 six


questions.
 I
 already
 know
 that
 I'm
 going


to
 ask
 on
 my
 deathbed.


And
 those
 questions
 are
 number
 one,


was
 I
 a
 good
 son?


Number
 two,


was
 I
 a
 good
 brother?


Number
 three,


was
 I
 a
 good
 husband,


number
 four,


was
 I
 a
 good
 dad?


Number
 five,


was
 I
 there
 for
 my
 friends?
 Was
 I
 a
 good


friend?
 And
 number
 six,
 did
 I
 just


occupy
 space
 and
 consume
 goods


or
 did
 I
 make
 a
 difference
 for
 others?


>> How
 do
 you
 answer
 all
 the
 questions
 you


just
 asked?


>> Well,
 I


like
 to
 think
 I'm
 trying
 hard
 to
 be
 able


to
 answer
 a
 yes
 to
 all
 of
 those.


>> And
 interesting.
 So,
 was
 I
 a
 good


premier
 is
 not
 one
 of
 your
 questions.
 Or


does
 that
 come
 under
 the
 sixth
 question?


>> That
 would
 come
 under
 the
 sixth.


>> It
 does
 come
 under
 the
 sixth.
 Yeah.


>> What
 are
 you
 spending
 your
 time
 on
 these


days?


>> So
 I
 got
 to
 know
 myself
 again
 after


getting
 out
 of
 politics
 and
 discovered


that
 I'm
 quite
 entrepreneurial
 and
 so
 I


have
 a
 kind
 of
 buffet
 of
 things
 that
 I


like
 to
 do
 that
 I've
 been
 doing.
 Right


now
 I
 serve
 as
 chair
 of
 the
 uh


University
 of
 Ottawa
 Heart
 Institute.
 Um


I
 am
 working
 on
 developing
 a
 new
 a
 gap


year
 program
 for
 the
 city
 of
 Ottawa.


Ideally,
 it
 will
 have
 um
 spill
 over
 and


be
 adopted
 by
 other
 communities


uh
 around
 the
 country.
 I
 do
 work
 with


everything
 from
 a
 um
 an
 education


technology
 company
 to
 a
 um
 a
 heroic


machine
 company
 to
 um
 a
 cancer
 drug


development
 um
 company.
 I've
 just
 wr


written
 another
 book
 that's
 coming
 out


shortly.
 Um
 I'm
 u
 what's
 it
 called?
 the


book
 uh
 be
 a
 good
 one.


It's
 uh
 it's
 based
 on
 a
 quote
 from


Jeremy
 Bentham
 who
 once
 said,
 "Whatever


you
 are
 in
 life,
 be
 a
 good
 one."
 This


one
 is
 dedicated
 uh
 to
 politicians.


Um
 and
 maybe
 my
 most
 important


responsibility
 these
 days
 is
 um
 I'm
 a


granddad.
 I've
 got
 six
 um
 grandkids
 and


I've
 discovered,
 Steve,
 that
 the


interest
 is
 even
 sweeter
 than
 the


principal.


One
 question
 I've
 always
 wanted
 to
 ask


you
 is
 that
 there
 has
 been
 a
 kind
 of
 a


post-political
 life
 that
 many
 people


who've
 enjoyed
 the
 kind
 of
 success


you've
 had
 in
 politics
 take,
 which
 is


you
 usually
 get
 enscconced
 at
 a
 very
 big


law
 firm
 as
 a
 senior
 counsel
 and
 then


you
 go
 sit
 on
 you
 know
 whatever
 a
 dozen


different
 boards
 of
 directors
 and
 so
 on


and
 you
 get
 rich
 frankly


>> and
 you
 have
 not
 taken
 that
 path.
 Yeah,


that's
 how
 come


>> it's
 not
 well,
 you
 know,
 you
 you
 got
 to


be
 you
 got
 to
 do
 what
 what
 what


moves
 you,
 inspires
 you,
 you
 know,
 turns


your
 crank.


>> And
 so
 I
 didn't
 I
 didn't
 add
 I'm
 I'm
 a


fellow
 at
 a
 couple
 universities
 as
 well.


So
 I
 get
 to
 hang
 around
 young
 people,


get
 to
 understand
 a
 world
 that
 I
 never


grew
 up
 in.
 uh
 and
 they
 help
 teach
 me


things
 so
 I
 can
 bring
 those
 to
 bear
 in


decision-m
 that
 I
 may
 be
 making


elsewhere.
 You
 got
 to,
 you
 know,
 life
 is


short
 and
 you
 better
 do
 you
 better
 spend


it
 doing
 things
 that
 um
 you
 really


enjoy.


When
 does
 a
 premier
 stop


relitigating
 or
 rethinking
 all
 of
 the


decisions
 that
 he
 or
 she
 made


and
 think,
 you
 know,
 if
 only
 I'd
 done


this,
 I
 should
 have
 done
 that.
 Why


didn't
 I
 do
 it
 this
 way?
 Or
 do
 you
 still


do
 that
 in
 your
 own
 head?
 You
 don't
 do


that.


>> I
 don't
 do
 that.


>> I
 I
 live
 with
 what
 I
 have
 done.
 I
 draw


what
 lessons
 I
 I
 might
 from
 those.
 And


ideally,
 I'm
 able
 to
 um
 impart
 that
 to


others.
 I
 speak
 about
 leadership
 from


time
 to
 time,
 for
 example,
 especially


when
 I'm
 I'm
 uh
 working
 with
 uh
 young


people.
 I
 mentor
 young
 people,
 a
 few


business
 leaders
 as
 well.
 So
 no,
 I
 don't


look
 back
 on
 my
 any
 of
 my
 time
 in


politics
 with
 deep
 regret.
 Could
 I
 have


done
 some
 things
 better?
 Absolutely.


Who
 couldn't
 in
 any
 endeavor?
 But
 I


think
 that
 uh
 on
 the
 whole
 I
 just
 I
 feel


very
 grateful.
 I
 mean
 um
 what
 are
 there


16
 million
 people
 in
 Ontario
 now?
 15


million
 people,
 whatever
 the
 heck
 it
 is.


One
 gets
 to
 serve
 as
 premier.
 I
 got
 to


do
 that
 for
 10
 years.


It
 just
 what
 a
 privilege.
 What
 an
 honor.


Were
 there
 ups
 and
 downs?
 How
 could


there
 not
 be?


>> Let's
 finish
 on
 this.
 In
 spite
 of


everything
 and
 boy,
 you
 have
 had
 some


high
 highs
 and
 some
 low
 lows.


Would
 you
 do
 it
 again?


>> Absolutely.


because
 in
 a
 minute
 because
 it's
 you


know
 to
 be
 in
 a
 position


to
 um


you
 know
 you
 know
 what
 the
 real


privilege
 of
 of
 government
 is.


You
 get
 to
 define
 the
 public
 interest.


That's
 heady
 stuff.
 What
 do
 you
 think
 is


the
 best
 for
 all
 of
 us?
 And
 to
 be
 in
 a


position
 to
 define
 that
 and
 then
 flesh


that
 out
 and
 lend
 shape
 to
 it
 and
 put
 in


place
 policies
 to
 me
 it
 was
 so
 Steve


it's
 just
 so
 exceptionally
 rewarding


to
 have
 made
 differences
 in
 our
 schools


and
 in
 our
 healthcare
 and
 the
 quality
 of


our
 air
 and
 the
 strength
 of
 our
 economy.


Um
 that's
 where
 else
 can
 you
 do
 that


stuff?
 It's,
 you
 know,
 I
 think
 Davis


said,
 um,
 Bill
 Davis
 said


the
 best
 day
 in
 the
 private
 sector
 can't


compare
 to
 the
 worst
 day
 as
 premier.


It's
 just
 there's
 so
 I
 mean
 the
 world
 is


your
 oyster
 when
 you're
 in
 that
 office


and
 you
 can
 make
 so
 many
 changes.


>> Premier
 McGinty,
 thank
 you
 for
 your


time.


>> Pleasure,
 Steve.
