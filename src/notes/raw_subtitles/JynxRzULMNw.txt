Hello everyone, I am Anthony
Welcome to my channel
today
I want to discuss a Chinese Internet phenomenon with you.
That is the culture of rubbing shoulders
Or the culture of soft pornography
I discussed this topic with my friends a long time ago.
I thought it was very interesting at the time
But I haven't taken care of it yet
Today's video
Let's first summarize the phenomenon of this edge culture
and try to analyze the mechanism of this desire
I'm not like the average analyst.
Just point out
This is because sexual repression in Chinese society is too severe.
That's all.
This is of course true
But our focus is on
In the process of rubbing the edge
Do you feel truly satisfied?
and whether the person has misunderstood his or her desires.
It is necessary to explain in advance that
This video
There is no intention to criticize or deny this phenomenon.
Myself
Have a very tolerant and open attitude towards this
Including my video itself is also on the edge
In the previous video about sexual fantasies
We also said
All sexual fantasies themselves
They are all worthy of respect and understanding
therefore
We made this video
It is purely to explore the real needs of the parties involved.
Before the video starts, let me say
If you have anything you want to discuss with me
And consulting topics
You can contact my email to make an appointment
So let's get back to today's topic.
First we say
Edge Culture
It is a network subculture phenomenon based on sexual suggestion.
Different from traditional pornographic culture
Edge Culture
Mainly by gazing at parts of the body other than the sexual organs
or items to get pleasure
For example, women's feet, stockings
Men's Adam's apple, blue veins on their arms, etc.
In the edge culture
These parts are coded as a set of sex symbols
And formed a complex and abstract black
And these slang
must be in a specific context and community
To be decoded
In the comment section, barrage and various short video platforms
The audience recognized each other through secret codes,
To achieve carnival by making fun of others
Edge culture is not like traditional erotic works
Leading to sexual intercourse or orgasm
Instead, it always stays on the edge of foreplay, suggestion, and ambiguity
The expansion and prosperity of the borderline culture
It is the sexual repression and loneliness in reality
As
What we said in the video about early love
Restrictions and restrictions on premature love in Chinese society
Coupled with the lack of gender education
Make students in their teens
Lack of high-quality interactions with the opposite sex
With the popularization of the Internet
A wealth of information
The process of differentiation of individual personality
Start well in advance
Original interpersonal communication
Often based on similar life experiences
and a common social background
Now even in the same living environment
Due to different contact information
People will gradually develop different values,
Aesthetic standards and emotional appeal
This will result in
It is becoming increasingly difficult to find resonance in real relationships
I want to emphasize that
The Internet does not necessarily lead to loneliness and isolation of individuals
It doesn’t mean that the quality of social interaction is necessarily lower.
Many online communities in China
The reason why I cannot give it to individuals
Providing real social support
Because many people grow up
I have never experienced respect for each other's personality.
Lack of habits of communication, negotiation and equal exchange
Therefore, they form a network subculture community
It can be said
It is a projection and replica of the real Chinese society
It even magnifies the bad habits that already exist in reality.
For example, continuing to fight and oppress within a small circle
Put up big-character posters and struggle sessions online without any bottom line
Exposing each other's privacy
And all kinds of bureaucracy, hierarchy, etc.
on the other hand
The network itself is beneficial to individuals
From a wider range
Filter out
Someone who can truly resonate deeply with me
This was supposed to be a real social
Unparalleled advantages
But the threshold for this kind of screening is relatively high
Individuals need to clarify their identity
You need to be clear about your interests.
Values ​​and ideas
This actually takes time.
Carefully thought out and constructed
at the same time
Find someone who truly resonates with you.
Relying solely on simple interactions such as browsing and liking
is not enough
Individuals need to actively participate
Deeper dialogue and interaction
Use clearer and more precise language
so
Only when people with similar backgrounds and ways of thinking
Find you
But all of these require individuals to devote time,
Energy and emotion
In this context
The huge potential and advantages of the Internet in social networking
Did not work
But the atmosphere of male-female confrontation on the Internet
It exacerbates the loneliness of individuals
So in reality
The cost and difficulty of intimacy and sex
Are increasing
We say truly satisfying sexual experience
It should be a comprehensive interaction
Not only physical contact
It also includes emotional and spiritual connections
This doesn’t necessarily need to be at the soul level.
How deep is the mutual understanding?
But at least there should be basic trust and respect.
Under the pressure of reality
Sexual behavior and sexual pleasure are rapidly being symbolized
Sexuality degenerates into something consumable and de-relational
and low-risk symbolic pleasure
“Borderline Culture” just fills this position
It is a desire that satisfies
A symbolic activity that avoids the cost of reality
Individuals in it
You can express your sexual fantasies
And its anonymity and the nature of virtual interaction
It also enables individuals to
Without having to bear actual responsibility and risk
Get Satisfaction
But this symbolic pleasure and satisfaction
Lack of deep linking to objects
It relies more on momentary stimulation or short-term satisfaction
Rather than long-term emotional and physical resonance
Therefore, this kind of pleasure is also very short-lived and superficial.
That's it.
Some people might say
Any pornographic culture on the Internet has this tendency
So what are the characteristics of the edge culture?
This brings us to our second point.
That is in the edge culture
Individual desire
On the surface, it is a kind of body directed to the opposite sex.
Personal physiological desires
But in fact
This desire is not simply sexual desire
But for the recognition and attention
Social Desire
This desire
Even in many cases, it is directed towards the same sex.
Why do I say so?
We often see this phenomenon
Some male netizens would like to see a certain female blogger
Post photos of yourself showing your legs or feet
In fact, that may not be a real photo of this woman.
These male netizens may also know this
Even this female blogger
Probably not a real woman.
But many male netizens
Still feel very stimulating and excited
This level of excitement
Compared to looking at pictures on porn sites themselves
Even higher
Even if the latter exposes more parts
For example
In a WeChat group composed entirely of male friends
Spread some borderline pictures
These pictures are not necessarily very revealing
But when it becomes a group viewing behavior
It's better than watching very pornographic pictures by yourself
Even more exciting
In the process
What the parties really seek
It is not a kind of internal
Egocentric Desire
But your own desire
The process of being recognized, seen and accepted by others
The former is a more common view.
That is to say, desires are self-centered.
Individual desire is merely the pursuit of
Purely personal physiological and psychological needs
Is self-sufficient
Without the need for external reactions or recognition from others
However, this is only a superficial phenomenon
Actually
Even people's physiological needs such as eating and drinking water
In fact, there are also other people's eyes behind them.
It’s also social
We also mentioned in this video on April 13th
Hegel believes
The emergence of the self is always accompanied by the emergence of the other
Only through the recognition and interaction of others can people
To establish yourself and discover yourself
Animals also have some kind of social life
For example, there is also division of labor and cooperation within Ant.
There is even a hierarchy
But this social life of animals
Just to maintain the reproduction of the population
It has no biological
Spiritual significance
The mutual recognition of people in society
should not be considered as forced in the first place
The direct one is the essence of man
Free Will
It can only be established in social relations
Lacan's Theory of the Other
This idea was also inherited from Hegel.
It is just Lacan's view on the other
More negative and pessimistic than Hegel
In Hegel
The emergence of the other is generally a positive thing
Lacan believes that
The emergence of the small other and the big other
This leads to the alienation of the subject
The big Other is the symbolic structure of the social order
Including culture, law, morality
A set of standards including language
When we communicate with others
Our words
First, it is based on a set of recognized grammatical rules.
This set of rules is often invisible and default
But Lacan believes
Language rules alienate individuals
Because language is not created by individuals themselves
It is a system of symbols passed down by society.
Individuals are shaped by language from birth
And only through language
To interact with other individuals
But these rules
Often unconsciously alters and manipulates individual desires
Makes the individual the desire of others
Mistaken for one's true desire
Lacan believes
In the real world
Only individuals believe in the above symbol rules
And follow those rules
The big other exists
therefore
The big Other is also virtual, incorporeal and fragile
In the context of marginal culture
When netizens interact with bloggers and with other netizens
Since everyone has a set of symbol rules
Therefore, the big Other is always present
This big Other is such a symbolic order
It is a content mechanism pushed by the network platform
The signifier of desire that is repeated in the group
and the default standards of what is sexy
constituted
You might have wanted to have sex with someone of the opposite sex.
Create a personal, intimate experience
Instead of wanting to see the same old "stockings" or "Adam's apple"
But under the gaze of the big Other
Your desire is not directed to the body parts of the opposite sex
But these parts
Symbolic meaning in a particular culture and symbol system
As the classic story goes:
There is a worker
Suspected of stealing factory property
He gets off work every day
The security guard always checks his cart carefully.
But nothing was found
Because the cart is always empty.
Later they found out
The worker stole the cart itself.
This story reminds us
Behind the symbols and behaviors
There are more hidden meanings
This is also why
Male netizens are concerned about a possible untrue
Photos of female bloggers
Reasons to still feel excited
Their desire
It's not really a desire for the opposite sex's body
But through this kind of picture and interaction with others
To satisfy your desires
The need to be seen and validated
That is to confirm that one's sexual desire is gregarious.
Legitimate
The desire to be recognized
This is the deeper desire of the person involved.
Therefore, even if this blogger account is fake
But the big Other is still at work
Because the platform interface structure
The sexy characters behind the pictures
The atmosphere in the comment section where everyone is rubbing shoulders with each other
etc.
All are present
These factors
Jointly confirmed the legitimacy of the parties' desires
final
The parties agreed
Such a way of coding sexiness
Sex is symbolic sex
No need to face the real other
Just face images and short videos
Even some text will do.
Sexual satisfaction
It is reflected in the likes, collections,
Following and commenting
Misunderstanding of this Desire
In our October 20th issue
Video discussing Chinese corporate culture
Also mentioned
At that time we said
Many Chinese companies have
Sexual harassment of female subordinates by male superiors
Including sexual innuendo, teasing, flirting, and dirty jokes
And uncomfortable compliments
At many Chinese company dinners,
A regular entertainment activity for male colleagues
It was a dirty joke on the female colleagues present.
Or ask questions that seriously violate personal boundaries
This cannot be entirely attributed to
A subconscious instinctive impulse and sexual satisfaction
party
Seems to be expressing his sexual desire for women
But in fact
It is to meet the consensus of the male community
That is
Strive to conform to the behavioral norms of the male group
And through this behavior
To strengthen one's identity in the group
As we analyzed in that video
In this corporate culture
Even between male leaders and male employees
There is a profound contradiction
But in terms of attitude towards women
Often a secret consensus can be formed
That is, no matter what class differences exist
Men who agree with this logic
They all assume that they have a certain privilege to gaze at women.
Can be on the wine table
Make uncomfortable jokes
Therefore, this secret consensus
It is often an important means for leaders to ease conflicts.
Feelings of superiority and superiority over women
It has become a kind of reconciliation between these men.
Whether leaders or subordinates
They can both gaze at women together
To bring each other closer
Relieve tension between each other
At this moment
Between male leaders and male employees
It's as if I let go of the daily grudges and conflicts.
A special spiritual bond that transcends class was established
The commonality between this and the edge culture is
The parties have forgotten their real needs.
Instead accept this
The Desire Map Created by the Big Other
and mistake it for one's own likes and preferences
That's it.
I believe everyone can feel it
I have no desire for these
Make any moral criticism
Compared to judging the right or wrong of desire
The more important question is
Recognize how symbols induce
and alienate our real needs
Although alienation is inevitable
But if the symbols are exchanged and generated
Can be more refined and profound
More open and decentralized
Rather than being monopolized by a certain group or organization
Then this symbol
It can also become
Tools to promote personal freedom and individuality
That’s all for today’s video.
