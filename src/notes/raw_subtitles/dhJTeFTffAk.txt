Hey
 everybody,
 welcome
 back
 to
 the


channel.
 We
 are
 back
 on
 another
 episode


of
 the
 daily
 recap.
 We
 have
 got
 a
 bunch


to
 talk
 about
 today.
 Number
 one,
 Oracle


after
 hours
 $
 38
 billion
 debt
 offering


in
 regards
 to
 building
 out,
 you
 guessed


it,
 data
 centers.
 We're
 going
 to
 talk


about
 it,
 the
 implications
 on
 what
 it


means
 for
 those
 data
 center
 companies.


Palier
 signed
 a
 pretty
 large
 partnership


today.
 The
 estimate
 is
 potentially
 $200


million
 multi-year
 partnership
 with


Lumen.
 We're
 going
 to
 talk
 about
 that


partnership,
 what
 it
 means.
 earnings.
 We


are
 officially
 in
 earnings
 season.
 Next


week
 is
 really
 when
 we
 get
 a
 lot
 of
 the


big
 tech
 earnings,
 but
 we
 did
 have
 Tesla


yesterday.
 So,
 we're
 going
 to
 recap


Tesla,
 talk
 about
 some
 of the
 earnings


that
 have
 happened
 throughout
 uh
 the


past
 48
 hours
 along
 with
 some
 macro


stats.
 The
 basic
 argument
 here
 on


earnings
 is
 that
 it's
 looking
 like
 Q3
 is


going
 to
 be
 a
 pretty
 strong
 quarter


based
 on
 the
 earnings
 that
 we
 got
 today.


Intel
 and
 Ford,
 not
 the
 worst
 earnings


in
 the
 world.
 So,
 we
 got
 a
 lot
 to
 talk


about.
 Let's
 get
 into
 it.
 Okay,
 let's


start
 off
 with
 this
 debt
 news
 around


Oracle.
 So,
 there's
 a
 couple
 of


implications
 to
 this
 that
 I
 think
 are


really
 important.
 First
 of
 all,
 what
 is


the
 headline?
 Oracle,
 and
 this
 came
 out


really
 an
 hour
 ago
 after
 hours.
 Quite


incredible
 to
 see
 this
 uh
 is
 completing


a
 $
 38
 billion
 debt
 offering
 uh
 likely


through
 some
 version
 of
 corporate
 bonds.


They
 did
 13
 billion
 a
 month
 ago,
 and


they
 were
 giving
 out
 about
 6.5%
 on
 those


corporate
 bonds.
 We
 don't
 know
 the
 exact


rate
 on
 these
 bonds,
 but
 it
 will
 be
 23.5


billion
 towards
 a
 data
 center
 in
 Texas


and
 14.75
 billion
 to
 a
 facility
 that
 is


going
 to
 help
 a
 project
 in
 Wisconsin.


Now,
 Vantage
 Data
 Centers
 is
 the
 name
 of


the
 company
 that's
 going
 to
 be


developing
 both
 of
 the
 data
 centers,


which
 are
 set
 to
 be
 used
 by
 Oracle
 to


power
 OpenAI.
 We've
 been
 talking
 a
 lot


about
 on
 on
 this
 channel
 about
 how
 vital


Open
 AI
 is
 to
 this
 broader
 ecosystem
 and


how
 much
 OpenAI
 ultimately
 needs
 to


succeed.
 Here's
 a
 fun
 stat
 for


everybody.
 AMD,
 Nvidia,
 Broadcom,
 and


Oracle
 all
 had
 their
 market
 caps


collectively
 go
 up
 by
 $630


billion
 in
 the
 following
 days
 after
 they


announced
 their
 partnerships
 over
 the


past
 two
 months
 with
 OpenAI.
 So,
 OpenAI


obviously
 is
 integral
 to
 a
 lot
 of
 what's


going
 on.
 And
 now
 it
 looks
 like
 $
 38


billion
 is
 going
 to
 be
 financed
 by
 JP


Morgan,
 Wells
 Fargo,
 Goldman
 Sachs.
 You


have
 some
 of
 the
 Saudis
 jumping
 into


this,
 some
 of
 the
 Japanese,
 uh,
 some
 of


the
 European
 banks
 as
 well
 in
 France.


You
 have
 a
 ton
 of
 these
 different


companies
 coming
 in
 to
 say,
 "Hey,
 we


want
 to
 help
 you
 finance
 this
 overall


data
 center
 buildout."
 Now,
 two


perspectives
 on
 this.
 Let's
 do
 bullish


than
 bearish.
 Number
 one,
 bullish.
 I
 ran


Cipher,
 Terwolf,
 Bit
 Farms,
 Nebius,


Cororeweave,
 Galaxy.
 I'm
 probably


leaving
 out
 some
 data
 center
 names,
 but


whatever
 stock
 that
 you
 are
 in,


obviously
 AMD,
 Nvidia,
 Broadcom,
 if


you're
 in
 those
 data
 center
 plays,
 uh
 it


seems
 like
 the
 demand
 for
 this
 product


is
 the
 biggest
 product
 in
 the
 world
 and


it
 might
 be
 the
 biggest
 product
 in
 the


world
 forever.
 The
 demand
 for
 data


centers
 is
 insatiable.
 The
 hyperscalers


are
 financing
 it.
 The
 free
 cash
 flows


from
 the
 hypersalers
 are
 continuing
 to


subsidize
 it
 and
 as
 a
 result,
 your


Nebius,
 your
 INE,
 your
 cipher,
 they


might
 get
 a
 three,
 four,
 five,
 seven


billion
 dollar
 contract.
 their
 market


caps
 are
 only
 from
 10
 to
 15
 billion


dollars,
 which
 one
 could
 argue
 is


expensive,
 but
 if
 they
 get
 these
 deals,


it
 becomes
 less
 expensive
 because
 they


end
 up
 showing
 real
 growth.
 So,
 I
 think


if
 you're
 in
 any
 of
 those
 names,
 which


have
 taken
 a
 beating
 over
 the
 past


couple
 weeks,
 and
 I
 think
 it's
 kind
 of


good,
 right?
 Everything
 in
 the
 stock


market
 took
 a
 beating,
 whether
 it
 was


high
 momentum
 or
 it
 was
 just
 a
 regular,


you
 know,
 name
 like
 like
 a
 Google,
 like


everything
 needed
 to
 take
 a
 little
 bit


of
 a
 pullback
 so
 we
 can
 get
 that
 next


leg
 to
 go
 higher.
 It's
 a
 little
 painful


to
 deal
 with,
 but
 at
 the
 end
 of the
 day,


it
 is
 healthy.
 And
 uh
 maybe
 this
 is
 a


part
 of
 the
 story,
 a
 part
 of
 the
 news


that
 can
 help
 make
 us
 get
 that
 next
 leg


up
 for
 those
 data
 center
 plays.
 By
 the


way,
 the
 S&P
 500
 closed
 at
 671.
 I
 mean,


it
 was
 a
 relatively
 good
 day
 across
 the


board.
 Some
 of
 those
 momentum
 names,


even
 in
 Oaklo
 that
 fell
 from
 193
 down
 to


118,
 ended
 the
 day
 at
 125.
 So,
 of


course,
 it's
 not
 back
 at
 195,
 but
 it's


also
 not
 down,
 you
 know,
 below
 100.
 So,


you
 are
 seeing
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 that


momentum
 stabilization
 across
 the


market.
 Now,
 here's
 the
 bare
 case.
 This


is
 debt.
 This
 is
 debt.
 And
 we
 got
 to
 be


honest
 about
 it.
 This
 is
 something
 that


I
 don't
 love
 to
 see.
 I'm
 sure
 a
 lot
 of


you
 guys
 don't
 love
 to
 see
 and
 my
 only


response
 to
 this,
 which
 has
 been
 my


response
 over
 the
 past
 couple
 weeks
 as


I've
 been
 trying
 to
 justify
 why
 the
 debt


financing
 makes
 sense,
 is
 that
 if
 there


is
 an
 ROI
 from
 AI,
 which
 if
 you're


invested
 in
 the
 stock
 market
 at
 this


point,
 you've
 got
 to
 believe
 got
 no


matter
 what
 you're
 in,
 you've
 got
 to


believe
 there's
 going
 to
 be
 some
 ROI
 on


AI.
 As
 long
 as
 there
 is
 an
 ROI,
 you
 can


justify
 it.
 If
 there
 is
 no
 ROI,
 if
 there


is
 no,
 you
 know,
 return
 that
 Oracle


thinks
 they're
 going
 to
 get,
 which
 is


why
 they're
 happy
 to
 pay
 this
 6
 and
 a


half%
 interest
 that
 they
 have
 to
 pay
 on


this
 40
 billion
 bucks
 because
 they're


going to
 make
 way
 more
 than
 six
 and a


half%.
 Then
 this
 all
 falls
 apart.
 So,


you
 know,
 my
 logic
 here
 is
 that
 the
 use


cases
 of
 AI
 are
 just
 evolving.
 AMD
 this


morning
 talked
 about
 helping
 to
 detect


certain
 illnesses
 before
 they
 happen


with
 a
 different
 company
 via
 AI.
 I
 know


the
 you
 know
 elementary
 use
 cases
 of
 AI


like
 taking
 a
 meeting
 summary
 which
 is


still
 important
 and
 can
 make
 companies


more
 productive
 is
 not
 as
 important
 as


we're
 expecting
 FSD
 robotics
 personal


assistance
 all
 of
 this
 stuff
 is
 coming


in
 the
 future
 and
 as
 long
 as
 it


manifests
 in
 what
 we
 think
 it
 can


manifest
 into
 and
 we
 don't
 know
 we're


going
 to
 have
 to
 see
 we're
 all
 living


through
 this
 lifetime
 to
 see
 if
 that


plays
 out
 this
 ROI
 is
 going to
 be
 there


so
 I
 think
 for
 the
 people
 that
 are


afraid
 that
 it's
 debt
 you
 should
 be


afraid
 I
 think
 every
 investor
 should
 be


like
 well
 it's
 a
 lot
 of
 debt
 but
 if
 the


technology
 actually
 has
 value
 that
 can


pay
 back
 the
 debt,
 then
 it
 likely
 makes


sense.
 Okay,
 next
 topic.
 Uh
 let's
 talk


about
 earnings,
 folks.
 We
 have
 been


getting
 some
 pretty
 damn
 good
 earnings


results
 across
 the
 board,
 and
 it
 is


quite
 incredible
 to
 see.
 So,
 I
 just
 want


to
 give
 a
 couple
 stats
 today.
 Out
 of
 the


60
 companies
 that
 have
 reported
 in
 the


S&P
 500
 so
 far,
 85%
 of
 them
 have
 beat


earnings
 by
 an
 average
 of
 8%.
 So,
 you


are
 seeing
 that
 earnings
 growth
 across


the
 board
 and
 beating
 some
 of
 the


estimates.
 Some
 of
 the
 companies
 today


that
 reported
 digital
 realy,
 they
 beat


earnings
 by
 510%.
 Next
 Tracker
 beat


earnings
 by
 18%.
 Ford,
 you
 know,
 legacy


auto
 company
 beat
 earnings
 by
 25%.
 By


the
 way,
 revenue
 they
 beat
 by
 three


billion.
 I
 mean,
 just
 just
 a
 quick
 note


on
 Ford,
 you
 know,
 Ford
 sells
 cars
 to


the
 consumer.
 The
 consumer
 has
 to
 be


able
 to
 buy
 those
 cars
 for
 Ford
 to
 make


money.
 I'm
 not
 saying
 that
 there's
 not


issues
 or
 cracks
 in
 the
 economy,
 but
 if


people
 are
 willing
 to
 buy
 $3
 billion


worth
 of
 cars
 in
 Q3
 ahead
 of


expectations,
 that
 means
 the
 consumer


might
 not
 be
 in
 the
 worst
 situation.


They're
 not
 in
 the
 best
 situation,
 but


they
 might
 not
 be
 in
 the
 worst


situation.
 Pneumont
 beat
 earnings
 by


19%.
 Deckers,
 another
 consumer
 brand,


selling
 shoes
 and
 clothes,
 beat
 earnings


by
 15%.
 And
 then
 you
 had
 the
 uh


basically
 stock
 of
 the
 day,
 story
 of
 the


day.
 Intel
 beating
 earnings
 by
 2,200%.


23
 cents
 versus
 1
 cent
 expected.


Massive,
 massive
 beat
 for
 Intel.
 Donny
 T


did
 have
 that
 $9
 billion
 stake
 that
 they


took
 a
 couple
 months
 ago.
 Should
 have


followed
 Donn
 T.
 Uh
 so
 look
 what
 does


this
 mean
 about
 the
 earnings
 picture?
 I


think
 the
 most
 important
 thing
 that
 it


says
 about
 the
 earnings
 picture
 is
 that


the
 at
 the
 end
 of the
 day
 a
 lot
 of
 these


companies
 are
 beating
 on
 revenue
 or


they're
 beating
 you
 know
 in
 or
 they're


coming
 in
 line
 with
 revenue
 but
 they're


really
 beating
 on
 EPS.
 Now
 why
 does
 that


matter?
 EPS
 is
 a
 function
 of
 earnings


per
 share.
 How
 do
 you
 determine
 earnings


per
 share?
 Well
 you
 have
 to
 take
 the


total
 shares
 outstanding
 in
 a
 company.


You
 have
 to
 take
 the
 earnings,
 aka
 the


net
 income,
 the
 gap
 net
 income,
 not
 the


operating
 income,
 but
 the
 actual
 income


after
 all
 of
 your
 expenses
 that
 a


company
 is
 able
 to
 produce,
 and
 then
 you


have
 to
 divide
 it
 by
 the
 number
 of


shares,
 and
 then
 you
 get
 an
 EPS,
 an


earnings
 per
 share.
 If
 the
 margins
 on
 a


company
 are
 going
 higher,
 they
 have


better
 earnings.
 So,
 if
 you're
 making
 30


cents
 on
 every
 dollar
 in
 profit,
 you


have
 a
 30%
 net
 income
 margin.
 If
 you're


making
 35
 cents
 on
 every
 dollar,
 you


have
 a
 35%
 net
 income
 margin.
 at
 margin


increase
 ahead
 of
 what
 the
 analysts
 are


expecting.
 And
 what
 is
 Wall
 Street?
 Wall


Street
 is
 a
 game
 of
 perception,
 not


reality.
 Eventually,
 it
 becomes
 reality,


but
 in
 the
 short
 term,
 it
 is
 perception.


If
 the
 perception
 on
 Wall
 Street
 is
 that


AMD
 is
 going
 to
 do
 a
 $150
 a
 share,
 and


AMD
 does
 $1.75
 a
 share,
 that's
 25
 cents


per
 share
 more
 than
 the
 street
 expected.


And
 what
 I'm
 seeing
 in
 terms
 of
 all


these
 earnings,
 and
 for
 those
 that


follow
 the
 market,
 open,
 market,
 close


every
 day,
 as
 we're
 looking
 at
 all
 these


earnings,
 companies
 are
 beating
 pretty


damn
 well.
 So
 then
 it
 begs
 the
 question


for
 the
 companies
 that
 are
 beating
 um


wait
 a
 second
 are
 they
 beating
 because


of
 AI?
 Are
 they
 beating
 because
 of


earnings?
 Are
 they
 beating
 because
 their


earnings
 are
 so
 good
 then
 their
 margin


enhancement
 is
 so
 good
 and
 their


productivity
 is
 so
 good
 that
 AI
 is


allowing
 them
 to
 show
 up
 these
 good


earnings?
 I
 think
 that
 is
 the


existential
 question
 and
 I
 don't
 have
 a


definitive
 response
 for
 this
 yet.
 after


earning
 season
 is
 done,
 I
 kind
 of
 want


to
 compile
 all
 the
 transcripts
 that


we've
 heard
 from
 all
 these
 companies
 and


you
 know
 kind
 of
 look
 for
 some
 themes
 in


what
 these
 the
 these
 companies
 are


saying.
 But
 if
 they
 all
 start
 mentioning


margins
 are
 going
 up
 because
 workers
 are


becoming
 more
 productive,
 employees


ultimately
 have
 more
 decisions
 in
 the


company
 as
 they
 have
 more
 autonomy
 to


make
 new
 decisions,
 be
 more
 creative


with
 the
 advance
 of
 AI.
 And
 as
 a
 result,


we
 are
 actually
 seeing
 progress


internally
 and
 externally
 with
 our


products
 and
 services
 than
 internally


with
 the
 companies
 uh
 that
 we're
 working


with
 and
 the
 employees
 that
 we're


working
 with
 to
 produce
 those
 products


and
 services
 which
 is
 leading
 to
 better


business
 results.
 I
 mean
 that
 is
 the


promise
 of
 AI
 at
 least
 to
 an
 extent
 in


the
 stock
 market
 and
 also
 what
 that


matters
 for
 the
 S&P
 500
 which
 is
 trading


at
 26
 times
 earnings
 uh
 you
 know


historically
 should
 be
 trading
 at
 18


times
 is
 that
 we
 are
 validated
 to
 an


extent
 to
 have
 the
 S&P
 trade
 at
 these


levels.
 The
 only
 way
 you
 get
 a
 market
 to


trade
 at
 higher
 than
 historical
 levels


if
 is
 if
 something
 actually
 matters
 to


that
 market
 to
 be
 able
 to
 give
 you
 a


reason
 for
 why
 investors
 should
 pay
 a


multiple.
 Lots
 of
 times
 investors
 pay
 a


higher
 multiple
 based
 on
 pure
 hype.
 If


the
 earnings
 growth
 is
 there
 and
 again


not
 every
 company's
 going to
 put
 that
 up


for
 but
 for
 the
 companies
 that
 matter
 if


they
 can
 put
 that
 up
 then
 that
 earnings


multiple
 will
 continue
 to
 expand
 because


where
 else
 are
 you
 going
 to
 put
 your


money
 right
 like
 yes
 you
 have
 gold
 you


have
 crypto
 but
 at
 the
 end
 of the
 day
 if


you
 want
 your
 money
 to
 compound
 inside


of
 an
 asset
 that
 produces
 free
 cash
 flow


and
 net
 income
 you
 need
 to
 put
 it
 into


something
 that
 can
 actually
 grow
 and
 if


it's
 showing
 the
 growth
 you're
 willing


to
 pay
 a
 bit
 more
 of
 a
 premium


especially
 if
 there
 is
 meaningful
 growth


that
 is
 a
 trajectory
 of
 longevity
 and


that's
 what
 justifies
 the
 market
 being


where
 it
 is
 today.
 So,
 it
 is
 quite


incredible
 to
 see
 the
 earnings
 that


we've
 seen
 so
 far
 and
 I'm
 just
 hoping


that
 in
 Q3
 that
 can
 continue
 when
 we
 get


the
 most
 important
 companies
 in
 the


world
 that
 are
 starting
 next
 week.
 Okay,


Tesla.
 Let's
 talk
 about
 Tessy.
 So,
 look,


Tesla
 had
 one
 of
 those
 quarters,
 we


talked
 about
 it
 over
 the
 past
 couple


days
 that
 was
 a
 good
 quarter,
 not
 a


great
 quarter.
 Um,
 and
 you
 know,
 it
 was


just
 one
 of
 those
 quarters
 where
 the


street
 was
 like,
 "All
 right,
 cool."
 You


know,
 we're
 just
 going
 to
 see
 if
 the


progress
 can
 continue
 the
 way
 that


everyone
 thinks
 it
 eventually
 will


continue.
 Tesla
 actually
 ended
 green
 on


the
 day
 as
 the
 entire
 market
 came
 up
 uh


448.98


a
 little
 bit
 red
 after
 hours.
 It
 did


fall
 all
 the
 way
 to
 418.
 So
 if
 you
 did


buy
 that
 418
 dip
 uh
 you
 got
 it
 here
 now


round
 about
 at
 450.
 Uh
 they
 missed
 on


EPS
 55
 cents
 versus
 50
 expected.
 Uh
 so


or
 50
 cents
 versus
 55
 cents
 expected.
 So


they
 missed
 on
 EPS.
 They
 beat
 on


revenue.
 The
 biggest
 thing
 about
 this


Tesla
 earnings
 is
 that
 when
 you
 listen


to
 Elon
 on
 the
 call,
 I
 mean
 it
 was


typical
 Elon,
 right?
 He
 you
 know
 he
 had


some
 energy.
 He
 was
 talking
 about


different
 things
 around
 the
 business,


FSD,
 autonomy,
 robots.
 I
 mean,
 ended
 up


saying
 that
 he's
 going
 to
 build
 a
 robot


army
 and
 he
 doesn't
 want
 to
 lose


controlling
 power
 of
 that
 robot
 army,
 so


everyone
 needs
 to
 vote
 for
 his


compensation
 package.
 So,
 I
 mean,
 you


had
 the
 typical
 Elon
 thing
 there.
 The


one
 thing
 that
 pissed
 off
 a
 lot
 of


people
 was
 that
 they
 didn't
 talk
 about


future
 products
 and
 I
 understand
 why


they
 can't
 do
 it,
 but
 like
 they
 kind
 of


didn't
 really
 answer
 the
 questions
 that


most
 shareholders
 cared
 about.
 So,
 that


was
 one
 thing
 that
 uh
 was
 not
 the
 best


for
 some
 of
 the
 Tesla
 faithful
 that
 were


just
 annoyed
 they
 didn't
 get
 those


answers.
 I
 think
 the
 biggest
 thing
 is
 as


follows.


Based
 on
 what
 Elon
 said
 on
 this
 call
 and


the
 last
 call,
 it
 doesn't
 look
 like


there's
 massive
 earnings
 growth


potential
 going
 into
 2026
 at
 the
 current


state
 of
 the
 business.
 And
 the
 reason


for
 that
 is
 because
 energy,
 even
 if
 they


double
 it
 next
 year,
 is
 not
 going
 to


make
 a
 meaningful
 difference
 in
 terms
 of


the
 actual
 net
 income
 or
 earnings
 growth


that
 the
 company
 can
 put
 up.
 Vehicle


deliveries,
 this
 is
 the
 wild
 card.
 I


mean,
 look,
 the
 EV
 subsidy
 is
 going


away.
 So,
 the
 question
 becomes,
 without


the
 EV
 subsidy,
 are
 they
 going
 to
 be


able
 to
 sell
 as
 many
 vehicles
 as
 they


did
 even
 this
 year?
 Now
 you
 do
 have


rates
 coming
 down
 which
 should
 hopefully


be
 helpful.
 But
 nonetheless,
 if
 people


aren't
 buying
 that
 many
 Teslas,
 they're


just
 not
 going
 to
 have
 that
 much,
 you


know,
 raw
 revenue
 coming
 through
 the


door.
 So
 that's
 another
 problem
 that's


potentially
 not
 going
 to
 help
 them
 next


year.
 Optimus,
 Elon
 said
 production
 for


Optimus
 is
 going
 to
 start
 next
 year.
 So


that's
 great,
 but
 that
 doesn't
 mean


they're
 necessarily
 getting
 orders
 yet


for
 Optimus.
 Now,
 that
 could
 change
 if


they
 report
 that
 like
 Walmart's
 buying


two
 million
 robots
 and
 they
 already
 put


in
 a
 purchase
 order
 for
 them.
 That's
 a


whole
 different
 question.
 that
 could


completely
 rebate
 the
 stock
 overnight,


but
 uh
 that
 so
 far
 has
 not
 really,
 you


know,
 put
 in
 into
 the
 the
 the
 ether.
 So


then
 the
 question
 just
 becomes
 FSD.
 And


FSD,
 you
 know,
 I
 updated
 recently.
 I'm


not
 on
 14
 yet.
 I
 was
 at
 13.2.
 And
 I
 said


that
 the
 nagging
 that
 FSD
 does
 in
 terms


of
 forcing
 you
 to
 like
 constantly
 look


in
 the
 road,
 not
 even
 check
 your
 phone


if
 you
 get
 a
 message
 for
 like
 4
 seconds.


Um
 that
 was
 really
 annoying.
 And
 Elon


said
 specifically
 if
 we
 can
 get
 to
 the


point
 where
 people
 in
 the
 car
 can
 text


and
 drive
 aka
 they
 can,
 you
 know,
 text


being
 a
 metaphor,
 do
 whatever
 they
 want


in
 the
 car
 without
 having
 to
 worry
 about


getting
 bombarded
 with
 messages
 of
 like


paying
 attention,
 that's
 when
 they
 win.


And
 I
 agree
 if
 that
 if
 if
 Tesla
 can


actually
 get
 unsupervised
 FSD
 because
 I


use
 it
 every
 day
 and
 I
 love
 it.
 If
 if


you
 could
 get
 someone
 to
 do
 whatever


they
 want
 in
 the
 car
 without
 having
 to


worry
 about
 the
 implications
 of
 like


driving,
 that
 would
 be
 a
 game
 changer.


Unfortunately,
 Tesla's
 not
 there
 yet,


but
 Elon
 knows
 that
 they're
 getting


closer.
 And
 if
 they
 do
 end
 up
 achieving


that
 goal,
 they're
 going
 to
 win


regardless
 of
 how
 much
 uh,
 you
 know,


vehicles
 they
 sell
 because
 no
 other


company
 has
 so
 far
 been
 able
 to
 do
 that.


Now,
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 companies
 that
 are


competing
 with
 your
 Whimos
 and
 all
 these


other
 AV
 startups.
 But
 that's
 one
 of
 the


main
 things
 Tesla
 cares
 about.
 I
 think


the
 big
 thing
 going
 into
 2026
 is
 that


this
 stock
 trades
 at
 a
 very
 aggressive


valuation.
 Now,
 Tesla's
 always
 traded
 at


a
 very
 aggressive
 valuation.
 So,
 you


know,
 one
 of
 the
 reasons
 I
 like
 Tesla
 is


because
 you're
 able
 to
 build
 a
 narrative


and
 a
 story
 long
 term
 and
 kind
 of
 pull


forward
 the
 growth
 and
 then
 watch
 that


growth
 grow
 into
 an
 S-curve.
 The
 problem


is
 the
 stock's
 not
 $200
 anymore.
 The


stock's
 at
 $450.
 So,
 if
 you're
 expecting


upside
 in
 2026,
 the
 question
 is
 where
 is


the
 earnings
 growth
 coming
 from
 or
 do


they
 even
 need
 earnings
 growth?
 Now,
 you


could
 say
 they
 don't
 need
 earnings


growth
 because
 the
 potential
 of
 their


earnings
 is
 so
 strong
 that
 it
 doesn't


really
 matter
 that
 they
 don't
 have
 the


earnings
 growth
 right
 now.
 It's
 going to


happen
 in
 the
 future.
 That's
 fair.
 And


that
 might
 very
 well
 take
 the
 stock


higher
 as
 rates
 come
 down,
 etc.
 people


might
 just
 want
 to
 park
 their
 money
 in


Tesla.
 Um,
 but
 if
 we
 have
 another
 year


of
 negative
 30%
 earnings
 growth,
 again,


Tesla
 is
 not
 growing.
 It's
 negative
 30%


growth,
 even
 though
 the
 valuation
 is


assuming
 that
 they're
 growing,
 then
 the


question
 just
 becomes
 what's
 the
 upside


going
 into
 next
 year.
 And
 I
 do
 think


there
 is
 upside.
 I
 just
 think
 it's


towards
 the
 latter
 half
 of
 the
 year
 when


you
 start
 to
 get
 more
 progress
 around


FSD
 and
 optimist
 and
 you
 start
 to
 see


that
 really
 materialize.
 Until
 then,
 I


think
 it's
 business
 as
 usual.
 I
 mean,
 it


was
 not
 a
 bad
 quarter.
 It
 was
 not
 a
 good


quarter
 in
 or
 not
 a
 phenomenal
 quarter.


It
 was
 a
 decent
 quarter
 and
 the
 stock
 is


relatively
 flat
 based
 on
 the
 quarter.
 I


mean,
 it
 was
 at
 440
 yesterday.
 It's
 at


448
 today.
 So,
 you
 didn't
 have
 this


explosive
 upside,
 but
 you
 also
 didn't


have
 explosive
 downside.
 And
 I
 think


that's
 how
 it
 should
 be.
 Like,
 you


shouldn't
 have
 massive
 downside
 for


Tesla
 when
 everyone
 knows
 the
 story.
 FSD


Robotics.
 It's
 just
 that
 story
 is
 not


materializing
 in
 earnings
 today.
 The


question
 for
 2026
 is
 how
 much
 investors


are
 willing
 to
 pay
 in
 terms
 of
 a
 premium


for
 that
 story
 to
 materialize


eventually.
 And
 I
 would
 love
 to
 know
 in


the
 chat,
 I
 mean
 like
 are
 you
 willing
 to


subsidize
 at
 these
 prices
 Tesla
 uh
 over


like
 an
 Nvidia,
 Amazon,
 Google,
 Meta,


all
 these
 other
 companies
 that
 are


showing
 the
 earnings
 growth
 because
 you


believe
 the
 expon
 exponential
 nature
 of


their
 S-curves
 are
 so
 strong
 that
 it


doesn't
 matter
 what
 the
 multiple
 is


today.
 It
 matters
 can
 Tesla
 actually


grow
 into
 that
 multiple.
 And
 if
 that's


the
 case,
 then
 ultimately
 we're
 going
 to


see
 how
 the
 story
 plays
 out
 with
 Tesla.


But
 not
 a
 bad
 quarter,
 not
 a
 phenomenal


quarter,
 just
 a
 regular
 quarter.
 And
 if


Tesla
 keeps
 executing,
 hopefully
 that


quarter
 turns
 into
 positive
 growth
 going


into
 26.
 All right,
 last
 thing
 for
 today


is
 Palanteer
 and
 Alex
 Karp.
 Now,
 I'm


going
 to
 attach
 a
 small
 compilation


video
 at
 the
 end
 of
 this
 video
 that
 has


a
 couple
 clips
 of
 the
 best
 moments
 of


Palanteer's
 uh
 CEO
 Alex
 Karp's
 new


interview.
 Uh
 this
 was
 on
 Fox
 Business.


I
 thought
 it
 was a
 great
 interview.
 So,


a
 couple
 clips
 that
 I
 will
 be
 posting
 at


the
 end
 for
 you
 guys
 to
 get
 some
 of
 the


juicy
 highlights.
 Main
 thing,
 Pounder,


and
 Lumen,
 big
 partnership,
 multi-year


partnership,
 $200
 million.
 essentially


pounder
 and
 lumen
 are
 going
 to
 be


working
 in
 a
 collaborative
 effort
 to
 be


able
 to
 deliver
 value
 to
 all
 the
 clients


that
 they
 both
 share,
 especially
 in
 the


government
 and
 commercial
 space.
 Um,


pretty
 cool
 stuff.
 They
 both
 the
 CEOs


came
 on
 Fox
 Business
 and
 it's
 very


similar
 to
 a
 lot
 of
 other
 CEOs
 and
 how


they
 talk
 about
 Palunteer.
 Palanteer's


value
 is
 downstream
 from
 value
 creation.


If
 they're
 able
 to
 create
 value,
 they're


able
 to
 get
 paid.
 And
 you
 know,
 the
 CEO


of
 this
 interview
 basically
 said,
 "Carp


came
 into
 the
 room,
 showed
 us
 the
 value,


and
 then
 we
 decided
 to
 sign
 a
 big


contract
 because
 at
 the
 end
 of the
 day,


a
 palenteer
 is
 able
 to
 do
 what
 they
 can


do
 in
 a
 very
 very
 sophisticated
 way
 that


a
 lot
 of
 other
 data
 service
 providers


just
 aren't
 able
 to
 do.
 So
 overall,


look,
 I
 I
 I've
 said
 this
 over
 the
 past


couple
 days.
 I
 think
 Paler
 has
 a
 shot
 at


200
 after
 um
 after
 their
 earnings.
 I
 did


buy
 a
 little
 bit
 at
 17238.
 I
 know
 I'm


buying
 a
 company
 that
 is
 trading
 at
 a


very
 expensive
 multiple.
 I
 just
 think


logically
 if
 they
 show
 50
 to
 55%


earnings
 growth
 I
 think
 the
 stock


probably
 goes
 higher.
 I
 could
 be
 wrong


and
 maybe
 the
 street's
 expecting
 that


number
 and
 pounder
 comes
 in a
 little bit


less
 and
 then
 it
 goes
 down
 10%
 that
 can


happen.
 I'm
 willing
 to
 deal
 with
 it.
 Uh


I
 I
 I
 am
 willing
 to
 DCA
 into
 the


companies
 that
 I
 really
 do
 believe
 in


even
 if
 I'm
 buying
 them
 at
 a
 higher


multiple
 but
 I
 think
 it
 could
 be
 a


really
 good
 quarter
 and
 if
 it
 is
 a


really
 good
 quarter
 then
 I
 think
 that


could
 be
 really
 good
 for
 Pounder
 and


their
 trajectory.
 Two
 quick
 things
 I


just
 want
 to
 say
 on
 the
 macro
 before
 we


play
 these
 pounder
 clips.
 Number
 one,
 uh


Trump
 confirmed
 he
 will
 be
 meeting
 with


X
 on
 October
 30th.
 very
 important
 for


easing
 China
 relations
 and
 potentially


getting
 a
 negotiated
 deal.
 Uh
 so
 that's


going
 to
 be
 important.
 That's
 going
 to


happen
 Octo
 October
 30th.
 Jameson
 Greer


and
 Bent
 are
 going
 to
 be
 speaking
 to
 the


China
 vice
 premier
 which
 is
 China's


trade
 representative.
 So
 it's
 good
 to


have
 more
 conversation
 between
 Bent


Jameson
 Greer
 who
 is
 the
 trade


representative
 for
 the
 United
 States
 and


China.
 Uh
 and
 then
 final
 thing
 I
 want
 to


say
 right
 here
 on
 macro.
 Uh
 buybacks
 are


starting
 folks.
 Buybacks
 are
 starting.


We've
 been
 in
 a
 blackout
 period
 for


buybacks
 over
 the
 past
 basically
 month.


As
 we
 get
 into
 earnings,
 companies
 can't


really
 buy
 back
 their
 stock.
 That
 period


is
 coming
 to
 an
 end.
 And
 so
 the
 stat


right
 here
 also
 Trump
 pardoned
 CZ,
 which


is
 like
 this
 massive
 figure
 in
 the


crypto
 space.
 So
 that
 was
 another
 thing


that
 happened
 today
 and
 basically
 said


he
 was
 being
 personally
 prosecuted
 by


the
 Biden
 administration's
 war
 on
 crypto


and
 uh
 that's
 why
 he
 got
 a
 pardon.
 Uh


buybacks
 have
 rose
 16%
 year-over-year,


reaching
 a
 record
 1.15
 trillion,
 second


consecutive
 yearly
 increase.
 Uh
 buybacks


by
 the
 four
 largest
 US
 banks
 jumped
 9.6


billion
 year-over-year.
 Uh
 21
 billion
 is


in
 Q3
 2025
 and
 since
 the
 2020
 low
 share


repurchase
 authorizations
 have
 more
 than


tripled.
 We're
 getting
 into
 a
 November


where
 more
 companies
 are
 going
 to
 buy


back
 their
 stock.
 Uh
 you've
 already
 had


a
 draw
 down
 in
 the
 market
 to
 an
 extent


in
 a
 lot
 of
 different
 individual
 stocks.


So,
 they're
 setting
 up
 for
 a
 good


earnings
 rally
 if
 those
 companies
 can


execute
 and
 you
 kind
 of
 have
 that
 Q4


momentum,
 which
 is
 that
 Santa
 Claus


rally
 that
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 talk
 about.


You
 kind
 of
 need
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 pain


before
 you
 get
 those
 gains.
 I
 mean,
 we


could
 potentially
 have
 a
 really
 good
 Q4


going
 into
 the
 end
 of
 the
 year
 as
 these


buybacks
 commence.
 So,
 that's
 what
 we


got
 in
 the
 stock
 market.
 Thank
 everybody


for
 listening
 and
 watching.
 Deeply


appreciate
 everyone.
 This
 is
 going
 to
 be


the
 last
 daily
 recap
 for
 the
 week.
 It
 is


already
 Thursday.
 Been
 a
 quick
 week.
 I


will
 be
 back
 on
 uh
 Sunday
 for
 the


future.
 So,
 tomorrow
 for
 the
 Monday
 or


for
 for
 Friday's
 market
 open,
 market


close,
 and
 then
 yeah,
 I'm
 turning
 28
 on


Monday.
 So,
 uh
 on
 the
 market
 close,
 I


said
 today
 uh
 we're
 going
 to
 go
 through


a
 bunch
 of
 my
 pictures,
 like
 pictures


from
 my
 past
 that
 a
 lot
 of
 you
 guys


haven't
 seen.
 It'll
 be
 like
 a
 fun
 thing


we
 can
 do
 on
 my
 birthday
 uh
 for
 that


market
 close
 on
 October
 27th.
 So,
 deeply


appreciate
 everybody.
 Here
 are
 some


clips
 of
 pounders
 Alex
 Karp
 in
 the


latest
 interview
 that
 he
 did
 today.


that
 there's
 basically
 the
 way
 they
 look


at
 it
 and
 the
 way
 I
 look
 at
 it,
 which
 is


my
 view,
 than
 not
 uh
 not
 not
 anyone


else's,
 which
 is
 we're
 in
 a
 we're
 in
 a


we're
 in
 an
 arms
 race
 here.
 This
 is


that's
 all
 academic,
 super
 academic.


It's
 like
 we're
 going
 to
 either
 have
 AI


and
 and
 determining
 the
 rules
 or
 our


adversaries
 will
 have
 it
 and
 they'll


determine
 the
 rules.
 And
 it
 and
 so
 this


is
 why
 these
 infrastructure
 things
 are


crazy
 important
 because
 in
 order
 to
 make


it
 work,
 what
 do
 you
 need?
 You
 need


infrastructure
 that
 can
 actually
 run
 the


models,
 get
 the
 data
 there
 in
 a
 secure


and
 cheap
 enough
 way.
 You
 need
 to
 make


the
 models
 actually
 useful.
 You
 need


ontology
 to
 do
 that.
 Meaning,
 you
 have


to
 deploy
 them
 where
 they're
 useful
 and


where
 they're
 not
 and
 and
 orchestrate


them.
 And
 if
 you
 start
 putting


impediments
 on
 this
 de
 facto,
 what's


going
 to
 happen
 is
 our
 adversaries
 will


build
 it
 and
 we
 will
 be
 buying


everything
 from
 them
 including
 our
 ideas


of
 how
 to
 run
 our
 country.
 And
 so
 like


my
 personal
 version,
 Palanteer,
 what
 we


represent
 at
 Palanteer,
 what
 we
 do
 not


impose
 on
 anyone
 else
 is
 we're
 running.


We're
 running
 like
 hell
 and
 we're
 going


to
 support
 anybody,
 especially
 people
 on


the
 front
 line
 who
 can
 like
 galvanize


this
 infrastructure
 and
 then
 our
 clients


in
 the
 DoD
 especially,
 and
 help
 make
 the


American
 war
 fighter
 the
 most
 lethal
 in


the
 world.


>> Jen,


>> I
 mean,
 look,
 we're
 doing
 very
 well.
 I


mean,
 you
 know,
 and
 if
 if
 we're
 doing


things
 that
 are
 not
 valuable,
 then
 I


want
 to
 hear
 about
 that,
 too.
 So,
 I
 was


I
 was
 very
 supportive
 of
 those
 efforts.


>> Did
 you
 Did
 they
 tell
 you
 there
 was


something?
 Yeah.
 You
 know,
 we
 could
 trim


some
 of
 the
 pallet
 stuff
 that
 we
 have.


>> I
 I
 we
 have
 so
 many
 contracts.
 We're


doing
 very
 well.
 You
 know,
 we
 we
 are


fully
 aligned
 with
 the
 US
 government.


And
 if
 there
 were,
 you
 know,
 I
 I
 don't


actually
 No,
 I
 don't
 think
 so.
 But
 the


truth
 is
 um
 you
 know
 look
 our
 we
 have


we're
 doing
 we've
 become
 a
 very
 large


business
 actually
 surprisingly
 to
 most


people
 outside
 the
 US
 government
 and
 in


US
 industry
 which
 is
 where
 we're
 just


you
 know
 crushing
 it
 but
 also
 in
 the
 US


government
 and
 we're
 very
 aligned
 with


our
 this
 is
 one
 of
 the
 secrets
 of


Palunteer
 because
 we
 started
 in
 the
 US


government
 with
 full
 alignment
 when
 when


I
 show
 up
 I'm
 like
 I'm
 not
 saying
 pay
 me


and
 I'll
 do
 nothing.
 I'm
 like
 hey
 we'll


show
 you
 results
 and
 then
 pay
 us.
 We
 are


downstream
 from
 value
 creation.
 And
 if


downstream
 from
 value
 creation
 means


we're
 doing
 something
 that's
 not


valuable
 like
 then
 I
 want
 to
 know


because
 it's
 not
 valuable
 for
 you
 and


tomorrow
 it's
 not
 going
 to
 be
 valuable.


>> That's
 how
 we
 started.
 Alex
 came
 into
 my


office
 first.
 You
 were
 the
 first
 US
 CEO


to
 go
 to
 Ukraine
 after
 the
 war
 began.


>> Uh
 yes,
 that's
 true.
 And
 again,
 it's
 so


funny.
 I
 get
 yelled
 at
 in
 some
 places


because
 of
 Israel.
 I
 get
 yelled
 at
 in


some
 places
 Ukraine.
 And


>> we're
 not
 yelling
 at
 No,
 I
 know
 you're


not.
 But
 it's
 fine.
 It's
 like
 to
 have


someone
 who
 welcomes.
 This
 is
 a
 rare
 um


yeah,
 you
 know,
 I
 I
 mean,
 by
 the
 way,


just
 to
 say
 the
 obvious,
 the
 Ukrainians


are
 tough
 and
 proud
 people
 and
 that's


the
 primary
 reason
 they're
 still


fighting.
 And
 um
 yeah,
 it's
 very
 hard
 to


know
 will
 happen.
 I
 I'm
 happy,
 you
 know,


as
 we've
 seen
 the
 president's
 fully


engaged
 and
 I
 think,
 you
 know,
 at
 some


point
 we
 might
 actually
 get
 a
 piece.
 I'm


really
 hopeful.
