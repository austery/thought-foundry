>> YOU'VE PROBABLY HEARD THE
PHRASE DON'T SPEAK ILL OF THE
DEAD. IT'S KIND OF A MORAL
GUIDANCE. CAN IT ALSO BE A
WORKPLACE RULE? AFTER AMERICAN
PODCASTER CHARLIE KIRK WAS
KILLED LAST MONTH, A COUNCILLOR
IN SAULT STE. MARIE SUGGESTED
ON SOCIAL MEDIA THAT, AMONG
OTHER THINGS, HE SPREAD HATE
SPEECH. SHE IS NOW BEING
INVESTIGATED BY THE CITY'S
INTEGRITY COMMISSIONER. AROUND
THE SAME TIME, THE UNIVERSITY
OF TORONTO PUT A PROFESSOR ON
LEAVE AFTER SHE POSTED THAT THE
SHOOTING WAS, QUOTE, TOO GOOD
FOR FASCISTS. IT RAISES SOME
BIG QUESTIONS WHAT CAN YOUR
EMPLOYER ACTUALLY DO IF YOU SAY
SOMETHING CONTROVERSIAL AT WORK
OR ONLINE?
[MUSIC]
WHAT ARE THE LIMITS ON FREEDOM
OF EXPRESSION? AND WHAT ABOUT
SCHOOLS? TALKING ABOUT CHARGED
TOPICS IN THE CLASSROOM CAN BE
TRICKY. SHOULD ANYTHING BE OFF
LIMITS.
[MUSIC]
WELCOME TO THE RUNDOWN.
[MUSIC]
HOW DO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS
HANDLE DISCUSSING SENSITIVE
ISSUES? IS POLITICAL BIAS A
PROBLEM IN SCHOOLS? I ASKED
MUNA KADRI YORK REGION
PRESIDENT OF THE ONTARIO
SECONDARY SCHOOL TEACHERS
FEDERATION AND SARA MORA, A
RECENT HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATE, TO
SHARE WHAT IT'S LIKE TO TALK
POLITICS AT SCHOOL.
[MUSIC]
MUNA SARA, THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR JOINING US ON THE PROGRAM,
AND THANKS FOR JOINING US IN
OUR MAKESHIFT STUDIO. HOW ARE
YOU GUYS DOING?
>> GREAT. THANK YOU FOR HAVING
US.
>> IT'S WONDERFUL. THANK YOU SO
MUCH FOR HAVING US.
>> ALL RIGHT. SO WE'RE HERE TO
TALK ABOUT SORT OF NAVIGATING
POLITICAL SPEECH IN THE
CLASSROOM. I WANT TO KNOW FROM
A TEACHER'S PERSPECTIVE, DO
TEACHERS FEEL A CHILL ON WHAT
THEY CAN DISCUSS IN A CLASSROOM?
>> WELL, WHAT WE DISCUSS IS
GUIDED BY CURRICULUM. SO THE
MINISTRY TELLS US WHAT IT IS
THAT WE'RE DISCUSSING IN THE
CLASSROOM, BUT DEPENDING ON THE
CLIMATE. SO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE.
DURING COVID, THERE WAS SOME
POLARIZING ISSUES. THE
CURRICULUM GUIDES WHAT WE TEACH,
BUT WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE SOME
PRESSURES WHEN THERE'S EXTERNAL
ISSUES IN THE COMMUNITY. AND SO
IT'S DIFFICULT TO NAVIGATE SOME
ISSUES BECAUSE OF THOSE
PRESSURES. BUT AGAIN, WE STILL
HAVE TO TEACH THE CURRICULUM
AND THAT'S WHAT WE DO.
>> WHAT WAS IT LIKE IN HIGH
SCHOOL AROUND SORT OF THOSE
CONVERSATIONS THAT WEREN'T
NECESSARILY CURRICULUM MAYBE
CURRICULUM ADJACENT, PERHAPS.
BUT HOW DID YOU SORT OF
NAVIGATE THOSE CONVERSATIONS
AND HOW WOULD YOU TALK ABOUT
THEM IN THE CLASSROOM?
>> THAT'S A REALLY GREAT
QUESTION. AND I THINK THAT,
LIKE, BOTH OF YOU GUYS MADE
REALLY GOOD POINTS. LIKE, EVERY,
EVERY TIME IS LIKE A
PARTICULARLY CONTENTIOUS TIME.
THERE'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE
SOMETHING GOING ON POLITICALLY
AND SOME CONFLICT OR CRISIS.
AND I MEAN, LIKE EDUCATION
ITSELF IS INHERENTLY POLITICAL.
SO EVEN MAKING DECISIONS WITHIN
HOW YOU COMMUNICATE WITH YOUR
STUDENTS AND THINGS LIKE THAT,
THAT IS INHERENTLY POLITICAL. I
THINK THAT I AM A MORE
PARTICULARLY POLITICALLY
ORIENTED PERSON THAN SOME OF MY
CLASSMATES. SO THAT WAS
DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT I
FOCUSED ON IN HIGH SCHOOL WHEN
I WAS IN CLASSES LIKE HISTORY
OR GEOGRAPHY OR ECONOMICS, THAT
WAS DEFINITELY AT THE FOREFRONT
OF MY MIND. I THINK I'M VERY
GRATEFUL TO HAVE HAD TEACHERS
WHO WERE VERY OPEN TO FOSTERING
THESE KINDS OF CONVERSATIONS
DURING THE US ELECTION, FOR
EXAMPLE, LAST YEAR, I WAS LIKE
HEAD OF THE HISTORY CLUB, SO WE
ORGANIZED A KIND OF LESSON
AFTER SCHOOL ABOUT HOW US
POLITICS WORKS, HOW THE
ELECTION WORKS IN THE US, AND
WHAT TO EXPECT FOR THIS
ELECTION. AND MY HISTORY
TEACHER ACTUALLY WAS THE ONE
WHO LED IT, AND HE WAS VERY
OPEN TO THESE CONVERSATIONS.
AND I THINK THAT WHAT WAS MOST
IMPORTANT ABOUT ALL OF THOSE
CONVERSATIONS IS THAT YOU
RECOGNIZE THAT YOU CAN'T
SEPARATE YOURSELF FROM BIAS.
BUT AGAIN, LIKE LEARNING HOW TO
THINK CRITICALLY, THAT IS
DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT ALL
OF MY TEACHERS DID A REALLY
GREAT JOB AT POINTING OUT, YOU
KNOW, LIKE TRYING TO SEPARATE
THE BIAS FROM THE VALUE THAT WE
ASCRIBE TO THESE THINGS AND,
AND JUST GIVING US THE MOST
OBJECTIVE STANCE IN A VERY
SUBJECTIVE LANDSCAPE.
>> MUNA I WANT TO UNDERSTAND,
HAVE THERE BEEN TEACHERS WHO
HAVE BEEN DISCIPLINED FOR, YOU
KNOW, POLITICAL SPEECH IN THE
CLASSROOM, AND HOW HAS THE
OSSTF HELPED?
>> WELL, I CAN'T SPEAK TO ALL
OF ONTARIO IN TERMS OF
DISCIPLINE AND OUR DEFINITIONS
OF DISCIPLINE, BUT HAVE THERE
BEEN CONVERSATIONS WITH
TEACHERS ABOUT CONCERNS ABOUT
WHAT IS DEEMED POLITICAL SPEECH
IN THE CLASSROOM? AND SO I
THINK YOU BROUGHT UP A GREAT
POINT, IS EVERYTHING IS
POLITICAL. AND SO IN TERMS OF
OUR ROLE AS OSSTF, WE SUPPORT
TEACHERS IN TERMS OF HOW DO YOU
NAVIGATE CURRICULUM DURING
TIMES WHERE A TOPIC MIGHT BE
CHALLENGING AND AND TO TELL YOU
FROM SUPPORTING 3500 MEMBERS IN
YORK REGION, THEY'RE ALL TRYING
TO GET IT RIGHT IN TERMS OF
HELPING STUDENTS MAKE THEIR OWN
DECISIONS, HELPING STUDENTS
ASSESS RESOURCES, HELPING
STUDENTS NAVIGATE DIFFICULT
CONVERSATIONS. AND SO WHILE,
LIKE YOU SAID, THERE'S A CHILL
AT DIFFERENT TIMES OVER
DIFFERENT ISSUES, OUR ROLE AS A
FEDERATION IS TO HELP OUR
COLLEAGUES WORK THROUGH THE
CURRICULUM IN A WAY THAT
SUPPORTS STUDENTS IN THE BEST
WAY POSSIBLE, AND YOU CAN SEE A
PRODUCT OF THAT SITTING BESIDE
ME WHO'S DOING INCREDIBLE WORK,
PARTLY BECAUSE OF THE EDUCATION
THAT SHE RECEIVED IN A PUBLIC
EDUCATION SETTING.
>> IN TERMS OF THE SUPPORTS,
WHAT ARE SOME OF THE CALLS THAT
YOU WERE HEARING FROM SOME OF
THE MEMBERS?
>> SO I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE.
MUCH OF THE ONTARIO CURRICULUM
IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES TALKS
ABOUT TALKING ABOUT CURRENT
EVENTS. SO WE'LL GET A CALL
SAYING HOW DO WE TALK ABOUT A,
B AND C AS A CURRENT EVENT. AND
SO WE ALWAYS COME BACK TO IS IT
IN YOUR CURRICULUM OKAY. YES,
IT'S IN YOUR CURRICULUM. THEN
WE TALK ABOUT ARE YOU BRINGING
IN A VARIETY OF RESOURCES. ARE
YOU BRINGING IN STUDENTS LIVED
EXPERIENCES? ARE YOU TRYING TO
FOSTER WAYS SO THAT STUDENTS
CAN BRING THEIR OWN RESOURCES
IN AND CRITICALLY ASSESS THOSE
RESOURCES? WE WANT TO HELP
STUDENTS BECOME ADULTS WHO CAN
INTEGRATE IN A WORLD AND HAVE
POLITICAL DISCUSSIONS IN A WAY
THAT'S CONSTRUCTIVE AND
PRODUCTIVE FOR SOCIETY.
>> I WANT TO HAVE A BETTER.
WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL, CELL
PHONES WEREN'T REALLY AROUND.
YOU KNOW, THEY WERE AROUND, BUT
THEY WEREN'T REALLY ALLOWED IN
THE CLASSROOM. PEOPLE WEREN'T
RECORDING VIDEOS. YOU CAN SEE
THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING IN
THE CLASSROOM THAT YOU WOULD
NEVER SEE BEFORE. AND I AM
CURIOUS, DO DO STUDENTS EVER
RECORD TEACHERS AT THE TIME
THAT YOU WERE IN SCHOOL AND
POST VIDEOS ON SOCIAL MEDIA?
>> OKAY, SO I PERSONALLY I'VE
NEVER SEEN SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
LIKE I, I UNDERSTAND THAT MIGHT
BE A CONCERN, ESPECIALLY WHEN
YOU'RE HAVING A POLITICALLY
CHARGED CONVERSATION OR
SOMETHING THAT THAT MIGHT BE A
LITTLE BIT MORE VULNERABLE WITH
YOUR STUDENTS. YOU KNOW WHAT I
MEAN? AND I'VE NEVER SEEN ANY
OF MY PEERS OR CLASSMATES DOING
SOMETHING LIKE THAT. OF COURSE,
LIKE THERE HAVE BEEN TIMES
WHERE WE'LL TAKE PHOTOS WITH
OUR TEACHERS OR SOMETIMES LIKE,
SHARE THINGS AMONGST EACH OTHER,
BUT I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYONE TRY
AND GO OUT OF THEIR WAY TO HARM
SOMEONE'S IMAGE LIKE THAT. NOW,
I'M NOT SAYING THAT THIS
DOESN'T HAPPEN. OF COURSE, I
HAVE A VERY MYOPIC LENS BASED
ON MY HIGH SCHOOL EXPERIENCE
AND THE PEOPLE THAT I GREW UP
WITH, BUT IN MY EXPERIENCE, I
HAVEN'T SEEN SOMETHING LIKE
THAT.
>> MUNA PLEASE DON'T WOULD BE
MY FIRST THOUGHT.
[LAUGHTER]
MY SECOND THOUGHT IS, IS WE
WORK REALLY HARD TO CREATE WHAT
WE CALL CLASSROOM NORMS AT THE
BEGINNING OF A SEMESTER SO THAT
STUDENTS FEEL SAFE TO BE ABLE
TO HAVE REALLY GOOD
CONVERSATIONS IN CLASSROOM, AND
TO THINK THAT SOMEBODY COULD
VIDEOTAPE A STUDENT'S ARE
EXPERIMENTING WITH THOUGHTS AND
IDEAS. AS A TEACHER WHO'S
PROTECTIVE OF THE STUDENTS IN
MY CLASSROOM, IT TERRIFIES ME
THAT THAT'S A THOUGHT THEY
COULD HAVE. AND WE HAVE,
UNFORTUNATELY, AN UNDERFUNDED
SYSTEM WHERE I HAVE 30 OR 40
KIDS IN A CLASS AND WE'RE
TRYING TO HAVE A CONVERSATION
AND YOU CATCH A SNIPPET IN A
MOMENT OF CHAOS THAT'S SO
UNPRODUCTIVE AND HARMFUL TO THE
STUDENTS I'M MEANT TO PROTECT
IN MY CLASSROOM.
>> DOES THAT PUT A CHILL ON
WHAT TEACHER?
>> IT ABSOLUTELY DOES. AND MY
PRIMARY ROLE AS A TEACHER IS TO
PROTECT THE STUDENTS IN MY
CLASSROOM AND DOING SOMETHING
LIKE THAT, WHICH VIOLATES I'M
GOING TO GUESS EVERY SINGLE
BOARD POLICY I KNOW IN MY BOARD
IT VIOLATES BOARD POLICY REALLY
PUTS STUDENTS IN A PLACE WHERE
THEY DON'T FEEL LIKE THEY CAN
HAVE VULNERABLE CONVERSATIONS
AS THEY'RE LEARNING, BECAUSE
THEY'RE WORRIED SOMEONE'S GOING
TO FILM. SO I'M REALLY PLEASED
TO SEE THAT WE'RE TAKING A
STRONGER TONE ON CELL PHONES TO
MAKE SURE THINGS LIKE THAT
AREN'T HAPPENING IN CLASSROOMS.
>> WHO LOSES OUT IN THAT? IN
WHAT SORT OF TECHNOLOGY CAN
CREATE IN THAT PARTICULAR
EXAMPLE WHERE YOU CAN'T HAVE
THESE CONVERSATIONS?
>> STUDENTS. AND, YOU KNOW, I
READ A TWEET FROM A REPORTER
THE OTHER DAY ABOUT HE PUT OUT
A TWEET AND IT WAS NUANCED
ABOUT SOMETHING. AND THEN THERE
WAS VITRIOL THAT CAME AT HIM,
NO NUANCED CONVERSATION. AND I
THOUGHT TO MYSELF, WE'RE LOSING
THE ABILITY TO HAVE POLITICAL
DISCOURSE BECAUSE WE'RE NOT
FINDING PLACES WHERE WE CAN
PRACTICE IT IN A SAFE WAY. IF
WE SAY, WELL, YOU CAN'T TALK
ABOUT THIS IN SCHOOL, WHERE ARE
YOU GOING TO LEARN TO HAVE A
RESPECTFUL CONVERSATION WITH
NUANCE AND DISAGREEMENT. IF
IT'S NOT IN THE SAFE
ENVIRONMENT OF A CLASSROOM?
>> YEAH, PICK.
>> UP ON THAT IS SUCH A GOOD
POINT. I THINK THAT SCHOOLS
LIKE AND JUST EDUCATION AS A
WHOLE IS LIKE THE FOUNDATION
FOR HOW YOU GROW UP AND HOW YOU
BEGIN TO THINK AND FUNCTION AS
A MEMBER OF OUR SOCIETY. AND,
YOU KNOW, EVEN AT A FRESH
UNIVERSITY STUDENT. SO I'M IN
MY FIRST YEAR AND PEOPLE TALK
ABOUT THE IVORY TOWER AND HOW
IT'S A VERY LIKE IT'S A VACUUM,
IT'S A SECLUDED SPACE. AND I
THINK THAT THAT CAN BE A GREAT
THING. AND I THINK THAT'S HIGH
SCHOOL IS ALSO A GREAT PLACE
FOR STUDENTS TO FACILITATE
CONVERSATION, WHERE THEY CAN
SHARE THEIR OPINIONS FREELY AND
OPENLY AND AND BE SAFE IN THAT
ENVIRONMENT. IT'S A KIND OF
PUBLIC SPHERE WHERE YOU ARE
ABLE TO SHARE WHATEVER YOU WANT
AND HAVE PRODUCTIVE DISCOURSE,
NOT LIMITED TO WHATEVER, LIKE
SOCIAL, ECONOMIC FACTORS THAT
MIGHT CONFINE YOU IN THE FUTURE
AS AN ADULT TO SPEAK YOUR TRUTH
AND ADVOCATE FOR YOURSELF AND
YOUR OWN VIEWS. AND I THINK
THAT'S A GREAT WAY TO FOSTER
CRITICAL THINKING ABILITIES,
THE ABILITY TO EVALUATE THE
CURRENT EVENTS GOING ON AROUND
YOU. IT'S JUST IT IS THE PLACE
TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS, SO
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE THAT
THEY'RE UNDER THREAT AND THAT
THEY ARE BEING, YOU KNOW, THERE
IS A CHILL, LIKE IN SOME WAYS.
>> I WANT TO READ A MEMO. THIS
WAS SENT OUT BY THE FORMER
EDUCATION MINISTER, JILL DUNLOP,
LAST YEAR TO SCHOOL BOARDS
ACROSS THE PROVINCE AROUND THE
TIME OF THE FIRST ANNIVERSARY
OF THE OCTOBER 7TH ATTACK,
WHICH I WILL READ IN PART, THE
FOCUS IN OUR SCHOOLS MUST
ALWAYS BE ON LEARNING. THIS
MEANS OUR SCHOOLS AND SCHOOL
RELATED ACTIVITIES SHOULD NEVER
BE USED AS VEHICLES FOR
POLITICAL PROTESTS THAT ENABLE
INFLAMMATORY, DISCRIMINATORY
AND HATEFUL CONTENT. WHILE
EVERYONE IS ENTITLED TO THEIR
OWN POLITICAL OPINIONS, THEY
ARE NOT ENTITLED TO DISSEMINATE
TO POLITICAL BIASES INTO OUR
CLASSROOMS. WE DID REACH OUT TO
THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION FOR
COMMENT, BUT WE DID NOT HEAR
BACK IN TIME FOR THIS TAPING.
BUT HOW DO YOU INTERPRET THIS
MEMO FROM THE MINISTRY?
>> WELL, UNCLEAR AT TIMES. AND
SO I UNDERSTAND THAT THEY'RE
TRYING TO PROMOTE A SAFE
LEARNING ENVIRONMENT, WHICH
EVERY EDUCATOR IS COMMITTED TO
LIKE. THAT IS OUR GOAL KEEPING
STUDENTS SAFE AS MUCH AS
POSSIBLE. BUT MORE CLARITY
WOULD HAVE BEEN APPRECIATED
BECAUSE I'LL GIVE YOU AN
EXAMPLE. I'M A POLITICS TEACHER.
MUCH OF WHAT WE HAVE TO TEACH
IS POLITICAL.
>> AND BIASES.
>> EXACTLY. AND WE HAVE TO TALK
ABOUT SOME OF SOME VERY
DIFFICULT TOPICS AND SOME
TERRIBLE THINGS THAT HAPPENED
HISTORICALLY. AND SO DOES THAT
MEMO DIRECT US NOT TO TEACH
CURRICULUM? I'M HOPING NOT. I
WOULDN'T I WOULD HOPE THAT THE
MINISTER ISN'T SORT OF SORT OF
THROWING AWAY CURRICULUM. IT'S
JUST A LACK OF CLARITY IS AN
ISSUE. AND FOR SOMETHING THAT'S
SO IMPORTANT, I THINK THAT
THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE
MINISTER, YOU KNOW, BRING
EXPERTS TO THE TABLE, BRING
TEACHERS AND EDUCATION WORKERS
TO THE TABLE. LET'S UNPACK
WHAT'S HAPPENING IN SCHOOLS AND
FINDING WAYS WHERE WE CAN WORK
WITHIN THE CURRICULUM TO MAKE
SURE THAT STUDENTS ARE HAVING
THEIR NEEDS MET IN A WAY THAT
NOBODY FEELS UNSAFE IN THE
CLASSROOM, BECAUSE THAT'S THE
GOAL, RIGHT? YOU KNOW, SAFETY
AND LEARNING HAND IN HAND AND
TRUST TEACHERS LIKE WE PUT
STUDENT NEEDS FIRST. IF THE
MINISTER OF EDUCATION WOULD
TRUST US, I THINK THAT THEY
WOULD HAVE A LOT MORE FAITH IN
THE SYSTEM, WHICH THEY SHOULD
HAVE. AS THE MINISTER OF
EDUCATION.
>> YOU'VE TOUCHED ON THIS A
LITTLE BIT. IN YOUR EXPERIENCE,
IT SEEMS LIKE YOU HAD A NUMBER
OF GREAT TEACHERS. WE ALL HAVE
OUR BIASES. IT'S HOW WE
APPROACH IT. WE ARE WEARING
MANY HATS. AS A JOURNALIST, AS
A TEACHER, DID YOU EVER FEEL
LIKE TEACHERS HAD A BIAS?
>> I THINK THAT IT'S A LOT OF
PEOPLE ARE SO WORRIED ABOUT THE
DISSEMINATION OF POLITICAL
NARRATIVES AND BIASES IN
CLASSROOMS, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT
COMES TO TALKING ABOUT
POLITICAL SPEECH IN SCHOOLS. I
AND I JUST FIND IT A BIT
SENSELESS TO THINK THAT YOU CAN
HAVE A BIAS LESS CLASSROOM. I
THINK THAT EVERYONE INHERENTLY
HAS BIAS. IF YOU DECIDE THAT
SOMETHING IS VALUABLE AND WORTH
TALKING ABOUT, THAT IS YOUR
BIAS TOWARD THAT SUBJECT.
YOU'RE ASCRIBING IT VALUE AND
THEREFORE YOU ARE BIASED
TOWARDS IT. SO I DO THINK, OF
COURSE, ALL MY TEACHERS HAD
BIAS. I'M A I AM BIASED,
EVERYONE HAS THEIR BIASES, BUT
I THINK IT DEPENDS ON HOW YOU
APPROACH THAT. AND IF YOU MAKE
YOUR STUDENTS AWARE THAT PEOPLE
THAT YOU'RE TALKING TO, AWARE
THAT WHAT YOU ARE SAYING IS NOT
NECESSARILY OBJECTIVE AND THAT
IT'S NOT UNIVERSAL, OR, YOU
KNOW, THERE IS THERE ARE
CERTAIN JUDGMENTS THAT CAN BE
MADE ON EITHER SIDE. I THINK
THAT THAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT
IN ANY CONVERSATION, NOT EVEN
JUST IN TERMS OF POLITICAL
SPEECH, BUT FOR EXAMPLE, I TOOK
A LOT OF HISTORY CLASSES IN
HIGH SCHOOL, AND THAT IS
SOMETHING THAT WAS STRESSED SO
MUCH TO US, ESPECIALLY WHEN WE
WERE READING FROM DIFFERENT
AUTHORS, DIFFERENT SOURCES AND
THINGS LIKE THAT. SO I DO THINK
THAT OF COURSE, TEACHERS WOULD
HAVE POLITICAL BIAS. THEY WILL
HAVE THEIR OWN PERSONAL
EXPERIENCES THAT INFLUENCE
THEIR OPINIONS. BUT I ALSO
THINK THAT IF IF HANDLED WELL,
THOSE CONVERSATIONS CAN BE
EXTREMELY PRODUCTIVE AND THEY
CAN STILL NAVIGATE
CONVERSATIONS WITH STUDENTS
WITHOUT NECESSARILY IMPOSING
THEIR OWN NARRATIVE OR OPINIONS
ON THEM.
>> MUNA FOR THE EDUCATORS WHO
ARE GOING TO BE WATCHING THIS
AND LISTENING TO THIS, WHAT IS
A TAKEAWAY IN TERMS OF HOW THEY
HANDLE SENSITIVE TOPICS IN THE
CLASSROOM?
>> KEEP DOING WHAT YOU'RE DOING
BECAUSE YOU'RE SO GOOD. YOU'RE
SO GOOD AT IT. AND WHEN I SIT
BESIDE A STUDENT WHO GRADUATED
FROM OUR PUBLIC EDUCATION
SYSTEM, WHO'S ABSOLUTELY
ROCKING IT IN EVERY WAY SHE IS,
IT'S A TESTAMENT TO THE
INCREDIBLE WORK THAT THE 60,000
OSSTF MEMBERS IN ONTARIO DO,
AND SO KEEP APPROACHING PUBLIC
EDUCATION FROM A PLACE OF
CARING AND KINDNESS, AND KEEP
BEING THOSE INCREDIBLE
CURRICULUM EXPERTS WHO PUT
STUDENTS FIRST. AND SO MY
MESSAGE ISN'T SO MUCH TO THE
TEACHERS IN OUR PROVINCE WHO I
KNOW ARE PUTTING STUDENTS FIRST.
IT'S TO THE MINISTER OF
EDUCATION IS TO BUILD
CONFIDENCE IN A SYSTEM THAT'S
WORKING SO WELL FOR OUR
STUDENTS, AND TO FUND IT
APPROPRIATELY, SO THAT YOU CAN
HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS IN
YOUR CLASSROOM WITHOUT 40 OTHER
STUDENTS IN THE CLASS. CAN YOU
IMAGINE A DEBATE? YOU
EXPERIENCED IT WITH 40 STUDENTS
DISCUSSING SOMETHING REALLY,
REALLY DIFFICULT, OR SCHOOLS
APPROPRIATELY SMALLER CLASS
SIZES. TRUST YOUR EDUCATORS AND
BUILD CONFIDENCE AMONG FAMILIES.
I SEND MY CHILD TO SCHOOL
BECAUSE I LOVE OUR PUBLIC
EDUCATION SYSTEM. SO MESSAGE
NOT TO MY COLLEAGUES IS THE
MINISTER OF EDUCATION.
>> ALL RIGHT, SARAH, YOU GET
THE LAST QUESTION. YOU'RE A
UNIVERSITY NOW, AS WE MENTIONED,
AND YOU MADE IT VERY CLEAR THAT
YOU WERE YOU DIDN'T FEEL LIKE
YOU, YOU KNOW, WERE SILENCED OR
ANYTHING IN HIGH SCHOOL. BUT DO
YOU FEEL FREER NOW THAT YOU'RE
IN UNIVERSITY? IN TERMS OF WHAT
YOU CAN SAY?
>> I THINK THAT JUST BEING IN
UNIVERSITY, YOU ARE IN A MUCH
MORE CONCENTRATED GROUP OF
PEOPLE WHO ARE VERY INTERESTED
IN WHATEVER CLASS YOU'RE IN. SO
I'M TAKING LIKE FOUR ETHICS
CLASSES. WE ARE DEBATING EVERY
SINGLE DAY.
>> TOPICS.
>> AND IT IS EXACTLY THE KIND
OF CONVERSATIONS THAT ARE TABOO
IN IN SCHOOLS, IN HIGH SCHOOL
AND THINGS LIKE THAT, AND
THINGS THAT THE MINISTRY OF
EDUCATION OR THE FORD
GOVERNMENT THAT THEY DON'T WANT
YOU TO TALK ABOUT AND THINGS
LIKE THAT. AND I, I'M WATCHING
AS I JUST GRADUATED FROM HIGH
SCHOOL, AND I'M SEEING ALL OF
THESE THINGS, LIKE THE
POTENTIAL REMOVAL OF SCHOOL
TRUSTEES AND, AND, YOU KNOW,
LIKE TRYING TO DECIDE WHAT
STUDENTS OR TEACHERS CAN AND
CANNOT TALK ABOUT IN SCHOOLS.
AND THAT'S REALLY CONCERNING TO
ME BECAUSE I DID HAVE A GREAT
EXPERIENCE IN TERMS OF MY
EDUCATION. AND I DON'T WANT TO
SEE STUDENTS OR TEACHERS LOSE
THEIR AUTONOMY IN THAT, IN THAT
SENSE AND WHAT THEY CAN TALK
ABOUT IN THEIR FREEDOM. BUT
YEAH, IN TERMS OF UNIVERSITY, I
DO THINK THAT I'M I'M
SURROUNDED BY A LOT OF LIKE
MINDED PEERS, PEOPLE WHO ARE
INTERESTED IN POLITICS, PEOPLE
WHO ARE INTERESTED IN DEBATING
THESE THINGS. SO I DO THINK
THAT IF YOU CONSTITUTE FREEDOM
AS WHAT PEOPLE ARE MORE WILLING
TO TALK ABOUT BECAUSE THAT'S
WHAT THEY'RE INTERESTED IN,
THEN YES.
>> ALL RIGHT. WE ARE GOING TO
LEAVE IT THERE. SARAH, I REALLY
APPRECIATE YOUR TIME. AND I
THINK WE CAN BOTH AGREE THAT I
THINK WE'RE IN GOOD HANDS. THE
FUTURE IS TAKEN CARE OF. WE'RE
GOOD.
[LAUGHTER]
>> YEAH.
>> THANK YOU.
>> IN THE US, MANY EMPLOYERS
CAN FIRE PEOPLE FOR ALMOST ANY
REASON. THAT'S NOT THE CASE IN
CANADA. BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
YOU CAN'T FACE CONSEQUENCES FOR
WHAT YOU SAY IN THE OFFICE OR
ON THE INTERNET. CHARLIE
HERRERA VACAFLOR, AN EMPLOYMENT
LAW AND HR SENIOR CONSULTANT AT
PENINSULA CANADA, EXPLAINS.
[MUSIC]
CHARLIE, WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM.
LET'S TALK POLITICAL SPEECH IN
THE WORKPLACE. HOW IS IT
PROTECTED COMPARED TO RACE,
GENDER OR RELIGION?
>> THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION AND
SOMETHING THAT WE CONSTANTLY
CLARIFY TO OUR CLIENTS AT
PENINSULA, POLITICAL SPEECH IS
NOT SPECIFICALLY PROTECTED IN
ALL CANADIAN JURISDICTIONS. FOR
INSTANCE, THE FEDERAL HUMAN
RIGHTS LEGISLATION AND
ONTARIO'S DO NOT PROTECT
SPECIFICALLY POLITICAL SPEECH,
HOWEVER MANY OTHER PROVINCES DO.
NOW, WHAT DOES THIS MEAN? CAN I
SPECIFICALLY AND BLATANTLY BAN
POLITICAL SPEECH FROM THE
WORKPLACE? NO. WHAT AS AN
EMPLOYER YOU CAN DO IS SET
SPECIFIC GUIDELINES OF WHAT IS
RESPECTFUL POLITICAL SPEECH IN
THE WORKPLACE AND WHICH
INSTANCES WILL BE CONSIDERED.
POSSIBLY, YOU KNOW, SOMETHING
THAT IS NOT RESPECTFUL.
>> I THINK WHAT WE SEE OF LATE
IS A LOT OF PEOPLE SEEING THE
CONSEQUENCES OF SOMETHING THAT
THEY HAVE SAID, AND WHAT WE SEE
IS THEM BEING TERMINATED FROM
THEIR JOB OR FIRED. ON WHAT
GROUNDS COULD AN EMPLOYER
TERMINATE SOMEONE FOR POLITICAL
SPEECH?
>> SO AT PENINSULA, WHAT WE SAY
TO OUR CLIENTS IS THAT NO
TERMINATION IS RISK FREE, AND
THEREFORE THESE KIND OF
DECISIONS SHOULD BE WELL
THOUGHT. AS I MENTIONED,
POLITICAL SPEECH IS PROTECTED.
AND IN SOME JURISDICTIONS, AS A
HUMAN RIGHTS PROTECTED
CHARACTERISTIC AND THEREFORE,
DEPENDING ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES,
A TERMINATION COULD LEAD TO A
DISCRIMINATION CLAIM. THEREFORE,
IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE ALWAYS
ESTABLISH SPECIFIC GUIDELINES
OF WHAT IS ACCEPTED POLITICAL
SPEECH, WHAT IS RESPECTFUL TO
OTHER EMPLOYEES IN HOW TO HAVE
THESE KIND OF CONVERSATIONS SO
THAT EVERYONE OPERATES WITH
KNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTANDING OF
WHAT IS THE EXPECTED CONDUCT.
>> I WANT TO TALK ABOUT SORT OF,
YOU KNOW, A LOT OF PEOPLE WORK
FROM HOME, BUT ALSO THE THE
SORT OF THE INFLUENCE OF
TECHNOLOGY, YOU KNOW, A LOT OF
PEOPLE AFTER IF THEY'RE WORKING
A 9 TO 5 AFTER 5:00, THEY'RE
THEY'RE LIVING THEIR LIVES. AND
I WANT TO MAKE A DISTINCTION.
OR IS THERE A DISTINCTION
BETWEEN SOMEONE WHO IS, YOU
KNOW, USING SOCIAL MEDIA,
TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING THAT
COULD BE CONTROVERSIAL AT HOME,
ONLINE VERSUS IN THE OFFICE?
>> YEAH, THAT'S THAT'S A GREAT
QUESTION. AND, YOU KNOW,
SOMETHING THAT HAS COME UP A
LOT LATELY, GIVEN EVERYTHING
THAT HAS HAPPENED AROUND
CERTAIN POLITICAL FIGURES,
EXPRESSIONS AND, YOU KNOW, SO
THERE'S TWO APPROACHES. THE
FIRST APPROACH IS HAVING, AS I
MENTIONED BEFORE, A WORKPLACE
POLICY THAT TELLS EMPLOYEES
WHAT IS THE BEST PRACTICE
CONDUCT FOR THEIR WORKPLACE.
THE SECOND ONE IS ALWAYS TO
HAVE A TRANSPARENT AND CONSTANT
COMMUNICATION WITH YOUR
EMPLOYEES ABOUT WHAT, WHAT, HOW
TO GO OVER SPECIFIC SITUATIONS.
SO IN THIS YEAR, IT'S BEEN IT'S
BEEN A HARD YEAR FOR CANADIANS
BECAUSE WE HAD PLENTY OF
ELECTIONS. WE ARE COMING OUT OR
WE'RE GOING THROUGH, YOU KNOW,
TURMOIL OF A RELATIONSHIP WITH
OUR CLOSEST NEIGHBOR. AND, YOU
KNOW, FOLKS HAVE THE YOU KNOW,
THEY WANT TO SAY SOMETHING.
>> HAVE A LOT TO SAY.
>> YEAH, EXACTLY. I MEAN, WE'RE
PEOPLE WE'RE, YOU KNOW, AND AND
SO IN THAT REGARD, IT'S ALWAYS
IMPORTANT TO FOR EMPLOYERS TO
SAY BEFORE YOU WANT TO SAY
SOMETHING, MAKE SURE IF IF YOU
REALLY HAVE TO, IF YOU REALLY
HAVE TO, AND IF YOU REALLY HAVE
TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE
CERTAIN CAVEATS OR THERE ARE
CERTAIN PROTECTIONS THAT ARE IN
PLACE, IS YOUR SOCIAL MEDIA,
DOES YOUR SOCIAL MEDIA HAVE
YOUR COMPANY AFFILIATION? IS
YOUR LIKE A SPECIFIC NAME THERE?
YOU KNOW, THOSE THINGS. AND
THEN OF COURSE, LET'S TRY TO
MODERATE THE WAY THAT WE
EXPRESS OURSELVES, YOU KNOW.
HATEFUL SPEECH, YOU KNOW, CAN
ALWAYS BRING PROBLEMS NOT ONLY
FOR ONESELF BUT ALSO, YOU KNOW,
IF YOU ARE HAVING YOUR COMPANY
AFFILIATION ATTACHED TO THAT,
IT COULD BRING REPUTATIONAL
PROBLEMS FOR THE COMPANY. AND
THAT IS WHERE A WORKPLACE
POLICY BEST ADDRESSES THOSE
KIND OF INSTANCES.
>> ALL RIGHT. I WANT TO TALK
ABOUT SOME REAL LIFE EXAMPLES.
WE ASKED THE MARKET RESEARCH
FIRM ADVANCED SYMBOLICS INC.
WHICH USES ARTIFICIAL
INTELLIGENCE TECHNOLOGY KNOWN
AS POLY, TO FIND OUT WHAT
TOPICS PEOPLE ARE AFRAID TO
TALK ABOUT IN THE WORKPLACE.
AND THE NUMBER ONE TOPIC CAME
UP AS CHARLIE KIRK, NOT CHARLIE
YOU, BUT CHARLIE KIRK, WHICH
FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T KNOW A
RIGHT WING COMMENTATOR WHO WAS
KILLED IN UTAH ON CAMPUS LAST
MONTH, AND WHAT THEY FOUND WAS
THAT ANY CONVERSATION AROUND
CHARLIE KIRK QUICKLY ESCALATED
INTO HEATED ARGUMENTS OR
ACCUSATIONS, AND THERE WAS A
PALPABLE SENSE THAT ANY COMMENT
COULD BE MISREPRESENTED OR
WEAPONIZED BY COLLEAGUES WITH
OPPOSING VIEWS. WITH THIS
SPECIFIC EXAMPLE, DO PEOPLE
NEED TO BE AFRAID OF WHAT THEY
SAY ABOUT HIM?
>> YOU KNOW, THAT STATEMENT IN
ITSELF IS IS VERY DANGEROUS
WHEN PEOPLE LIVE WITH FEAR
ABOUT WHAT THEIR THOUGHTS ARE
AND THEIR EXPRESSIONS, IT SEEMS
LIKE THERE ARE MANY THINGS THAT
HAVE GONE WRONG BEFORE. NOW
WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW
TO ADDRESS THEM. WHAT I'VE SAID
BEFORE, IN PART ABOUT THE
PUBLICATIONS THAT WE DO, IS
THAT BOTH EMPLOYEES AND
EMPLOYERS HAVE ARE GOING
THROUGH A LOT OF CHANGES, AND
THE VELOCITY OF THESE CHANGES
IS UNPRECEDENTED. PACE
LEGISLATION IS BEING COMING UP,
NEW THINGS ARE HAPPENING. YOU
KNOW, THERE'S TENSION GROWING
AND THEN PEOPLE JUST REACT. AND
IN THIS REACTION IS WHERE, YOU
KNOW, THE PROBLEMS, THE TENSION
COMES AND THE FEAR ENSUES, BOTH
FOR THE EMPLOYEE AND THE
EMPLOYER. IN THESE SITUATIONS,
I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE IS A
LOT OF, YOU KNOW, TENSION AND
JUST UNCERTAINTY ABOUT HOW TO
MANAGE THESE SITUATIONS. BUT I
THINK THE KEY ONE IS EMPATHY.
HOW HOW IS MY EXPRESSION GOING
TO BE RECEIVED BY THE OTHER
PERSON? AND IF ANOTHER PERSON
WERE TO SAY SOMETHING THAT I
COMPLETELY DISAGREE WITH, HOW
SHOULD I HOW WILL I RECEIVE
THAT? AND I THINK THAT THAT IS
ONE OF THE KEY MESSAGES THAT
ALL EMPLOYERS SHOULD BE PUTTING
OUT THERE IS, YOU KNOW, HAVE
MORE EMPATHY IN THE WAY THAT
YOU EXPRESS YOURSELF, BECAUSE,
HOWEVER, YOU MAY BE HURTING
OTHER PEOPLE, YOU MAY ALSO BE
SUBJECT TO THAT. AND WHEN, WHEN
IF WE DON'T DO THAT, THE
PROBLEM IS THAT SITUATIONS WILL
ESCALATE. AND, YOU KNOW, MAY
THAT NEVER HAPPEN, THAT, YOU
KNOW, WE HAVE VIOLENCE IN THE
WORKPLACE. ONE OF THE KEY
THINGS THAT WE TELL ALL OUR
EMPLOYERS, OUR CLIENTS, IS THAT
THEY HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO HAVE
A RESPECTFUL WORK ENVIRONMENT
THAT IS AN ACTUAL LEGAL
OBLIGATION. AND SO IF EMPLOYERS
CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT EMPLOYEES
CAN HAVE A GOOD RESOURCE TO GO
AGAINST THEIR BUSINESSES. SO
THIS ALSO CLARIFIES WHY
EMPLOYERS ARE ALSO FEEL VERY
TENSE.
>> I WANT TO GET A BETTER
UNDERSTANDING FROM THE EMPLOYEE
SIDE OF THINGS. WE TALK ABOUT
SORT OF THE WITCH HUNT. WE TALK
ABOUT THE PRESSURE THAT
EMPLOYERS HAVE TO PUT OUT A
STATEMENT. IF AN EMPLOYEE IS
FIRED FOR POSTING SOMETHING
OFFENSIVE ABOUT CHARLIE KIRK OR
ISRAEL AND PALESTINE, WHAT
RECOURSE DOES THE EMPLOYEE HAVE
TO CHALLENGE THEIR TERMINATION?
SOMETIMES IT MAY SEEM THAT
EMPLOYERS ARE BEING QUICK
BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO RESPOND IN
A WE'RE IN A TIME AND AGE WHERE
IF YOU DON'T SEE A RESPONSE OR
SOMEONE HAS BEEN FIRED FROM
THEIR JOB, THEN SOMETHING IS
NOT BEING DONE. BUT ON THE
EMPLOYEE SIDE, IS THERE
SOMETHING THAT THEY CAN DO?
>> WE'RE VERY CAREFUL AT
PENINSULA TO ALWAYS TELL OUR
EMPLOYERS, YOUR EMPLOYEE HAS
RIGHTS. YOUR EMPLOYEE HAS
GUARANTEES THAT YOU NEED TO
RESPECT. FREEDOM OF SPEECH IS
SPECIFICALLY ONE OF THEM. AND
IN CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS, AS I
MENTIONED BEFORE, POLITICAL
SPEECH IS SPECIFICALLY
PROTECTED. SO THAT MEANS THAT
OPERATING THROUGH TERMINATION
OR UNREASONABLE DISCIPLINARY
ACTION CAN WARRANT YOU A HUMAN
RIGHTS CLAIM. WHAT WE DO TELL
OUR OUR CLIENTS TO COMMUNICATE
WITH THEIR EMPLOYEES IS HOW TO
MANAGE THIS IN A SITUATION THAT
ALLOWS THEM TO HAVE THE FREEDOM,
BUT ALSO MAKES THEM AWARE THAT
THEIR SPEECH AND THE WAY THAT
THEY VOICE IT, CAN BE PUT UNDER
SCRUTINY.
>> IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT THERE
ARE BLURRED LINES. YEAH. THIS
IS WE'RE TALKING THIS IS A
SOMETIMES IT'S VERY CLEAR AS TO
WHAT IS POLITICAL SPEECH AND
WHAT COULD BE CONSIDERED
HATEFUL, BUT TO WHAT EXTENT IS
SPEECH IN THE EYE OF THE
BEHOLDER? I WANT TO GIVE YOU AN
EXAMPLE. YOU KNOW THE PHRASE
FROM THE RIVER TO THE SEA,
PALESTINE WILL BE FREE MIGHT BE
OFFENSIVE TO SOME PEOPLE, BUT
NOT TO OTHERS. HOW DO EMPLOYERS
NAVIGATE THE NUANCE OF THAT?
>> SO EVERYBODY IS ENTITLED TO
A SPECIFIC VIEW ON A SPECIFIC
TENSION, RIGHT. AND WHEN WE'RE
TALKING ABOUT WAR, THAT WILL
ALWAYS HAVE GRAY AREAS, THE
SPECIFIC WAY IS TO ENSURE THAT
THE WORKPLACE AS A WHOLE IS
ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD, NO MATTER
HOW IT'S BEING SAID, NO MATTER
WHAT IS BEING SAID. BECAUSE
WHAT CAN BE OFFENSIVE TO
SOMEBODY MAY NOT BE OFFENSIVE
TO OTHERS AND VICE VERSA. SO
THE ISSUE HERE IS HOW CAN WE
MOVE TOGETHER IN A WAY THAT,
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE DON'T SEPARATE,
PEOPLE DON'T CREATE VIOLENCE,
PEOPLE DON'T CREATE TENSION. I
ALWAYS SAY THAT WITH THE MOST
CLEAR CUT WAYS WHEN WE'RE
TALKING ABOUT THE LGBTQ PLUS
COMMUNITY, SOMETHING LIKE A
PRONOUN MEANS EVERYTHING FOR
THAT COMMUNITY BECAUSE IT'S
TALKING ABOUT NOT ONLY THEIR
IDENTITY, BUT THE WAY THAT THEY
EXPRESS THEMSELVES. AND HAVING
A COMMENT ABOUT THAT MAY BE
LIKE SOMETHING IN PASSING FOR
MANY FOLKS, BUT FOR THAT
COMMUNITY, IT'S EVERYTHING. AND
NOT BEING RESPECTFUL ABOUT THAT.
IT'S LITERALLY NEGATING THEIR
EXISTENCE. SO EXPRESSIONS FROM
THE RIVER TO THE SEA MAY MEAN,
YOU KNOW, SOMETHING TOTALLY
RIGHTFUL AND CHAMPION FOR SOME,
BUT FOR THE OTHER ONES HAS TO
DO WITH THEIR EXISTENCE AS WELL.
