Hello,
 my
 friends.
 Today
 is
 October
 25th


and
 this
 is
 Markets
 Weekly.
 So,
 this


past
 week
 was
 a
 pretty
 exciting
 week
 in


markets.
 We
 had
 the
 S&P
 500
 make
 new


all-time
 highs.
 You
 know,
 who
 knows,


maybe
 we
 really
 will
 get
 to
 7,000
 by
 the


end
 of
 the
 year,
 as
 many
 are
 expecting.


Now,
 the
 latest
 upward
 impulse
 comes


from
 better
 than
 expected
 CPI
 data,


which
 we
 finally
 got
 on
 Friday.
 Now,


from
 my
 perspective,
 I
 think
 inflation


data
 is
 kind
 of
 boring
 because
 when
 you


zoom
 out
 a
 bit,
 on
 a
 year-over-year


basis,
 CPI
 has
 basically
 been
 around
 3%


for
 over
 a
 year.
 Now,
 at
 every
 month,


some
 components
 are
 a
 little
 bit
 hotter,


some
 components
 a
 little
 bit
 cooler.
 For


this
 month,
 it
 was
 shelter,
 but
 you


know,
 big
 picture
 is
 we're
 in
 a
 3%


inflation
 regime
 and
 uh
 have
 been
 for


some
 time
 now.
 The
 White
 House
 is
 also


suggesting
 that
 we
 won't
 get
 the
 next


CPR
 report
 because
 of
 the
 government


shutdown.
 So,
 you
 know,
 um
 I
 guess
 we'll


just
 assume
 that
 it's
 great.
 Um


something
 else
 that
 happened
 this
 week


was
 that
 we
 had
 some
 positive
 news
 on


the
 US
 China
 trade
 discussions.
 Now,


there
 was
 some
 concern
 that
 China
 would


be
 weaponizing
 their
 rare
 earths.
 Maybe


they
 would
 uh
 use
 that
 to
 impact
 the


stock
 market,
 get
 them
 some
 negotiating


leverage.
 But
 we
 also
 had
 news
 this
 week


that
 Trump
 will
 be
 meeting
 President
 Xi


next
 week
 in
 Korea.
 Now,
 from
 my


perspective,
 that's
 really
 good
 news


because
 knowing
 the
 president,
 he
 would


only
 have
 a
 meet
 if
 he
 had
 an
 idea
 of


what
 would
 happen
 and
 he
 can
 announce


good
 news.
 So
 that
 doesn't
 mean
 that


we'll
 have
 a
 great
 deal,
 but
 from
 my


perspective
 means
 that
 we
 won't
 have
 bad


news.
 So
 that
 is
 of
 course
 uh
 positive


for
 the
 markets.
 Now
 today,
 let's
 talk


about
 three
 things.
 First
 off,
 now
 given


that
 CPI
 has
 been
 better
 than
 expected,


the
 market
 fully
 prices
 in
 two
 cuts
 this


year,
 and
 the
 10-year
 yield
 has
 gone


down
 to
 around
 4%.
 Mortgage
 rates
 are


now
 at
 2-year
 lows,
 just
 a
 little
 bit


above
 6%.
 Let's
 talk
 about
 how
 that


could
 impact
 the
 housing
 market.


Um,
 secondly,
 so
 this
 Sunday
 is
 kind
 of


a
 big
 week
 in
 Argentina
 because
 we're


having
 the
 Argentinian
 midterm


elections.
 Now,
 usually
 this
 is
 not


something
 anyone
 cares
 about,
 but
 uh
 at


the
 moment,
 this
 administration
 is
 doing


a
 lot
 to
 help
 Argentina
 uh
 lending
 them


billions
 of
 dollars
 to
 prop
 up
 their


currency.
 Let's
 talk
 about
 what
 the
 US


is
 doing
 and
 how
 it
 plays
 into
 a
 greater


geopolitical
 strategy
 the
 president
 has


in
 mind.
 Lastly,
 the
 big
 big
 exciting


price
 action
 the
 past
 week
 was
 of
 course


in
 gold
 and
 silver,
 which
 totally


imploded
 earlier
 in
 the
 week.
 Now
 just


last
 week
 we
 were
 talking
 about
 how
 they


were
 going
 parabolic
 and
 you
 know
 you


don't
 know
 how
 high
 you
 go
 but
 you
 do


know
 that
 you
 will
 implode
 and
 that


looks
 like
 it
 happened.
 So
 let's
 see


about
 talk
 a
 little
 bit
 about
 what


happened
 there.
 All
 right.
 Um
 starting


with
 the
 housing
 market.
 So
 again


taking
 a
 step
 back
 over
 the
 past
 few


years
 we've
 had
 mortgage
 rates
 go
 super


high
 as
 high
 as
 above
 7%
 and
 housing
 has


definitely
 been
 in
 a
 recession.
 Now,


house
 prices
 haven't
 really
 gone
 down


that
 much.
 They've
 actually
 continued
 to


go
 up
 slowly,
 but
 transactions
 have
 been


low
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 are
 complaining


about
 affordability.
 Consumer
 sentiment


surveys
 show
 that
 it's
 a
 really
 bad
 um


time
 to
 be
 buying
 a
 house.
 Now,
 one
 of


the
 main
 channels
 where
 monetary
 policy


is
 supposed
 to
 affect
 the
 economy
 is


through
 interest
 rate
 se
 sensitive


sectors
 like
 um
 like
 housing.
 Now,
 when


you
 raise
 interest
 rates,
 a
 whole
 bunch


of
 things
 happen.
 You
 know,
 everyone


reacts
 differently.
 It's
 a
 it's
 a


complicated
 system.
 Now,
 in
 theory,


maybe
 if
 interest
 rates
 are
 at
 4%,


you'll
 put
 your
 money
 in
 a
 money
 market


fund
 rather
 than
 go,
 I
 don't
 know,
 see
 a


Taylor
 Swift
 concert
 or
 something
 like


that.
 Pretty
 sure
 that's
 never
 happened,


but
 you
 know,
 that's
 the
 theory.
 But
 one


more
 concrete
 tangible
 thing
 that


happens
 is
 that
 uh
 finance
 purchases


that
 you
 usually
 finance,
 be
 it
 cars
 or


be
 it
 homes,
 uh
 usually
 take
 a
 hit
 when


interest
 rates
 go
 higher.
 And
 that


really
 was
 uh
 very
 concrete
 in
 the


housing
 sector.
 It
 didn't
 really
 affect


the
 stock
 market
 too
 much.
 Um
 but
 again,


every
 sector,
 every
 person
 is
 different.


Now,
 the
 way
 that
 housing
 feeds
 into
 the


economy,
 I
 think
 of
 it
 as
 three


segments.
 First
 off,
 the
 most
 important


segment
 of
 course
 is
 new
 construction.


Now,
 GDP
 is
 when
 you
 was
 when
 you


produce
 more
 goods
 and
 services
 uh
 in
 a


year.
 When
 you
 build
 a
 house,
 you
 have


to
 hire
 people.
 You
 buy
 a
 whole
 bunch
 of


materials.
 You
 got
 appliances
 and
 all


that
 stuff.
 So,
 uh,
 building
 a
 new


construction
 home
 has
 a
 big
 impact
 on


GDP
 and
 it
 multiplies
 through
 all
 sorts


of
 industries
 related
 to
 housing.
 So,


that's
 pretty
 important
 lever.
 Uh,


secondly,
 you
 have
 existing
 home
 sales.


So,
 that's
 homes
 that
 are
 already
 built


but
 then
 get
 sold.
 Let's
 say
 someone
 is


living
 in
 an
 old
 home,
 sells
 it
 to
 buy


another
 old
 home.
 Now,
 when
 you
 have


interest
 rates
 go
 down,
 uh
 there's
 more


turnover
 in
 existing
 homes
 and
 that


helps
 uh
 brokerage
 commissions


basically.
 So,
 you
 give
 brokers
 work
 do


not
 a
 huge
 part
 of
 GDP,
 but
 it's


something.
 And
 the
 third
 part
 I
 think


that
 um
 housing
 affects
 the
 economy
 is


through
 refinancing.
 So,
 let's
 say
 that


you
 have
 a
 really
 really
 high
 mortgage


rate
 and
 mortgage
 rates
 go
 down,
 you


refinance.
 That
 means
 your
 monthly


payment
 goes
 down
 and
 so
 uh
 you
 have


more
 disposable
 income
 that
 you
 could


spend
 on
 other
 things.
 it
 it's
 kind
 of


like
 um
 you
 know
 indirect
 stimulus
 to
 uh


borrowers.
 So
 right
 now
 at
 let's
 say
 6.2


63
 mortgage
 rates


we
 can
 see
 potentially
 that
 we
 could


have
 some
 impact
 on
 these
 three
 channels


but
 from
 my
 reading
 very
 very
 limited.


Now
 starting
 with
 home
 construction.
 Now


the
 best
 way
 to
 get
 data
 on
 this
 is
 to


just
 listen
 to
 what
 the
 home
 builders


are
 saying.
 Now,
 this
 past
 week,
 we
 had


PY
 Homes,
 a
 large
 publicly
 traded
 home


builder,
 come
 and
 talk
 about
 uh
 what


they're
 seeing
 on
 the
 ground.
 And
 from


perspect
 their
 perspective,
 it's
 pretty


clear
 that
 yes,
 mortgage
 rates
 have
 come


down,
 but
 it's
 really
 not
 helping
 that


much.
 Uh
 from
 their
 perspective,
 they


think
 that
 yes,
 rates
 have
 come
 down,


but
 people
 are
 worried.
 The
 economy


doesn't
 seem
 to
 be
 doing
 that
 well,
 and


they're
 worried
 about
 job
 security.
 So,


uh
 it
 doesn't
 seem
 to
 have
 helped
 that


much.
 And
 of
 course,
 they
 are
 building


uh
 fewer
 homes
 than
 they
 were
 before.


Now,
 something
 else
 worth
 noting
 is
 that


even
 though
 interest
 rates
 have
 come


down,
 for
 someone
 who's
 buying
 a
 new


construction
 home,
 it's
 not
 going
 to


make
 a
 really
 big
 difference.
 What
 the


new
 what
 the
 builders
 have
 been
 doing


over
 the
 past
 couple
 years
 is
 that


they've
 been
 offering
 incentives
 to


entice
 uh
 people
 to
 buy
 new
 homes.
 Those


incentives
 come
 in
 the
 form
 of
 interest


rate
 buydowns.
 So,
 let's
 say
 that
 the


market
 rate
 of
 a
 of
 a
 of
 a
 mortgage
 rate


is
 7%.
 If
 you
 buy
 it,
 if
 you
 buy
 a
 new


construction
 home,
 maybe
 the
 builder


will
 buy
 it
 down
 to
 6%
 5
 a.5%.


So,
 they've
 been
 selling
 uh
 they've
 been


buying
 down
 rates
 the
 cost
 of
 lower


profit
 margins.
 And
 you
 can
 see
 this
 in


PY
 Homes's
 uh
 quarterly
 presentation.


Their
 margins
 have
 come
 down.
 Now
 when


interest
 rates
 go
 down
 a
 something
 the


other
 builders
 like
 LAR
 are
 saying
 is


that
 you
 know
 rather
 than
 just
 you
 know


continue
 the
 buy
 down
 at
 the
 same
 rate


so
 the
 ultimate
 home
 buyer
 has
 an
 even


lower
 mortgage
 they'll
 just
 uh
 spend
 a


little
 bit
 less
 money
 on
 the
 buy
 down
 so


that
 homeowner
 home
 buyer
 is
 still
 going


to
 face
 a
 5.5%
 mortgage.
 It's
 just
 that


the


builder
 is
 going
 to
 spend
 less
 money
 to


buy
 down
 the
 mortgage
 and
 have
 higher


profit
 margins.
 So,
 they're
 going
 to


protect
 their
 margins.
 The
 new
 home


buyer
 is
 going
 to
 face
 basically
 the


same
 post
 incentive
 rate.
 So,
 uh
 given


so
 it
 doesn't
 seem
 like
 uh
 the
 mortgage


rate
 decline
 is
 going
 to
 have
 too
 much


impact
 on
 new
 home
 construction.
 Uh
 what


about
 um
 resale
 homes?
 Now,
 resale
 homes


have
 been
 ticking
 up
 a
 little
 bit


higher.
 um
 slightly,
 but
 when
 you
 zoom


out
 and
 look
 at
 the
 data,
 you
 can
 see


that
 it's
 really
 not
 that
 much
 of
 a


difference.
 So,
 yes,
 when
 you
 have
 uh


interest
 rates
 coming
 down,
 you're
 going


to
 help
 on
 the
 margin.
 Some
 people
 buy


uh
 new
 resale
 homes,
 but
 really,


historically
 speaking,
 interest
 rates


are
 quite
 high
 and
 the
 economy
 does
 seem


to
 be
 slowing
 or
 at least
 people
 are


concerned
 about
 that.
 So,
 the
 help
 it's


been
 having
 some
 impact,
 but
 really
 not


a
 lot.
 What
 about
 the
 third
 path,


refinancing?
 Now,
 I've
 been
 reading
 some


headlines
 saying
 refinancing
 activity,


you
 know,
 a
 gazillion%
 higher
 than


year-over-year.
 But
 that's
 super
 super


misleading
 because
 when
 you
 look
 at
 the


universe
 of
 mortgage
 rates
 outstanding,


the
 majority
 of
 people
 have
 mortgage


rates
 that
 are,
 you
 know,
 below
 4%,


below
 5%.
 Only
 about
 say
 15%
 of
 people


have
 mortgage
 rates
 above
 6%.
 So,
 if


mortgage
 rates
 today
 are
 about,
 you


know,
 6.2
 2
 6.3%.
 Yeah,
 it's
 going
 to


make
 sense
 for
 someone
 who
 took
 out
 a
 7%


mortgage
 last
 year
 or
 a
 couple
 years
 ago


to
 refinance,
 but
 for
 the
 vast
 majority


of
 people,
 it's
 not
 just
 it's
 not
 going


to
 make
 sense.
 And
 to
 be
 clear,
 if
 you


have
 a
 let's
 say
 hypothetically


speaking,
 if
 you
 have
 a
 6%
 mortgage
 and


then
 mortgage
 rates
 drop
 to
 5.9,
 you're


not
 going
 to
 refinance.
 That's
 not
 how


the
 world
 works.
 Uh
 the
 research
 that


I've
 seen
 on
 this
 topic
 suggests
 that
 uh


the
 rates
 have
 to
 be
 about
 75
 100
 basis


points
 lower
 uh
 than
 your
 own
 mortgage


for
 you
 to
 actually
 refinance.
 Now
 part


of
 that
 could
 be
 that
 when
 you
 refinance


you
 also
 have
 to
 pay
 a
 couple
 percent
 in


and
 refinancing
 costs,
 but
 I
 think
 for
 a


lot
 of
 people,
 you
 know,
 it's
 just
 not


worth
 the
 hassle.
 So
 even
 if
 mortgage


rates
 were
 down
 to
 say
 5
 a
 half%,
 you


probably
 won't
 have
 that
 much
 of
 a


difference.
 you
 probably
 have
 to
 get
 it


uh
 even
 lower
 than
 that
 and
 u
 just


doesn't
 seem
 to
 be
 happening.
 So,
 uh,


from
 what
 I
 see,
 mortgage
 rates
 have


come
 down,
 could
 continue
 to
 come
 down,


but
 probably
 not
 going
 to
 make
 that
 much


of
 a
 difference
 to
 the
 housing
 sector,


all
 three
 channels,
 uh,
 for
 the


foreseeable
 future.
 But
 we'll
 see.
 Uh,


the
 president
 is
 seemingly
 launching


some
 new
 initiatives,
 emergencies,
 and


so
 forth.
 And
 they
 are
 very
 creative


bunch.
 Which
 leads
 us
 to
 our
 second


topic.
 Now
 the
 white
 house
 know


secretary
 Besson
 has
 been
 moving


mountains
 for
 uh
 President
 Javier
 Mille


of
 Argentina.
 So
 taking
 a
 step
 back


Argentina
 obviously
 historically
 has
 had


a
 lot
 of
 problems
 with
 inflation
 and


economic
 mismanagement.
 And
 so
 finally


the
 Argentinian
 people
 elected
 Javier


Mille
 who
 memorably
 goes
 around
 with
 a


chainsaw
 telling
 everyone
 that
 he's


going
 to
 implement
 austerity
 and
 get


inflation
 under
 control.
 And
 true
 to
 his


word,
 he
 did
 fire
 a
 whole
 bunch
 of


people
 and
 he
 did
 help
 Argentinian


inflation
 get
 down
 to
 more
 reasonable


levels.
 Now,
 part
 of
 the
 recipe,
 part
 of


his
 plan
 is
 to
 have
 a
 stronger
 than


should
 be
 Argentine
 peso.
 Uh
 that
 would


kind
 of
 stabilize
 import
 costs,
 maybe


help
 in
 the
 inflation
 effort.
 Uh
 but
 the


problem
 is
 that
 when
 you
 have
 a
 currency


that's
 stronger
 than
 what
 the
 market


would
 like
 then
 you
 have
 depreciation


pressure
 which
 is
 what
 the
 Argentinian


peso
 has
 been
 suffering
 over
 the
 past


few
 months.
 Um,
 part
 of
 this
 is
 of


course
 that
 there
 seems
 to
 be
 some
 sense


that
 Javier
 Mle
 is
 having
 less
 political


support
 and
 so
 if
 his
 party
 and
 his


supporters
 were
 to
 lose
 power
 then
 maybe


you
 would
 have
 the
 old
 regime
 come
 back


a
 lot
 more
 big
 spending
 and
 so
 forth
 and


you
 know
 bad
 for
 bad
 for
 um
 economic


growth
 there
 maybe
 pesa
 was
 going
 to


continue
 to
 depreciate
 so
 people
 are


front
 running
 that
 in
 any
 case


has
 been
 trying
 to
 shore
 up
 their


currency
 and
 he
 took
 a
 20
 billion
 loan


from
 the
 IMF.
 But
 of
 course,
 that's
 not


enough
 because
 your
 currency
 is
 too


strong
 relative
 to
 what
 the
 market
 would


like
 it
 to
 be
 and
 you
 don't
 want
 it
 to


be
 weak
 because
 you
 want
 to
 control


inflation.
 So,
 Javier
 Mle
 has
 been


asking
 the
 White
 House
 for
 support
 and


strangely
 enough,
 the
 White
 House
 has


given
 support.
 Now,
 they've
 offered


Argentina
 a
 20
 billion
 swap
 line
 and


reports
 suggest
 that
 uh
 they're
 also


invening
 in
 the
 currency
 markets,


selling
 dollars,
 buying
 pesos.
 Now
 this


is
 you
 know
 really
 quite
 extraordinary


because
 I
 don't
 think
 any
 uh
 previous


administration
 would
 be
 doing
 that.
 Now


looking
 at
 this
 chart
 you
 can
 see
 that


these
 interfations
 have
 been
 having
 some


impact
 but
 there
 are
 only
 short-term


impacts
 because
 the
 ultimate
 problem
 is


that
 the
 market
 is
 not
 confident
 that


the
 Malay
 reform
 agenda
 can
 survive.
 Now


this
 Sunday
 there's
 they're
 going
 to


have
 midterm
 elections
 in
 Argentina.
 If


the
 election
 results
 are
 unfavorable
 to


the
 president
 over
 there,
 then
 you
 know


no
 amount
 of
 money
 is
 going
 to
 save
 the


peso
 because
 people
 are
 going
 to
 assume


that
 Argentina
 is
 going
 to
 go
 back
 to
 um


its
 old
 ways.
 So
 another
 interesting


chart
 you
 can
 look
 at
 is
 how
 Argentinian


dollar
 bonds
 are
 trading.
 So
 these
 are


bonds
 these
 don't
 have
 currency
 risk
 in


sense
 they're
 kind
 of
 default
 risk.
 Um


and
 you
 can
 see
 that
 they've
 been


fluctuating
 in
 line
 uh
 with
 aid
 from
 the


White
 House
 and
 perceptions
 of
 uh
 Javier


Mille's
 political
 fortunes.
 Now
 I
 think


if
 you
 take
 a
 step
 back
 and
 look
 more


broadly
 at
 what
 the
 president
 is
 doing,


this
 is
 very
 clearly
 part
 of
 a
 uh


fundamental
 shift
 in
 geostrategic


alignment.
 Whereas
 the
 president
 is


focusing
 more
 on
 the
 Americas.
 It's
 a


revival
 of
 the
 old
 Monroe
 doctrine
 which


basically
 says
 that
 the
 US
 will
 have
 uh


control
 over
 the
 Americas
 and
 you
 can


see
 this
 in
 what
 the
 president
 is
 doing


in
 Venezuela
 you
 know
 just
 casually


sending
 boats
 there
 bullying
 up
 uh


smuggling
 boats
 and
 also
 this
 past
 week


floating
 out
 the
 possibility
 that
 hey


maybe
 we'll
 have
 land
 troops
 there
 in


Venezuela.
 So,
 as
 we
 all
 know,
 the


government
 in
 Venezuela
 is
 not
 friends


with
 the
 Trump
 administration
 and
 to
 be


frank
 is,
 you
 know,
 doing
 a
 really
 bad


job
 and
 led
 to
 a
 huge
 refugee
 crisis
 of


Venezuelans.


But
 you
 can
 also
 see
 how
 the
 president


is
 acting
 pretty
 aggressively
 to
 the


president
 of
 Colombia
 this
 past
 week,


sanctioning
 him.
 He
 is,
 of
 course,


someone
 who
 is
 uh,
 you
 know,
 not
 friends


with
 the
 president.
 And
 of
 course
 uh
 a


few
 weeks
 ago
 we
 have
 the
 president
 uh


being
 you
 know
 kind
 of
 aggressive


towards
 uh
 Brazil
 and
 President
 Lula


over
 there
 because
 they
 were
 treating


President
 Bolsinaro
 who
 was
 President


Trump's
 friend
 and
 former
 president
 of


Brazil
 very
 poorly.
 So
 in
 many
 ways
 the


United
 States
 is


exerting
 a
 lot
 more
 control
 over
 the


Americas
 and
 it's
 not
 shy
 in
 using
 its


both
 its
 financial
 firepower
 and
 its


military
 might
 to
 do
 that.
 So
 I
 think


this
 is
 something
 that
 is
 uh
 just
 a
 big


shift
 in
 how
 things
 are
 going
 to
 work


and
 this
 is
 just
 the
 first
 year
 in
 the


Trump
 presidency.
 We
 have
 a
 few
 more


years,
 maybe
 more
 than
 a
 few
 more
 years.


We'll
 see.
 Um
 so
 I
 think
 that
 that's
 a


kind
 of
 an
 interesting
 alignment
 and
 you


know
 maybe
 maybe
 it
 will
 be
 good
 for


some
 of
 those
 countries.
 It's
 certainly


been
 good
 for
 Argentina
 if
 he
 can


support
 this
 reformist
 path.
 And
 one


thing
 I'll
 note
 is
 that
 it's
 just
 $20


billion.
 This
 is
 for
 a
 country
 the
 size


of
 the
 United
 States.
 that's
 really


really
 nothing
 and
 if
 it's
 able
 to
 shore


up
 an
 ally
 in
 Argentina


which
 is
 a
 country
 very
 rich
 full
 of


natural
 resources
 that
 seems
 to
 be
 a


pretty
 good
 investment
 and
 also
 the


president
 suggested
 that
 if
 Malay
 uh
 was


not


uh
 if
 election
 didn't
 go
 the
 right
 way


maybe
 you
 wouldn't
 have
 lines
 so


incentive
 for
 other
 for
 the
 voters
 down


there
 to
 think
 about
 that
 all
 right
 the


last
 thing
 that
 I
 want
 to
 talk
 about
 is


of
 course
 gold
 and
 silver
 now
 just
 Last


week
 we
 were
 talking
 about
 how
 gold
 and


silver
 had
 seemingly
 gone
 parabolic.
 And


when
 you're
 in
 these
 parabolic
 phases,


you
 know,
 they
 can
 go,
 you
 know,
 higher


than
 anybody
 can
 expect
 it.
 Uh
 but


historically
 speaking,
 they
 will
 implode


and
 you
 don't
 know
 when
 that
 would


happen.
 So
 it's
 always
 a
 hard
 decision.


Should
 you
 stay
 in?
 Should
 you
 get
 out?


You
 know,
 it's
 a
 very
 painful
 thing
 to


get
 out
 and
 only
 to
 see
 it
 go
 higher


than
 you
 can
 ever
 expect
 and
 then


everyone
 around
 you
 get
 rich.
 But
 then


when
 you
 stay
 in,
 you
 also
 have
 the
 pop


run
 the
 risk
 that
 it
 will
 suddenly


implode.
 And
 that's
 kind
 of
 what


happened
 early
 last
 week.
 So
 we
 saw
 gold


come
 down,
 you
 know,
 5%,
 silver
 even


more.
 It
 was
 one
 of
 the
 largest
 down


moves
 used
 in
 those
 meadows
 for
 for
 over


a
 decade.
 So
 definitely
 a
 very
 painful


episode
 for
 many
 people.
 Now
 there
 were


many
 narratives
 surrounding
 the
 rise
 of


gold
 and
 silver.
 You
 know,
 like
 we


discussed
 last
 week,
 you
 know,
 at
 the


end
 of
 the
 day,
 it's
 just
 momentum.
 Like


a
 lot
 of
 people
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 reasons
 to


buy
 something.
 Uh
 but
 they
 buy
 it,
 price


goes
 up,
 so
 they
 lever
 up
 and
 buy
 more.


More
 leverage
 leads
 to
 higher
 gains,
 but


also
 makes
 it
 more
 fragile.
 And
 you
 can


see
 this
 in
 the
 options
 uh
 data
 in
 GLD


as
 well.
 GLD
 options
 will
 absolutely


surging.
 Again,
 this
 is
 reminiscent
 to
 a


lot
 of
 things
 we
 see
 in
 the
 meme
 stock


world.
 A
 lot
 of
 people
 buy
 calls
 and
 so


forth
 and
 goes
 or
 you
 can
 even
 buy
 puts


to
 protect
 your
 gains.


Um
 but
 of
 course
 well
 when
 the


volatility
 goes
 down
 or
 maybe
 the
 puts


decay
 that
 leads
 to
 upward
 pressure
 as


people
 buy
 back
 their
 hedges
 and
 so


forth.
 So


they
 basically
 squeeze
 this
 higher
 and


in
 from
 a
 cash
 basis.
 You
 can
 also
 see


that
 there
 have
 been
 tremendous
 inflows


into
 GLD
 as
 uh
 more
 and
 more
 investors


chase
 it.
 Now,
 as
 it
 implodes,
 we
 do
 see


some
 notable
 outflows.
 And
 historically


speaking,
 you
 know,
 when
 you
 look
 at


something
 that
 like
 this,
 you
 you
 don't


really
 want
 to
 buy
 it
 because
 you
 have


to
 go
 through
 a
 consolidation
 phase
 as


it
 gradually
 digests
 the
 gains
 and
 then


resumes
 it
 uptrend.
 Now
 for
 gold,
 a


really
 natural
 commonly
 uh
 kind
 of
 a


pullback
 point
 would
 be
 it
 50-day
 moving


average
 which
 you
 can
 see
 is
 around
 37


3,800
 notably
 lower
 than
 we
 are
 today.


So
 one
 scenario
 is
 for
 gold
 you
 know
 you


just
 kind
 of
 consolidate
 sideways
 maybe


for
 a
 few
 weeks
 maybe
 a
 few
 months
 and


uh
 then
 maybe
 resume
 trend
 upwards.


That's
 certainly
 what
 it's
 been
 doing
 uh


for
 the
 past
 several
 years.
 For
 silver


though,
 I
 think
 that's
 a
 whole
 another


story.
 As
 we've
 been
 talking
 about,
 uh,


part
 of
 the
 squeeze
 in
 silver
 is
 just


this
 tremendous
 bizarre
 squeeze
 in


London
 and
 part
 of
 it
 is
 fear
 of
 tariffs


that
 US
 might
 impose
 and
 and
 so
 forth.


So
 silver,
 if
 you
 look
 at
 historically,


it
 tends
 to
 go
 straight
 up
 and
 then
 it


tends
 to
 go
 straight
 down.
 So
 whether
 or


not
 silver
 will
 behave
 like
 gold,
 just


consolidate
 on
 the
 right,
 consolidating


and
 go
 up,
 you
 know,
 that
 historically


it
 hasn't
 done
 that.
 So,
 uh,
 we'll
 see


what
 happens.
 Again,


I
 don't
 know
 what
 the
 future
 holds.


Maybe
 we
 just
 go
 straight
 up
 to
 alltime


highs.
 Uh,
 but
 historically
 speaking,


that
 doesn't
 happen.
 Now,
 this
 coming


week
 is
 going
 to
 be
 a
 super
 super


exciting
 week.
 We
 have
 a
 Fed
 meeting.
 We


have
 President
 Xi
 and
 President
 Trump


meeting
 and
 we
 also
 have
 a
 bunch
 of
 Max


7
 earnings.
 So,
 this
 next
 come
 next
 week


is
 going
 to
 be
 super
 super
 exciting.
 And


of
 course,
 after
 the
 Ted
 meeting,
 I'll


be
 back
 to
 give
 you
 my
 thoughts.
 So


guys,
 can't
 wait
 for
 next
 week
 and
 I'll


talk
 to
 you
 all
 soon.
