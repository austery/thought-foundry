[Music]


hi
 everyone
 today
 we
 are
 talking
 to
 the


man
 that
 makes
 us
 all
 look
 much
 better


in
 photos
 and
 enable
 us
 to
 open
 400


billion
 PDFs
 yearly
 wow
 named
 the
 top
 Co


by
 glass
 store
 based
 on
 employee


feedback
 please
 welcome
 shantanu
 Aran


cheer
 and
 COO
 of
 adobe
 shantanu
 what
 an


honor
 to
 have
 you
 on
 thank
 you
 so
 much


for
 having
 me
 Nikolai
 it's
 a
 pleasure
 to


be
 on
 your
 show
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 have
 um


uh
 have
 heard
 about
 your
 your
 products


and
 they
 use
 your
 things
 every
 day
 but


just
 uh
 uh
 very
 briefly
 what
 are
 the


main
 things
 that
 adobe
 do
 well
 adobe's


uh
 you
 know
 Mission
 has
 always
 been
 uh


changing
 the
 world
 through
 digital


experiences
 and
 you
 know
 the
 company
 was


founded
 uh
 when
 we
 invented
 postcript


which
 was
 the
 way
 that
 people
 actually


printed
 uh
 and
 you
 know
 subsequently


we've
 invented
 many
 groundbreaking


Innovations
 but
 three
 real
 lines
 of


businesses
 uh
 we
 talk
 about
 creativity


so
 any
 piece
 of
 creative
 content
 that


you
 see
 out
 there
 uh
 we
 hope
 a
 piece
 of


adobe
 software
 was
 used
 to
 create
 it


whether
 it's
 packaging
 on
 a
 bottle
 of


water
 whether
 it's
 the
 video
 you're


looking
 on
 a
 web
 whether
 it's
 you
 know
 a


image
 that
 you're
 editing
 the
 second


business
 is
 as
 you
 mention
 so
 so
 in


there
 for
 instance
 you
 would
 have


Photoshop
 as
 one
 of
 the
 products
 exactly


Photoshop
 is
 one
 of
 the
 products


illustrator
 is
 one
 of
 the
 products
 for


vector
 and
 artwork
 and
 logo
 creation


certainly
 Premier
 for
 editing
 videos
 all


the
 special
 effects
 is
 After
 Effects
 uh


and
 so
 so
 that's
 the
 creative
 business


our
 newest
 product
 there
 is
 Express
 uh


which
 is
 enabling
 this
 vision
 for


creativity
 for
 all
 so
 anybody
 who
 is
 a


story
 to
 tell
 whether
 you're
 a
 k


through2
 student
 or
 the
 largest


Enterprise
 in
 the
 world
 that's
 the


creative
 business
 probably
 we're
 best


known
 for
 that
 and
 as
 you
 point
 out
 I


have
 to
 I
 have
 to
 tell
 you
 I
 did
 a


weekend
 course
 in
 Photoshop
 and
 I
 love


it
 so
 much
 fun
 that's
 awesome
 and
 we're


making
 it
 better
 and
 easier
 we
 just


announced
 some
 really
 cool
 stuff
 at
 Max


in
 London
 as
 it
 relates
 to
 how
 we
 use


generative
 AI
 in
 that
 the
 second


business
 is
 uh
 everything
 to
 do
 with
 PDF


and
 we
 call
 that
 accelerating
 document


productivity
 automating
 inefficient


paper-based


processes
 uh
 and
 that
 was
 uh
 you
 know
 as


I
 said
 the
 PDF
 it's
 called
 the
 document


Cloud
 as
 well
 perhaps
 the
 most
 recent


business
 uh
 that
 we
 have
 uh
 incubated


and
 created
 from
 scratch
 is
 enabling
 any


business
 uh
 to
 engage
 digitally
 with


their
 customers
 so
 we
 call
 that
 the


experience
 Cloud
 powering
 uh
 digital


experiences
 for
 Enterprises
 and
 that's


close
 to
 a
 $5
 billion
 business
 for
 us
 as


well
 now
 Nikolai
 so
 uh
 three
 different


areas
 of
 businesses
 that
 adobe
 is
 in
 now


not
 many
 software
 companies
 have
 been


around
 for
 more
 than
 40
 years
 what's


been
 the
 key
 to
 this
 in
 our
 DNA
 I
 would


say
 uh
 at
 our
 core
 we
 recognize
 we're
 a


product
 company
 uh
 and
 as
 long
 as
 you


can
 innovate
 and
 create
 fundamental
 uh


product
 platforms
 that
 stand
 the
 test
 of


time
 I
 mean
 postcript
 is
 still
 you
 know


the
 premier
 way
 in
 which
 people
 print
 uh


Photoshop
 is
 the
 way
 in
 which
 people


edit
 images
 PDF's
 all
 about
 the
 document


platform
 and
 so
 I
 think
 you
 know
 the


reinvention
 uh
 has
 always
 been
 part
 of


the
 DNA
 we
 went
 from
 a
 company
 that
 just


licensed
 software
 for
 a
 few
 Hardware


manufacturers
 when
 we
 did
 postcript
 we


built
 an
 applications
 business
 uh
 as
 you


are
 aware
 we
 completely
 transitioned
 and


we
 were
 the
 first
 major
 software
 company


uh
 to
 transition
 to
 the
 cloud
 and
 then


we
 created
 the
 digital
 marketing


business
 so
 I
 think
 it's
 fundamental


reinvention
 and
 a
 willingness
 to
 make


that
 investment
 to
 invest
 in
 deep


technology
 I
 think
 has
 been
 Key
 to
 Our


Success
 now
 what's
 what's
 kind
 of
 left


in
 the
 company
 from
 the
 founders
 because


you
 talk
 about
 the
 founders
 as
 being


important
 mentors
 for
 you
 as
 well
 well


uh
 you
 know
 uh
 it's
 uh
 interesting


yesterday
 we
 had
 a
 event
 and
 we
 call
 it


the
 founders
 award
 and
 uh
 this
 was


started
 about
 20
 years
 ago
 uh
 Nikolai


and
 I
 I
 think
 you
 know
 when
 John
 and


Chuck
 started
 the
 company
 uh
 the
 two


things
 that
 really
 motivated
 them
 was


the
 what
 and
 you
 know
 how
 can
 you
 have


impact
 with
 fundamental
 Technology


Innovation
 but
 also
 the
 how
 and
 I
 think


Adobe
 has
 always
 been
 a
 company
 that's


been
 known
 for
 uh
 you
 know
 being
 a
 great


place
 to
 work
 and
 the
 founders
 award
 is


given
 to
 people
 who
 represent
 not
 just


what
 they
 do
 but
 how
 they
 do
 it
 and
 so
 I


would
 say
 culture
 uh
 is
 uh
 you
 know


their
 uh
 biggest
 contribution
 to
 the


company
 very
 very
 simply
 they
 used
 to


say
 something
 as
 uh
 straightforward
 as


we
 want
 to
 create
 a
 company
 that
 has


great
 impact
 and
 where
 great
 people
 want


to
 work
 and
 you
 know
 captured
 in
 that


single
 sentence
 actually
 is
 such
 deep


insight
 into
 how
 you
 build
 great
 lasting


companies
 how
 do
 you
 keep
 the
 speed
 up


in
 a
 company
 you
 know
 I've
 seen
 some


research
 on
 an
 Hills
 and
 during
 the


15year
 lifetime
 of
 uh
 of
 an
 anel
 the
 the


speed
 of
 action
 slows
 down
 a
 lot
 so
 that


when
 The
 Neighbor
 an
 attacks
 they


basically
 take
 you
 over
 so
 how
 do
 you


make
 sure
 that
 the
 Adobe
 anel
 isn't


isn't
 killed
 it's
 something
 that
 you


know
 I
 think
 larger
 companies
 have
 to


keep
 working
 on
 maybe
 I
 have
 uh
 you
 know


the
 luxury
 and
 the
 privilege
 of
 having


been
 here
 so
 long
 but
 one
 of
 the
 things


I
 would
 say
 is
 that
 you
 know
 I
 mean


software
 has
 an
 scurve
 right
 and
 so


there
 are
 uh
 things
 at
 the
 beginning
 of


that
 scurve
 where
 you're
 incubating
 or


you're
 investing
 in
 new
 fundamental


platforms
 and
 there
 are
 other
 comp
 other


products
 like
 postcript
 which
 are
 more


mature
 so
 I
 I
 think
 the
 first
 thing
 I


would
 say
 as
 it
 relates
 to
 Pace
 is
 you


have
 to
 be
 aware
 of
 which
 part
 of
 that


scurve
 you
 are
 on
 and
 not
 every
 one
 of


them
 has
 to
 innovate
 at
 that
 pace
 uh


because
 you
 know
 perhaps
 the
 customers


are
 not
 willing
 uh
 to
 even
 welcome
 that


kind
 of


innovation
 uh
 the
 second
 thing
 I
 would


say
 is
 you
 have
 to
 be
 impatient
 but
 it's


uh
 important
 to
 be
 thoughtful
 about
 what


you're
 impatient
 for
 in
 some
 cases
 you


may
 be
 uh
 impatient
 for
 functionality


and
 developing
 a
 product
 in
 some
 cases


you
 may
 be
 impatient
 and
 the
 pace
 is
 all


about
 customer
 acquisition
 in
 other


phases
 it
 may
 be
 about
 revenue
 and
 so
 I


I
 think
 Pace
 to
 your
 point
 is
 a
 really


important
 thing
 uh
 but
 I'm
 not
 sure
 one


size
 fits
 all
 in
 terms
 of
 pace
 and
 so
 if


everybody
 was
 at
 a
 frenetic
 Pace
 uh


maybe
 you're
 not
 actually
 managing
 the


company
 effectively
 enough
 but
 when
 you


need
 that
 sense
 of
 urgency
 uh
 I
 think


one
 of
 the
 ways
 in
 which
 you
 create
 pace


is
 by
 INSP
 iction
 I've
 always
 said


Nikolai
 people
 do
 what
 you
 inspect
 not


what
 you
 expect
 and
 so
 I
 think
 you
 know


constant
 inspection
 and
 making
 sure
 that


as
 Leaders
 we're
 removing
 the
 obstacles


that
 allows
 people
 to
 uh
 proceed
 at
 the


pace
 that
 they
 want
 I
 I
 would
 say
 the


fundamental
 product
 person
 wants
 to
 go


as
 fast
 as
 they
 want
 right
 and
 so
 I


think
 uh
 bureaucracy
 sometimes
 comes
 in


and
 potentially
 slows
 thing
 down
 and
 so


you
 know
 our
 job
 is
 removing
 obstacles


so
 for
 the
 things
 that
 require


incredible
 Pace
 fast
 decision
 making
 are


we
 providing
 the
 environment
 that
 allows


the
 people
 who
 are
 actually
 in
 charge
 of


that
 to
 do
 that
 where
 is
 the
 uh
 border


between
 uh
 inspection
 and
 uh
 uh
 control


and
 micromanagement
 I
 again
 I
 I
 I
 don't


think
 uh
 you
 know
 we
 control
 and


micromanagement
 but
 I
 think
 inspection


is
 really
 important
 I
 mean
 I
 think


that's
 the
 role
 which
 is
 you
 know
 are
 we


clear
 about
 you
 know
 uh
 What
 uh
 uh
 the


teams
 are
 focused
 on
 what
 the
 key


objectives
 are
 and
 uh
 for
 example


yesterday
 you
 know
 AI
 generative
 AI
 is


certainly
 you
 know
 the
 buzz
 around
 uh


the
 industry
 right
 now
 and
 so
 you
 know


when
 you're
 inspecting
 it
 it's
 it's


about
 having
 a
 conversation
 so
 the
 word


inspection
 may
 suggest
 you
 know
 uh
 more


formalism
 but
 I
 think
 having
 that


conversation
 and
 having
 time
 and
 what
 is


our
 most
 valuable
 commodity
 time
 is
 our


most
 valuable
 commodity
 and
 so
 when


you're
 spending
 time
 as
 a
 leadership


team
 as
 well
 as
 with
 individuals
 um
 I
 I


think
 that's
 what
 you
 have
 to
 do
 as
 a


company
 and
 so
 you
 know
 I
 this
 is
 not


about
 micromanagement
 it's
 actually


about
 freeing
 people
 to
 innovate
 at
 the


pace
 at
 which
 they
 want
 but
 if
 decisions


need
 to
 be
 made
 what's
 the
 monetization


how
 are
 we
 going
 to
 go
 to
 market
 who
 are


the
 potential
 Partners
 how
 do
 we
 think


about
 you
 know
 uh
 how
 we
 get
 the
 message


out
 I
 think
 facilitating
 and
 enabling


that
 is
 a
 big
 part
 of
 what
 you
 have
 to


do
 you
 mentioned
 AI
 which
 of
 course
 is


at
 the
 center
 of
 innovation
 just
 now
 and


intuitively
 you
 have
 thought
 that


working
 with
 the
 types
 of
 software
 you


do
 um
 kind
 of
 the
 creative
 processes
 and


so
 on
 AI
 would
 be
 like
 a
 real
 threat
 so


how
 do
 you
 perceive
 it
 every
 single


massive
 technology
 shift
 um
 is
 either
 a


a
 phenomenal
 Tailwind
 if
 you
 Channel
 it


effectively
 or
 to
 your
 point
 it
 can
 be
 a


disruption
 or
 a
 threat
 I
 mean
 when
 you


know
 the
 cloud
 came
 along
 and
 we
 said
 oh


my
 God
 this
 offers
 us
 such
 a
 different


business
 model
 and
 the
 ability
 for
 us
 to


have
 all
 this
 data
 that
 you
 know
 people


can
 have
 access
 to
 their
 creativity


wherever
 they
 go
 when
 mobile
 came
 along


we
 said
 hey
 why
 is
 mobile
 just
 a


consumption
 device
 it
 should
 be
 a


creation
 device
 and
 let's
 enable


creativity
 uh
 you
 know
 on
 a
 mobile


device
 and
 I
 think
 the
 same
 is
 true
 of


uh
 Ai
 and
 generative
 AI
 I
 mean
 the
 buzz


as
 you
 know
 is
 all
 about
 generative
 AI


Derby's
 been
 deploying
 AI
 in
 our


products
 because
 if
 uh
 computers
 what


are
 they
 good
 at
 computer
 Compu
 are
 good


at
 pattern
 matching
 computers
 are
 good


at
 you
 know
 automating
 mundane
 tasks
 and


when
 you
 think
 about
 creativity
 in


particular
 if
 you
 can
 enable
 somebody


who
 has
 this
 creative
 idea
 they're


trying
 to
 create
 something
 they're


trying
 to
 communicate
 something
 but
 the


thing
 that
 they
 fear
 the
 most
 is
 the


blank
 page
 right
 I
 mean
 how
 do
 you
 start


this
 creative
 process
 and
 I
 think


generative
 AI
 is
 this
 massive
 enabler
 to


allow
 people
 if
 you're
 ideating
 or
 if


you're
 prototyping
 or
 if
 you're


brainstorming
 to
 start
 that
 so
 I
 believe


that
 you
 know
 AI
 will
 enable
 people
 to


be
 more
 productive
 they
 will
 uh
 you
 know


eliminate
 mundane
 task
 it
 will
 allow
 you


to
 automate
 things
 that
 need
 to
 happen


and
 it
 will
 allow
 inspiration
 and
 so
 uh


used
 effectively
 any
 piece
 of
 technology


is
 going
 to
 dramatically
 expand
 the


addressable
 Market
 I
 mean
 this
 is
 now


about
 when
 computers
 came
 and
 the
 fact


that
 we
 democratized
 desktop
 publishing


you
 know
 the
 market
 share
 and
 our


install
 base
 went
 up
 dramatically
 when


we
 moved
 to
 the
 cloud
 and
 we
 said
 hey


now
 you
 can
 have
 access
 to
 this
 at
 a


monthly
 subscription
 it
 expanded


dramatically
 when
 we
 added
 mobile


applications
 it
 expanded
 dramatically


and
 I
 think
 the
 same
 is
 true
 I
 think
 you


I
 everybody
 has
 this
 creative
 spark
 and


if
 you
 can
 use
 the
 product
 you
 said
 you


took
 the
 Photoshop
 uh
 lesson
 over
 a


weekend
 we
 just
 want
 you
 to
 be
 able
 to


say
 hey
 I
 want
 to
 take
 this
 image
 I
 want


to
 remove
 this
 I
 want
 to
 have
 a


conversational
 with
 it
 so
 so
 do
 you
 so


do
 you
 think
 generative
 AI
 will
 will


increase
 the
 creativity
 acity
 uh
 the


creative
 activity
 in
 society
 overall


massively
 I
 I
 I
 think
 there's
 no


question
 I
 mean
 when
 you
 think
 about
 all


these
 new
 media
 platforms
 that
 have


emerged
 uh
 every
 one
 of
 them
 has


dramatically
 changed
 it
 now
 that


introduces
 different
 challenges
 which
 is


now
 somebody
 who's
 doing
 that
 creative


expression
 how
 do
 you
 stand
 out
 you
 know


how
 do
 you
 create
 a
 following
 if
 that's


what
 you're
 trying
 to
 create
 but
 the


sheer
 volume
 of
 what
 goes
 on
 is
 going
 to


massively
 increase
 where
 does
 firefly


come
 in
 here
 that's
 one
 of
 your
 products


you
 know
 when
 we
 thought
 about
 AI
 uh


first
 you
 know
 we
 said
 to
 ourselves
 we


represent
 the
 creative
 community
 and
 if


you
 think
 about
 uh
 generative
 AI


specifically
 we
 say
 there
 are
 three


layers
 to
 how
 we
 should
 think
 about
 it


uh
 the
 first
 layer
 is
 the
 interfaces


what
 are
 people
 actually
 using
 and
 how


do
 they
 use
 these
 products
 to
 accomplish


their
 objectives
 because
 I
 think
 you
 and


I
 and
 others
 wake
 up
 in
 the
 morning
 and


we
 don't
 say
 oh
 I
 want
 to
 use
 the
 the


computer
 we
 say
 we
 want
 to
 get
 something


done
 and
 so
 at
 the
 interface
 layer
 what


are
 we
 doing
 to
 enable
 our
 products
 to


be
 simpler
 the
 second
 thing
 we
 said
 is


where
 can
 we
 leverage
 other
 Foundation


models
 that
 exist
 and
 where
 should
 we
 be


creating
 Our
 Own
 Foundation
 models


because
 the
 foundation
 model
 is
 sort
 of


the
 brain
 and
 it's
 the
 center
 of


activity
 of
 what's
 happening
 and
 so
 we


said
 imaging
 video
 we
 need
 to
 create
 our


own
 models
 because
 understanding
 that


process
 of
 what
 the
 models
 really
 can


enable
 somebody
 to
 do
 when
 you
 do


something
 like
 generator
 filp
 perhaps


the
 most
 widely
 adopted
 and
 accelerated


adoption
 of
 a
 feature
 in
 Photoshop
 in


the
 history
 of
 Photoshop
 it
 means
 that


we're
 thinking
 about
 you
 know
 how
 this


product
 can
 be
 used
 to
 accomplish


something
 and
 then
 data
 and
 the
 data
 is


like
 okay
 how
 are
 these
 models
 trained


where
 did
 the
 data
 come
 from
 and
 so
 I


think
 Adobe
 was
 very
 thoughtful
 about


all
 three
 areas
 uh
 We've
 innovated


dramatically
 on
 the
 interface
 layer
 you


can
 now
 with
 reader
 have
 a
 coners


ational
 interface
 in
 experience
 Cloud
 if


you're
 a
 marketer
 you
 can
 say
 hey
 I
 want


to
 run
 a
 campaign
 for
 this
 segment
 and


in
 Photoshop
 you
 can
 do
 things
 and


express
 you
 can
 do
 things
 like


generative
 fill
 and
 an
 AI
 assistant
 that


enables
 you
 to
 take
 what's
 in
 your
 mind


what
 are
 the
 underlying
 models
 you


utilize
 here
 that's
 a
 great
 question
 and


so
 on
 Firefly
 for
 Imaging
 as
 it
 relates


to
 photoshop
 and
 you
 know
 for
 video


we've
 said
 we're
 going
 to
 create
 our
 own


models
 and
 even
 phase
 one
 of
 that
 was


Firefly
 both
 as
 an
 ideation
 and
 a


website
 where
 you
 can
 go
 and
 you
 can


just
 prototype
 things
 and
 you
 can
 ideate


and
 you
 can
 brainstorm
 and
 you
 can
 in
 a


collaborative
 Way
 start
 your
 ideation


process


firefly.com
 represents
 that
 destination


uh
 that
 allows
 people
 to
 do
 you
 know


it's
 a
 playground
 it's
 a
 playground
 for


creativity
 uh
 the
 foundation
 models


we've
 created
 Our
 Own
 Foundation
 models


in
 imaging
 in
 video
 uh
 but
 also
 at
 the


national
 uh
 Association
 of
 broadcasters


Show
 recently
 the
 NAB
 it's
 the
 big
 video


show
 Nikolai
 we
 showed
 how
 we
 can


actually
 integrate
 other
 models
 as
 well


and
 so
 we
 showed
 whether
 you
 in
 Premier


you
 can
 think
 about
 whether
 it's
 open
 AI


Sora
 or
 whether
 it's
 Runway
 ml
 or


whether
 it's
 a
 paa
 you
 can
 actually


create
 and
 integrate
 these
 models
 and
 so


that's
 why
 I
 like
 this
 taxonomy
 that
 we


have
 of
 what
 are
 we
 doing
 at
 the


interface
 layer
 what
 are
 we
 doing
 at
 the


foundation
 models
 layer
 and
 what
 kind
 of


data
 are
 we
 using
 to
 train
 whatever


models
 we
 were
 differentiated
 in
 that
 we


said
 we
 will
 train
 our
 models
 only
 on


daily
 that
 we
 have
 licensed
 for
 and
 so


we
 can
 indemnify
 a
 customer
 like
 you
 and


so
 if
 you're
 using
 our
 model
 we
 can


indemnify
 you
 uh
 but
 you
 know
 the
 world


has
 other
 models
 and
 we
 have
 to
 be


supportive
 of
 the
 other
 models
 that


other
 customers
 might
 using
 so
 Firefly


specifically
 is
 about
 the
 naming
 for
 our


models
 and
 it's
 also
 this
 you
 know


playground
 that
 we
 have
 as
 a
 destination


site
 uh
 we're
 using
 open
 AI
 for
 text
 so


when
 we
 use
 you
 know
 things
 like
 in
 PDF


and
 you
 want
 to
 try
 and
 create
 a
 summary


of
 a
 PDF
 or
 have
 a
 conversational


interface
 we
 will
 support
 it
 but
 we've


also
 described
 how
 other
 large
 language


models
 whether
 it's
 from
 Nvidia
 whether


it's
 from
 Microsoft
 whether
 it's
 from


Google
 whether
 it's
 from
 open
 AI
 we
 will


support
 those
 because
 you
 know
 adobi
 has


always
 won
 in
 recognizing
 that
 there's
 a


heterogeneous
 world
 out
 there
 you
 know


we
 supported
 Mac
 and
 PCs
 from
 day
 one
 we


support
 Android
 and
 iOS
 from
 day
 one
 and


I
 I
 think
 our
 job
 is
 leveraging
 the


platforms
 that
 exist
 and
 AI
 is
 a
 new


platform
 so
 so
 shantu
 so
 when
 now
 open


AI
 comes
 out
 with
 chat
 GPT
 FS
 which


supposedly
 according
 to
 samman
 who
 was


on
 the
 podcast
 um
 says
 it's
 going
 to
 be


100
 times
 more
 complex
 than
 uh
 for
 how


is
 that
 going
 to
 change
 the
 playground


well
 you
 know
 I
 I
 think
 you
 know
 clearly


what
 open
 AI
 is
 on
 is
 this
 sort
 of
 uh


you
 know
 ambitious
 agenda
 to
 do
 AGI


right
 you
 know
 general
 intelligence
 and


I
 think
 when
 you
 think
 about
 what
 will


happen
 with
 the
 next
 version
 of
 Chad
 GPT


you
 know
 we've
 gone
 from
 you
 know
 uh


sort
 of
 summarization
 and
 you
 know


answering
 questions
 uh
 to
 reasoning
 and


so
 I
 think
 you
 know
 we're
 starting
 to


tackle
 some
 of
 these
 hard
 problems
 of


can
 computers
 reason
 I
 mean
 it's


mindboggling
 to
 think
 perhaps
 that
 a


baby
 born
 today
 for
 the
 first
 time


perhaps
 in
 Civilization
 a
 computer
 may


be
 able
 to
 not
 just
 have
 more


information
 than
 a
 baby
 but
 also
 to
 be


reasoned
 better
 than
 a
 baby
 and
 so
 I


think
 what'll
 happen
 with
 the
 next


version
 of
 of
 you
 know
 whether
 it's
 open


AI
 models
 or
 Google's
 models
 or
 the


Adobe
 models
 is
 you
 can
 start
 to
 do


reasoning
 what
 does
 that
 mean
 what
 does


I
 mean
 for
 a
 creative
 when
 you're


thinking
 about
 creating
 an
 image
 it's
 in


you
 know
 it's
 got
 a
 certain
 set
 of


Dimensions
 when
 you
 say
 I
 want
 to
 create


a
 video
 and
 I
 want
 to
 see
 a
 person


walking
 down
 a
 street
 and
 you
 know


crossing
 the
 light
 you
 have
 to


understand
 physics
 right
 I
 mean
 you
 have


to
 understand
 physics
 so
 you
 don't
 go
 in


the
 ground
 you
 have
 to
 understand


physics
 so
 you
 don't
 hit
 you
 know
 the
 uh


building
 that
 you're
 walking
 into
 and
 so


I
 think
 we're
 going
 to
 start
 to
 expand


on
 this
 model
 of
 you
 know
 thinking
 about


reasoning
 certainly
 resolution
 certainly


you
 know
 inference
 and
 as
 you
 know
 with


AI
 uh
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 activity
 that's


right
 now
 happening
 with
 training
 which


is
 everybody's
 training
 these
 models
 the


real
 value
 is
 going
 to
 come
 from


inference
 right
 and
 how
 people
 use
 it


and
 I
 think
 financial
 services
 companies


like
 you
 you're
 going
 to
 use
 AI
 to
 do


Financial
 reasoning
 and
 perhaps
 you
 know


faster
 invest


uh
 you
 know
 decisions
 and
 so
 I
 think


we're
 walking
 up
 the
 stack
 from
 you
 know


just
 being
 able
 to
 do
 something
 like
 a


text
 to
 an
 image
 or
 you
 know
 a
 prompt


creating
 a
 a
 Pros
 to
 how
 do
 I
 reason
 and


how
 do
 I
 think
 about
 it
 and
 it's


exciting
 but
 are
 you
 worried
 that


there'll
 be
 one
 of
 these
 models
 which


means
 that
 you
 don't
 need
 your
 overlay
 I


I
 don't
 think
 so
 Ian
 what
 I
 always
 says


people
 who
 use
 AI
 will
 replace
 people


who
 don't
 use
 AI
 um
 and
 you
 know
 I
 mean


I
 mean
 everybody
 talks
 about
 this
 is


going
 to
 replace
 humans
 well
 the
 place


where
 AI
 is
 probably
 the
 most
 advanced


is
 in
 software
 writing
 uh
 right
 I
 mean


when
 you
 think
 about
 what's
 happened


with
 the
 ability
 to
 say
 I
 want
 to
 create


a
 program
 uh
 that's
 what's
 the
 most


expansive
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 uh
 you
 know
 at


your
 institution
 you're
 reducing
 the


number
 of
 software
 engineers
 and


developers
 we're
 all
 saying
 how
 do
 we


make
 them
 more
 productive
 how
 do
 we


allow
 them
 to
 you
 know
 do
 more
 at
 the


same
 cost
 so
 there
 will
 be
 an
 efficiency


increase
 and
 I
 do
 think
 there
 like


every
 generation
 of
 Technology
 some


things
 will
 get
 disrupted
 but
 overall
 it


creates
 more
 opportunity
 and
 I
 certainly


believe
 that
 for
 creativity
 I
 mean
 how


worried
 about
 are
 you
 about
 deep
 fakes
 I


mean
 you
 should
 be
 the
 world
 you
 should


be
 the
 world
 champion
 in
 deep
 fakes
 I


that's
 a
 great
 question
 and
 I'll
 get
 to


that
 but
 I
 the
 thing
 I
 wanted
 to
 say
 on


that
 previous
 question
 also
 was
 that
 you


know
 you
 need
 a
 soul
 for
 creativity
 and


you
 know
 I
 think
 that's
 the
 part
 where


human
 Ingenuity
 will
 always
 be
 good
 uh


deep
 fix
 we
 actually
 started
 uh
 when


when
 we
 thought
 about
 Adobe
 and
 we
 said


listen
 we
 create
 the
 world's
 content
 and


it's
 really
 critical
 for
 us
 to
 also
 take


responsibility
 for
 what's
 happening
 with


content
 and
 so
 we
 created
 this
 thing
 you


know
 it's
 called
 Uh
 content
 credentials


think
 of
 it
 as
 a
 nutrition
 label
 uh


Nikolai
 and
 when
 we
 started
 this
 we
 said


um
 we
 have
 one
 part
 in
 the
 chain
 uh
 but


we
 have
 now
 got
 thousands
 of
 parts


Partners
 who've
 signed
 up
 for
 this


content
 uh
 authenticity
 initiative
 as


it's
 called
 and
 what
 the
 content


authenticity
 initiative
 is
 camera


manufacturers
 when
 they
 take
 a
 picture


they're
 putting
 like
 a
 digital
 signature


on
 that
 picture
 saying
 it
 was
 created


with
 this
 camera
 at
 this
 time
 taken
 by


Nikolai
 when
 you
 edit
 it
 in
 our
 piece
 of


software
 we
 stamp
 that
 with
 you
 know


what's
 happened
 if
 somebody
 who's
 in
 the


content
 distribution
 game
 you
 know


whether
 it's
 meta
 whether
 it's
 New
 York


Times
 whether
 it's
 the
 BBC
 they've
 all


signed
 up
 to
 carry
 those
 credentials
 so


I
 think
 the
 plumbing
 and
 the


infrastructure
 for
 deep
 fakes
 is
 all


there
 I'll
 tell
 you
 what
 the
 the
 real


challenge
 is
 so
 when
 you
 talk
 about
 deep


fix
 the
 ability
 to
 look
 at
 the
 provence


of
 a
 piece
 of
 content
 is
 all
 there
 the


question
 is
 will
 a
 consumer
 want
 to
 see


where
 that
 came
 from
 who
 created
 it
 who


might
 have
 changed
 it
 and
 so
 now
 we
 have


this
 ability
 we're
 working
 with
 the
 US


government
 you
 you
 know
 50%
 I
 think
 it's


50%
 of
 the
 world's
 population
 is
 going


to
 have
 an
 election
 I
 think
 in
 a


12-month
 period
 some
 of
 them
 have


certainly
 happened
 uh
 and
 so
 in
 that


particular
 context
 what
 we
 are
 saying
 is


when
 you
 see
 a
 piece
 of
 content
 you
 can


see
 this
 label
 which
 says
 you
 know
 it


says
 content
 credential
 think
 of
 it
 as
 a


nutrition
 label
 if
 you
 click
 on
 it
 it


will
 tell
 you
 it
 will
 tell
 you
 who


created
 it
 when
 it
 was
 created
 when
 it


was
 perhaps
 altered
 the
 question
 is
 how


many
 people
 actually
 read
 the
 nutrition


label
 when
 you're
 eating
 food
 and
 it's


the
 same
 issue
 with
 content
 how
 many


people
 are
 going
 to
 say
 I
 want
 to
 know


where
 that
 piece
 of
 content
 was
 created


so
 I
 would
 say
 the
 technology
 companies


the
 people
 Distributing
 this
 media
 we've


all
 participated
 in
 the
 Deep
 fakes
 uh


you
 know
 sort
 of
 uh
 life
 cycle
 to


understand
 how
 we
 can
 bring
 that
 value


now
 the
 consumer
 has
 to
 say
 uh
 when


somebody
 uh
 that
 you
 know
 is
 saying
 I


want
 to
 see
 that
 piece
 of
 content
 are


they
 going
 to
 insist
 on
 evaluating
 the


content
 credential
 cuz
 we
 neither
 you


nor
 I
 can
 come
 in
 the
 way
 of
 people


creating
 content
 it's
 the
 question
 is


the
 consumer
 how
 much
 do
 they
 care
 about


where
 they
 came
 from
 hopefully
 that


makes
 sense
 absolutely
 the
 development


in
 this
 field
 is
 uh
 I
 mean
 the
 speed
 is


just
 unbelievable
 right
 the
 speed
 the


brain
 supplied
 here
 unlimited
 amount
 of


capital
 you
 know
 the
 curves
 are
 just


exponential
 uh
 to
 a
 degree
 we'
 never


seen
 before
 you
 and
 I
 we
 are
 we
 are
 of


course
 uh
 still
 a
 very
 young
 and
 uh
 and


so
 on
 but
 we
 you
 know
 we're
 not
 like
 22


do
 you
 think
 um
 do
 you
 think
 it's
 a


disadvantage
 for
 us
 to
 really
 understand


and
 grasp
 the
 possibilities
 here
 is
 is


your
 experience
 good
 or
 bad
 again
 I
 I
 I


think
 it
 puts
 puts
 more
 uh
 you
 know
 of
 a


challenge
 for
 us
 it
 it
 for
 sure
 Keeps
 Us


young
 right
 yes
 I
 I
 think
 it
 keeps
 us


young
 and
 you
 know
 I
 mean
 the
 best
 part


of
 my
 job
 is
 when
 I
 can
 just
 sit
 down


with
 10
 people
 that
 we've
 hired
 from


University
 or
 people
 who
 are
 heading
 up


this
 research
 and
 say
 educate
 me
 right
 I


mean
 educate
 me
 on
 that
 and
 I
 think
 you


know
 you
 have
 to
 recognize
 your
 role
 uh


in
 the
 company
 Nikolai
 which
 is
 my
 role


is
 not
 you
 know
 understanding
 to
 the


minut
 detail
 the
 difference
 between
 a


diffusion
 model
 and
 a
 Transformer
 model


and
 the
 math
 associated
 with
 that
 but


the
 implications
 of
 what
 that
 means
 and


how
 do
 we
 Channel
 you
 know
 uh
 people


into
 you
 know
 align
 them
 into
 create


whatever
 objectives
 they
 are
 and
 then


how
 do
 we
 support
 it
 and
 so
 I
 I
 think


our
 role
 changes
 as
 it
 relates
 to
 in
 an


organization
 leading
 it
 and
 then
 as


consumers
 you
 know
 you
 know
 we
 will
 see


the
 benefits
 right
 we
 will
 see
 the


benefits
 when
 we
 go
 to
 a
 website
 and


somebody
 knows
 exactly
 who
 we
 are
 you


know
 this
 is
 our
 experience
 Cloud


opportunity
 I
 mean
 the
 experience
 Cloud


vision
 for
 Adobe
 was
 born
 with
 this


Insight
 that
 when
 we
 moved
 our
 entire


business
 model
 uh
 from
 a
 two-tier


distribution
 model
 to
 engaging
 directly


with
 customers
 on
 the
 website
 we
 were


like
 hey
 we
 should
 build
 the


infrastructure
 nobody
 has
 automated


marketing
 right
 I
 mean
 supply
 chain
 was


automated
 Finance
 was
 automated
 HR
 was


automated
 but
 how
 many
 times
 do
 you
 go


to
 a
 website
 Nikolai
 and
 you're
 like
 why


doesn't
 it
 know
 everything
 that
 I've


done
 with
 this
 website
 and
 why
 do
 I
 have


to
 enter
 my
 data
 and
 why
 can't
 it
 tell


me
 if
 I
 like
 this
 piece
 of
 content
 hey


give
 me
 five
 recommendations
 that
 are


truly
 relevant
 for
 me
 and
 so
 I
 think
 AI


is
 going
 to
 be
 you
 so
 as
 consumers
 I


think
 you
 and
 I
 will
 certainly


experience
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 benefits
 of
 this


but
 as
 people
 running
 large


organizations
 I
 think
 our
 job
 is


understanding
 the
 technology
 to
 a
 level


so
 that
 we
 can
 actually
 appreciate
 uh


what
 it
 can
 and
 cannot
 do
 but
 then


channeling
 That
 Into
 You
 know
 really


understanding
 how
 we
 evolve
 our


businesses
 to
 take
 advantage
 of
 it
 and


not
 have
 our
 head
 in
 the
 sand
 no


shantanu
 you're
 a
 sailor
 so
 just
 to
 use


a
 sailing
 term
 here
 let's
 change
 Tac
 and


uh
 and
 uh
 sail
 back
 to
 uh
 to
 India
 where


you
 where
 you
 grew
 up
 now
 how
 do
 you


think
 your
 Indian
 upbringing
 shaped
 you


well
 you
 know
 I
 I
 I
 think
 growing
 up
 in


India
 there
 were
 a
 few
 things
 uh
 that


were
 true
 when
 I
 grew
 up
 that
 are
 again


still
 certainly
 true
 I
 mean
 the
 first


was
 uh
 the
 importance
 of
 Education
 I


mean
 I
 was
 really
 fortunate
 my
 parents


emphasized
 very
 deeply
 uh
 the
 need
 for


me
 to
 invest
 in
 myself
 I
 mean
 investment


in
 education
 is
 an
 investment
 in


yourself
 and
 so
 I
 you
 know
 I
 I
 think
 the


first
 thing
 that
 was
 uh
 really


inculcated
 in
 me
 my
 mother
 actually


taught
 she
 was
 a
 professor
 of
 American


literature
 so
 I
 think
 they
 instilled
 in


me
 this
 curiosity
 my
 father
 was
 an


entrepreneur
 and
 so
 you
 know
 I
 I
 learned


from
 him
 you
 know
 how
 one
 you
 know
 has


to
 innovate
 and
 um
 I
 think
 the
 other


part
 of
 the
 Indian
 culture
 that
 has


certainly
 served
 me
 well
 is
 we
 tend
 to


take
 a
 longterm
 View
 and
 so
 you
 know
 I


think
 all
 of
 us
 running
 companies
 yes


table
 Stakes
 is
 executing
 on
 it
 on
 a


quarter
 by
 quarter
 basis
 but
 fundamental


Innovation
 takes
 time
 so
 I
 would
 say
 uh


the
 importance
 of
 Education
 intellectual


curiosity
 and
 you
 know
 taking
 this
 long


uh
 term
 View
 and
 outlook
 on
 how
 you


build
 a
 business
 uh
 that
 is
 built
 for


greatness
 I
 think
 those
 were
 the
 two


things
 that
 perhaps
 you
 know
 I
 was
 I
 was


really
 influenced
 from
 my
 uh
 culture
 do


you
 think
 that's
 something
 you
 have
 in


common
 with
 the
 likes
 of
 SAA
 Adela
 AJ


banga
 and
 the
 other
 top
 Indian
 leaders


in
 America
 well
 the
 two
 that
 you


mentioned
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 you
 know


Nikolai
 all
 three
 of
 us
 went
 to
 the
 same


high
 school
 I
 know
 yeah
 and
 so
 I
 I
 think


we
 do
 I
 mean
 you
 know
 the
 other
 you
 know


it's
 so
 gratifying
 to
 see
 uh
 you
 know
 so


many
 and
 it's
 pretty
 it's
 pretty
 amazing


how
 many
 high
 schools
 are
 there
 in
 India


oh
 there
 hundreds
 of
 I
 mean
 you
 know
 the


thing
 that
 India
 does
 have
 is
 a


population
 right
 when
 you
 have
 a
 billion


but
 uh
 this
 was
 in
 a
 a
 town
 called


Hyderabad
 which
 has
 now
 become
 the


epicenter
 for
 you
 know
 a
 lot
 of


technology
 in
 those
 days
 and
 uh
 this
 was


an
 incredible
 school
 it
 was
 modeled


after
 a
 British
 public
 school
 they


really
 uh
 emphasized
 an
 all
 around


education
 but
 if
 you
 think
 about
 it
 in


that
 you
 know
 I
 came
 to
 this
 country
 in


1984
 60
 or
 70%
 of
 my
 graduating
 class


would
 come
 to
 the
 US
 for
 higher
 studies


I
 mean
 you
 know
 the
 US
 was
 this


phenomenal
 place
 where
 uh
 it
 allowed


people
 to
 come
 you
 know
 it
 was
 the
 land


it
 is
 the
 land
 of
 opportunity
 and
 it


gave
 us
 you
 know
 this
 gift
 of
 Education


uh
 I
 would
 say
 today
 not
 a
 lot
 of
 those


people
 are
 coming
 right
 I
 mean
 from
 uh


institutions
 in
 India
 maybe
 5%
 of
 people


are
 coming
 because
 there's
 so
 much


opportunity
 in
 India
 I
 mean
 you
 know
 I


think
 the
 economy
 in
 India
 is
 exploding


and
 perhap
 I
 have
 said
 if
 I
 was


graduating
 right
 now
 I'm
 not
 sure
 I


would
 come
 to
 the
 US
 given
 how
 much


opportunity
 there
 was
 but
 to
 answer
 your


question
 in
 those
 days
 the
 entire


generation
 of
 people
 who
 are
 now
 you


know
 uh
 in
 the
 US
 we
 all
 came
 here
 we


came
 here
 to
 pursue
 a
 MERS
 in
 computer


science
 or
 a
 PhD
 or
 an
 MBA
 and
 we
 stayed


because
 here's
 where
 the
 opportunity
 is


now
 there's
 clearly
 a
 reverse
 uh
 you


know
 migration
 and
 then
 there
 was
 a
 time


when
 when
 you
 guys
 went
 through
 kind
 of


the
 glass
 ceiling
 and
 certainly


everybody
 needed
 to
 have
 an
 Indian
 CEO


to
 be
 credible
 well
 I
 was
 fortunate
 I


mean
 I
 I
 have
 to
 say
 I
 was
 per
 you
 know


perhaps
 one
 of
 the
 more
 uh
 tenured
 CEOs


and
 you
 know
 when
 when
 I
 got
 my
 job
 uh


in
 2007
 as
 CEO
 I
 mean
 I
 was
 it
 was
 a


incredible
 honor
 for
 me
 Nikolai
 and
 uh


it's
 so
 gratifying
 to
 see
 what
 Satya
 and


Sund
 and
 you
 know
 uh
 certainly
 Arin
 in


Tech
 and
 lakman
 in
 Starbucks
 and
 you


know
 every
 time
 you
 read
 about
 another


Indian
 you
 know
 your
 your
 heart
 fills


with
 pride
 you
 mentioned
 um
 that
 you


were
 long-term
 that
 you
 worked
 um
 on


strategy
 for
 a
 longer
 period
 of
 time
 SAA


Adela
 he
 uh
 talks
 about
 the
 importance


of
 empathy
 uh
 you
 talks
 about
 you
 talk


about
 you
 know
 mentoring
 coaching
 and
 so


on
 um
 if
 you
 were
 to
 elaborate
 a
 bit
 on


what
 being
 Indian
 means
 to
 leadership
 I


I
 would
 say
 the
 thing
 growing
 up
 in


India
 especially
 people
 in
 my
 generation


you
 had
 to
 be
 incredibly
 resourceful
 you


know
 there's
 this
 Indian
 expression
 I


don't
 know
 if
 you've
 heard
 of
 it
 called


jugad
 and
 what
 jugad
 means
 is
 you
 know


it's
 a
 way
 of
 hey
 people
 will
 figure


things
 out
 and
 you
 know
 growing
 up
 in


India
 not
 everything
 I
 mean
 there
 so


much
 bureaucracy
 if
 you
 wanted
 to
 get


anything
 done
 you
 had
 to
 be
 incredibly


resourceful
 I
 don't
 take
 no
 for
 an


answer
 when
 I
 want
 something
 done
 I'm


like
 okay
 let's
 keep
 brainstorming
 let's


keep
 thinking
 and
 you
 know
 I
 I'd
 rather


you
 know
 Aspire
 for
 something
 incredibly


and
 fall
 a
 little
 short
 then
 you
 know


try
 and
 just
 set
 your
 bar
 so
 low
 that


you
 can
 easily
 cross
 it
 I'll
 tell
 you


one
 thing
 shant
 if
 I
 had
 taken
 no


pronoun
 we
 wouldn't
 have
 gotten
 you
 on


these
 podcasts
 because
 uh
 you're
 not
 an


easy
 man
 to
 get
 I
 apologize
 for
 that
 I


apologize


you
 you
 said
 that
 you
 said
 that
 if
 you


were
 young
 again
 you
 would
 probably
 stay


in
 India
 how
 do
 you
 see
 the
 development


in
 India
 going
 forward


now
 I
 I
 think
 it's
 just
 incredible
 I


mean
 the
 investment
 in
 infrastructure


that
 we've
 done
 education
 was
 always
 you


know
 important
 I
 think
 you
 pointed
 out


earlier
 access
 to
 Capital
 in
 AI
 um
 and


you
 know
 I
 think
 the
 people
 growing
 up


there
 uh
 you
 know
 the
 world
 is
 more
 flat


uh
 I
 I
 worry
 nowadays
 sometimes
 that


postco
 people
 are
 building
 up
 walls


again
 uh
 but
 I
 would
 say
 the
 Indian


entrepreneur
 today
 when
 I
 grew
 up
 the


Indian
 entrepreneur
 was
 focused
 on


making
 a
 market
 in
 India
 uh
 today
 the


Indian
 entrepreneur
 has
 Global


aspirations
 you
 know
 you
 have
 access
 to


Capital
 you
 have
 access
 to
 talent
 and


you
 know
 all
 of
 them
 are
 focused
 on
 you


know
 how
 you
 can
 create
 it
 and
 you
 know


there's
 something
 so
 natural
 about
 being


in
 the
 culture
 that
 you
 grew
 up
 with
 I


mean
 all
 of
 us
 as
 immigrants
 to
 this


country
 had
 to
 adapt
 to
 the
 US
 and
 so
 um


I
 when
 I
 grew
 up
 there
 wasn't
 really


uh
 tech
 industry
 in
 India
 that's
 changed


there
 wasn't
 access
 to
 Capital
 I
 I
 I


think
 you
 know
 when
 I
 grew
 up
 um
 when


you
 took
 a
 loan
 from
 A
 bank
 to
 set
 up
 a


firm
 I
 mean
 the
 interest
 rates
 were


something
 like
 18
 or
 20%
 I
 mean
 you
 know


prohibitively
 expensive
 to
 create


businesses
 the
 notion
 of
 equity
 and


Venture
 Capital
 just
 didn't
 exist
 and
 so


but
 you
 know
 this
 is
 where
 I
 think
 it


doesn't
 matter
 whether
 it's
 Hyderabad
 or


you
 know
 rest
 or
 or
 other
 places
 I
 mean


access
 to
 talent
 and
 capital
 has
 become


a
 worldwide
 phenomenon
 and
 I
 really
 hope


that
 you
 know
 postco
 I
 know
 these
 Supply


chains
 everybody
 has
 said
 hey
 we
 need
 to


have
 our
 supply
 chains
 closer
 to
 us
 but


there's
 such
 a
 power
 of
 having
 free


trade
 across
 the
 the
 globe
 which
 I
 hope


we
 don't
 you
 know
 go
 away
 from
 that
 what


have
 you
 taken
 from
 sailing
 you


represented
 IND
 giant
 sailing
 uh
 you


know
 sailing
 in
 those
 days
 was
 uh
 you


know
 just
 an
 incredible
 passion
 I
 mean


you
 were
 one
 with
 nature
 and
 maybe
 one


of
 the
 things
 you
 recognize
 is
 you
 know


to
 some
 degree
 when
 you're
 sailing
 I
 I


understand
 you
 are
 also
 uh
 you
 know


passionate
 about
 sailing
 I'm
 you
 know


you're
 with
 this
 force
 of
 Nature
 and
 you


recognize
 to
 some
 degree
 you
 know
 that


you're
 a
 small
 small
 Cog
 in
 in
 the
 world


but
 you're
 then
 trying
 to
 channel
 this


wind
 and
 you
 know
 the
 waves
 I
 mean
 you


know
 sailing
 in
 Bombay
 where
 you're


sailing
 in
 the
 waves
 was
 just
 this
 it's


this
 incredible
 Rush
 that
 comes
 you
 know


and
 comparatively
 how
 you
 constantly


trying
 to
 improve
 uh
 um
 sadly
 I've
 given


up
 sailing
 Nikolai
 when
 I
 came
 to
 this


country
 I
 said
 you
 know
 U
 education
 was


the
 thing
 I
 focused
 on
 and
 family
 and


now
 golf
 is
 the
 thing
 but
 I'll
 tell
 you


what
 I
 like
 with
 sailing
 you
 know
 you


could
 be
 you
 could
 be
 in
 the
 lead
 and


then
 the
 win
 changes
 yep
 and
 you
 are


lost
 next
 race
 you
 have
 to
 take
 the
 same


amount
 of
 risk
 and
 so
 uh
 it's
 so
 so


let's
 say
 you
 do
 you
 think
 about
 table


tennis
 there
 are
 just
 no
 external


factors
 sailing
 max
 amount
 of
 external


factors
 and
 so
 I
 just
 think
 there's
 so


much
 to
 learn
 from
 it
 I
 agree
 how
 often


do
 you
 get
 to
 sale
 way
 too
 little


because
 uh
 I'm
 in
 the
 office
 too


much
 um
 now
 you
 are
 one
 of
 the
 um
 most


well-liked
 CEOs
 uh
 and
 we
 see
 that
 from


surveys
 at
 glore
 and
 so
 on
 what
 um
 is
 it


important
 for
 a
 leader
 to
 be
 liked
 you


know
 I
 hope
 people
 would
 say
 they


respect
 me
 more
 than
 they
 like
 me
 and
 I


think
 you
 know


um
 I'm
 also
 very
 transparent
 about
 the


values
 uh
 you
 know
 that
 are
 important
 to


me
 we
 talk
 about
 creating
 the
 future
 we


talk
 about
 being
 genuine
 we
 talk
 about


you
 know
 owning
 the
 outcome
 and
 raising


the
 bar
 and
 if
 I
 model
 those
 values
 then


you
 know
 people
 hopefully
 at
 least
 say


um
 that
 you
 know
 he
 he's
 true
 to
 what
 he


uh
 stands
 for
 and
 I
 think
 people
 would


say
 I'm
 I'm
 I'm
 approachable
 and
 you


know
 I
 I
 I
 like
 that
 we
 are
 a
 very


egalitarian
 company
 and
 it's
 the
 way


Silicon
 Valley
 is
 but
 you
 know
 every


time
 you
 get
 that
 I
 will
 say
 it's


humbling
 it's
 humbling
 to
 hear
 that
 the


things
 that
 you
 do
 are
 appreciated
 by


people
 how
 do
 you
 coach
 people
 you
 know


early
 in
 my
 career
 I
 I
 had
 this


incredible
 mentor
 and
 um
 he
 challenged


me
 a
 lot
 uh
 I
 think
 in
 me
 he
 saw
 you


know
 a
 spark
 of
 somebody
 who
 could


potentially
 accomplish
 something
 and
 it


was
 a
 different
 management
 style
 and
 you


know
 initially
 I
 struggled
 with
 it
 a


little
 bit
 because
 he
 would
 ask
 me
 to
 do


something
 and
 I
 get
 it
 done
 and
 he's


like
 yeah
 yeah
 whatever
 you
 know
 that


was
 yesterday
 why
 aren't
 you
 doing
 this


and
 why
 aren't
 you
 doing
 that
 and
 he


would
 always
 push
 me
 and
 challenge
 me


and
 later
 I
 realized
 that
 you
 know
 I
 he


saw
 in
 me
 something
 hopefully
 that
 he


said
 this
 guy
 is
 capable
 of
 more
 and
 my


job
 is
 pushing
 him
 to
 do
 more
 and
 I


would
 say
 that
 influenced
 me
 a
 lot
 as
 my


management
 style
 which
 is
 my
 style
 is


all
 about
 saying
 how
 do
 you
 set


unreasonable
 expectations
 and
 people


amaze
 you
 with
 the
 Ingenuity
 and
 so
 um


hopefully
 I'm
 providing
 opportunity
 to


people
 um
 I
 believe
 in
 a
 in
 a
 management


style
 with
 the
 leadership
 team


especially
 at
 the
 executive
 team
 where


yes
 they
 all
 wear
 a
 functional
 hat
 you


might
 run
 a
 business
 you
 might
 be
 your


CFO
 you
 might
 be
 hit
 of
 uh
 you
 know


people
 you
 might
 be
 your
 GC
 but
 first


and
 foremost
 you're
 all
 people
 who


represent
 as
 the
 executive
 team
 the


company
 and
 so
 that's
 been
 my
 management


style
 which
 is
 like
 I'm
 very
 I


information
 in
 too
 many
 companies
 was


deemed
 to
 be
 power
 I
 have
 exactly
 the


opposite
 leadership
 style
 I
 believe
 you


give
 people
 access
 to
 information
 and


that's
 what
 makes
 them
 more
 productive


so
 I
 I
 would
 say
 you
 know
 again
 there


isn't
 one
 style
 that
 works
 I'm
 not
 you


know
 arrogant
 enough
 to
 believe
 that


that's
 the
 way
 one
 should
 operate
 but
 if


people
 know
 what
 your
 style
 is
 then


hopefully
 you
 know
 the
 people
 who


Embrace
 that
 style
 and
 resonate
 with
 how


they
 want
 to
 be
 managed
 they
 can
 Thrive


and
 so
 that's
 that's
 how
 would
 coach


which
 is
 like
 I'm
 always
 available
 I'm


accessible
 hopefully
 people
 wouldn't
 say


I'm
 not
 a
 microman
 but
 but
 and
 somebody


gave
 me
 this
 expression
 so
 I
 I
 will
 uh


you
 know
 give
 credit
 to
 them
 which
 is


they
 said
 management
 for
 me
 is
 a
 little


bit
 of
 you
 have
 to
 have
 your
 head
 in
 the


cloud
 and
 your
 feet
 on
 the
 ground
 and
 I


am
 in
 the
 details
 Nikolai
 as
 well


because
 I
 believe
 that
 if
 you're
 not
 in


the
 details
 and
 if
 you
 don't
 have
 I
 I


don't
 know
 how
 you
 set
 a
 vision
 for
 the


company
 without
 understanding
 a
 little


bit
 of
 the
 details
 and
 conversely
 if


you're
 only
 in
 the
 details
 and
 you're


not
 you
 know
 uh
 uh
 setting
 a
 vision
 so


you
 know
 but
 my
 management
 style
 is


evolving
 and
 one
 last
 thing
 but
 but
 you


you
 because
 you
 mentioned
 three
 things


uh
 plant
 the
 flag
 Road
 building
 and
 and


um
 unreasonable
 expectations
 what
 is
 it


mean
 to
 plant
 the
 flag
 I
 think
 planting


the
 flag
 when
 we
 started
 off
 uh
 I'll


give
 you
 an
 experience
 with
 this
 uh
 you


know
 I'll
 give
 you
 the
 experience
 Cloud


business
 when
 I
 took
 over
 in
 2009
 we


bought
 this
 company
 called
 in
 2007
 in


2009
 we
 bought
 omniture
 omniture
 was
 all


about
 you
 know
 uh
 getting
 analytics
 and


we
 said
 hey
 data
 is
 going
 to
 be


important
 and
 analytics
 is
 going
 to
 be


important
 um
 and
 we
 said
 you
 know
 why
 is


it
 that
 uh
 Adobe
 was
 always
 about
 the


art
 we
 allowed
 creativity
 but
 we
 weren't


about
 the
 science
 you
 know
 that
 old


marketing
 adage
 50%
 of
 my
 marketing
 is


working
 I
 just
 don't
 know
 which
 50%
 so


we
 said
 we
 should


create
 the
 new
 Next
 Generation
 marketing


stack
 and
 why
 is
 it
 that
 digital


marketing
 does
 doesn't
 exist
 we
 didn't


really
 know
 at
 that
 point
 everything


that
 needed
 to
 be
 done
 and
 how
 that
 were


evolved
 but
 you
 get
 comfortable
 with


ambiguity
 I
 think
 as
 Leaders
 you
 and
 I


have
 to
 get
 very
 comfortable
 with


ambiguity
 and
 so
 that
 was
 for
 me


planting
 the
 flag
 which
 is
 saying
 we're


going
 to
 go
 create
 this
 stack
 and
 how


did
 you
 build
 a
 road
 then
 well
 you
 build


the
 road
 you
 know
 uh
 we
 said
 to
 our


board
 when
 we
 actually
 acquired
 omniture


that
 this
 is
 going
 to
 be
 one
 of
 many
 and


we
 have
 to
 through
 both
 organic


Innovation
 and
 inorganic
 acquisition
 so


you
 know
 we
 bought
 omniture
 then
 we


bought
 day
 software
 we
 built
 a
 real-time


CDP
 uh
 completely
 from
 scratch
 the


experience
 Cloud
 you
 know
 now
 a
 7800


million
 business
 we
 build
 that


completely
 from
 scratch
 and
 so
 uh
 you


understand
 what
 the
 building
 blocks
 are


um
 associated
 with
 it
 and
 you're


ruthless
 about
 execution
 um
 and
 you
 know


you
 keep
 going
 from
 the
 long
 range
 what


you're
 trying
 to
 accomplish
 in
 the
 short


range
 and
 uh
 that's
 what
 I
 say
 and
 I
 I


was
 perhaps
 when
 I
 took
 over
 uh
 in
 all


cander
 I
 was
 probably
 better
 at
 the
 road


building
 because
 I
 was
 Chief
 Operating


Officer
 and
 I
 needed
 to
 get
 my
 head


around
 everything
 but
 you
 realize
 when


you're
 in
 a
 room
 and
 you're
 trying
 to


motivate
 or
 inspire
 a
 room
 50%
 of
 the


room
 probably
 doesn't
 care
 about
 what


they
 want
 to
 do
 tomorrow
 they
 want
 to


know
 what
 hill
 you
 want
 them
 to
 climb


and
 you
 know
 what
 is
 the
 you
 know
 are


you're
 trying
 to
 win
 a
 World
 Series
 what


are
 you
 trying
 to
 do
 that's
 planting
 the


flag
 the
 other
 half
 of
 the
 room
 doesn't


care
 about
 you
 know
 where
 you
 want
 to
 go


they're
 like
 hey
 tell
 me
 what
 I
 want
 to


do
 because
 I
 feel
 motivated
 by
 that
 and


so
 as
 Leaders
 we
 have
 to
 change
 our


management
 style
 to
 inspire
 people
 to
 do


their
 best
 if
 we
 don't
 recognize
 that


then
 I
 think
 we
 are
 not
 recognizing
 what


our
 jobs
 are
 which
 is
 our
 job
 is
 making


them
 productive
 our
 job
 is
 not
 saying


hey
 you
 got
 to
 manage
 the
 uh
 the
 way
 I


want
 you
 to
 and
 so
 I
 think
 recognizing


that
 they're
 different
 people
 with


different
 motivations
 who
 get
 inspired


by
 different
 things
 and
 can
 cont


contribute
 in
 different
 ways
 you
 also


say
 that
 part
 of
 your
 job
 is
 to
 set


unreasonable
 expectations
 what
 is


unreasonable
 expectations
 the
 same
 as


some
 kind
 of
 reality
 Distortion
 field
 or


what
 is
 it
 I
 hope
 not
 I
 I
 actually
 hope


not
 I
 don't
 think
 it's
 reality


Distortion
 I
 for
 me
 the
 unreasonable


expectations
 is
 saying
 if
 you
 can


connect
 the
 dots
 from
 where
 you
 are


today
 to
 everything
 you
 want
 to
 go
 I


mean
 you
 you
 talked
 a
 lot
 about


generative
 AI
 you
 know
 our
 hypothesis


with
 generative
 Ai
 and
 our
 assertions


are
 very
 clearly
 hey
 this
 is
 going
 to
 be


a
 massive
 Tailwind
 if
 we
 enable
 people


to
 create
 exactly
 how
 that
 manifests


itself
 in
 video
 Etc
 we
 don't
 know
 and
 so


the
 unreasonable
 expectations
 are
 to
 say


I
 want
 you
 to
 create
 this
 video
 model
 I


want
 you
 to
 create
 an
 animation
 model
 I


don't
 know
 exactly
 how
 that's
 coming
 but


that's
 where
 the
 Ingenuity
 of
 those


developers
 and
 the
 engineers
 and
 the


product
 people
 comes
 in
 place
 and
 so
 uh


I
 think
 reality
 Distortion
 is
 different


which
 is
 you're
 in
 denial
 perhaps


sometimes
 of
 what's
 Happening
 whereas
 I


think
 unreasonable
 expectations
 is
 about


actually
 in
 many
 ways
 at
 least
 for
 me


saying
 I
 have
 more
 faith
 in
 what
 you
 can


do
 than
 perhaps
 you
 have
 in


yourself
 and
 I
 think
 that
 to
 them
 they


seem
 the
 unreasonable
 and
 then
 you
 know


when
 we
 moved
 to
 the
 cloud
 and
 we
 said


okay
 we
 want
 to
 add
 so
 many
 subscribers


people
 were
 like
 I
 can't
 add
 up
 to
 that


and
 you're
 being
 unreasonable
 I'm
 like


no
 we
 should
 go
 for
 it
 and
 we
 should


figure
 it
 out
 and
 then
 you
 know
 we


greatly
 exceeded
 it
 I
 mean
 and
 I
 this
 is


where
 I
 that's
 what
 I
 call
 unreasonable


expectations
 who
 do
 you
 ask
 for
 advice
 I


have
 a
 great
 self-help
 group
 you
 know
 I


was
 I
 was
 in
 YPO
 when
 I
 uh
 you
 know
 at


one
 point
 in
 my
 career
 I'm
 neither
 why


which
 is
 Young
 nor
 am
 IP
 anymore
 but
 um


John
 Dono
 uh
 you
 know
 one
 of
 my
 best


friends
 uh
 John
 became
 CEO
 of
 eBay


PayPal
 when
 I
 took
 over
 as
 CEO
 of
 um


Adobe
 we
 were
 both
 the
 number
 guys
 and


so
 having
 somebody
 that
 you
 can
 be


completely
 yourself
 and
 talk
 about
 you


know
 what
 needs
 to
 get
 done
 and
 you
 know


learn
 from
 them
 over
 time
 that
 self-help


group
 is
 IM
 IM
 immense
 where
 do
 you
 meet


uh
 well
 he
 and
 I
 have
 uh
 you
 know
 this


passion
 for
 golf
 but
 otherwise
 we
 we
 get


together
 for
 dinner
 you
 know
 we'll
 get


together
 for
 dinner
 and
 we're
 just
 like


okay
 we
 know
 or
 we
 call
 each
 other
 on


the
 phone
 and
 um
 you
 know
 when
 I
 have


something
 that
 I
 want
 to
 run
 by
 somebody


you
 know
 the
 real
 thing
 is
 there're
 a


sounding
 board
 for
 us
 correct
 Nikolai


and
 there're
 a
 sounding
 board
 George


Roberts
 uh
 you
 know
 the
 founder
 of
 KKR


uh
 I'm
 fortunate
 enough
 to
 have
 got
 to


know
 George
 Roberts
 really
 well
 and
 you


know
 the
 advice
 that
 he
 gives
 and
 to
 see


you
 know
 the
 passion
 that
 he
 has
 for


driving
 business
 and
 uh
 staying
 you
 know


very
 current
 and
 putting
 money
 to
 work
 I


mean
 that's
 something
 that
 I've
 learned


from
 him
 which
 is
 like
 you
 know
 I
 I


don't
 use
 the
 word
 risk
 I
 use
 the
 word


invest
 Ms
 we're
 paid
 right
 in
 our
 jobs


to
 make
 investments
 some
 of
 them
 work


some
 of
 them
 don't
 but
 hopefully
 you


know
 we
 have
 a
 better
 track
 record
 so


those
 are
 two
 among
 the
 others
 there's


romesh
 wadwani
 who's
 an
 incredibly


successful
 Indian
 entrepreneur
 so
 I'm


blessed
 um
 I
 I
 actually
 probably
 create


fewer
 friends
 but
 deeper
 friendships
 I'm


not
 a
 big
 networker
 but
 that's
 my


self-help
 group
 and
 I
 I
 I
 wouldn't
 spare


it
 and
 then
 you
 know
 your
 family
 your


family
 always
 is
 there
 you
 know
 and


thick
 and
 thin
 and


when
 you
 have
 I
 I
 used
 to
 say
 this


apparently
 there's
 some
 research
 that's


been
 done
 when
 you
 have
 young
 kids
 uh


they
 are
 more
 willing
 to
 you
 know
 tell


you
 you
 know
 the
 truth
 than
 anybody
 else


and
 you
 have
 to
 seek
 out
 these
 truth


tellers
 and
 you
 know
 uh
 so
 your
 wife
 my


two
 kids
 they
 will
 tell
 me
 like
 they


won't
 sugarcoat
 anything
 and
 that's


invaluable
 because
 unfortunately
 as
 we


get
 more
 senior
 in
 our
 roles
 everybody's


telling
 us
 how
 good
 the
 ideas
 that
 we


have
 are
 and
 you
 have
 to
 seek
 out
 those


truth
 tellers
 new
 college
 graduates
 when


you
 hire
 them
 they're
 far
 more
 willing


because
 they
 ask
 you
 the
 tough
 questions


uh
 you
 know
 I
 to
 say
 why
 are
 we
 doing


this
 why
 are
 we
 doing
 that
 and
 so
 I


think
 we
 all
 have
 the
 ability
 to
 do
 it


the
 question
 is
 are
 we
 going
 to
 seek


them
 out
 and
 how
 do
 we
 put
 into
 practice


what
 we
 learn
 from
 them
 right
 one
 last


thing
 I'll
 say
 one
 last
 thing
 I'll
 say


serving
 on
 a
 public
 board
 I
 serve
 on
 one


board
 yeah
 you're
 on
 fisa
 right
 I'm
 on


fisa
 what
 are
 you
 what
 are
 what
 do
 you


learn
 from
 from
 being
 on
 the
 board
 of


fiser
 well
 uh
 you
 know
 talk
 about


unreasonable
 expectations
 you
 know
 when


Albert
 talked
 about
 moonshots
 and


solving
 Co
 right
 I
 mean
 they
 that
 was
 an


unreasonable
 expectation
 that
 was
 a


moonshot
 uh
 Investments
 um
 if
 you
 think


about
 Pharma
 when
 people
 who
 are
 running


Pharma
 companies
 are
 making
 medicinal


bets
 in
 therapeutic
 areas
 chances
 are


you
 know
 in
 many
 cases
 uh
 you
 know
 their


successor
 might
 reap
 the
 benefits
 of
 it


right
 because
 of
 the
 timetable


associated
 with
 uh
 you
 know
 medicinal


development
 and
 so
 I
 learn
 again
 that


long
 range
 view
 of
 what
 needs
 to
 be
 done


the
 global
 nature
 of
 you
 know
 what


happens
 so
 you're
 always
 learning
 the


question
 is
 is
 your
 mind
 open
 to
 that


learning
 I
 mean
 every
 experience
 that


you
 have
 with
 everybody
 when
 when
 I
 hear


these
 questions
 I'm
 probably
 going
 to
 go


back
 Nikolai
 and
 say
 why
 did
 he
 ask
 me


that
 question
 and
 what
 was
 perhaps


behind
 it
 and
 what
 should
 I
 take
 away


from
 it
 you
 know
 as
 somebody
 who
 is
 in


the
 investment
 business
 and
 you're


thinking
 about
 it
 clearly
 you're
 trying


to
 piece
 this
 picture
 together
 so
 I
 I


think
 every
 interaction
 is
 a
 learning


experience
 you
 just
 have
 to
 be
 open
 to


it
 talking
 about
 boards
 um
 you
 you
 are


both
 the
 CEO
 of
 the
 and
 the
 chair
 of


adobe
 and
 as
 a
 shareholder
 we
 uh


generally
 think
 those
 roles
 should
 be


split
 why
 do
 you
 think
 the
 same
 person


should
 have
 them
 and
 why
 are
 we
 wrong


well
 I
 know
 in
 Europe
 uh
 you
 know


clearly
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 European
 investors


believe
 in
 that
 and
 I
 think
 what
 are
 you


looking
 for
 in
 that
 I
 would
 say
 what


you're
 looking
 for
 in
 that
 is
 a
 couple


of
 things
 one
 is
 you're
 looking
 for
 is


there
 the
 right
 amount
 of
 uh
 whether
 you


call
 it
 accountability
 whether
 you
 call


it
 transparency
 that
 exists
 in
 a
 board


so
 that
 you
 know
 there
 is
 the
 right


amount
 of
 dialogue
 that's
 happening
 and


you
 know
 is
 that
 conversation
 happening


u
 i
 I
 would
 say
 uh
 to
 you
 as
 an
 investor


I
 would
 say
 a
 couple
 of
 things
 first
 is


the
 board
 you
 know
 is
 there
 good
 uh


board
 refreshment
 are
 the
 people
 on
 the


board
 people
 whom
 you
 would
 look
 at
 and


say
 hey
 are
 these
 people
 who
 have
 uh
 you


know
 created
 uh
 tremendous
 value
 and
 are


they
 going
 to
 be
 people
 who
 are
 just
 yes


people
 or
 are
 there
 people
 who
 are
 going


to
 push
 back
 I
 mean
 Dave
 Li
 uh
 Dave


Ricks
 from
 Eli
 Lily
 you
 know
 one
 of
 our


recent
 board
 members
 you've
 seen
 the


tremendous
 success
 so
 I
 I
 would
 say
 U


and
 I
 I
 I
 do
 think
 the
 information


asymmetry
 that's
 happening
 between
 you


know
 people
 who
 run
 a
 company
 and
 the


board
 it's
 increasing
 right
 given
 how


complicated
 the
 business
 is
 and
 so
 if


you
 have
 a
 lead
 director
 and
 the
 lead


director
 has
 the
 ability
 to
 you
 know


engage
 with
 the
 board
 you
 have
 the


private
 sessions
 um
 you
 have
 the
 ability


to
 you
 know
 create
 an
 alternate


mechanism
 by
 which
 you're
 doing
 great


corporate
 governance
 um
 and
 I
 think
 the


US
 philosophy
 is
 trust
 somebody
 until


they
 proven
 untrustworthy
 and
 if
 I'm
 not


then
 you
 know
 what's
 what's
 the
 board's


number
 one
 job
 Nikolai
 the
 board's


number
 one
 job
 is
 hiring
 and
 Fir
 in
 the


CEO
 it's
 kind
 of
 difficult
 for
 you
 to


fire
 yourself
 right
 uh
 well
 I
 not
 really


I
 mean
 the
 lead
 director
 can
 call
 a


meeting
 and
 the
 if
 the
 lead
 director
 is


like
 whether
 there's
 ethical
 issues
 or


performance
 issues
 the
 lead
 director


needs
 to
 be
 able
 to
 do
 that
 and
 so
 I
 I


again
 I
 I
 realize
 the
 European
 style
 is


different
 but
 you
 know
 I
 I
 believe
 that


with
 speed
 that
 needs
 to
 be
 done
 uh
 I


have
 the
 ability
 to
 do
 it
 and
 I
 have
 to


earn
 it
 I
 don't
 take
 it
 for
 granted
 I


will
 say
 that
 and
 you
 know
 every
 year


and
 when
 I
 was
 named
 chair
 it
 was
 a


massive
 honor
 for
 me
 it's
 not
 one
 that
 I


take
 lightly
 uh
 Nikolai
 and
 so
 hopefully


you
 as
 an
 investor
 feel
 good
 about
 that


okay
 this
 is
 not
 a
 a
 perk
 it's
 a
 honor


and
 it
 needs
 to
 be
 earned
 and
 it
 needs


to
 be
 uh
 you
 know
 refreshed
 absolutely


shantonu
 if
 you
 are
 not
 allowed
 to
 say


golf
 in
 what
 other
 the
 ways
 do
 your


reles
 well
 you
 know
 I
 I
 I
 love
 the
 time


with
 my
 family
 I
 love
 traveling
 um
 you


know
 I
 love
 traveling
 um
 where
 is
 your


favorite
 place
 to
 travel
 to
 uh


Hawaii
 uh
 the
 big
 island
 on
 Hawaii
 is
 my


favorite
 place
 to
 travel
 in
 the
 world
 uh


it
 is
 a
 place
 where
 you
 know
 the
 plane


door
 opens
 when
 you
 land
 in
 Hawaii
 and


you
 breathe
 into
 that
 air
 and
 you
 know


you
 can
 feel
 your
 blood
 pressure
 going


down
 and
 you
 think
 you're
 best
 so
 Hawaii


and
 when
 you
 are
 on
 the
 beach
 what
 do


you
 read
 or
 what
 do
 you
 read
 generally


you
 know
 I
 I
 like
 to
 have
 three
 or
 four


books
 that
 I'm
 reading
 actually
 I
 I'm
 a


person
 that
 you
 know
 when
 I'm
 reading
 u


i
 so
 I'm
 reading
 uh
 I
 like
 sports
 books


I
 like
 reading
 about
 you
 know
 people
 who


have
 defied
 the
 odds
 um
 I
 like
 mystery


uh
 you
 know
 I
 I've
 read
 a
 lot
 of
 mystery


growing
 up
 um
 I
 read
 less
 management


books
 uh
 if
 I
 read
 the
 management
 books


I
 typically
 skim
 them
 if
 it's
 written
 by


a
 friend
 of
 mine
 or
 somebody
 that
 I
 know


uh
 then
 I
 read
 it
 you
 know
 uh
 and
 I
 I


read
 a
 little
 bit
 about
 history
 not


enough
 I
 mean
 that
 that's
 one
 regret


Nikolai
 I
 don't
 read
 as
 much
 as
 I
 did


Growing
 Up
 uh
 and
 I
 really
 I
 really


should
 get
 back
 to
 it
 more
 I
 I
 get
 great


pleasure
 in
 Reading
 uh
 but
 I
 I'm
 not


doing
 as
 much
 as
 I
 should
 you
 know
 it's


priorities
 right
 we
 all
 don't
 have
 as


much
 time
 as
 uh
 we
 would
 like
 lastly
 we


have
 uh
 tens
 of
 thousands
 of
 young


people
 listening
 to
 these
 podcast
 what


what
 is
 your
 advice
 to
 them
 you
 know


first
 I
 would
 say
 the
 world's
 your


oyster
 right
 I
 mean
 uh
 it
 is
 just
 an


incredible
 time
 to
 pursue
 your


uh
 passions
 uh
 I
 mean
 as
 we
 said
 um


access
 to
 Capital
 exists
 uh
 you
 know
 uh


access
 to
 information
 exists
 right
 now


with
 how
 much
 of
 you
 know
 that
 is
 being


democratized
 and
 so
 pursue
 your
 passions


I
 mean
 I
 was
 fortunate
 in
 that
 I
 didn't


follow
 the
 conventional
 path
 when
 I
 did


my
 MBA
 everybody
 said
 hey
 you
 now
 have


to
 go
 into
 you
 know
 product
 management


or
 business
 management
 and
 I'm
 like
 I


would
 like
 Building
 Products
 I'm
 going


to
 build
 it
 and
 so
 I
 think
 people
 really


do
 their
 best
 work
 when
 you
 come
 to
 work


in
 the
 morning
 and
 you
 don't
 think
 it's


work
 you
 come
 because
 you
 have
 a
 passion


you
 can't
 wait
 to
 get
 out
 of
 bed
 and
 so


find
 something
 that
 gives
 you
 that


feeling
 which
 is
 like
 I
 like
 being
 here


you
 know
 I
 like
 engaging
 with
 people
 and


if
 you're
 doing
 it
 because
 you
 think


it's
 the
 right
 thing
 or
 you
 know
 it's
 a


step
 along
 the
 way
 and
 you
 hate
 it
 but


you
 know
 you
 believe
 it's
 good
 for
 your


career
 I
 it
 it's
 not
 going
 to
 work
 and


so
 Follow
 Your
 Passion
 well
 you
 for
 sure


have
 followed
 yours
 and
 your
 uh
 love
 and


passion
 for
 what
 you
 do
 is
 coming


through
 just
 coming
 through
 so
 so
 loud


and
 clear
 so
 uh
 it's
 been
 really
 an


honor
 to
 have
 you
 on
 here
 and
 uh
 a
 big


thanks
 for
 taking
 the
 time
 no
 thank
 you


so
 much
 for
 having
 me
 and
 I
 really


appreciate
 it
 and
 I
 look
 forward
 to


maybe
 uh
 you
 know
 sailing
 together
 when


we're
 both
 in
 the
 same
 city
 that
 would


be
 that
 would
 be
 a
 blast
 absolutely


can't
 wait
 take
 care
 thank
 you
