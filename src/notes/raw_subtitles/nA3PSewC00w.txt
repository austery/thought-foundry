From
 the
 New
 York
 Times,
 I'm
 Natalie


Kitrov.
 This
 is
 the
 daily.


[Music]


For
 months,
 President
 Trump
 has
 been


ratcheting
 up
 the
 pressure
 on
 Venezuela


with
 increasingly
 aggressive
 military


actions
 that
 the
 administration
 claims


are
 about
 targeting
 drug
 traffickers.


But
 behind
 the
 scenes,
 some
 US
 officials


are
 pushing
 toward
 a
 very
 different


goal,
 regime
 change.


Today,
 my
 colleague
 Anatoli
 Kman


explains
 the
 battle
 being
 waged
 within


the
 White
 House
 over
 whether
 to
 topple


the
 government
 of
 Nicholas
 Maduro.


It's
 Thursday,
 October
 23rd.


[Music]


Anatoli,
 welcome
 back
 to
 the
 Americas.


You're
 in
 your
 old
 stomping
 ground
 in


Caracus.


>> That's
 right.
 Yeah.
 It's
 strange
 to
 be


back.
 Yeah.
 After
 eight
 years
 of


reporting
 from
 here.


>> Just
 tell
 me
 how
 many
 times
 over
 the


course
 of
 your
 career
 as
 a
 foreign


correspondent,
 you've
 been
 in
 Venezuela


awaiting
 the
 theoretical
 end
 of
 this


long-standing
 regime
 now
 led
 by
 Maduro.


>> Oh
 god.
 Um,
 I
 arrived
 in
 the
 country


just
 a
 few
 weeks
 after
 Maduro
 took
 power


in
 2013.


And
 I
 think
 I've
 seen
 at
 least
 six


times,
 six
 moments
 when
 it
 looked
 like


his
 government
 might
 collapse.
 And


>> you
 know,
 I've
 I've
 seen
 it
 all.
 It
 was


mass
 protest,
 you
 know,
 millions
 of


people
 in
 the
 streets.
 It
 was,
 you
 know,


military
 coups.
 It
 was
 economic
 chaos,


you
 know,
 the
 deepest
 reception
 in
 the


world
 outside
 of
 war
 zone
 in
 modern


history.
 There
 was
 a
 national
 blackout


for
 a
 week,
 then
 it
 just
 looked
 like
 the


entire
 country
 might
 collapse.
 There
 was


a
 stone
 election
 last
 year
 and
 it's


still
 the
 same
 government
 in
 power.
 But


what
 we
 haven't
 had
 before
 is
 the


spectra
 of
 military
 action
 and
 military


action
 from
 the
 most
 powerful
 country
 on


earth.
 So
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 here
 believe


that
 this
 time
 it
 it
 could
 be
 different.


>> Okay,
 let's
 get
 into
 this
 moment
 that


we're
 in
 right
 now.
 There
 have
 been
 so


many
 boats
 that
 have
 been
 bombed
 in
 the


Caribbean
 Sea
 at
 this
 point
 by
 the
 Trump


administration
 that
 it's
 been
 hard
 to


keep
 it
 straight.
 We've
 seen
 more
 than


two
 dozen
 people
 killed.
 What's
 the


latest
 on
 the
 ground
 of
 Venezuela?


>> So,
 so
 far
 the
 US
 has
 destroyed
 seven


boats
 of
 Venezuelan
 coast,
 killing
 about


30
 people.
 It
 has
 amassed
 a
 substantial


military
 force
 in
 the
 Caribbean.
 And


last
 week,
 the
 Trump
 administration
 has


authorized
 the
 CIA
 to
 conduct
 covert


operations
 inside
 Venezuela.
 And
 Trump


has
 explicitly
 said
 that
 he's


considering
 launching
 operations
 on


Venezuelan
 land.


>> Basically,
 the
 threat
 of
 military
 boots


on
 the
 ground,


>> basically
 meaning
 the
 involvements
 of
 US


servicemen,
 US
 operatives
 in
 violent


actions
 inside
 Venezuela.
 But
 it's
 the


sense
 of
 siege
 that
 it
 has
 created
 in


Venezuela,
 I
 think.
 and
 the
 expectation


that
 this
 is
 just
 the
 first
 phase
 of
 a


prolonged
 military
 campaign
 against
 the


Maduro
 government.


>> You
 said
 that
 the
 expectation
 is
 that


this
 is
 the
 first
 phase
 of
 what
 we're


seeing.
 So
 what's
 the
 next
 phase?
 Like


what's
 the
 sense
 of
 what
 the
 eventual


endgame
 is
 here?


>> So
 it's
 hard
 to
 know
 what
 is
 legitimate


planning
 for
 next
 military
 steps
 and
 and


what
 is
 part
 of
 psychological
 warfare.


We
 have
 to
 keep
 in
 mind
 that
 part
 of


administration's


strategy
 I
 suppose
 is
 to
 create
 this


atmosphere
 and
 fear
 and
 and
 tension
 and


paranoia
 among
 the
 government
 of


Nicholas
 Maduro
 and
 create
 a
 sort
 of


split
 in
 his
 power
 structure.
 But
 no


matter
 who
 you
 speak
 to
 here
 in


Venezuela,
 whether
 it's
 a
 street
 seller,


business
 people,
 officials
 in
 Maduro


government,
 it's
 clear
 to
 everyone
 that


the
 final
 goal
 is
 to
 topple
 Maduro.
 And


this
 doveetales
 with
 what
 my
 colleagues


in
 Washington
 hearing
 from
 the
 sources


that
 they
 are
 talking
 to
 that's
 the


endgame
 of
 this
 pressure
 campaign
 is
 to


bring
 a
 different
 government
 in
 power
 in


Venezuela.


>> Right.
 Ending
 a
 regime
 that
 the
 US
 has


opposed
 for
 a
 very
 long
 time.
 Just


explain
 why
 that's
 been
 the
 case.


>> So
 the
 standoff
 goes
 back
 to
 the
 time
 of


Maduro's
 predecessor
 and
 man
 Ugo
 Chavez.


He
 was
 a
 left-wing
 nationalist
 leader


who
 became
 increasingly
 undemocratic.


>> Hugo
 Chavez
 has
 packed
 the
 Supreme
 Court


and
 the
 army
 with
 his
 supporters
 and


introduced
 a
 new
 penal
 code
 that


criminalizes
 disscent.


>> This
 movements
 became
 increasingly


antagonistic
 towards
 the
 US


>> after
 Venezuela
 forced
 the
 US
 ambassador


out
 of
 the
 country.


The
 United
 States
 is
 expelling
 its


ambassador


>> and
 used
 the
 country's
 oil
 wealth
 to


challenge
 US
 dominance
 in
 the
 region.


>> George
 W.
 Bush,


you
 are
 a
 donkey,
 Mr.
 Bush.


>> Chavez
 struck
 new
 alliances
 with
 US


adversaries.


>> Iranian
 President
 Muhammad
 Ahmed
 is


visiting
 Venezuela.


>> Cha
 said
 that
 he's
 searching
 for
 a


strategic
 relationship
 with
 Russia.
 with


China,
 with
 Russia,
 with
 Iran.
 He


repressed
 pro-American
 opposition


parties.
 And
 over
 time,
 the
 US
 has


responded
 with
 gradual
 sanctions
 which


were
 aimed
 at
 creating
 conditions
 for


the
 opposition
 to
 win
 in
 a
 democratic


way
 and
 and
 change
 the
 course.


But
 then


>> a
 new
 day
 is
 coming
 in
 Latin
 America.


It's
 coming.
 This
 all
 changes
 during


Trump's
 first
 term
 in
 power.


>> The
 people
 of
 Venezuela
 are
 standing
 for


freedom
 and
 democracy,
 and
 the
 United


States
 of
 America
 is
 standing
 right
 by


their
 side.


>> Trump
 starting
 a
 so-called
 maximum


pressure
 campaign
 to
 drive
 Maduro
 from


power.


>> We
 have
 many
 options
 for
 Venezuela.
 This


is
 our
 neighbor.
 this
 is,
 you
 know,


we're
 all
 over
 the
 world
 and
 we
 have


troops
 all
 over
 the
 world
 in
 places
 that


are
 very,
 very
 far
 away.


>> So,
 he
 recognized
 the
 country's


opposition
 leader
 as
 the
 legitimate


president
 of
 the
 country.
 He
 bans


Venezuelan
 oil
 from
 the
 US.
 He
 makes
 it


extremely
 difficult
 for
 Venezuelan


governments
 to
 make
 any
 financial


transactions
 and
 precipitating
 an


economic
 crisis
 in
 the
 country
 which


made
 life
 very
 difficult
 for
 ordinary


people
 which
 led
 Maduro
 to
 dig
 further


in
 to
 rely
 more
 on
 repression
 to
 deepen


his
 alliances
 with
 China
 and
 Russia
 to


hold
 on
 to
 power.


>> Right?
 The
 push
 to
 ou
 Maduro
 just
 did


not
 work.
 And
 the
 question
 for
 a
 long


time
 now
 has
 been
 how
 far
 is
 the
 US


willing
 to
 go
 to
 get
 rid
 of
 Maduro.
 For


the
 Trump
 administration
 now
 it
 seems
 as


though
 that
 threshold
 is
 changing.
 They


seem
 much
 more
 willing
 to
 do
 something


that
 they
 weren't
 back
 in
 2019
 which
 is


use
 military
 force.
 And
 that's
 why


you're
 saying
 that
 things
 seem
 so
 much


different
 in
 this
 moment.


>> That's
 right.
 What
 was
 missing
 in
 the


past
 was
 the
 threats
 of
 US
 military


action.


>> And
 so
 how
 did
 we
 get
 here
 to
 the
 point


where
 now
 the
 threat
 of
 military
 force


is
 very
 much
 on
 the
 table?


>> So
 from
 a
 Venezuelan
 side,
 last
 year


was
 a
 point
 of
 no
 return
 for
 Venezuelan


democracy
 because
 Maduro
 went
 from


making
 it
 very
 difficult
 for
 the


opposition
 to
 campaign
 to
 outright


making
 up
 numbers.
 But
 it
 was
 a


presidential
 election
 last
 year.
 Huge


outswell
 of
 support
 for
 the
 opposition


led
 by
 Maria
 Kina
 Machado


[Applause]


>> and
 her
 candidates
 get
 70%
 of
 the
 vote


and
 her
 activists
 are
 able
 to
 provide


proof
 of
 those
 numbers
 are
 able
 to


provide
 evidence
 of
 real
 election


results.


This
 political
 campaign
 organized
 by


Maria
 Kurina
 Machado
 was
 the
 reason
 she


received
 Nobel
 Peace
 Prize.
 But
 Magdura


ignores
 them,
 produces
 completely


different
 results


and
 uses
 repression
 to
 stay
 in
 power.


basically
 challenging
 the
 opposition,


the
 world
 to
 do
 anything
 about
 them.


>> And
 that's
 the
 state
 of
 play
 basically,


right?
 When
 Trump
 comes
 into
 office
 in


January,
 Maduro
 has
 held
 on
 to
 power


even
 though
 at
 this
 point
 the
 whole


world
 basically
 believes
 that
 he
 has


stolen
 this
 election.
 So
 what
 does
 Trump


do?


>> So
 initially
 he
 tries
 negotiating
 with


Maduro.
 He
 sends
 his
 envoy
 to
 Karacas
 to


start
 working
 on
 a
 deal
 that
 would
 in


effect
 deliver
 all
 of
 Pinsola's
 natural


resources
 to
 the
 US
 and
 keep
 Madur
 in


power
 at least
 for
 the
 time
 being.


>> Did
 you
 say
 deliver
 all
 the
 natural


resources
 of
 Venezuela
 to
 the
 US?


>> That's
 right,
 Natalie.
 The
 reporting


that
 we
 have
 shows
 that
 it
 was
 arguably


the
 most
 farreaching
 attempt
 at
 resource


diplomacy
 of
 Trump's
 Tman
 power.
 It's


involved
 shipping
 all
 of
 Venezuelan
 oil


to
 the
 United
 States.
 It
 involved


opening
 up
 all
 of
 Venezuela's
 oil
 fields


and
 mines
 to
 US
 companies.
 And
 very


importantly,
 it
 involved
 Maduro


basically
 breaking
 off
 the
 existing


contracts
 with
 Chinese,
 Russian,
 and


Iranian
 companies.
 Basically
 sabotaging


his
 existing
 alliances
 in
 order
 to


rebuild
 his
 relationship
 with
 the
 United


States.
 That
 would
 essentially
 be


Venezuela
 doing
 a
 complete
 180
 on
 its


foreign
 policy
 and
 seeding
 control
 over


its
 most
 valuable
 resources
 to
 the
 US.


Can
 you
 just
 explain
 why
 Maduro
 and
 his


government
 would
 agree
 to
 that?


>> The
 biggest
 reason
 is
 survival
 in
 return


for
 these
 economic
 riches.
 Maduro
 would


stay
 in
 power
 or
 at
 the
 very
 least
 his


movements
 would
 be
 able
 to
 stay
 in
 power


or
 to
 be
 able
 to
 contest
 elections
 in


the
 future.
 So
 it
 created
 an
 offramp
 for


Maduro
 and
 his
 top
 officials.


>> This
 does
 seem
 like
 exactly
 the
 kind
 of


transactional
 extractive
 deal
 that
 Trump


has
 favored
 in
 the
 past.
 You
 know,
 pay


me
 and
 we'll
 help
 you
 out.
 So
 I
 assume


that
 this
 seems
 like
 a
 pretty
 good


offer.


>> That's
 right.
 Early
 this
 year,
 the


momentum
 was
 definitely
 heading
 towards


a
 deal.


Venezuela
 started
 accepting
 deportation


flights
 from
 United
 States.
 It
 started


releasing
 Americans
 held
 in
 Venezuela


and
 it
 seemed
 like
 we
 are
 cruising


towards
 normalization
 of
 relations.


But
 then
 Trump
 Secretary
 of
 State
 Marco


Rubio
 takes
 center
 stage
 and
 everything


changes.


[Music]


We'll
 be
 right
 back.


Anatoli,
 you
 told
 us
 this
 deal
 seemed


like
 a
 go,
 but
 then
 Secretary
 of
 State


Marco
 Rubio
 took
 control.
 So,
 how
 did


Rubio
 get
 in
 the
 middle
 of
 these


negotiations?
 Exactly.


>> So,
 he
 starts
 undermining
 it
 behind
 the


scene.
 First,
 in
 late
 March,
 he
 exerts


pressure
 to
 cancel
 permits
 for
 US


companies
 operating
 in
 Venezuela.
 He


scraps
 these
 licenses,
 dealing
 a
 major


blow
 to
 to
 Venezuelan
 economy.
 And
 then


in
 June,
 Rubio
 uses
 his
 connections
 in


the
 South
 Florida
 Republican
 Party
 to


convince
 Trump
 that
 CubanAmerican


congressman
 from
 South
 Florida
 will
 not


support
 his
 big
 spending
 bill
 if
 a
 deal


with
 Maduro
 goes
 forward.


>> The
 BBB,
 the
 big
 beautiful
 bill.


>> Correct.
 The
 big
 beautiful
 bill.


>> It's
 interesting.
 While
 one
 side
 of
 the


Trump
 administration
 is
 trying
 to


negotiate
 this
 deal
 with
 Maduro,
 here


you
 have
 Marco
 Rubio
 actively


undermining
 the
 strategy
 at
 every
 turn.


Why?
 That's
 right.
 For
 Rubio,
 it's


personal.
 Marco
 Rubio
 is
 a
 son
 of
 Cuban


immigrants
 who
 became
 part
 of
 this
 large


community
 of
 Cubanameans
 in
 South


Florida
 who
 view
 Latin
 America
 through


the
 prism
 of
 Cuban
 influence
 in
 the


region.
 And
 they
 see
 getting
 rid
 of


Maduro
 as
 a
 crucial
 step
 towards
 ending


dictatorship
 in
 the
 country
 that
 they


left
 in
 the
 country
 that
 their
 parents


or
 grandparents
 have
 left.
 And


throughout
 his
 political
 career,
 Rubio


has
 rejected
 negotiations
 with
 Chavez,


with
 Maduro.
 And
 for
 him,
 the
 main
 goal


has
 always
 been
 to
 see
 Maduro
 gone.
 And


this
 time
 Rubio
 has
 a
 plan
 that
 he
 can


present
 as
 the
 moral
 imperative.


>> And
 so
 what
 is
 the
 plan
 that
 he


presents?


>> He
 is
 supporting
 Maria
 Karina
 Machado,


the
 opposition
 politician
 who
 won


elections
 in
 Venezuela
 last
 year.
 In
 the


view
 of
 Marco
 Rubio
 and
 his
 supporters,


they
 are
 working
 to
 restore
 democracy
 in


Venezuela
 and
 to
 put
 legitimate


presidents
 in
 power.
 But
 throughout


Trump's
 terms,
 it's
 been
 very
 clear
 that


the
 issues
 of
 democracy
 and
 human
 rights


do
 not
 carry
 much
 cas.


So
 Rubio
 had
 to
 look
 for
 another
 weapon.


He
 needed
 to
 present
 something
 to
 Trump


that
 would
 catch
 his
 ear
 and
 would


outweigh
 the
 economic
 benefits
 of


working
 with
 Maduro.
 And
 he
 found
 the


answer
 in
 drugs.


Trump
 has,
 you
 know,
 spoke
 repeatedly


about
 the
 drug
 epidemic,
 you
 know,
 the


fentinel
 crisis
 in
 the
 US.
 He
 has


threats
 in
 Mexican
 cartels.
 He
 has


threats
 in
 military
 actions
 against


cartels
 in
 Mexico.
 So,
 Marco
 Rubio


changes
 tack.


>> Maduro,
 although
 they
 call
 him
 a


dictator
 cuz
 he
 is
 and
 all
 that,
 he's


not
 a
 government
 official.
 What
 he
 is
 is


the
 head
 of
 a
 drug
 trafficking
 logistics


organization,
 a
 cartel,
 the
 cartel
 of


the
 Suns.
 He
 starts
 to
 frame
 Venezuelan


governments
 as
 a
 drug
 cartel.


>> And
 I've
 seen
 a
 lot
 of
 this
 reporting


and
 it's
 fake
 reporting
 and
 I'll
 tell


you
 why.
 It
 says
 that
 somehow
 Venezuela


is
 not
 involved
 in
 the
 drug
 trade


because
 the
 UN
 says
 they're
 not
 involved


in
 the
 I
 don't
 the
 UN
 I
 don't
 care
 what


the
 UN
 says.
 The
 UN
 doesn't
 know
 what


they're
 talking
 about.


>> He
 flips
 the
 Venezuelan
 issue
 from
 being


a
 struggle
 over
 democracy
 and
 human


rights
 towards
 it
 being
 a
 struggle


against
 drugs.
 Nicholas
 Maduro
 is
 an


indicted
 drug
 trafficker
 in
 the
 United


States
 and
 he's
 a
 fugitive
 of
 American


justice.


>> He
 makes
 Maduro
 government
 part
 of


America's
 war
 against
 drugs
 and
 this


leads
 to
 an
 escalation.
 Rubio
 designates


basically
 Maduro's
 entire
 regime
 as
 a


narco
 terrorist
 cartel
 and
 you
 know
 he


supports
 sending
 all
 this
 military


hardware
 into
 the
 region
 to
 threaten


Maduro
 and
 ultimately
 this
 leads
 to
 the


strikes
 on
 the
 boats
 of
 alleged
 drug


traffickers
 of
 Venezuela's
 coast


>> and
 we've
 covered
 this
 on
 this
 show
 you


know
 it's
 still
 the
 case
 that
 the
 Trump


administration
 has
 not
 actually


presented
 any
 strong
 evidence
 that


Maduro
 is
 a
 cartel
 leader.
 That's
 not


something
 the
 intelligence
 agencies
 have


agreed
 with.
 You're
 saying
 that
 Rubio


goes
 forward
 with
 this
 strategy
 anyway.


>> That's
 right,
 Natalie.
 It
 is
 accepted


that
 some
 cocaine
 ships
 through


Venezuela,
 that
 Venezuela
 is
 the


location
 for
 drug
 smuggling,
 but
 there


has
 not
 been
 any
 convincing
 evidence


that
 this
 is
 a
 hierarchical
 organized


endeavor
 from
 the
 top
 levels
 of


Venezuelan
 government.
 But
 Rubio
 knows


that
 this
 is
 a
 compelling
 political


narrative,


>> right?


>> And
 at
 the
 same
 time,
 Mario
 Karina


Machado
 is
 pitching
 an
 economic


reconstruction
 plan
 which
 in
 spirit
 is


very
 similar
 to
 the
 deal
 that
 Maduro
 has


been
 negotiating
 with
 Trump
 earlier
 this


year.
 So
 in
 effect,
 Rubio
 is
 promising


to
 Trump
 that
 he
 can
 kill
 two
 birds
 with


one
 stone.
 he
 can
 topple
 Maduro
 and


proclaim
 a
 victory
 in
 his
 fight
 against


drugs
 and
 at
 the
 same
 time
 obtain
 the


same
 economic
 deals
 that
 Maduro
 is


offering
 him
 in
 return
 for
 staying
 in


power.


>> And
 is
 that
 actually
 true
 that
 Maria


Karina
 Machado
 would
 give
 up
 the
 same


things
 that
 Maduro
 is
 offering
 like


Trump
 could
 just
 get
 the
 economic
 deal


he
 wants
 and
 ou
 Maduro
 at
 the
 same
 time?


So,
 Maria
 Karina
 has
 held
 very


consistent
 views
 throughout
 her


political
 career
 and
 she
 is
 a
 firm


believer
 in
 American
 style
 free
 market


economy.
 She
 is
 a
 firm
 supporter
 of


American
 businesses,
 American
 economic


interest
 and
 she
 was
 willing
 to
 tailor


her
 message
 in
 order
 to
 keep
 Trump
 on


her
 side.
 After
 Trump
 came
 to
 power,
 she


has
 stopped
 talking
 about
 the
 plight
 of


Venezuelan
 migrants,
 which
 was
 major


elements
 of
 her
 election
 campaign.
 She


has
 stayed
 largely
 silenced
 when
 Trump


sent
 hundreds
 of
 Venezuelans
 to
 an


Salvadorian
 prison
 without
 any
 due


process.
 and
 she
 has
 unequivocably


supported
 Trump's
 campaign
 against
 drug


smuggling
 in
 Venezuela
 without


mentioning
 the
 fact
 that
 some
 of
 her


countrymen
 are
 being
 killed
 at
 high
 seas


without
 any
 evidence
 of
 due
 process.


>> So
 Machado
 it
 sounds
 like
 is
 not
 being
 a


purist
 in
 an
 effort
 to
 not
 alienate
 the


Trump
 administration
 because
 above
 all


else
 what
 she
 wants
 is
 political
 change


in
 her
 country.
 I'm
 wondering
 how


regular
 Venezuelans
 view
 her
 pitch,


Rubio's
 pitch
 for
 US
 intervention
 to


achieve
 that
 goal.
 They
 obviously


overwhelmingly
 voted
 against
 Maduro
 as


you
 said,
 but
 do
 they
 agree
 with
 the


argument
 that
 getting
 Maduro
 out
 is


worth
 the
 potential
 upheaval
 of
 US


military
 action
 in
 their
 country?


>> This
 is
 a
 crucial
 question.
 Natalie


Machado
 has
 presented
 her
 overwhelming


victory
 in
 last
 year's
 election
 as
 a


mandate
 for
 change
 at
 any
 cost.
 Whether


Venezuelans
 agree
 has
 been
 difficult
 to


gauge
 because
 of
 the
 scale
 of
 repression


in
 the
 country.
 But
 the
 polling
 that
 I


have
 seen
 shows
 that
 only
 a
 minority
 of


Venezuelans
 support
 military


intervention
 in
 Venezuela.


Overwhelmingly,
 Venezuelans
 support


political
 change.
 They
 want
 Maduro
 gone


and
 they
 want
 international
 community
 to


help
 them
 achieve
 that
 change.
 But
 a


minority
 believe
 that
 a
 military


intervention
 would
 be
 a
 justified
 cause


to
 achieve
 that
 goal.


>> But
 despite
 the
 fact
 that
 intervention


doesn't
 necessarily
 have
 broad-based


support
 in
 Venezuela,
 we
 are
 at
 what


feels
 like
 the
 precipice
 of
 something.


And
 I'm
 just
 wondering
 if
 you
 can
 lay


out
 what
 the
 paths
 forward
 are
 now.
 Is


the
 diplomatic
 route
 that
 leaves
 Maduro


in
 power
 still
 even
 an
 option?
 Have
 we


moved
 so
 far
 in
 the
 other
 direction
 that


it's
 just
 not
 on
 the
 table
 anymore?


>> So
 diplomacy
 is
 off
 the
 table
 for
 now.


Trump
 has
 told
 his
 envoy
 to
 basically


cut
 off
 contacts
 with
 Maduro
 for
 the


time
 being
 and
 appears
 to
 have
 given


Rubio
 green
 light
 to
 to
 achieve
 results


through
 military
 pressure.
 and


supporters
 of
 negotiation
 approach.
 They


acknowledge
 that
 they
 lost
 this
 battle.


They
 acknowledge
 that
 they
 have
 been


outplayed,
 outmaneuvered
 by
 Rubio
 at


this
 stage.
 But
 they
 don't
 believe
 that


this
 is
 the
 end.
 They
 point
 to
 Trump's


behavior


towards
 Ukraine
 where
 he
 has
 repeatedly


changed
 his
 positions
 since
 returning
 to


power.
 So
 just
 because
 negotiations
 are


off
 the
 table
 now,
 that
 does
 not
 mean


that
 we'll
 be
 off
 the
 table
 forever.
 And


Rubio's
 opponents,
 they
 biding
 their


time
 for
 Rubio
 to
 make
 a
 mistake,
 for


him
 to
 fail
 to
 produce
 clear
 results
 in


a
 in
 a
 span
 of
 next
 several
 months
 in


order
 for
 them
 to
 then
 redouble
 their


pitch
 of
 economic
 balances
 that
 could
 be


had
 in
 a
 short
 term
 straight
 away
 under


the
 current
 government
 in
 Venezuela.
 On


the
 side
 of
 those
 who
 are
 advocating


intervention,
 it
 does
 seem
 as
 though
 a


lot
 of
 people
 in
 that
 camp
 may
 be
 hoping


for,
 fantasizing
 about
 a
 kind
 of


painless
 surgical
 extraction
 of
 Maduro


from
 Venezuela,
 you
 know,
 by
 Marines
 or


or
 whoever,
 and
 then
 the
 arrival
 of
 a


new
 government
 led
 by
 Machado
 that


everybody
 wants
 that
 functions
 smoothly.


But
 Anatoli,
 you
 know
 this
 better
 than


me.
 The
 US
 has
 a
 long
 history
 of
 this


kind
 of
 intervention
 in
 Latin
 America.


Has
 it
 ever
 worked
 that
 way?
 Seamless,


smooth.


>> I
 mean,
 history
 shows
 that
 only
 rarely


do
 military
 interventions
 produce
 the


kind
 of
 sustained
 democracy
 that
 Machado


is
 advocating
 for.
 There's
 not
 much


track
 record
 for
 this
 sort
 of
 outcome.


Machado
 believes
 that
 the
 country


overwhelmingly
 supports
 her
 and
 would


just
 welcome
 her
 with
 open
 arms
 to
 just,


you
 know,
 for
 her
 candidates
 to
 assume


the
 presidency
 and
 take
 over
 armed


forces,
 state
 bureaucracy,
 state


infrastructure
 and
 just
 usher
 this
 new


era
 of
 democracy,
 prosperity.
 But


there's
 all
 sorts
 of
 outcome
 that
 are


likely
 even
 more
 likely
 to
 to
 occur.


Maduro
 could
 lose
 power
 but
 be
 replaced


by
 someone
 even
 more
 hardlined
 within


his
 own
 coalition
 but
 someone
 even
 more


oppressive
 and
 someone
 more
 antagonistic


towards
 the
 United
 States.
 You
 know
 the


power
 vacuum
 could
 create
 all
 sorts
 of


chaos
 perhaps
 not
 necessarily
 in
 in


Karacas
 but
 in
 the
 in
 the
 periphery
 of
 a


country
 areas
 where
 you
 have
 all
 sorts


of
 armed
 groups
 ranging
 from
 criminal


gangs
 to
 Colombian
 insurgents.
 you
 know,


we
 we
 could
 see
 the
 violence
 that
 this


could
 create
 could
 unleash
 a
 whole
 new


wave
 of
 migration
 towards
 Colombia,
 the


neighboring
 country
 to
 Venezuela,
 which


could
 destabilize
 that
 country
 further.


You
 know,
 the
 the
 military
 interventions


could
 have
 all
 sorts
 of
 unexpected


lasting
 outcomes
 that
 go
 far
 beyond
 the


sort
 of
 clean,
 elegant
 transition
 to


democracy
 under
 a
 democratically
 elected


government.


>> Yeah.
 And
 one
 of
 those
 outcomes,
 right,


is
 that
 you
 could
 end
 up
 destabilizing


this
 country
 and
 potentially
 spurring
 a


new
 wave
 of
 migration,
 which
 is
 exactly


what
 this
 administration
 wants
 to
 avoid.


I
 mean,
 if
 you
 end
 up
 creating
 all
 this


instability
 that
 could
 potentially


spread
 to
 neighboring
 countries,
 that's


obviously
 not
 in
 the
 US
 interest
 either.


And
 it's
 also,
 by
 the
 way,
 the
 opposite


of
 the
 America
 first
 agenda
 that
 Trump


campaigned
 on.


>> No.
 And
 the
 way
 this
 campaign
 is


unfolding
 so
 far
 gives
 indications
 of


the
 risks
 ahead.
 You
 know
 the
 way
 the


strikes
 against
 boats
 seems
 to
 be


spreading
 to
 countries
 neighboring


Venezuela.
 Colombian
 president
 has


accused
 us
 of
 of
 murdering
 a
 Colombian


fisherman.
 Trump
 has
 responded
 by


cutting
 off
 aids
 and
 threatening


Colombian
 governments.
 So
 this
 has


already
 escalated
 beyond
 the
 sort
 of


narrow
 surgical
 approach
 towards


removing
 Maduro
 and
 we
 are
 just
 in
 the


beginning.
 So
 I
 think
 you
 know
 the
 risk


of
 plunging
 the
 region
 into
 uncharted


territory
 are
 are
 very
 great
 and
 and


this
 is
 the
 line
 that
 Maduro's


governments
 and
 his
 allies
 in
 Washington


have
 exploited.
 you
 know,
 they
 present


themselves
 as
 this
 bastion
 of
 stability


and
 relatives
 peace
 against
 the
 anarchy


and
 chaos
 that
 Machado
 is
 about
 to


unleash
 on
 the
 country.


>> Just
 to
 pull
 back
 to
 take
 a
 longer
 view


of
 all
 of
 this,
 if
 if
 the
 Trump


administration
 goes
 through
 with
 this,


it
 wouldn't
 just
 be
 right
 a
 return
 to
 an


older,
 more
 aggressive
 approach
 to
 the


Americas,
 a
 more
 aggressive
 foreign


policy.
 In
 many
 ways,
 it
 would
 be
 a
 test


of
 how
 far
 the
 US
 can
 push
 the
 limits
 of


that
 policy
 in
 2025.
 The
 latest
 phase
 of


all
 of
 this
 started,
 as
 you
 said,
 with


bombing
 boats
 in
 international
 waters


and
 treating
 alleged
 criminals
 as
 if


they're
 enemy
 combatants
 in
 a
 war,
 which


many
 experts
 see
 as
 a
 complete
 violation


of
 international
 law.
 So,
 I'm
 wondering


how
 you
 are
 thinking
 about
 the
 larger


stakes
 of
 what
 we're
 seeing
 play
 out


here.


>> What
 worries
 me
 the
 most
 here,
 Natalie,


is
 the
 potential
 precedent
 that
 it
 sets.


To
 me,
 this
 is
 beyond
 Venezuela,
 a


country
 that
 I
 know
 and
 care
 deeply


about.
 This
 is
 beyond
 Latin
 America.


This
 is
 about
 what
 happens
 when
 the
 most


powerful
 country
 on
 earth,
 chooses
 to


designate
 a
 sovereign
 government.
 Yes.
 a


repressive,
 illegitimate,
 but
 a


government
 of
 a
 sovereign
 nation,
 a


criminal
 organization,
 a
 terrorist


group,
 and
 then
 deal
 with
 it
 in
 any


matter
 that
 it
 sees
 fits.
 It
 becomes
 a


precedent
 for
 how
 the
 US
 deals
 with


other
 nations
 around
 the
 world.
 To
 me,


there's
 a
 risk
 of
 this
 conflict
 given


rise
 to
 to
 something
 larger.
 Hm.


>> And
 of
 course,
 you
 could
 argue
 that
 what


we
 see
 in
 Minnesota
 is
 just
 a


continuation
 of
 years,
 perhaps
 decades


of
 US
 interventionism.
 You
 know,
 the
 the


drone
 strikes
 on
 presumed
 terrorists
 in


the
 Middle
 East,
 at least
 since
 the
 time


of
 Barack
 Obama
 with
 very
 little
 legal


oversight.
 Of course,
 it
 has
 sent


alleged
 terrorists
 to
 Guatana
 Bay.
 But
 I


think
 what
 we
 see
 in
 Venezuela
 is
 a


massive
 escalation
 of
 a
 trend,
 right?


Where
 you


see
 perhaps
 in
 broad
 daylight
 the


killing
 of
 people
 accused
 of
 certain


crime
 without
 the
 least
 amount
 of


evidence
 or
 due
 process
 presents
 it.
 And


the
 risk
 that
 many
 legal
 experts
 see
 is


that
 this
 becomes
 the
 new
 normal.
 that


this
 will
 become
 the
 way
 US
 and
 perhaps


other
 global
 powers
 treat
 the


adversaries
 by
 designating
 sovereign


nations
 as
 criminals
 and
 then
 treating


them
 as
 such.


[Music]


>> Anatoli,
 thank
 you.


>> Thank
 you
 for
 having
 me
 as
 always.


On
 Wednesday,
 Defense
 Secretary
 Pete


Hgsith
 said
 that
 the
 military
 had


attacked
 a
 boat
 in
 the
 Eastern
 Pacific


Ocean
 for
 the
 first
 time,
 an
 expansion


of
 the
 attacks
 the
 administration
 has


been
 carrying
 out
 on
 vessels
 in
 the


Caribbean.


Hegath
 said
 in
 a
 social
 media
 post
 that


the
 strike
 killed
 two
 people
 on
 the


boat,
 which
 he
 said
 was
 carrying
 drugs.


It
 was
 the
 eighth
 known
 boat
 attack


since
 September,
 bringing
 the
 officially


acknowledged
 death
 toll
 of
 the
 strikes


to
 34.


[Music]


We'll
 be
 right
 back.


Here's
 what
 else
 you
 should
 know
 today.


On
 Wednesday,
 President
 Trump
 announced


that
 he
 was
 imposing
 new
 sanctions
 on


Russia
 for
 the
 first
 time
 in
 his
 second


term,
 underscoring
 his
 frustration
 with


President
 Vladimir
 Putin
 after
 a
 plan


for
 the
 two
 leaders
 to
 meet
 fell
 apart.


Trump
 made
 his
 irritation
 with
 Putin


clear
 on
 Wednesday,
 saying
 his


conversations
 with
 the
 Russian
 leader


were
 always
 good,
 but
 never
 went


anywhere.
 The
 sanctions
 targeted


Russia's
 two
 largest
 oil
 companies,
 and


they're
 some
 of
 the
 most
 significant


measures
 that
 the
 US
 has
 taken
 against


the
 Russian
 energy
 sector
 since
 the


beginning
 of
 the
 war
 in
 Ukraine.


And
 President
 Trump
 acknowledged
 on


Wednesday
 that
 he
 was
 having
 the
 entire


East
 Wing
 demolished
 to
 make
 way
 for
 his


90,000
 square
 ft
 ballroom,
 an
 expansion


of
 a
 project
 that
 is
 remaking
 the


profile
 of
 one
 of
 the
 nation's
 most


iconic
 buildings.


Trump
 also
 said
 the
 ballroom
 would
 cost


300
 million,
 hundred
 million
 more
 than


the
 original
 cost
 estimate
 given
 less


than
 3
 months
 ago.
 The
 president
 has


said
 that
 he's
 raising
 tens
 of
 millions


of
 dollars
 in
 private
 donations
 to
 fund


the
 construction,
 sparking
 concerns
 from


ethics
 experts
 who
 warn
 that
 it
 may
 just


be
 another
 way
 for
 the
 wealthy
 to
 buy


access
 to
 the
 president.
