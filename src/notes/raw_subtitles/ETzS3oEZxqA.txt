This is Bloomberg Businessweek Daily,
reporting from the magazine that helps
global leaders stay ahead with insight
on the people, companies and trends
shaping today's complex economy.
Plus, global business, finance and tech
news as it happens, Bloomberg
Businessweek Daily with Carol Massar and
Tim Stennett back live on Bloomberg
Radio, Television, YouTube and Bloomberg
Originals at a very good afternoon.
A happy Monday, everybody.
A very busy monday Carol Massar along
with bailey lipschultz.
Tim is off this week and we got a lot
going on.
It's October 13th.
Monday.
God, you got stocks higher on all of
this way higher after a big sell off on
Friday.
So buying the dip seeming to work again
for another session.
Good point.
Right.
To see that investors come back and see
what's going on.
We've got another air related deal
involving open air.
We've got the U.S.
and China belly.
It seems like not so good on Friday.
Right.
And but over the weekend, it feels like
there was some movement that maybe these
trade talks are continuing, seeming to
walk back via true social yet again,
surprise, surprise.
But to your point, we're seeing critical
minerals rallying and rare earths stocks
rallying.
So a lot of excitement or at least maybe
a sigh of relief on this Monday.
Exactly.
All right.
So we're going to try and tackle all of
this.
I do feel like they're big, big, big
issues.
So we're going to get into the latest on
that cease fire deal between Israel and
Hamas.
At the same time, I'm sure you've been
watching Open Air and Broadcom today.
Yeah.
What you need to know about that, Stocks
rallying, as you mentioned, chip stocks
rallying.
Broadcom, last time I checked, was up, I
think about 10%.
So best day in quite some time.
Having a good day for one of the biggest
stocks in the world, mind you.
And also we've got a double dose of the
view from the C-suite following earnings
on the industrial sector.
Daniel Flores, CEO of Fastenal and on
the Retail and Consumer Committe Singh,
CFO and Growth officer at Levi Strauss.
I don't know.
Are you a big Levi fan?
I love Levi's.
I've gone back to buying them like I
love them, I love them.
And I think what's interesting we are
let's not forget, I forget what day it
is, right?
Government shutdown.
But here we are.
It continues going on longer than many
thought.
And so what these CEOs have to say about
the environment I think is really
important when we are kind of data
deficient courtesy of the government
just sitting in that data vacuum, if you
will.
But at least we get big bank earnings in
the next few days.
We do get big bang.
All right.
Get ready.
Everybody is going to be a busy week.
First up, though, let's get a check on
the trade and your top business stories
to sort things over to Amy Morris in for
Charlie.
Tell it.
All right.
Thank you, Carol.
Wall Street traders drove stocks toward
their best session since May.
The U.S.
and China signaling that willingness to
keep trade negotiations alive.
We checked markets for you all day long
here at Bloomberg.
The S&P 500 up 1.6%, NASDAQ up more than
2%.
The Dow up one and a quarter percent.
The ten year Treasury note bond markets
are closed for the holiday half open.
I signed a multi-year agreement with
Broadcom to collaborate on custom chips
and networking equipment marking the
latest step in the AI startup's
ambitious plan to add computing
infrastructure.
The hardware rollout should be completed
by the end of 2029.
That's according to the companies.
With Broadcom shares now 10% higher.
Debney Disney shares 1% higher.
Taylor Swift says she'll have new
content that will premiere on Disney
Plus in December.
That's according to a post on Ex the
Arrows Tour.
The final show, a six episode behind the
scenes docu series will premiere
December 12th on Disney Plus Warner
Brothers.
Discovery shares are more than four and
a half percent higher as the media
company reportedly rejected Paramount's
guidance initial takeover approach for
being too low.
Sources tell Bloomberg that Paramount
has several options in its pursuit of
Warner Brothers.
The government shutdown is leaving
investors desperate for a fresh read on
the economy.
Banks are seen as uniquely positioned to
fill in some of those information gaps.
Jp morgan, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup
all set to report third quarter earnings
tomorrow for on Demand news 24 hours a
day.

I'm Amy Morris.
That's a Bloomberg business plan.
Let's go back to Bloomberg Businessweek
Daily with Carol Massar and Bailey
Lipschultz.
All right.
So appreciate it.
Of course, Amy Morris in there for
Charlie Pellet.
Hey, President Trump called for the
historic dawn of a new Middle East in an
address to the Israeli parliament.
That was earlier today as he visits the
region to celebrate a deal halting the
war in Gaza and securing the release of
prisoners held by Hamas.
That has happened now.
The president just left Egypt after
meeting with leaders from across the
world to celebrate that deal that could
bring an end to a devastating two year
war that destroyed most of Gaza, much of
Gaza and inflame tensions across the
region.
This is the day that people across the
region and around the world have been
working, striving, hoping and praying
for.
They have done things over the last
month that I think were really
unthinkable.
Nobody thought this could happen.
With the historic agreement we've just
signed, those prayers of millions have
finally been answered.
And that, of course, was President Trump
earlier from Egypt.
For more, we head to.
Israel and Jerusalem.
Add to Bloomberg's Oliver Crook.
He is Bloomberg News correspondent.
Oliver Hard not to feel like after a
really difficult two years that this is
it's somewhat historic.
At the same time, we know that there is
still much to be done to work out.
First off today, talk about the
significance of what has happened on
this Monday, October 13th.
Carol, I think the difficulty is joining
these two ideas, the sort of close of
the first chapter of what has been a
horrific two years, obviously, for the
Israelis beginning on October 7th and
then ensuing within the Gaza Strip for
the last two years, where, as you say,
you know, almost 70,000 people have been
killed, the majority of which are women
and children.
And that sort of devastation that has
just been ripped through the Gaza Strip,
that came to a close and came to a
silence on Friday night and really
trying to usher in this moment of peace.
And we should say we started the day
today, Carol, with 20 hostages alive,
still held by Hamas.
They have now been repatriated to
Israel.
We have begun the prisoner swap, the
prisoners being released from the
Israeli side into the West Bank, into
Gaza.
Almost 2000 of those will be released in
the first phase of this plan.
And I think that it is fair to say and I
think Donald Trump is fair to claim the
kind of credit that he is claiming.
And even the greatest critics of Trump,
I think today would say that it's his
sort of unconventional foreign policy
and unorthodox approach that really made
this happen.
It's hard to imagine the traditional
levers of foreign policy being able to
bring this deal into being.
That being said, as that one chapter
closes, that sweet chapter sort of
closes, it sort of masks the complexity
and the bitter complexity of the next
chapter that now is open, the one that
began in Egypt today with the president
of the United States convening all of
these leaders from across the world,
many from Arab states.
We should say that the sort of four new
leaders that were put in the prominence
in that main hall where the Turkish
leader, obviously Trump and the leader
of Egypt and the leader of Qatar, those
are seen as kind of the sort of
foundational members of this member of
this agreement that has been worked out
over the last couple of weeks.
And that really materialized very
quickly over the last week.
But again, it does very little to
explain some of the difficulties that
still lie ahead, the difficulties about
how this sort of governance structure is
going to work in Gaza with this
so-called Board of Peace overseeing it.
Who's going to participate in that?
The question of security forces within
the Gaza Strip, a security apparatus
that is both legitimate to the Israelis
and to the Palestinians.
And, of course, I think the most
immediate question, what is the future
of Hamas?
And this is a question that is still
fundamentally unanswered.
And the Israeli war aims have been two
fold since the very beginning.
The return of the hostages that was
accomplished today and the dismantling
or destruction of Hamas that has not yet
been finished.
So when you ask a very simple question
at the end of this day, is the war over?
The answer is not necessarily yes,
depending on who you ask.
To Donald Trump, it is absolutely over.
Ask Benjamin Netanyahu.
You may not get the same answer in all
of our.
You mentioned President Donald Trump.
What was the reception like for him
today?
As you mentioned, traditional means
likely wouldn't have resulted in where
we are today.
It was a it was a hero's welcome.
I mean, even as before you touched down
in Israel, as I was arriving a couple of
days ago, you could see one of the
skyscrapers in Tel Aviv looking out the
window with an Israeli flag and an
American flag.
And underneath it said, thank you.
And once you land, you get into the
airport.
There are still they the posters of the
hostages that have been there since the
beginning of the attack.
You take the highway from Tel Aviv here
to Jerusalem, which is the same route
that the president took today.
These are highways that are lined with
Israeli flags.
Ordinarily, since Friday night, every
third flag is an American flag.
And that is exactly the reception that
Donald Trump got here in Israel speaking
before the Knesset.
I think that this sort of hyperbole
reached its sort of vaulting height when
the speaker of the Knesset said that you
will be remembered, Donald Trump, not
just as an American president, but you
will be remembered as a giant in Jewish
history and you will be remembered for
thousands of years to come.
That is what he was told.
And again, that is been sort of broadly
speaking, it's, I think, fair to say
that Trump is certainly the most popular
politician in Israel and probably at
this moment, the most popular person in
Israel.
What about Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu?
Not so popular.
Well, he's actually gained a little bit
of support in the polls after this deal
was sort of struck.
But again, is you're speaking to sort of
one of the main issues.
I mean, we can go all the way back to
before October 7th when there were
literally hundreds of thousands of
people in the streets, huge divisions
within Israeli society trying to get
Benjamin Netanyahu to call elections to
step down.
All of those sorts of thing.
Then October the seventh happened, this
sort of war government was assembled,
but there are still a lot of questions
about what comes next for the Israeli
government himself and for Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
If you go by the election schedule, the
next election is going to be in October.
But again, you have the sort of
constituents of the Israeli government
currently better being held up largely
by these sort of far right wing of
Israeli politics by the ministers,
Smotrich and Ben-gvir, who, by the way,
did not pull out their support of the
government in order to bring it to
collapse for this deal.
But they did not vote for this deal.
They did not support this deal.
They are people who more than likely
would like to continue to prosecute this
war further and further.
So there's still these disagreements
that exist, and we should say in a
hostage square, when we had Steve
Whitcomb speaking a couple of days ago
alongside Jared Kushner and Ivanka
Trump, every time Trump's name came up,
massive applause, massive cheering.
And in the literally 800,000 people that
were watching it.
However, when Benjamin Netanyahu, his
name came up, massive booing across that
crowd, you could say that that is a
crowd that is more traditionally hostile
to Benjamin Netanyahu.
That is not the universal feeling.
But there's a lot of complexity under
the surface in politics.
There's been a lot of complexity
throughout the last two years, certainly
with this.
Oliver.
So good to check in with you.
I know we'll be checking in with you
once again next hour for any updates on
this.
That is Oliver Cook.
He is correspondent for Bloomberg News
there in Jerusalem.
All right.
We want to stay on this story.
Joining us right now is Mona Yacoubian.
She is director and senior adviser,
Middle East program at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies.
She joins us from Washington, D.C..
Mona, should President Trump be taking a
victory lap here?
I think the president does deserve to
take a victory lap, considering what has
been accomplished today.
The release of the last 20 remaining
hostages who were alive are alive in
Gaza.
The the cessation of hostilities for
now, the flowing in of much needed
assistance into Gaza.
These are important milestones.
However, I think the president is
perhaps premature in saying the war is
over.
The difficult steps ahead are the ones
that we will have to watch closely to
see if, in fact, his aspirations become
reality.
And how does that play out?
If you were going to say that this is
presumably some form of a stopgap and
not necessarily conclusion and marking a
next chapter, what plays out?
How does this play out and kind of
what's your view on that?
But what will distinguish what happened
today from cease fires in the past is if
the various points that are laid down in
President Trump's 20 point plan are in
fact implemented.
Critical among them is the disarming of
Hamas.
Hard to know how exactly that's going to
happen.
The the the agreement itself is very
short on details.
There's also the envisioning of an
international stabilization force that
would surge into Gaza and be responsible
for security.
Not at all clear how that's going to
happen.
And, of course, questions around
governance and the constituting of a
committee of Palestinian technocrats to
be overseen by former British Prime
Minister Tony Blair.
I mean, there are there are so many
details that have yet to be ironed out,
let alone implemented.
And I think these are the key potential
sticking points in the coming days and
weeks and likely months.
Mona.
And I think it's fair to say, right, a
conflict like this that has gone on not
just in the last two years of a war, but
it's been going on for a long time
between Israel and and and Gaza and
Hamas.
What is Hamas, though, in a world where
there is no conflict between Hamas and
Israel?
I mean, they have been designated
terrorist groups.
I'm just curious, what is Hamas
potentially going forward in?
If there's real peace in this region?
Well, you can point to a really
important issue here.
I mean, Hamas raison d'etre is
resistance, resistance against Israel
and against Israeli occupation.
Now, presumably, if all of the various
elements that would bring actual peace
between Israelis and Palestinians come
into fruition, then that could indeed
sort of, I think, dramatically undermine
the rationale for Hamas to continue to
exist.
But I do think it's really important,
Carol, to note this agreement talks
about and calls for the disarming of
Hamas.
It does not call for the destruction of
Hamas, as Prime Minister Netanyahu has
called for and made a centerpiece of his
policies on Gaza.
So.
Okay.
So that's an important distinction.
Correct.
Very much so.
I mean, we're already seeing reporting
that as Israeli troops withdraw from
limited areas of Gaza, there is
reporting that Hamas is filling in and
is taking over.
And so, again, this just gives you a
sense of how daunting this challenge is
going to be going forward.
And Mara, you have about you have more
than 30 years of experience in the
Middle East and North Africa.
With that in mind, what do the next
weeks and months, years look like?
Well, I think immediately what's going
to need to happen is more meat on the
bones of exactly how it is that this
agreement that all of these various
leaders just signed off on in Sharm el
Sheikh.
How will those how will those points
actually be implemented?
So I think the first order of the day is
going to be figuring out how to
establish security on the ground as
Israeli troops withdraw and in not at
all clear how that's going to happen.
What are the mechanisms by which Hamas
is going to be disarmed and to whom?
Whom will they give their arms to?
And then, of course, the other key
element of any post-conflict
stabilization is governance.
You've got to have governance.
You've got to have authorities on the
ground.
Who will they be?
How will that structure be set up?
Those are really critical questions.
And we're a long ways from understanding
what the details are that will govern
those various arrangements.
There's a disarmed Hamas just to kind of
tie this up to do they want a Gaza, a
Palestinian state that actually thrives?
Presumably they have called in and would
be in agreement with that.
But as always, the devil is in the
details.
For example, they are saying that Israel
must withdraw 100% from Gaza.
That is not envisioned by the plan.
And ultimately, what does a Palestinian
state look like?
Is there a way to actually build a
Palestinian state from the current set
of circumstances that we see on the
ground?
That is also going to be extraordinarily
difficult as long as these questions
remain.
There will be space for resistance.
There will be space for groups like
Hamas or its successor to cause trouble.
Yeah, it's fascinating.
Right.
And you talk about, you know, the
building of a Palestinian state and then
there's just the actual build of a land
that has just been devastated.
So much more to come.
And I know we'll lean on you in the
future because I'm sure there'll be more
to come.
Mona Yacoubian, she's director and
senior adviser, Middle East program at
the Center for Strategic and
International Studies.
Hey, in just a moment, we're going to
talk a little bit about earnings,
barely, because we've got fashion all
day reported this morning and stocks
been under some pressure.
Been under some pressure.
And this is a big bellwether when we
look at the industrial space.
So one of the first out of the gate,
down more than 5%.
Disappointing so far.
Yeah.
Curious to see what the CEO is going to
say, who will join us in just a moment.
And we're going to get into what you
need to know about opening his latest
deal.
First up, though, let's get a check on
the trade once again on this Monday and
your top stories.
Here again, Amy Morse in for Charlie
Pallet.
Thanks so much, Carol.
Stocks are recouping some of those
losses after President Trump and senior
officials backpedaled on tariff threats
against China, signaling a willingness
to negotiate.
We checked those markets for you all day
long here at Bloomberg.
The S&P 500 now up 1.6%, NASDAQ up 2.2%,
and the Dow up 1.4%.
And the dash for gold is persistent.
Gold futures now 3% higher.
Bond markets are closed for the holiday
open.
I signed a multiyear agreement with
Broadcom to collaborate on custom chips
and networking equipment marking the
latest step in the startup's ambitious
plans to add computing infrastructure.
Broadcom shares now 10% higher bank
earnings.
Also in focus this week, JPMorgan,
Goldman Sachs and Citigroup all set to
report their third quarter earnings
tomorrow for on Demand news 24 hours a
day.
Subscribe to Bloomberg News now wherever

I'm Amy Morris.
That's the Bloomberg business splash.
We go back now to Bloomberg Businessweek
Daily with Carol Massar and Bailey
Lipschultz.
All right.
So appreciate it.
Amy Morrison there for Charlie Pallet.
Well, Big John is a big market story as
well today, once again driving the
trade, pushing semi as a group
semiconductors that is higher today led
by Broadcom whose stock jumped after
opening.
I agreed to buy the company's custom
chips and networking equipment in a
multi-year deal, part of an ambitious
plan by the startup to add AI
infrastructure.
So we wanted to just dig a bit deeper
into it.
Amy talked about it.
We certainly are seeing it playing out
in the market.
Got a great voice though, Bailey to walk
us through it, One of my favorite people
I will say really must, he said Mandeep
Singh name about five times on the call
this morning.
He really was like, We need to get him
to do so.
Perfect timing.
And that's why we're joined now by
Bloomberg Intelligence, global head of
Technology Research, Mandeep Singh here
in the studio.
Mandeep, walk us through with this deal
because it feels like every other day
Openai has a new agreement with some
chip manufacturer and the terms are
slightly different, whether it's an
ownership stake or front buying chips.
What's up with this Broadcom pact?
I mean, they are really going after, you
know, data center capacity right now.
And the way they are doing it is by
diversifying their supplier base.
So it's not just relying on and really
average everyone does right now for
compute, but really leveraging Broadcom,
which is a custom silicon maker.
So think about, you know, NVIDIA giving
you a generic chip where you can run
your A.I.
workloads, whether it's training or
inferencing.
Custom silicon is used just for, you
know, the specific workflow that Openai
has to run for its proprietary models.
So no one else has any benefit of using
a custom silicon because Openai is not
looking to sell its own chips to compete
with Nvidia, it's looking to use its
chips for its own chip app or any other
custom app that it has developed
in-house.
And Google is a prime example of what a
custom silicon looks like because they
have their own TTPs, which when you
compare to Nvidia GPUs, is more
customized in nature, but it does a
terrific job of running YouTube or any
other AI workloads that Google wants to
run on its chips.
So that's what Open your Eyes doing.
And it has a tremendous cost advantage
because it costs a lot lower than the
Nvidia price tag of $30,000 on average
for a GPU TPU tensor processing unit.
I should make sure I understand.
What's interesting though is I do feel
like there's this move trend to get.
Chips that maybe don't cost as much,
maybe don't use as much power, but do
exactly what we need.
Is that fair?
Yeah.
I mean, look, one bar at one gigawatt
requires up to 500 to 600000 accelerator
chips.
So we're talking point five, 2.6 million
chips for one gigawatt data center.
Imagine if you can save up to $5,000 how
it multiplies, you know, in terms of
cost savings.
The real constraint right now is power.
It's not as if you get a cheaper chip
and you're all good.
You still need the performance per watt,
which is why it really is so good,
because it gives you 5 to 10 x more
performance per watt than the
competitors, right?
Exactly.
I want to show there's a graphic.
And one of our producers made it,
Elizabeth said.
Right.
And I think, you know, we've all been
looking at this.
It's about open AI and all of the
companies that they're doing deals with.
And it's not even been a month, but they
have done deals with and Vedere Oracle
core.
We've AMD now Broadcom.
And again, it's just late September to
mid-October.
So is that what this is, is just giving
them a smarter supply chain and having
access to what they need?
Is it as simple as that?
Well, it's not as simple because they're
going across the stacks.
Think of, you know, how air applications
are deployed.
You need the chip, you need the
infrastructure, you need the cloud,
because that's where you're doing your
inferencing.
So they've cut deals with different
parts of the stack here, not just the
chipmakers, not just the power guys, but
also the cloud guys.
So from that perspective, because we've
right core, we've.
Exactly.
And look, I mean, to my mind, they are
going aggressive in terms of adding more
capacity than they probably need because
they think if they get market share,
they get the companies or users to use
their product, then they will be able to
monetize and probably drive some
companies out of, you know, competing
with them because of the scale involved
here.
Well, are are I anthropic striking
similar deals or is this the open air
show?
I think right now HCI must be thinking
and they are doing a $20 billion deal
with some private financing.
But look, when open air announces a ten
gigawatt deal, we're talking 500
billion, not 20 billion anymore.
So it's the numbers are getting bigger
and bigger.
What is opening I in this moment in time
on October 13, the most important
company in the world?
Well, when I look at Mag seven, you're
Broadcom is not in Max seven.
It's a $1.6 trillion company.
You know, open air is probably you know,
it's up 10% because of this.
I mean, also the whole space sold off on
Friday.
So I don't want to downplay that too
much.
But like they're not even public,
They're not even profitable as much as
we know.
Right.
No, I mean, look, I.
So right now, their gross margins would
be negative if you factor in their
training costs.
Inferencing wise, yes, they are making
some money.
But clearly, if you include everything
and just you compare it with Google,
Google has an annual cost of revenue of
around 100 billion that powers all of
their apps.
You know, Google, YouTube, everything
that they run, open their eyes.
Compute costs are probably north of 20
billion right now.
And if they're adding 26 gigawatt more
capacity, we are talking, you know,
compute cost to multiply at least 25
fold.
So from that perspective, you have to
ask yourself, yeah, how much incremental
revenue do you want to see from open air
to justify this, you know, 1 trillion,
potentially $1 trillion in compute
infrastructure spend.
And that's where Google's infrastructure
is so efficient because just, you know,
less than five gigawatt of compute gets
you to over 400 billion in revenue.
That's pretty cool to say the least, in
a non financial analysis terminology.
Wendy, thank you.
Always a gem.
Bloomberg Intelligence Global head of
Technology research mandeep Singh.
I spent in the build out is one read on
the US economy and certainly the tech
economy now to another great read barely
on US economic activity and we're
talking about the industrial supplier
Fastenal which reported earnings earlier
this morning and shares I think they
were the worst performing the S&P 500 at
one point.
Yeah, right now down about 6%.
And keep in mind, this is a $50 billion
company.
So this is no small, small fish in the
again, in the industrial space.
One of the first reads we get every
quarterly earnings season missing Wall
Street views, broadly speaking.
So interesting.
What's driving that?
Well, let's ask the CEO.
Daniel Flores is with us.
He is chief executive officer of Fast
and he joins us from Winona, Minnesota.
Dan, it is great to have you back with
us.
Talk to us about the quarter, because it
does seem like analysts were noting that
the pricing during the quarter was
weaker than expected and marks the
second straight quarter of softer
pricing.
And maybe that's why we're seeing the
stock down.
What you want to say to investors.
Well, part of the reason our stocks are
down is this price to perfection.
If you look at what it's done year to
date and where the multiple has gone.
But, you know,
we had we had a really good quarter.
We had we had a double digit quarter.
We hadn't seen that for a couple of
years.
Double digit growth, sorry, and pleased
with the outcome.
One of the one of the challenges we had
this year was there's a lot of fluidity
around tariffs and what it means for
pricing.
And we will raise price.
To address costs in our customers supply
chain.
We we really don't want to raise more
than that because we believe it impairs
our ability to grow as fast as we'd
like.
And, you know, coming into the quarter,
we estimated, you know, x four for
impact of pricing came a little bit
less.
We lowered our number for the fourth,
fourth quarter.
But the most important aspect is on a
price cost basis, we are neutral and
that's what we aspire to be.
We'd rather just grow.
Mm hmm.
And Dan, to your point, fast, and even
with the pullback today, returning 22%
year to date, so outperforming the S&P
500 and comparable stocks in the
industrial space.
But just one more question on pricing.
In terms of expectations, Would you want
to raise pricing?
Like do you get the sense that consumers
and customers would push back just given
how you've been shifting into bigger
customers spending much more money?
Yeah.
Customers always push back on pricing.
Doesn't matter the size.
Customer We will.
We are having conversations with our
customer.
We will be doing some price increases in
Q4.
I suspect we'll be doing some price
increases as we move into 2026.
But again, our first discussion with the
customer.
They understand it.
They're willing to move on price.
Our first discussion is always what are
alternatives to this product?
That maybe doesn't mean we have to raise
your prices 5%.
Maybe it means it only has to be two,
and we'd rather go to two because that's
what that's what a supply chain partner
does.
Well, then how did tariffs fit into
this, just given that, according to
analysts across the street, when we look
at certain industries now is when we're
going to see tariffs showing up in the
third quarter in guidance as a it as it
relates to 2026.
What are you seeing and how are you kind
of attacking or addressing any pressures
from tariffs?
Yeah.
So for us, tariffs have been in the in
the equation since the early part of the
second quarter.
A little bit of the first quarter I
think in the that the individual that
handles pricing.
Historically, he'll provide us an update
once a month.
He'd gotten to the point where he was
providing us updates he he was up to a
video number of 14 as of July that he
was serving out to the field, giving
them guidance into what we were seeing
in our supply chain.
And and so we've been adding price as
we've gone through the year.
And these have been discussions with
customers.
And I hope that answers your question.
No, I think it does.
But I think the big thing is are you
mitigating the impact of tariffs?
Are you shifting your supply chain?
Is the expectation that you can have
some kind of knock on effect as it
relates to pricing?
If we do continue to see threats from
the president going after countries like
China or others, we are going to talk to
one of the members of Levi's management
team.
And they called out that they had to
dial up their expectations for the
impact of tariffs from other countries.
So how is that impacting when you look
at your supply chain and when you look
at the potential for pricing impacts in
2026?
We've been moving supply chain around
the planet in earnest since 2017 2018
timeframe.
As our name would imply, we sell a lot
of fasteners and most of the fasteners
in North America come from either
mainland China or Taiwan.
And the automotive industry took the
production there back in the fifties and
sixties, actually took it to Japan and
South Korea and it migrated from there.
If I look at our resources, we now have
a sourcing team in Shanghai, but we have
a sourcing team in Bangkok, we have a
sourcing team in northern India and we
have work to diversify our supplier base
around the planet and a little bit more
in North America, but really around the
planet.
So to have diversity in supply so you're
not caught off guard by some price
change or or a tariff change.
In addition to that, we've taken supply
chains coming in North America, which
traditionally came in through the West
Coast, the United States, and then we
would redistribute from there.
We have moved supply chains.
So they're bringing product directly
into the west coast of Canada or the
west coast of Mexico, because those two
countries represent about 14% of our
revenue.
Now, you bypass the tariff, however,
it's more expensive to break shipments
down over in Asia and bring them in, but
it's a lot less than a tariff.
One of the things I want to ask you, you
know, you talk about supply chains is
the end game.
Dan, we're talking with Dan Flores.
He's chief executive officer of
Fastenal.
Is it about, though, largely reducing
your exposure to China, which has been a
pretty big one?
It's reducing our customers exposure to
any market, in this case, China and or
Taiwan.
But the any market that are on the
receiving end of some of the political
winds and create an unstable supply base
for our customer here, it happens to be
China another month.
It might be a different country, another
year it might be a different country is
diversifying your supply chain so your
eggs are not all in one basket.
Be ready.
So whatever our customer.
Yeah, whichever way the winds blow.
Hey, one of the things I want to ask you
to speak broadly, the earnings update
today, you talked about the industrial
environment still sluggish.
We've heard similar commentary on this
persistent sluggishness elsewhere from
manufacturers as well as caution around
project delays.
At what point does this become something
more worrying than just sluggishness?
Well,
for us, it's been sluggish since
November of 20.2, when
we really hit on what the Industrial
Institute for Supply Management puts
out, the PMI index, and that's been sub
50, which really plays into our customer
base other than January and February of
this year.
That's been sub 50 since November of
2022.
So we've been in a sluggish economy for
a long time.
From our perspective.
And other than living through the first
part of it, where you had customers that
were downshifting, what reason our
growth is shining through in a different
way.
I think we're executing at a higher
level, but B, once you get through that
downshifting, now you're just even if
your customers are at a subdued level,
you can grow in that kind of
environment.
And that's what's shining through in our
numbers right now.
All right.
One thing I want to ask you, because as
you would imagine, I don't know how much
of this is pervasive in your world, but
I is like the non-stop conversation that
we are having.
Certainly when it comes to activity and
market impact, To what extent is A.I.
maybe sucking up the oxygen in the
economy?
Are you seeing any signs of that or your
world?
They're going to still need what you
guys supply no matter what's going on
with the air spend and enthusiasm.
Well, first off, we have a lot of we
have a meaningful improvement in our
revenue as relates to things like data
centers, because we sell into a wide
range of of customer needs and end
market needs, whether that is the actual
construction.
I visited many data centers being built
or we have people on site there after
it's built.
We're supplying into that facility with
things like air handling and maintenance
equipment in the case of our customers
that sell into that sector.
That's actually a strong business for us
right now.
And then as a organization, we're we're
increasingly making use of AI in our own
business and how we go to market and how
we help our employees be more efficient,
what they do.
And then about 45 seconds here with in
with keeping in mind data center
construction, where are those products
sourced from?
Are those also heavily sourced from
China and exposed to tariffs?
Are they different supply chain
altogether?
They're you know, they're
mostly a different supply source,
but it depends on the component.
If it's facility maintenance type of
products, they're coming from anywhere
on the globe.
And so they're they're subject to the
same type of issues that any product
would have.
But a lot of the components I know a lot
of the manufacturers that we sell into,
I visited one about a year ago in
Michigan where they were purposely
avoiding China and they're selling
directly into the data centers.
All right.
They're going to yell at me.
But 20 circuits you've been at fast
enough for a long time.
You've seen different cycles.
How do you describe this one?
And again, just got about 20 seconds, if
you could be very quickly, very quick.
Oh,
you know, you add in the fact that, you
know, similar we saw in 18, but odd with
the fact of it's just something I'm
fluid and and and there's so many things
that occur from week to week, month to
month that are outside the norm.
But the fundamentals still work.
All right.
So serve your customer at a high level.
You grow your business.
I love talking with you.

All right.
So appreciate it.
Amy Morris in there for Charlie Pellet.
All right, folks, Levi Strauss shares
they are trading slightly lower today
after dropping as much as 14% on Friday.
This is after the company's upgraded
earnings guidance still fell short of
higher investor expectations following
the stock's more than 40% rally heading
into that earnings print.
Now, one key disappointment, at least
according to analysts out on the street,
is earnings growth, failing to match the
pace of sales expansion due to tariff
and distribution costs.
Meantime, I got to say, Bayley, you did
have to count raising its price target
on the stock to 26 from 22 a share.
And they've got their berating, yes,
staying bullish.
And you look at the street 13 analysts,
ten of them buys.
So is it a sell the news event priced to
perfection.
We see.
It's a really good point.
So let's see what one of the companies
members of the C-suite have to say from
it.
Singh is with us, chief financial and
growth officer at Levi Strauss.
He joins us from our San Francisco
bureau.
I mean, it's so good to have you here
with us.
How are you and how is the consumer
doing?
Well, thanks for having me, Carolyn
Bailey.
It's great to be here again.
You know, we had a real strong quarter,
four consecutive quarters of high single
digit growth and record gross margins,
as well as the fact that we were able to
raise our full year guidance by as well
as gross margin and EPS expectations.
Overall, as a company, we are a stronger
and higher performing company defined by
accelerated growth, expanding margins
and higher return on invested capital.
To your question about the consumer, the
consumer is largely being resilient.
You know, our products are really well
segmented.
You know, we have blue tag, which we
which is our premium high pinnacle
product, and that's doing well.
We've introduced that in the U.S.
So far, so good.
We have a Red Dead product that is
basically marketed to consumers who earn
between 100,000 and over.
And that's, you know, based on our
results, really done well.
And then we have, you know, signature
product sold through Wal-Mart that
again, had a banner, Coca-Cola.
And that's for, you know, lower income
consumer.
So consumer strength really strong.
That's why we were able to raise the
full year guidance.
And our product pipeline hasn't been
stronger.
Now, if you go outside the U.S.
and international business was up in the
high single digit.
And so Asia had a strong core consumer,
strong Europe had a decent quarter
consumer in a better place, and so is
Latin America.
Well, I'm just going to lay it out for
you.
I think I bought my first pair of Levi's
in a long time, just a couple of months
ago.
My daughter, who's 22, so much younger
than me, has been buying Levi's for a
while.
So barely.
I mean, they're back.
I go into the store in downtown, in in
the village, and yeah, it's packed.
Or you get a partnership with Beyoncé.
All the marketing you guys are spending
in terms of targeting both young and
older generations.
But Harmeet, I want to ask about
tariffs.
So Levi expects tariffs from China about
30%, but increase expectations to 20%
from the rest of the world.
Where are you sourcing your jeans
materials?
Is it more are you more exposed to that
doubling in terms of are you getting
materials from Vietnam in place of
China?
Yeah.
So overall, we're taking a holistic
approach as we are able to offset the
tariff impact.
You know, as you think about this year,
we raised guidance in the top line and
the bottom line and gross margin.
So, you know, we've been able to
withstand that.
Your specific question barely resource
about a 1% We import into the U.S.
from China, a little over a percent from
India.
Most of and Vietnam is in the mid to
high single digit.
So most of our imports are from the
Southeast Asian countries think
Bangladesh, Pakistan and and the rest of
Asia.
The way we think about our supply chain,
it's fairly well diversified.
We import from about 20 countries into
the U.S.
60% of our business is outside the U.S.
And so we are well positioned to
mitigate and offset tariffs in the way
we are thinking about the holistic
approach, given that volume is driving a
big piece of our, you know, revenue
momentum and we have tenured vendor
relationships, we're working with our
vendors, we're looking at different cost
efficiencies across our organization as
well as, you know, being very thoughtful
about pricing.
So let me just ask you, though, you
guys, did you know, you mentioned you
raised your full year outlook.
You did warn that tariffs are starting
to bite profit profitability to measure
by gross margins improve.
So these are the good stuff.
But again, that tariffs are starting to
bite.
I mean, can you tell us what that means,
what the bite of tariffs, when, when,
how much you know, any color around
that?
Sure.
So, you know, overall, you know, we were
able to raise top line and bottom line
guidance despite absorbing tariffs.
And so we are able to mitigate it.
To the question about tariffs.
Yeah, you know, tariffs were introduced
on Liberation Day.
We normally buy our products, you know,
six months in advance.
And so, you know, we are working
through, you know, our efforts and we've
got different levers to kind of position
as who take order through the quarter,
which is reported gross margins are
record.
So we are able to offset tariffs because
we've got other things working for us.
You know, as we grow our women's
business, our direct to consumer
business and international, all of which
are accretive to gross margins and allow
us to, you know, mitigate and offset
some of the tariff exposure.
Quarter four, we did guide gross margins
to be slightly down versus a year ago.
And had it not been for tariffs, you
know, we would have grown gross margins.
But overall, as we think about the year,
we will report again another year of
record gross margin.
So we are working on levers for 2026.
The good news is we'll end the year
stronger and we believe we're well
positioned to have another strong year
in 2026.
And Carol, we've talked with a good
friend, Peter Atwater, for quite some
time about that k-shaped recovery, where
people who are well-off are doing much
better than those really in the bottom
quintile.
Harmeet, when you look at your goods,
when you look at the ability to raise
prices from the impact of tariffs, which
products are you able to more easily
raise prices where you are going to see
consumers push away?
And how are you thinking about that
strategy as it relates to, say, the
jeans that you do sell through a Walmart
where you don't have that gross margin
going direct to consumer and you do have
likely, at least when we look at the
data consumer who's feeling the pinch of
inflation, broadly speaking.
Yeah.
And so the first thing Baily, to your
question is our products are well,
segmented depending on the income
profile of different consumers.
I talk blue to red and signature
signature is what's sold into the lower
income consumer.
We've been very thoughtful about
pricing.
We are leading with product innovation
rather than price.
And so we are doing what we can to
maintain a price point.
It was evident in quarter three
Signature, for example, I think is up in
the low double digits for the year.
As we think about, you know, our other
products, the good news for us is our
product pipeline has never been
stronger, you know, leading with lose
and baggy while at the same time selling
a lot of slim and skinny both for him
and her.
You know, we've got wonderful, you know,
waist up product the thing trucker
jackets, thing, linen shirts, etc.,
etc..
And so as a company, we're making this
pivot to be more of a denim lifestyle
retailer going forward.
Our past was all about denim.
Our future is going to be about denim
lifestyle.
I just want to know, do you really have
a pair of baggy barrel jeans?
I can't get my head around them.
I'm trying.
I'm trying.
I'm just.
I haven't done it.
I haven't done it.
Ami, what I do want to ask you two areas
you guys have had kind.
Of a mission, a goal to get to 10
billion in sales by 2027.
I think you may have adjusted a little
bit.
I think also a 15% event margin.
Could you reach 15% in the next few
years even if sales have not hit that 10
billion?
You know?
Talk to us a little bit about that
mission.
Yeah, no, you know, we gave up the
expectation of 10,000,000,015% on our
Investor Day in the middle of June 2022.
Since then, you know, there's been a lot
of change and a lot of uncertainty.
As a company, we have kind of, you know,
navigated our way through uncertainty.
We haven't given a new date on the
10,000,000,002 and a and the 15% I
thinking is will probably do that
sometime next year.
But to your question, the company that
we are
building and the company that is God,
the foundation given where we are ending
this year.
So you take 22, 2025 will end about 6%
organic growth.
Last year it was 3%.
The year before that it was flat.
You would think an EBIT margin this year
will end about middle heavens.
Last year it was in the mid-teens, the
previous year it was about nine.
So we have seen a steady progress and
our view is we probably get to the 15%
faster than we get to the 10 billion.
But but really, a company that is
steadily delivering mid-single digit
growth in a category that probably grows
a little, you know, out of that.
So our view is that we will we are
market leaders now in the U.S., number
one in men's, number one in women's and
really resonating with the youth.
And so the question is, if you're able
to stay at, you know, and implement our
strategies, our view is we can continue
to be a market leader and probably pick
up a little bit of share, especially
because the denim category is
accelerating.
We have seen the acceleration in the
U.S., we've seen the acceleration
outside, and that is largely driven by
the world becoming more casual.
Yeah, I have more jeans in my wardrobe
than I've ever had in like since high
school.
Like, it's really kind of wild and
rebellion.
I got another question I was just going
to ask in terms of geographic expansion.
When you think about China, what's going
on with China and also what products do
the Chinese consumers want?
Is it that high end good or is it more
of a bargain purchase?
Yeah.
So China for us is still
under-penetrated.
China represents about two or 3% of our
business.
You know, our business in China has been
slow and soft.
The Chinese consumer right now is going
through a bit of a macro uncertain
climate.
But the good news for us is they love
the brand.
Brand equity scores are really solid.
We think China can be, you know, a
business that grows double digit over
the long term.
But your specific question, the Chinese
consumers are fairly discerning on the
brands he or she gravitate to.
There is a high end consumer as well as
a consumer that like the mid-market
consumer, what we call the core product.
So if you think about our Asia strategy,
we really you know, our products are
relevant for the mid-market consumer,
while we also offer products for the
higher premium and consumer.
30% of the Asian denim category is
premium.
And, you know, premium, for example, our
highest pinnacle product is largely
Japanese, you know, fabric, Japanese
denim and inspired by Selvedge.
And so that's what we are selling.
And I think over time we will be able to
start growing our China business back in
the low double digit range.
Yeah.
Interesting.
Seth.
I will say, Carol, I know you mentioned
you have more jeans than I have been
buying the Sherpa jackets, the denim
jackets like crazy.
I don't know why I have three of them in
different colors.
I bought a bunch of denim jacket.
That's what I mean.
I'm like, I don't wear jeans, I wear
chinos, but I wear the denim jackets
like crazy.
I know.
I just.
I don't know.
I love it.
I love it.
Yes, I agree.
But I work and jeans every morning.
Yeah.
And bailing coal.
Now we've got the blue tab.
It's it's it's full of jacket you can
definitely read to office depending on
the on the, on the you know dress
environment at Bloomberg I walked in you
know fairly casual so you know it's
something that we are not bringing to
offer which should make your wardrobe at
some stage.
Hey, one last question.
Does it feel like God mean the it's been
a crazy year and a lot of stuff coming
out.
Everybody, investors, the world at
large.
Does it feel like things are starting to
calm down on a day when we've talked
about what seems like progress in a
cease fire between Israel and Hamas?
Yeah, you know, as I mentioned earlier,
you know.
We have lived through uncertainty.
You know, the good news for us is the
category is strong.
We have real business momentum.
The brand's never been stronger and we
have a product pipeline that is never
been fuller, especially as we head
towards holiday.
You know, our focus right now is making
sure our product is on the floor.
On the floor when because of what we
have seen, Carol, is consumers gravitate
to newness and gravitate towards
relevant.
And, you know, and, you know, our view
is if we can offer the right product and
build a brand experience, and that's why
we've got a real focus on our direct to
consumer business while complementing
growth with our wholesale business.
So this quarter, you know, both DTC and
wholesale was up.
Had in the U.S.
five consecutive quarters of high growth
and is fueled by both the channels.
All right.
Well, Harmeet, when you talk with your
design team, I like highways, buttons
that kind of slam through the legs and
then a little flare.
I'm just going to put it out there.
A little stretch in there, too.
It's kind of my favorite.
My favorite.
My favorite.
And you are, Jeff.
Thank you.
Yeah, and I'll take that feedback.
Karen.
I sincerely believe feedback is a is a
gift.
And getting feedback from consumers like
yourself is something that I'll take
upon myself to feedback to our
designers.
All right.
I'm going to hold you to it.
All right.
Good stuff, Ami.
Thank you so much.
Ami It's saying.
Chief Financial and Growth Officer Brett
Levi Strauss, joining us from our bureau
in San Francisco.
All right, folks, just a quick check on
the markets.
Barely.
We are just rolling off our highs of the
session, but we've got a rally underway.
We're still well in the green, up more
than 1% on the S&P 500, led by none
other than the chip stocks.
So thank you.
Open air.
Yeah, exactly right.
Yeah.
We're seeing the chip stocks rally in a
big way and you've got, what, the Dow up
about 1% and the Nasdaq 100, a gain of
about 2%.
We'll take it after the pain that we saw
on Friday.
Yeah, it's broad based or broader based
buying, certainly in the S&P 500.
I'm Carol Massar along with ali
lipschultz.
Let's take a look at some individual
stocks on the move on this monday.
With us is bloomberg news equities
reporter alexandra semenov.
Alex, we're going to go to the name that
everybody seems to be talking about.
Yeah, well, Broadcom, guys, as you
mentioned, that sell off that we got on
Friday, basically old news today and
artificial intelligence enthusiasm is
back in full force.
Broadcom is up about 10% right now.
This is after open.
I agreed to buy the company's custom
chips and networking equipment in a
multi-year deal.
This is part of a bigger plan by this
startup.
To add a infrastructure opening, I will
design the hardware and work with
Broadcom to develop this gear.
And one of the goals by open AI is that
it'll take what it's learned so far
about AI and develop it very directly.
They said that we want to take it
directly to the hardware, unlocking new
levels of compatibility and
intelligence.
The hardware rollout should be completed
by the end of 2029.
But the interesting part here, of
course, is that there's no clear details
on how open A.I.
will be paying for.
This has been a theme very clearly.
Heard this before.
Yeah, fun stuff there, though, Alex.
What's going on with Keurig?
Dr.
Pepper?
Another stock in the green?
Yeah, we just got some news earlier.
A report from the Financial Times that
Starboard value had to build a stake in
the beverage company.
Apparently, they had started building
their stake right around when Keurig
announced it would buy ADP, the Dutch
company that owns Peet's Coffee.
The deal has been really unpopular among
investors.
Shares of Keurig Dr.
Pepper Pepper had fallen about 26% since
that deal was announced in August.
So it looks like Star Board is trying to
kind of restore investor confidence here
without making too much of a fuss about
it.
All right, Tickers, CDP, just real
quickly, JPM on the move.
I love this story.
Just got about 1520.
Yeah, shelling out $1.5 trillion into
industries that bolster US economic
security and resiliency.
And a really interesting comment from
Jamie Dimon here.
He says that we can't rely on other
countries for our own national
securities and we need to act now.
All right.
