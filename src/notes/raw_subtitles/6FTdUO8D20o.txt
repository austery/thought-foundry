Hi
 everybody,
 I'm
 Nicolola
 Tangen,
 the


CEO
 of
 the
 Norwegian
 Sovereign
 Wealth


Fund
 and
 today
 we
 are
 in
 really
 really


good
 company.
 We
 are
 in
 Singapore.
 We're


talking
 to
 Forest
 Lee,
 the
 founder
 and


the
 CEO
 of
 C,
 which
 is
 the
 largest
 tech


company
 in
 Southeast
 Asia.
 Uh,
 a
 market


leader
 in
 video
 game
 distribution
 and
 in


fintech
 and
 in
 e-commerce.
 An
 incredible


journey
 and
 a
 big
 thank
 you
 for
 taking


the
 time.


Welcome
 to
 Singapore,
 Nicola.
 Thank
 you


for
 visiting
 us.


Thank
 you.
 I
 also
 should
 say
 that
 in
 the


fund
 we
 are
 a
 big
 shareholder
 in
 C
 and


uh
 uh
 so
 we
 follow
 it
 very
 very
 closely


but
 first
 of
 all
 for
 those
 in
 um
 uh
 in


Europe
 and
 the
 US
 who
 don't
 know
 C
 what


uh
 what
 do
 you
 do?


Yeah
 C
 is
 a
 Singaporean
 technology


company
 and
 with
 the
 mission
 to
 better


the
 lives
 of
 consumers
 and
 small


businesses
 through
 technology.
 So
 we
 are


the
 technology
 company
 by
 heart
 and
 uh


it
 has
 been
 16
 years
 when
 we
 started


company
 and
 uh
 we
 primary
 uh
 focus
 on


Southeast
 Asia
 market
 uh
 as
 the
 first


market
 and
 later
 on
 we
 also
 enter
 into


some
 new
 market
 like
 uh
 Taiwan
 like
 like


a
 Brazil.
 Uh
 actually
 interestingly
 uh


the
 name
 uh
 of
 the
 we
 chosen
 the
 name
 C


as
 our
 company
 name
 is
 actually
 a
 short


form
 of
 Southeast
 Asia.
 This
 is
 a
 kind


of
 a
 a
 shout
 out
 of
 our
 of
 our
 home


market.
 We
 feel
 very
 proud
 of
 that.
 And


uh
 and
 today
 we
 primarily
 operate
 three


businesses.
 Uh
 video
 game
 business
 named


Garina
 and
 uh
 and
 an
 e-commerce
 business


named
 Shopee
 and
 more
 recently
 the


fintech
 business
 named
 uh
 named
 money.


And
 uh
 uh
 for
 Garina
 uh
 it
 started
 as
 a


just
 a
 game
 distributor
 and
 in
 Southeast


Asia
 but
 later
 on
 we
 evol
 to
 become
 a


one
 of
 the
 largest
 mobile
 game
 developer


and
 publisher
 in
 the
 world


and
 a
 self-developed
 game
 from
 Garina


named
 Freefire
 and


you
 have
 something
 like
 100
 million


people
 playing
 this
 every
 day
 right


yeah
 free
 like
 today
 is
 the
 the
 largest


mobile
 game
 in
 the
 world
 by
 daily
 active


users
 as
 you
 mentioned
 more
 than
 100


million
 people
 uh
 play
 the
 game
 from


over
 130
 countries
 every
 on
 the
 daily


basis.


Do
 you
 play
 it?


Yeah,
 I
 played
 a
 lot.


Well,
 I'm
 I'm
 I'm
 very
 pleased
 you


taking
 a
 break
 from
 uh
 from
 playing
 to


to
 talk
 to
 us.


Yeah.


Um
 but
 how
 uh
 to
 go
 from
 like
 a
 video


game
 distributor
 to
 become
 uh
 you
 know


more
 than
 hundred
 billion
 dollar
 uh


market
 cap
 company.
 Just
 how
 did
 it
 how


did
 it
 go
 about?
 How
 was
 how
 what


happened?
 Yeah,
 it
 is
 a
 it
 is
 amazing


journey
 and
 although
 we
 started
 as
 video


game
 company
 but
 our
 ambition
 our


mission
 is
 always
 like
 is is
 more
 than


that
 right
 and
 as
 we
 as
 we
 deeply
 in
 our


heart
 we
 believe
 in
 technology
 and
 I


think
 it's
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 other
 uh


things
 like
 uh
 uh
 uh
 in
 addition
 to
 to


games
 and
 can
 be
 can
 be
 done
 through
 the


through
 technology
 and
 uh
 I
 still


remember
 about
 10
 years
 ago
 when
 we


received
 our
 uh
 series
 of
 B
 funding
 we


are
 like
 uh
 we
 achieve
 uh
 we
 we
 reached


a
 billion
 dollar
 valuation.
 So
 we


officially
 become
 a
 unicorn.
 I
 think
 if


I
 remember
 correctly,
 we're
 probably
 the


first
 unicorn
 from
 uh
 from
 tech


technology
 unicorn
 from
 Southeast
 Asia.


And
 10
 years
 later
 today,
 as
 you


mentioned,
 it's
 a
 hundred
 billion
 dollar


market
 cap
 public
 company.
 And
 it's
 over


the
 10
 years
 is
 we
 achieved
 like
 a
 100


times
 of
 of
 the
 value.
 The
 biggest


contributor
 for
 that
 actually
 is
 we
 ride


a
 wave
 of
 the
 mobile
 internet


revolution.
 And
 10
 years
 ago
 is
 just
 the


very
 very
 beginning
 of
 the
 of
 the
 of
 the


all
 the
 smartphone
 and
 all
 the
 all
 the


like
 the
 applications
 on
 the
 on
 the


smartphones
 before
 that
 and
 there's
 the


internet
 there's
 a
 there's
 a
 PC
 game


actually
 we
 started
 as
 a
 PC
 game


publisher
 and
 there's
 a
 e-commerce
 but


the
 dressable
 market
 is
 much
 much


smaller
 because
 you
 need
 have
 a
 desktop


and
 to
 assess
 the
 internet
 and
 you
 need


a
 broadband
 and
 broadband
 penetration
 in


a
 lot
 of
 our
 market
 is
 still
 relatively


low
 but
 things
 completely
 changed
 when


you
 have
 the
 when
 you
 have
 the
 phone,


right?
 And
 you
 you
 like
 people
 can
 can


access
 the
 the
 internet
 and
 do
 all
 the


things
 anywhere
 anytime.


But
 you
 were
 but
 I
 mean
 you
 were
 a
 video


game
 distributor.
 How
 did
 you
 come
 up


with
 the
 idea
 of
 uh
 going
 into


e-commerce
 just
 what
 was
 the
 thinking


behind
 that?
 Yeah,
 it's
 a
 down
 to
 the


like
 what
 is
 the
 fundamental
 value
 and


the
 technology
 can
 bring
 and
 and
 I
 I
 I


remember
 um
 interestingly
 actually
 10


years
 ago
 and
 I
 I
 sometimes
 I
 brought
 my


family
 to
 China
 for
 holidays
 and
 uh
 at


that
 time
 I
 I
 have
 a
 six-year-old


daughter.
 It's
 a
 like
 a
 Yeah.
 So
 uh
 to


to
 we
 are
 very
 very
 impressed
 by
 how


much
 like
 e-commerce
 has
 developed


especially
 like
 the
 mobile
 the
 mobile


e-commerce
 developed
 in
 in
 China.
 So
 on


our
 trip
 and
 uh
 uh
 sometimes
 my
 my


daughter
 want
 this,
 want
 that,
 like
 no


matter
 what
 she
 wanted
 and
 it's
 just
 a


few
 kind
 of
 taps
 and
 and
 the
 swaps
 on


her
 mom's
 phone
 and
 the
 the
 the
 box
 just


delivered
 to
 the
 door
 next
 day
 and
 uh


and
 whatever
 he
 want
 she
 want
 it
 will
 be


in
 the
 in
 the
 box.
 to
 her
 this
 is
 a
 this


is
 a
 magic
 and
 u
 and
 I
 I
 give
 a
 lot
 of


thoughts
 about
 it
 like
 when
 we
 came
 back


to
 Singapore
 and
 I
 think
 this
 is
 just
 a


great
 business
 and
 it's
 a
 it's
 a
 creates


so
 much
 value
 and
 creates
 so
 much
 joy


and
 convenience
 to
 to
 consumers
 and
 and


it's
 hard
 for
 me
 to
 swallow
 the
 fact


such
 business
 such
 thing
 doesn't
 exist


in
 in
 Southeast
 Asia.


But
 but
 how
 do
 you
 um
 uh
 so
 how
 do
 you


go
 from
 having
 the
 idea
 to
 actually


executing
 this?
 Because
 now
 you
 have


what
 what
 market
 share
 in
 Southeast


Asia?
 You
 have
 close
 to
 half
 the
 market


or


Yeah.
 Yeah.


Yeah.
 So
 you
 go
 from
 nothing
 to
 half
 the


market
 in
 Southeast
 Asia.
 You
 you
 beat


uh
 Alibaba,
 Tik
 Tok
 and
 so
 on.
 Um
 how
 do


you
 go
 about
 it?
 There's
 a
 lot
 of


factors
 and
 uh
 but
 the
 thing
 is
 like


what
 we
 really
 really
 focus
 on
 is
 coming


out
 the
 local
 solutions
 and
 because
 of


uh
 we
 are
 we
 we
 before
 that
 we
 are
 video


game
 company
 right
 and
 we
 are
 a
 game


company
 and
 we
 we
 have
 a
 pretty
 much


have
 a
 zero
 e-commerce
 experience
 and
 uh


and
 we
 never
 done
 e-commerce
 in
 other


market
 right
 and
 so
 when
 we
 try
 to
 uh


address
 this
 this
 like
 looking
 at
 this


business
 opportunity
 we
 really
 go
 to


down
 to
 the
 fundamentals
 and
 we
 don't


have
 a
 ready
 to
 go
 playbook
 from
 other


market.
 I
 say
 what
 is
 really
 matters
 in


in
 any
 every
 specific
 market
 what
 is
 the


best
 solution
 for
 that


um
 for
 example
 I
 think
 a
 key


differentiator
 for
 us
 over
 the
 years
 is


the
 logistics
 capability
 we
 have
 a
 we


have
 a
 build
 and
 uh
 we
 are
 the
 only


e-commerce
 player
 today
 uh
 have
 a
 build


up
 a
 lot
 of
 uh
 uh
 capability
 in
 terms
 of


the
 logistics
 and
 it's
 a
 it's
 a
 very


very
 important
 and
 because
 of
 number
 one


and
 this
 is
 a
 key
 things
 for
 the


customer
 experience
 right
 is
 it
 doesn't


matter
 how
 good
 things
 you
 you
 buy,
 how


cheap
 you
 buy
 and
 people
 really
 care


where
 I
 can
 have
 it,
 can
 I
 have
 it
 on


time
 and
 and
 can
 I
 have
 it
 in
 the
 good


condition
 of
 the
 of
 the
 puzzle.
 So
 this


is
 a
 very
 very
 important
 but
 it's
 a
 very


very
 hard
 problem
 to
 solve
 and
 the


Southeast
 Asia
 is
 a
 very
 vast
 geography


with
 a
 very
 complicated
 situation
 and


the
 roads
 right
 and
 the
 and
 the
 and
 you


know
 a
 lot
 of
 places
 there's
 a
 not


complete
 address
 system
 there's
 a
 no


kind
 of
 like
 a
 like
 a
 postcode
 database


right
 and
 you
 you
 always
 see
 that
 the


the
 customer
 just
 describe
 the
 address


the
 the
 delivery
 uh
 like
 a
 point
 is
 okay


you
 you
 you
 drive
 into
 the
 village
 and


You
 keep
 driving,
 you
 see
 a
 mosque
 and


turn
 right
 and
 then
 after
 two
 big
 trees


you
 see
 a
 red
 house
 on
 the
 left
 that
 is


that
 is
 a
 address.
 Yeah.
 So
 definitely


you
 cannot
 find
 such
 a
 place
 on
 on


Google
 map
 and
 and
 over
 the
 time
 we
 have


to
 build
 up
 our
 own
 address
 book
 with


address
 system
 based
 on
 all
 this
 uh
 all


this
 information
 and
 that
 is
 become
 very


very
 very
 very
 important.


How
 much
 money
 have
 you
 spent
 building


the
 infrastructure
 on
 the
 logistic
 side?


Well
 um
 well
 it's
 it's
 it's
 a
 sizable


investment
 but
 we
 have
 been
 very
 very
 uh


very
 very
 uh
 smart
 and
 very
 very


cautious
 in
 terms
 of
 the
 capital
 things


and
 most
 of
 our
 facilities
 is
 a
 is
 on


the
 lease
 basis
 we
 don't
 really
 purchase


land
 we
 don't
 really
 purchase
 a
 building


but
 I
 think
 it's
 a
 it's
 a
 it's
 a
 less


about
 the
 money
 is
 about
 the
 effort
 and


it's
 about
 the
 determinations
 um
 we
 are


we
 are
 not
 a
 logistics
 company
 right
 and


and
 we
 don't
 have
 the
 in-house
 logistics


team
 have
 been
 very
 very
 good
 experience


really
 focus
 on
 things,
 but
 we
 have
 a


lot
 of
 a
 very
 very
 smart
 talent,
 right?


And
 is
 it
 do
 you
 really
 want
 your
 best


talent
 to
 work
 on
 those
 challenges?
 Like


most
 of
 the
 people
 they
 say
 they


probably
 don't
 want
 to
 work
 on
 those


things,
 but
 if
 you
 want
 to
 build
 up
 a


successful
 e-commerce
 business,
 this
 is


the
 things
 you
 have
 to
 work
 on.
 That's


why
 we
 assign
 our
 best
 talent
 and
 the


smartest
 ones,
 right?
 and
 to
 to
 to
 focus


on
 those
 issues
 and
 they
 put
 a
 lot
 of


effort
 to
 figure
 out
 every
 single
 point


A
 to
 point
 B
 for
 the
 route
 and
 what
 is


the
 best
 way
 what
 is
 optimized
 way
 for


delivery
 which
 is
 the
 cheapest
 cost
 and


with
 the
 shortest
 time
 so
 and
 this
 is
 a


very
 very
 much
 a
 and
 and
 bottom
 up


effort
 what
 are
 the
 key
 factors
 uh
 that


you
 have
 to
 what
 are
 kind
 of
 the
 key


boxes
 you
 have
 to
 tick
 in
 order
 to
 beat


these
 competitors
 you
 know
 what
 are
 the


other
 things
 learn
 logistic
 six
 that
 you


think
 are
 important


many
 many
 things
 and
 but
 I
 think
 what


really
 uh
 matters
 to
 us
 is
 a
 it's
 a
 it's


a
 very
 long-term
 horizon
 I
 think
 like
 we


believe
 in
 this
 business
 and
 uh
 we
 we
 we


do
 this
 business
 I
 mean
 we
 see
 Southeast


Asia
 is
 our
 home
 market
 and
 uh
 we
 for


foresee
 ourself
 will
 be
 an
 e-commerce


supplier
 here
 forever
 so
 whatever
 we


build
 is
 a
 very
 very
 very
 long-term


focus
 and
 uh
 uh
 we
 care
 not
 much
 about


the
 competitors
 I
 mean
 over
 the
 time
 we


have
 gone
 through
 several
 round
 of


competitions
 and
 uh
 competitors


sometimes
 come
 and
 go
 and
 they
 come
 by


waves
 and
 they
 also
 leave
 by
 waves
 and


but
 we
 are
 the
 one
 always
 stay
 here
 and


this
 is
 our
 home
 ground
 so
 and
 we
 have


been
 very
 very
 focused
 on
 to
 build
 up


the
 customer
 satisfaction
 I
 think
 we're


very
 obsessed
 with
 with
 our
 customers


right
 is
 it
 on
 every
 day
 on
 a
 daily


basis
 and
 our
 NPS
 score
 is
 getting


better
 is
 the
 customer
 just
 more
 happier


is
 happier
 to
 buy
 things
 on
 shopppee
 are


they
 buying
 more
 are
 they
 buying
 more


frequently


and
 and
 they
 give
 give
 us
 more
 trust.
 So


I
 think
 that
 is
 really
 kind
 of
 the
 the


the
 the
 advantage
 and
 we
 want
 to
 we
 want


to
 build
 and
 to
 make
 a
 sustainable


success
 here.


So
 what
 are
 the
 numbers
 you
 look
 at
 on
 a


daily
 basis
 from
 from
 this
 part
 of
 the


business?


Wow.
 Uh
 there
 there's
 a
 there's
 a
 quite


a
 lot
 and
 it
 start
 with
 the
 the
 daily


the
 orders
 the
 the
 GMBB
 and
 the
 active


user
 numbers
 on
 our
 app
 right
 and
 the


the
 the
 purchase
 frequency
 and
 for
 every


delivery
 is
 like
 the
 we
 we
 don't
 look
 at


every
 single
 delivery
 but
 we
 look
 at
 and


and
 cohort
 basis
 is
 what
 is
 the
 average


delivery
 time
 and
 is
 this
 meet
 our


expectation
 is
 getting
 better
 than
 the


and
 the
 last
 last
 week
 and
 what
 is
 the


customer
 service
 satisfaction


satisfaction
 rate
 right
 and
 how
 how
 how


soon
 we
 resolve
 the
 customer
 complaints


the
 issues.
 So
 all
 those
 small
 things


and
 it's
 not
 for
 us
 we
 also
 track
 all


the
 merchant
 right
 and
 you
 know
 we
 have


a
 we
 have
 a
 chatbot
 like
 for
 the


customer
 service
 it's
 not
 only
 for
 us


between
 us
 and
 the
 the
 customers
 it's


also
 between
 every
 single
 merchant
 and


the
 customers
 we
 want
 to
 make
 sure
 all


the
 merchant
 on
 shopppee
 platform
 also


provide
 a
 very
 good
 customer
 service
 we


also
 check
 them
 we
 read
 them
 in
 terms
 of


how
 quickly
 they
 respond
 to
 a
 customer


inquiry
 so
 this
 is
 and
 and
 we
 we
 have


certain
 incentive
 to
 encourage
 them
 to


do
 to
 do
 it
 to
 do
 it
 better.


What
 are
 what
 do
 you
 think
 is
 going
 to


be
 the
 future
 development
 in
 this


business?
 What
 are
 the
 what
 are
 the
 next


developments?
 I
 think
 like
 fundamentally


uh
 the
 core
 of
 the
 e-commerce
 is
 like


how
 do
 you
 make
 sure
 it's
 number
 one
 is


it's
 a
 more
 affordable
 and
 more


accessible
 to
 more
 people
 to
 have
 more


people
 to
 enjoy
 the
 benefit
 of
 the


e-commerce
 and
 uh
 this
 is
 rel
 to
 a
 lot


of
 work
 in
 the
 in
 the
 supply
 chain
 uh


like
 optimizations
 at
 this
 moment
 if
 we


are
 not
 just
 matching
 uh
 whatever
 the


the
 the
 the
 merchandise
 with
 the


customers
 we
 also
 put
 a
 lot
 of
 effort
 to


work
 with
 a
 lot
 of
 uh
 upstream


uh
 suppliers
 and
 how
 to
 make
 their


product
 more
 uh
 attractive,
 more
 more


competitive.
 Like
 we
 we
 provide
 a
 lot
 of


them
 the
 the
 the
 market
 information
 what


really
 customers
 want
 and
 to
 help
 them


to
 do
 better
 businesses
 and
 uh
 and
 uh


and
 again
 so
 delivery
 is
 a
 big
 things.


It's
 a
 it's
 a
 very
 very
 important
 part


in
 the
 whole
 e-commerce
 experience
 and


there's
 still
 a
 lot
 of
 more
 we
 can
 do


and
 you
 can
 be
 always
 be
 make
 it
 cheaper


and
 faster.
 So
 we're
 going
 to
 keep
 doing


on
 that
 and
 uh
 and
 uh
 we
 also
 noticed


there's
 a
 certain
 like
 a
 new
 trend
 right


and
 and
 the
 and
 about
 about
 the
 industry


and
 more
 recently
 the
 the
 live


streaming.
 So
 that
 is
 a
 new
 way
 of
 uh


selling
 things
 and
 the
 engagement
 uh


with
 the
 with
 the
 with
 the
 with
 the


buyers
 and
 uh
 and
 and
 also
 that's
 could


be
 just
 a
 way
 to
 do
 e-com
 to
 do


e-commerce
 customer
 service.
 You
 can


just
 sitting
 there
 do
 the
 live
 streaming


to
 answer
 questions
 whatever
 whatever


questions
 you
 have
 on
 the
 on
 the


product.
 So
 we
 embrace
 that
 format.
 We


want
 to
 make
 sure
 whoever
 want
 to


selling
 through
 live
 streaming,
 it
 can


also
 sell
 on
 on
 Shopee.
 So
 um
 the
 the


industry
 will
 continually
 evolve.
 But


I'll
 say
 this
 will
 be
 just
 gradually
 and


the
 fundamental
 things
 will
 not
 change


and
 just
 make
 things
 cheaper
 and
 and


faster
 to
 customers
 and
 uh
 and
 for


whatever
 you
 can
 do.
 Yeah.


And
 so
 what
 part
 of
 the
 technology
 are


you
 working
 on
 just
 now
 to
 develop


further?
 Well,
 um
 there
 there's
 many


many
 things
 but
 if
 you
 have
 to
 call
 out


uh
 a
 very
 very
 specific
 ones
 like


actually
 we
 are
 very
 very
 excited
 to
 see


how
 how
 much
 AI
 can
 help
 to
 to
 improve


the
 businesses
 and
 we
 have
 already
 seen


some
 uh
 very
 visible
 progress
 and
 for


example
 considering
 the
 the
 the
 the


transaction
 volume
 we
 are
 dealing
 with


on
 the
 daily
 basis
 it's
 such
 a
 big


business
 it's
 like
 we
 handle
 like


millions
 of
 customer
 inquiries
 on
 the


daily
 basis
 every
 behind
 And
 every


purchase
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 uh
 inquiries.


The
 customer
 always
 want
 to
 know
 like
 uh


is
 it
 something
 really
 good
 to
 buy?
 What


is
 the
 color
 do
 you
 have?
 And
 I
 already


made
 a
 purchase
 and
 when
 can
 I
 receive


it?
 Where's
 my
 puzzle?
 Yeah.
 If
 I
 don't


like
 it,
 what
 can
 I
 do?
 Right.
 And


there's
 what
 else
 do
 you
 sell?
 So,
 and


now
 like
 80%
 of
 such
 inquiries
 is


handled
 by
 AI
 chatbot.


Oh
 wow.


And
 the
 satisfaction
 rate
 is
 very
 very


high.
 And
 we
 do
 the
 AB
 test
 for
 some
 we


ask
 the
 chatbot
 like
 enabled
 by
 AI
 to
 to


to
 to
 to
 do
 to
 do
 the
 to to
 do
 the


customer
 service
 some
 is
 by
 human
 being


and
 we
 compare
 the
 satisfaction
 rate
 and


actually
 it's
 it's
 on
 par.


Wow.


Yeah.
 So
 it's
 a
 and
 now
 even
 we
 use
 uh


AI
 tools
 to
 train
 our
 customer
 service


representative
 even
 like
 we
 use
 a
 AI


tool
 a
 kind
 of
 a
 AI
 like
 a
 c
 service


trainer
 to
 train
 the
 the
 train
 customer


service
 human
 representative
 so
 it's
 a


that's
 that's
 yeah
 that's
 a
 very


interesting


what
 about
 the
 uh
 the
 gaming
 business


what
 is
 the
 latest
 developments
 there


the
 latest
 development
 and
 uh
 actually


to
 us
 is
 a
 uh
 free
 fire
 is
 already
 like


a
 very
 very
 successful
 very
 very


successful
 game
 and
 uh
 and
 increasingly


and
 and
 and
 we
 we we
 notice
 it's
 a
 and


and
 the
 game
 is
 is
 a
 beyond
 the
 game


actually
 it's
 a
 it's
 a
 really
 become
 a


platform
 if
 you
 think
 about
 freef
 fire


as
 a
 app
 on
 your
 phone
 right
 it's
 it's
 a


mobile
 game
 it's
 a
 huge
 uh
 aggregator
 of


a
 of
 a
 of
 a
 traffic
 and
 increasingly
 we


see
 when
 you
 have
 that
 traffic
 whatever


the
 new
 game
 content
 the
 new
 game
 play


you
 can
 just
 keep
 adding
 into
 this


platform
 enter
 into
 this
 game
 so
 it's
 a


the
 game
 is
 really
 become
 not
 just
 a


product
 and
 finished
 products
 become
 a


service
 and
 it
 become
 evergreen
 uh


platform.
 I
 think
 this
 is
 a
 this
 is
 a


very
 very
 powerful
 and
 now
 uh
 we
 even


can
 identify
 a
 lot
 of
 social
 trend
 on


the
 on
 the
 in
 the
 game
 like
 people


really
 talk
 about
 what
 is
 the
 hot
 topic


in
 the
 in
 the
 in
 their
 community
 in


their
 society
 right
 and
 uh
 and
 actually


last
 year
 and
 there
 is
 a
 very
 famous
 uh


uh
 like
 there's
 a
 like
 a
 hippo
 become


very
 very
 famous
 in
 Thailand
 and


suddenly
 become
 a
 global
 phenomenon
 like


everybody
 say
 oh
 this
 baby
 hippo
 is
 so


cute
 and
 it's
 so
 adorable
 and
 within
 two


week
 two
 weeks
 and
 we
 build
 this
 hippo


into
 the
 game.
 It's
 a
 become
 in-game


character
 and
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 in-game


kind
 of
 a
 custom
 like
 a
 pet
 related
 to


this
 hippo
 and
 it's
 it's
 really
 really


loved
 by
 the
 by
 the
 gamers
 the
 tie


gamers
 feel
 very
 very
 proud
 to
 say
 oh


this
 is
 a
 local
 there's
 a
 games
 so
 local


they
 care
 what
 we
 we
 care
 here
 and


globally
 everybody
 say
 oh
 this
 is
 so


cute
 people
 and
 want
 to
 go
 to
 talent
 to


to
 to
 to
 see
 it
 is
 a
 is
 a
 so
 it's
 a
 it's


beyond
 the
 game
 and
 we
 see
 a
 lot
 of


social
 media
 post
 about
 the
 the
 in-game


character
 of
 these
 people
 also
 make
 the


freef
 fire
 like
 a
 more
 famous
 and
 beyond


the
 gamer
 audience.
 I
 think
 this
 this
 is


some
 new
 trend
 we
 have
 been
 observing


and
 I'm
 a
 big
 believer.
 I
 think
 like
 the


game
 is
 increasingly
 become
 the
 primary


entertainment
 and
 social
 tools
 for
 the


younger
 generation.


What
 are
 some
 of
 the
 other
 developments


that
 you
 think
 we
 could
 be
 seeing
 here


going
 forward?
 Uh
 well
 again
 so
 I
 have


to
 mention
 AI
 again
 this
 is
 the
 this
 is


the
 things
 really
 uh
 will
 be
 the


gamecher
 and
 uh
 uh
 we
 have
 already
 seen


that
 and
 uh
 and
 it's
 very
 obvious
 on
 the


production
 side
 right
 and
 for
 any
 game


you
 know
 you
 need
 to
 generate
 a
 lot
 of


keep
 generating
 new
 content
 is
 generate


a
 lot
 of
 code
 and
 generate
 a
 lot
 of
 uh


arts
 right
 and
 previously
 a
 lot
 of


things
 has
 been
 done
 like
 for
 the
 very


very
 basic
 ones
 we
 have
 to
 outsource
 for


third
 party
 like
 a
 studios
 like
 I'm


talking
 about
 the
 arts
 and
 they
 they


came
 up
 we
 give
 them
 the
 concept
 they


came
 up
 some
 very
 basic
 drawings
 and


then
 our
 in-house
 senior
 designer
 just


look
 at
 one
 by
 one
 and
 pick
 the
 good


ones
 and
 give
 the
 final
 touch
 and
 before


go
 to
 production
 and
 now
 entire
 this


process
 is
 a
 is
 a
 very
 much
 done
 by
 AI


and
 it's
 like
 our
 our
 designer
 just
 tell


the
 AI
 tools
 okay
 generate
 things
 for
 me


I
 want
 this
 and
 imagine
 this
 word


imagine
 this
 character
 tell
 me
 and


suddenly
 a
 lot
 of
 it
 could
 be
 generated


I
 mean
 there
 are
 they're
 not
 that


consistent
 yet
 the
 quality
 and
 uh
 there


could
 be
 errors
 here
 and
 there
 and
 but


it's
 a
 it's
 a
 it's
 a
 good
 starting
 point


and
 again
 so
 our
 our
 in-house
 senior


designer
 will
 just
 pick
 the
 ones
 is


really
 good
 and
 just
 do
 the
 final
 touch


and
 supervise
 the
 entire
 process.
 So


that's
 save
 a
 lot
 of
 uh
 time.
 I
 think


that's
 will
 largely
 increase
 the
 uh


productivity
 on
 the
 on
 the
 on
 the


creativity
 side
 and
 but
 I
 actually
 more


important
 and
 it's
 a
 more
 exciting
 part


is
 on
 the
 gaming
 experience
 part.
 I


think
 it's
 still
 at
 very
 very
 early


stage.
 Um
 but
 I
 very
 see
 the
 result.
 I


can
 give
 you
 uh
 example
 the
 certain


things
 we're
 are
 trying.
 So
 for
 example


like
 a
 free
 fire
 is
 really
 a
 a
 team


game.
 So
 it's
 it's
 a
 kind
 of
 like
 a
 it's


the
 the
 biggest
 fun
 is
 coming
 from
 you


go
 together
 play
 the
 game
 with
 other


people
 you
 form
 a
 team
 and
 together
 and


come
 out
 a
 different
 strategy
 different


game
 play
 and
 people
 play
 different
 role


try
 to
 win
 as
 a
 team
 together
 and
 but
 we


have
 a
 lot
 of
 very
 shy
 gamers
 they
 just


don't
 want
 to
 reach
 out
 to
 other
 gamers


and
 they
 they
 log
 into
 the
 game
 they


just
 play
 solo
 and
 they
 always
 play
 solo


I
 think
 it's
 great
 to
 play
 solo
 has
 a


great
 experience
 but
 we
 feel
 it's
 it's


something
 missing
 it's
 a
 waste
 because


actually
 would
 much
 much
 more
 enjoy


enjoyable
 if
 you
 play
 as
 a
 team
 game.
 So


what
 we're
 doing
 now
 is
 like
 before
 we


try
 to
 match
 them
 up
 with
 the
 team
 up


with
 them
 with
 some
 bots,
 right?
 And
 but


the
 boss
 is
 very
 very
 predictable.
 It's


very
 very
 stupid
 in
 a
 in
 a
 way
 after
 a


while
 you
 know
 this
 is
 a
 boss
 is
 not


fun.
 It's
 not
 fun
 to
 really
 play


together
 and
 but
 because
 of
 the
 the
 the


the
 new
 technology
 the
 AI
 actually
 the


boss
 become
 much
 much
 smarter
 and
 they


can
 not
 only
 play
 the
 game
 with
 you
 give


you
 the
 guidance
 what
 you
 do
 in
 the
 game


they
 also
 can
 chat
 with
 you
 can
 make
 a


joke
 with
 you
 it's
 a
 really
 kind
 of


become
 a
 very
 much
 a
 similar
 a
 human


experience
 it's
 it's
 so
 real
 that
 it's
 a


for
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 cases
 you
 can
 cannot


really
 hard
 to
 tell
 the
 difference


how
 many
 people
 do
 you
 have
 in
 game


development


um
 we
 have
 about
 2,000
 2,000
 people


developing
 games.
 Yeah.
 Wow.
 What
 is
 a


good
 game?


What
 is
 a
 good
 game?


Well,
 and
 it's
 a
 fun
 game
 to
 play
 and


it's
 a
 it's
 a
 it's
 a
 fun
 to
 play
 within


the
 first
 hour
 and
 it's
 a
 it's
 still
 fun


to
 play
 after
 100
 hours
 and
 uh
 it's
 a


it's
 easy
 to
 start.
 It's
 like
 we
 want
 to


build
 up
 the
 game.
 Uh
 it's
 accessible
 to


everyone.
 We
 want
 everybody
 become
 a


gamer
 and
 enjoying
 the
 game
 play.


But
 you
 need
 you
 need
 a
 you
 need
 a


practice
 and
 you
 need
 a
 lot
 of
 effort
 to


become
 a
 expert.
 Yeah.


So
 I
 think
 that
 is
 the
 key
 element
 in
 my


view
 of
 a
 good
 game.


Now
 the
 last
 the
 third
 area
 you
 have
 is


um
 is
 fintech.
 What
 are
 you
 tell
 us
 what


are
 you
 doing
 there?
 Oh,
 this
 is
 a


amazing
 and
 this
 is
 a
 very
 very
 exciting


business
 and
 we
 have
 a
 we
 think
 we
 have


a
 we
 have
 a
 full
 potential
 there
 and
 uh


we
 we
 I
 mean
 we
 start
 this
 businesses
 uh


actually
 by
 resolving
 a
 lot
 of
 uh
 issues


we
 have
 the
 the
 challenge
 we
 have
 for


our
 video
 game
 business
 and
 for
 our


e-commerce
 businesses
 right
 and
 uh
 and


in
 the
 early
 days
 like
 uh
 even
 we


publish
 the
 games
 and
 we
 have
 the
 best


games
 from
 all
 over
 the
 world
 and
 uh
 but


because
 of
 the
 people
 no
 credit
 card
 and


for
 the
 gamers
 they
 have
 no
 way
 to
 pay


us
 and
 We
 have
 to
 build
 up
 a
 a
 cash
 card


like
 a
 gift
 card
 network
 ourself
 as
 a


game
 company.
 is
 a
 build
 up.
 It's
 a


payment
 network.
 And
 I
 remember
 the
 days


I
 drive
 my
 car
 with
 all
 the
 bags
 of
 a


credit
 card
 to
 go
 around
 7-Eleven
 to


distribute
 and
 to
 count
 how
 many
 cars
 I


have
 in
 the
 in
 in
 the
 stock
 and
 how
 much


money
 I
 I
 I
 I
 receive
 and
 uh
 and
 uh
 and


and
 and
 and
 later
 on
 and
 for
 e-commerce


online
 transaction
 is
 a
 become
 a
 big


challenge
 as
 well,
 right?
 and
 uh
 and


there's
 so
 many
 transactions
 and
 how
 you


want
 to
 make
 sure
 the
 transaction
 is
 all


smooth
 in
 such
 a
 large
 scale
 and
 uh
 and


in
 a
 very
 very
 safe
 way.
 So
 that's
 the


this
 all
 the
 challenge
 we
 we
 started


with.
 So
 thus
 we
 build
 up
 a
 lot
 of


solution
 the
 product
 under
 the
 money
 or


fintech
 business
 umbrella
 to
 solve
 these


issues.
 But
 actually
 we
 see
 a


increasingly
 we
 see
 a
 very
 very
 big


opportunity
 is
 a
 is
 because
 of
 our


e-commerce
 businesses
 we
 realize
 and
 and


when
 people
 want
 to
 buy
 things
 and
 they


really
 don't
 have
 much
 access
 to
 the


consumption
 credit
 and
 such
 a
 issue
 has


been
 largely
 resolved
 in
 most
 of
 the


market
 western
 market
 by
 credit
 card
 but


as
 you
 know
 the
 credit
 card
 penetration


is
 relatively
 low
 in
 most
 of
 the
 market


we
 operated
 in
 so
 people
 just
 do
 not


have
 access
 to
 credit
 and
 that's
 why
 we


introduced
 the
 like
 through
 our
 uh


shopppee
 purchase
 and
 we
 introduced
 this


a
 it's
 a
 credit
 line
 for
 them
 like
 they


can
 just
 buy
 things
 now
 but
 uh
 pay
 it


later
 in
 some
 other
 western
 market
 this


is
 just
 just
 a
 supplementary
 to
 the


credit
 card
 but
 here
 because
 it's
 become


a
 major
 main
 solution
 so
 uh
 even
 like


within
 a
 very
 short
 period
 of
 time
 money


already
 is
 already
 the
 largest
 largest


digital
 lender
 for
 the
 for
 the
 for
 the


consumer
 consumption
 like
 digital
 like


in
 in
 Southeast
 Asia
 and
 it's
 we
 already


have
 over
 $7
 billion
 loan
 book
 and
 it's


growing
 very
 very
 rapidly.


So
 uh
 in
 a
 way
 these
 businesses
 fit


together
 and
 there
 is
 a
 logical


connection
 between
 them.


Yeah.


What
 would
 be
 the
 next
 logical
 extension


of
 your
 business
 mix?
 Well,
 uh
 there
 is


a
 lot
 of
 things
 and
 we
 can
 and
 we
 can
 we


can
 think
 about
 it
 and
 at
 this
 moment


and
 uh
 uh
 we
 we
 haven't
 really
 we
 don't


rush
 into
 say
 okay
 this
 is
 will
 be
 a
 a


new
 business
 we're
 going
 to
 enter
 into
 I


think
 there's
 a
 still
 so
 much
 we
 can
 do


and
 uh
 and
 uh
 in
 in
 the
 three
 verticals


we
 have
 and
 this
 is
 indeed
 a
 very
 very


three
 very
 very
 big
 verticals
 and
 three


very
 very
 big
 applications
 at
 at
 the


moment


you
 mentioned
 AI
 several
 times
 Could
 we


see
 you
 going
 into
 a
 more
 pure
 play
 AI?


It
 could
 be.
 It
 could
 be.
 And
 uh
 and
 at


this
 moment
 and
 and
 as
 I
 mentioned,
 we


we
 we
 have
 put
 a
 lot
 of
 effort
 on
 the


each
 business
 lines
 and
 for
 the
 for
 the


for
 the
 specific
 applications.
 But
 on


the
 company
 level
 and
 the
 and
 we
 have
 a


lot
 of
 new
 initiative
 as
 well.
 We
 look


at
 the
 entire
 organiz
 how
 the


organization
 is
 structured
 is
 organized.


Is
 it
 like
 a
 very
 much
 a
 AI
 ccentric


organization?
 And
 I
 think
 that
 will
 be


the
 future.
 And
 also
 we
 encourage
 a
 lot


of
 bottom
 up
 initiatives.
 And
 back
 to
 10


years
 ago
 when
 we
 just
 uh
 get
 into
 the


the
 the
 mobile
 internet
 revolution.
 And


I
 remember
 we
 we
 in-house
 developed
 a


lot
 of
 pilot
 and
 all
 the
 different
 type


of
 apps
 right
 and
 uh
 they
 called
 all
 the


different
 names
 and
 try
 to
 uh
 try
 to


become
 become
 a
 big
 business
 and


eventually
 shopppee
 actually
 one
 of
 the


it's
 a
 project
 number
 six
 become
 a
 very


very
 big
 mobile
 e-commerce
 businesses


and
 uh
 and
 today
 again
 so
 we
 have
 a


several
 like
 agent
 platforms
 and
 uh
 so


we
 provide
 the
 tools
 in
 house
 we
 allow


we
 encourage
 everybody
 in
 the
 company
 uh


with
 or
 without
 coding
 experience
 to


build
 up
 the
 agent
 for
 their
 specific


need.
 So
 I
 do
 believe
 like
 whatever
 uh


the
 new
 business
 opportunity
 we
 may


capture
 you
 you
 have
 to
 start
 with
 solve


a
 very
 very
 specific
 problem
 and
 now
 we


we
 we
 provide
 the
 tools
 and
 we
 start


with
 some
 in-house
 problems
 and


hopefully
 if
 something
 really
 become


valuable
 and
 can
 can
 be
 applied
 not
 only


inhouse
 but
 for
 the
 more
 like
 a
 broader


customer
 base
 and
 we
 should
 launch
 it
 as


a
 as
 a
 standalone
 business
 that
 will
 be


the
 new
 new
 business
 enabled
 by
 by
 AI.


Which
 companies
 in
 the
 world
 do
 you


admire
 the
 most?


Well,
 um
 there's
 a
 there's
 a
 lot
 of


great
 companies
 and
 uh
 I
 think
 it's
 it's


hard
 for
 me
 to
 pick
 any
 specific
 one
 and


but
 there's
 so
 many
 uh
 great
 things
 and


we
 can
 we
 can
 learn
 the
 the
 the
 but
 uh
 I


I
 do
 admire
 uh
 in
 our
 industry.
 So


Amazon
 I
 think
 it's
 a
 they
 have
 they


have
 the
 best
 they
 they're
 the
 pioneer


not
 only
 the
 pioneer
 of
 the
 of
 the


e-commerce
 and
 also
 there's
 also
 doing


uh
 doing
 great
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 things
 we
 we


we
 have
 to
 learn
 for
 them
 very
 very


obsession
 with
 the
 customers
 and
 always


focus
 on
 lower
 low
 price
 for
 the


customers
 deliver
 the
 value
 to
 the


customers
 then
 really
 really
 focus
 on


logistics
 network
 which
 we
 also
 believe


that
 is
 a
 key
 part
 of
 the
 e-commerce


businesses
 and
 what
 we
 want
 to
 uh
 learn


from
 them
 and
 also
 follow
 their
 path
 is


like
 uh
 they
 they
 they
 kind
 of
 like


incubate
 their
 cloud
 business
 and
 some


additionally
 a
 lot
 of
 new
 businesses


through
 their
 original
 e-commerce


businesses.
 Hope
 we
 can
 follow
 that
 path


as
 well
 to
 continually
 uh
 grow.


What
 would
 it
 take
 for
 you
 to
 be
 a


trillion
 dollar
 company?


Well,
 I
 think
 it
 will
 be
 AI.
 Yeah.
 And


uh
 and
 uh
 again
 so
 mobile
 internet
 we


ride
 we
 ride
 wave
 of
 the
 mobile
 internet


revolution
 and
 make
 us
 a
 hundred


billion.
 It's
 hundred
 billion
 dollar


company
 and
 it's
 hard
 for
 us
 to
 imagine


uh
 without
 the
 mobile
 internet


revolution
 if
 we
 are
 just
 a
 PC
 game
 like


a
 distributor.
 I
 think
 doesn't
 matter


how
 good
 we
 are
 there'll
 be
 no
 way
 for


us
 to
 to
 be
 where
 we
 are
 today
 and
 and
 I


think
 it's
 a
 trillion
 dollar
 trillion


dollar
 business
 is
 always
 aspiration
 and


uh
 but
 increasingly
 I
 see
 the
 path


there.
 I
 think
 it's
 the
 answer
 will
 be


will
 be
 AI
 and
 and
 the
 AI
 just
 will
 be


just
 a
 lot
 of
 value
 creation
 and
 and


make
 people's
 the
 technology
 will
 make


people's
 life
 very
 very
 different
 today


and
 in
 a
 very
 very
 better
 ways.
 I
 think


this
 will
 be
 bring
 a
 lot
 of
 convenience


and
 joy
 to
 the
 to
 the
 to
 the
 to
 the


customers
 and
 large
 large
 value
 will
 be


created.
 A
 big
 pie
 will
 be
 created
 and


hope
 we
 just
 do
 our
 best
 to
 capture
 part


of
 it
 and
 uh
 and
 and
 a
 trillion
 dollar


is
 is
 very
 achievable


given
 the
 markets
 you're
 in
 the
 the


share
 price
 can
 be
 very
 volatile
 and
 you


know
 the
 share
 price
 was
 up
 uh
 I
 know


five
 times
 and
 it's
 down
 70%
 and
 now


it's
 back
 up
 sharply.
 Does
 that
 uh


impact
 the
 way
 you
 think?
 Well,
 uh
 I
 I


think
 it's
 a
 it's
 a
 good
 journey
 for
 us.


I
 mean
 appreciate
 we
 have
 gone
 through


that
 and
 and
 we
 are
 really
 uh
 proud
 and


we
 have
 survived
 all
 those
 up
 and
 the


downs
 and


and
 uh
 um
 well
 I
 I
 would
 say
 there's
 a


there's
 not
 much
 impact
 and
 a
 lot
 of


time
 the
 share
 price
 just
 reflect
 the


external
 perception
 of
 the
 of
 the
 market


of
 the
 business
 of
 the
 of
 the
 company


but
 I
 think
 like
 uh
 I
 as
 we
 stay
 true


our
 with
 our
 belief
 which
 we
 believe
 in


technology
 I
 think
 technology
 will
 keep


advancing
 and
 the
 technology
 uh
 across


the
 entire
 history
 in
 the
 past
 and
 also


probably
 in
 the
 future
 just
 continually


getting
 better
 and
 and
 change
 people's


life
 in
 a
 better
 way
 create
 a
 lot
 of


value
 and
 uh
 and
 uh
 and
 that
 is
 a
 that


is
 a
 very
 very
 kind
 of
 like
 a
 like


convincing
 and
 uh
 and
 we
 we
 deeply


believe
 in
 that
 and
 on
 top
 of
 that
 I


think
 there
 is
 a
 huge
 market
 right
 and
 u


and
 today
 uh
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 still


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 part
 of
 the
 world


people
 not
 really
 fully
 uh
 enjoy
 the
 the


benefit
 a
 technology
 can
 bring
 to
 them


is
 because
 of
 probably
 the


infrastructure
 because
 of
 the
 there's
 a


no
 very
 much
 local
 solution
 for
 them
 and


there's
 a
 no
 right
 application
 I
 think


that
 is
 a
 part
 probably
 uh
 we
 can
 pick


continually
 play
 a
 bigger
 role
 and
 we


start
 that
 role
 from
 Southeast
 Asian


market
 our
 home
 market
 and
 then
 and
 in


the
 past
 five
 years
 we
 also
 kind
 of


bring
 our
 best
 practice
 to
 Brazil
 and


Brazil
 become
 a
 very
 very
 sizable
 market


for
 us
 and
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 other
 places


for
 us
 to
 continue
 to
 do
 that.


Moving
 on
 to
 uh
 to
 corporate
 culture.


What
 um
 how
 would
 you
 define
 the


corporate
 culture
 in
 C?


We
 have
 uh
 five
 core
 values.
 When
 when


you
 walk
 into
 the
 office,
 you
 may
 see


the
 value
 war.
 So
 we
 have
 that
 we
 have


that
 war
 like
 in
 every
 single
 office.
 We


want
 to
 make
 sure
 it's
 very
 very


visible.
 It's
 a
 reminder
 to
 all
 the


employees
 on
 the
 daily
 basis.


It's
 the
 five
 things
 is
 uh
 we
 serve.
 We


always
 want
 to
 make
 sure
 uh
 customer


come
 first.
 Whatever
 like
 uh
 we
 do
 is
 is


a
 we
 need
 we
 have
 the
 customer
 service


mentality
 and
 we
 run
 we
 highly
 value


execution
 speed
 matters
 and
 if
 we
 get


things
 done
 today
 we're
 not
 going
 to


wait
 till
 tomorrow
 and
 if
 we
 can
 run
 we


will
 not
 work
 so
 and
 we
 adapt
 and
 we


know
 we
 are
 in
 a
 very
 very
 dynamic


environment
 and
 it's
 highly
 competitive


and
 the
 technology
 change
 so
 fast
 as
 you


just
 uh
 mentioned
 the
 share
 price
 can
 go


five
 times
 and
 go
 go
 go
 can
 go
 down
 like


70
 80
 90%
 %
 so
 it's
 a
 very
 very
 uh


changing
 environment.
 So
 we
 need
 to
 make


sure
 we
 can
 always
 adapt
 and
 uh
 we


commit.
 So
 the
 like
 whatever
 you
 want
 to


achieve
 right
 is
 it
 doesn't
 matter
 it's


a
 hundred
 billion
 dollar
 market
 cap
 or


trillion
 billion
 dollar
 whatever
 things


you
 do
 and
 you
 want
 to
 be
 committed
 that


is
 the
 only
 way
 you
 can
 achieve


excellence
 and
 actually
 the
 last
 one
 is


uh
 we
 stay
 humble
 and
 uh
 and
 I
 believe


this
 is
 the
 foundation
 of
 our
 core


values
 the
 culture
 and
 if
 if
 you
 have
 to


pick
 one
 word
 to
 describe
 our
 corporate


culture
 and
 that
 will
 be
 uh
 humility
 I


think
 it's
 a
 it's
 a
 guide
 us
 in
 the
 in


the
 in
 the
 in in
 the
 good
 time.


Why
 is
 it
 important
 to
 be
 humble?


Well,
 I
 mean
 I
 think
 it's
 a
 interesting


and
 that
 is
 a
 is
 even
 before
 I
 started


the
 company
 and
 uh
 and
 uh
 I
 was
 a


Stanford
 student
 and
 I
 was
 fortunate


enough
 to
 sit
 in
 the
 audience
 when
 Steve


Jobs
 gave
 this
 very
 famous
 uh
 uh


commencement
 speech
 and
 stay
 foolish
 and


stay
 hungry
 and
 he
 shared
 three
 amazing


personal
 stories.
 But
 my
 take
 away
 from


that
 story
 all
 this
 speech
 actually
 is
 a


is
 advice
 to
 the
 young
 fresh
 graduate


and
 it's
 a
 it's
 a
 calling
 for
 humility


right
 because
 you
 have
 to
 be
 uh
 humble


and
 to
 stay
 stay
 humble
 to
 to
 stay


foolish
 right
 and
 you
 have
 to


acknowledge
 okay
 there's
 a
 you
 are


probably
 not
 the
 smartest
 ones
 and
 there


are
 a
 lot
 of
 things
 can
 be
 done
 better


you
 should
 keep
 learning
 and
 uh
 and
 and


you
 have
 to
 be
 humble
 to
 to
 stay
 hungry


right
 and
 to
 try
 to
 achieve
 more
 is
 not


enough
 and
 there's
 more
 things
 we
 can
 do


and
 that's
 it's
 a
 keep
 it's
 a
 very
 very


good
 reminder
 to
 me
 as
 a
 person
 and
 also


it's
 a
 how
 I
 want
 to
 uh
 how
 I
 want
 to


run
 my
 company
 so
 and
 this
 is
 a
 uh
 it's


very
 very
 important
 I
 think
 to
 keep
 like


driving
 the
 the
 company
 keep
 keep
 moving


forward
 and
 it's
 also
 so
 important
 in


the
 in
 the
 difficult
 time
 as
 you


mentioned
 like
 uh
 uh
 our
 our
 share
 our


share
 price
 hit
 historical
 high
 uh
 like


I
 think
 like
 a
 few
 years
 ago
 in
 the
 2021


when
 in
 the
 mid
 of
 the
 covid
 and
 uh
 and


the the
 success
 comes
 so
 fast
 and
 so


sudden
 and
 suddenly
 the
 whole


organization
 feels
 so
 good
 and
 uh


everybody
 feel
 oh
 we
 are
 amazing
 company


we
 are
 we
 are
 we
 are
 we
 are
 the
 best
 we


are
 the
 superman
 see
 our
 share
 price
 see


our
 market
 cap
 and
 uh
 I
 have
 a
 very
 very


unsettled
 feeling
 I
 feel
 really
 really


worried
 at
 time
 and
 uh
 um
 I
 wrote
 a
 a


companywide
 note
 to
 everybody
 I
 say
 okay


Yeah.
 So
 it's
 very
 important
 to
 remind


ourself
 like
 we
 need
 to
 stay
 humble
 and


uh
 and
 uh
 and
 whatever
 we
 achieved
 or


whatever
 how
 market
 see
 us
 and
 is
 still


like
 where
 we
 are
 today
 compared
 to
 our


ambition
 we
 are
 still
 young
 we're
 still


very
 very
 small
 and
 we
 shouldn't
 feel


too
 good
 too
 proud
 of
 our


where
 does
 your
 but
 where
 does
 your


personal
 humbleness
 come
 from


I
 don't
 know
 I
 think
 that's
 it's
 a
 it's


a
 it's
 a
 it's
 a
 just
 me
 and
 uh
 I
 always


see
 uh
 the
 great
 greatness
 of
 other


people.
 I
 always
 see
 people
 I
 enjoy


working
 with
 the
 people
 and
 uh
 has
 a


higher
 ambition
 and
 and
 be
 smarter
 than


me
 could
 be
 more
 capable
 for
 me.
 And
 to


me
 I
 always
 feel
 like
 uh
 okay
 this
 is
 a


lot
 of
 things
 uh
 I
 can
 I
 can
 I
 can
 I
 can


do
 better.
 Uh
 I
 think
 it's
 it's
 a
 come


from
 the
 self-drive.
 Yeah.


And
 where
 does
 that
 come
 from?
 Actually,


I
 think
 it's
 a
 it's
 a
 remind
 me
 a
 a


great
 movie
 called
 Forest
 Gump
 and
 uh


and
 uh
 and
 uh
 you
 know,
 I
 picked
 the


name
 Forest
 because
 of
 that
 that
 movie.


I
 I
 just
 love
 that
 character
 in
 the


movie.
 And


what
 is
 it?
 What
 is
 it?
 I
 love
 Forest


Gump,
 too,
 but
 what
 is
 it
 with
 Forest


that
 you
 like?
 uh
 well
 he's
 uh
 clearly


and
 uh
 he's
 not
 the
 smartest
 person
 in


the
 in
 the
 in
 the
 in
 any
 any
 room
 right


in
 the
 classroom
 and
 they
 are
 the
 mo


he's
 not
 the
 most
 savvy
 and
 I
 feel


related
 to
 that
 and
 along
 the
 journey
 I


always
 see
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 people


smarter
 than
 me
 and
 and
 more
 capable


more
 savvy
 than
 me
 right
 and
 uh
 and
 I
 I


think
 it's
 maybe
 it's
 a
 naturally
 for
 me


to
 identify
 the
 strengths
 of
 other


people
 and
 find
 a
 way
 to
 to
 to
 admire


them
 and
 to
 work
 with
 Um
 and
 uh
 uh
 and


uh
 and
 but
 like
 look
 at
 the
 uh
 what
 who


what
 first
 camp
 does
 right
 and
 he
 has
 a


very
 kind
 heart
 and
 in
 a
 very
 very


authentic
 way
 and
 uh
 he
 just
 keep
 trying


to
 be
 helping
 and
 try
 to
 to
 loyal
 to
 the


friends
 to
 the
 to
 the
 community
 and
 try


to
 help
 others
 and
 even
 just
 a
 little


small
 things
 right
 and
 doesn't
 matter


his
 family
 his
 friends
 right
 his
 his


co-workers
 his
 wartime
 colleagues
 right


and
 he's
 is
 a
 trying
 to
 uh
 you
 know
 help


other
 people
 do
 good
 things
 in
 a
 very


very
 authentic
 way.


How
 many
 times
 have
 you
 seen
 the
 movie?


Well,
 probably
 at
 least
 10
 times
 over


the
 years.
 Yes.


Do
 do
 you
 think
 life
 is
 a
 box
 of


chocolate?


Yeah,
 it
 is
 a
 box
 of
 chocolate
 and
 Yeah.


It's
 a
 full
 of
 surprise
 and
 it's
 a
 and


it's
 it's
 a
 full
 of
 flavors.
 Yeah.
 I


mean
 the
 the
 the
 things
 like
 I
 think
 the


aspiration
 I
 draw
 is
 not
 only
 uh
 because


of
 first
 come
 what
 he
 has
 done
 and
 and


actually
 in
 a
 way
 is
 such
 a
 big
 impact


he
 make
 to
 the
 community
 even
 in
 the


movies
 in
 the
 in
 the
 changed
 the
 course


of
 the
 American
 history
 and
 uh
 but
 he


also
 lead
 a
 very
 very
 lived
 in
 a
 very


very
 rich
 life
 and
 very
 very
 successful


life
 both
 like
 financially
 and
 also
 like


a
 socially
 he's
 very
 very
 successful
 I


think
 I
 mean
 in
 a
 way
 probably
 I
 I
 see


him
 as
 my
 role
 model
 and
 and
 and
 he's
 a


very
 humble
 person
 to
 start
 with.
 That's


maybe
 the
 where
 I
 draw
 the
 uh
 aspiration


from.
 Yeah.


Well,
 he
 bought
 some
 shares
 in
 the
 fruit


company
 for
 instance.


Yes.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.


I
 love
 this.
 This
 is
 fantastic.


Um
 but
 how
 do
 you
 but
 how
 do
 you
 how
 do


you
 balance
 humility
 with
 confidence,


you
 know,
 and
 ambition?
 Um
 humility
 I


think
 it's
 a
 uh
 I
 don't
 see
 is
 the


opposite
 to
 confidence
 and
 uh
 I'm
 a
 I'm


a
 I
 feel
 I'm
 a
 very
 humble
 person
 and
 uh


uh
 C
 is
 a
 very
 very
 humble
 organizations


and
 but
 at
 the
 same
 time
 uh
 we
 are
 also


uh
 very
 very
 confident
 and
 uh
 uh
 we
 know


what
 we're
 doing
 and
 there's
 always
 a


things
 and
 we
 can
 do
 we
 what
 we
 can
 do


better
 and
 uh
 and
 but
 we
 also
 feel
 very


proud
 for
 the
 things
 we
 are
 doing
 now


and
 how
 good
 we
 can
 be
 and
 uh
 how
 much


how
 much
 we
 we
 have
 achieved
 and
 uh
 in
 a


way
 um
 I
 think
 um
 humility
 work


perfectly
 with
 uh
 ambition
 and
 because


it's
 a
 you
 can
 say
 it's
 like
 a
 yeah
 it's


a
 it's
 a
 big
 achievement
 to
 be
 a
 the


largest
 uh
 most
 valuable
 company
 in


Southeast
 Asia
 it's
 like
 a
 hundred


billion
 dollar
 that
 is
 a
 big
 achievement


and
 but
 if
 I
 go
 to
 Silicon
 Valley


there's
 a
 many
 trillion
 dollar
 companies


and
 if
 your
 ambition
 is
 one
 of
 the
 days


be
 be
 become
 one
 of
 them
 and
 to
 to
 be
 in


their
 league
 and
 today
 we
 are
 still
 very


very
 early
 and
 that
 is
 a
 way
 uh
 to
 keep


us
 a
 few
 very
 very
 humble
 and
 we
 are


still
 very
 early
 and
 we
 are
 still
 very


small.


What
 what
 is
 your
 leadership
 philosophy?


How
 do
 you
 lead
 the
 company?


Uh
 I
 would
 say
 three
 things
 and
 I
 really


value
 doesn't
 matter
 when
 we
 were
 just
 a


10
 people
 startup
 or
 like
 today
 we
 have


like
 a
 50,000
 employees
 very
 large


organizations.
 First
 is
 I
 do
 feel


leadership
 should
 be
 uh
 it's
 it's
 all


about
 not
 about
 yourself.
 It's
 about
 as


a
 leader
 how
 do
 you
 lie
 up
 others?
 How


to
 make
 other
 people
 being
 successful?
 I


think
 that
 is
 a
 very
 very
 important
 and


this
 is
 start
 when
 we're
 a
 10
 people


company.
 It's
 like
 a
 I
 keep
 thinking


even
 as
 a
 leader
 how
 I
 make
 sure
 these


are
 10
 people
 will
 be
 successful


together
 with
 me
 because
 a
 lot
 of
 them


take
 the
 risk
 they
 quit
 their
 job
 they


can
 have
 a
 very
 very
 good
 paid
 job
 they


have
 a
 bright
 future
 but
 they
 decide
 to


to
 give
 up
 all
 other
 things
 and
 jump


into
 jump
 into
 this
 startup
 with
 me


together
 and
 how
 to
 make
 sure
 they
 can


realize
 their
 full
 potential
 they
 can


live
 their
 full
 life
 by
 working
 together


with
 me
 and
 it's
 today
 is
 a
 like
 that
 is


what
 really
 kind
 of
 like
 I
 I
 push
 myself


every
 day
 how
 to
 make
 sure
 all
 the


50,000
 employees
 in
 the
 company
 and
 they


can
 realize
 their
 full
 potential.
 They


are
 doing
 what
 they
 really
 enjoying


doing
 and
 they
 can
 like
 fully
 realize


their
 strengths
 right
 and
 and
 I
 deeply


believe
 if
 every
 single
 of
 them
 uh
 being


successful
 find
 their
 success
 in
 the


company
 and
 this
 will
 be
 a
 very
 very


successful
 company.
 So
 it's
 like
 every


time
 I
 talk
 to
 my
 employees
 it's
 always


the
 first
 question
 in
 my
 mind
 is
 how
 can


I
 make
 you
 better
 and
 how
 can
 I
 support


you
 as
 your
 as
 your
 CEO.
 So
 this
 is
 the


first
 thing
 and
 the
 second
 thing
 is
 like


I
 believe
 um
 leader
 is
 a
 should
 be
 show


up
 in
 the
 difficult
 time
 and
 should
 be


pick
 always
 the
 most
 difficult
 decisions


to
 make
 and
 take
 the
 most
 difficult


actions
 and
 uh
 uh
 we
 all
 know
 sometimes


u
 a
 easy
 decision
 a
 easy
 action
 doesn't


mean
 it's
 the
 right
 one
 right
 and


actually
 a
 lot
 of
 time
 is
 a
 is
 the
 other


way
 and
 uh
 uh
 as
 a
 leader
 you
 need
 to


take
 that
 uh
 ultimate
 responsibility
 and


accountability
 and
 you
 cannot
 always


just
 try
 to
 be
 do
 the
 good
 things,
 the


pleasant
 things
 and
 the
 popular
 things.


You
 should
 delegate
 that
 to
 the
 to
 your


to
 your
 other
 team
 members.
 Let
 them
 do


the
 pleasant
 things,
 let
 them
 do
 the
 the


popular
 things
 and
 you
 should
 be
 count


yourself
 do
 the
 difficult
 things.
 M


so
 during
 the
 covid
 time
 and
 as
 you


mentioned
 our
 share
 price
 dropped
 a
 lot


and
 it's
 a
 very
 very
 difficult
 time
 and


we
 have
 to
 quickly
 change
 the
 course
 of


the
 our
 uh
 like
 a
 direction
 and
 we
 have


to
 operate
 company
 with
 the
 from
 the


capital
 abundance
 mentality
 to
 the


capital
 scarity
 kind
 of
 a
 situation.
 And


we
 have
 to
 achieve
 self-sufficient


uh
 much
 much
 quicker
 right
 and
 then
 so


we
 have
 to
 make
 a
 tough
 decisions
 we


have
 to
 uh
 exit
 market
 we
 have
 to
 close


down
 some
 new
 businesses
 and
 we
 have
 to


let
 go
 great
 people
 and
 even
 for
 the


people
 uh
 stay
 with
 us
 and
 uh
 I
 remember


there's
 a
 one
 year
 a
 year
 end
 we
 decide


to
 freeze
 the
 salary
 we
 decide
 to
 not


giving
 out
 bonus
 and
 we
 cut
 a
 lot
 of
 a


benefit
 and
 uh
 and
 I
 voluntarily
 to


stand
 up
 and
 to
 sign
 the
 companywide


note
 to
 inform
 everybody
 this
 decisions.


I
 want
 them
 to
 hear
 from
 me
 and
 I


explain
 to
 them
 why
 this
 is
 my
 decision.


It's
 not
 a
 HR
 decision.
 not
 anybody
 else


in
 the
 organization
 decisions
 my


decisions
 and
 why
 I
 have
 to
 make
 these


decisions
 and
 uh
 and
 uh
 I
 I
 also
 show
 uh


I
 understand
 this
 means
 a
 lot
 of


difficulty
 for
 our
 employees
 but
 we
 need


to
 gone
 through
 this
 together
 and
 I
 seek


for
 their
 understanding
 and
 and
 support


things
 like
 the
 difficult
 time
 the


leader
 should
 stand
 up
 and
 the
 the the


third
 thing
 is
 about
 trust
 I
 think
 among


all
 the
 leadership
 qualities
 uh
 build
 up


the
 trust
 is
 a
 very
 very
 important
 and


and
 people
 choose
 to
 follow
 you
 not


because
 of
 how
 smart
 you
 are
 or
 like
 how


great
 idea
 you
 have.
 It's
 a
 it's
 simply


because
 of
 people
 trust
 you


and
 a
 lot
 of
 time
 this
 trust
 need
 to
 be


uh
 mutual
 and
 have
 and
 and
 need
 to
 be


earned
 and
 I'm
 the
 person
 really
 uh


enjoying
 personal
 relationships
 and
 I
 I


enjoying
 time
 where
 much
 smaller


companies
 I
 feel
 very
 proud
 I
 know


everybody's
 name
 I
 know
 their
 birthday
 I


know
 how
 many
 kids
 they
 have


not
 anymore


not
 anymore
 yeah
 not
 anymore
 and
 uh
 and


uh
 and and
 uh
 and
 that's
 why
 I
 think


that's
 have
 to
 change
 how
 I
 how
 I
 built


up
 the
 trust
 and
 now
 I
 have
 to
 change
 in


a
 much
 larger
 scale
 way.
 So
 I
 I
 I
 do
 uh


rely
 on
 the
 companywide
 note
 and
 I
 take


every
 opportunity
 to
 send
 companywide


email.


How
 often
 do
 you
 do
 that?


Well
 um
 very
 very
 regularly
 uh
 I
 do
 u


there's
 a
 uh
 I
 do
 our
 our
 company


birthday
 and
 uh
 I
 do
 our
 IPO


anniversary.
 I
 do
 the
 year
 end
 Christmas


holiday
 and
 uh
 every
 quarter
 we
 will
 do


earnings
 and
 I
 want
 to
 make
 sure
 our


guys
 everybody
 in
 the
 company
 hear
 about


company
 result
 and
 performance
 first


from
 me
 instead
 of
 from
 uh
 media
 like


from
 anybody
 else.
 So,
 and
 uh


occasionally
 like
 when
 there's
 a


specific
 things
 like
 I
 want
 to
 talk


about
 it
 and
 uh
 and
 I
 also
 do
 that
 and


when
 I
 travel
 uh
 I
 want
 to
 make
 sure
 I


regularly
 I
 have
 a
 I
 have
 the
 roster.
 I


want
 to
 make
 sure
 I
 cover
 all
 our
 local


offices
 and
 I
 I
 I
 travel
 to
 meet
 them


when
 I'm
 in
 the
 local
 office.
 Usually
 I


do
 the
 town
 hall
 probably
 with
 hundreds


of
 employees
 and
 uh
 they
 can
 ask


whatever
 the
 questions
 they
 ask
 and
 they


can
 ask
 real
 time
 live
 and
 uh
 no
 kind
 of


no
 no
 forbidden
 questions
 and
 they
 can


ask
 uh
 anything
 and
 in
 front
 of
 them
 I


will
 see
 the
 questions
 and
 I
 will
 answer


them
 one
 by
 one
 and
 I'm
 not
 going
 to


skip
 any
 questions.
 I
 think
 that
 is
 a


way
 to
 to
 to
 build
 up
 the
 trust.
 Now
 you


also
 um
 well
 known
 for
 building
 great


teams
 and
 you
 hire
 people
 sometimes


straight
 from
 university
 and
 they
 stay


with
 you
 right
 what
 do
 you
 think
 is
 the


key
 to
 achieving
 that
 um
 we
 have
 a
 have


a
 very
 very
 early
 days
 and
 uh
 we
 have


this
 in-house
 management
 associate


program
 and
 uh
 uh
 we
 brought
 in
 the


young
 talents
 and
 uh
 and
 we
 grew
 them


with
 them
 give
 them
 the
 opportunity
 and


and
 we
 we
 develop
 them
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 them


a
 lot
 of
 grad
 graduate
 from
 this
 program


today
 already
 after
 10
 years
 already


play
 a
 very
 very
 critical
 role
 in
 the
 in


the
 company
 and
 uh
 and
 uh
 we
 benefit
 a


lot
 from
 uh
 from
 such
 things.
 That's
 why


and
 we
 keep
 this
 best
 of
 practice.
 We


keep
 these
 traditions
 every
 year.
 uh
 the


leadership
 team,
 not
 only
 myself,
 the


entire
 leadership
 team,
 we
 spend
 a
 lot


of
 time
 for
 this
 uh
 campus
 recruiting


and
 we
 make
 want
 to
 make
 sure
 we
 bring


in
 the
 the
 the
 very
 bright
 young
 talent


and
 we
 rotate
 them
 and
 we
 give
 put
 them


on
 two-year
 training
 program
 and
 we


spend
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 time
 mentoring
 them


and
 coaching
 them
 and
 uh
 hopefully
 they


will
 find
 what
 they
 really
 enjoy
 and


what
 they
 really
 love
 in
 the
 company
 and


that
 they
 can
 stay
 stay
 long
 with
 the


company
 and
 uh
 eventually
 become
 a
 very


very
 key
 contributor
 to
 the
 to
 our


future
 growth.
 We
 do
 believe
 in
 the


young
 people
 and
 uh
 I
 think
 it's
 a


starting
 with
 uh
 our
 early
 days
 when
 we


started
 the
 video
 game
 e-commerce


business
 here.
 Um
 the
 industry
 didn't


really
 exist.
 There's
 a
 no
 no
 talent


pool
 for
 us
 to
 directly
 hire
 with


experience.
 So
 we
 do
 kind
 of
 have
 to


build
 up
 everything
 from
 the
 ground


zero.
 The
 only
 things
 we
 can
 do
 just


bring
 in
 the
 very
 capable
 fast
 learning


young
 people
 and
 just
 train
 them
 and


grow
 them
 and
 grow
 and
 and
 grow
 them


together
 grow
 with
 them
 together
 and


develop
 them.
 So
 and
 the
 internal
 the


the
 the
 in-house
 talent
 development
 and


build
 up
 in
 talent
 pipeline
 and
 is
 a
 I


would
 say
 it's
 very
 very
 important
 to
 us


and
 become
 our
 key
 capability.


Um
 how
 much
 do
 you
 work?


Every
 day
 all
 the
 time
 wherever
 I'm
 I'm


awake
 I'm
 I'm
 working.
 Yeah.
 When
 do
 you


wake
 up?


Um
 6:00
 or
 7.
 Yeah.


And
 and
 then
 you
 go
 to
 bed.


11
 12.
 I
 try
 to
 sleep
 7
 8
 hours
 a
 day.


Yeah.


And
 do
 you
 how
 do
 you
 relax?


Uh
 spend
 a
 lot
 of
 time
 with
 uh
 with
 with


my
 kids.
 And
 I
 mean
 they're
 still
 young


and
 I
 really
 I
 get
 a
 lot
 of
 advice
 from


from
 my
 friends.
 Okay.
 When
 they
 were


young,
 try
 to
 spend
 as
 much
 as
 them
 uh


you
 can.
 And
 you
 will
 miss
 that
 time


when
 they
 when
 they
 grow
 up
 and
 they


when
 they
 leave
 the
 family.
 So
 I
 cherish


every
 moment
 I
 I
 spend
 the
 time
 with


them
 at
 home
 and
 or
 travel
 together
 with


them
 and
 sometimes
 I
 learn
 a
 lot
 from


them.
 I
 think
 it's
 like
 probably
 because


they
 are
 the
 younger
 generation


customers
 and
 uh
 I
 get
 a
 lot
 of
 insight


from
 them
 as
 well
 for
 games,
 for


e-commerce.
 Yeah,


you
 become
 immensely
 wealthy.
 How
 do
 you


what
 do
 you
 enjoy
 doing
 with
 your
 money?


Not
 much.
 I
 I
 think
 like
 uh
 for
 me
 it's


a
 just


me.
 I
 think
 there's
 not
 much
 change


actually.
 I
 eat
 less
 compared
 to
 10


years
 ago
 and
 I
 I
 I
 eat
 eat
 much


simpler.
 Uh
 um
 I
 I
 didn't
 change
 much
 in


in
 terms
 of
 what
 I
 what
 I
 dress
 and
 uh
 I


I
 enjoy
 dress
 the
 the
 the
 shirts,
 the


pants
 with
 the
 company
 logo.
 Most
 of
 the


time
 they're
 free.
 So
 well
 uh
 I
 uh
 I


haven't
 really
 thought
 about
 uh
 thought


about
 I
 think
 it's
 like
 a
 probably
 it's


it's
 not
 really
 about
 how
 to
 spend


money.
 It's
 like
 a
 uh
 what
 is
 a
 really


luxury
 I
 have
 with
 that
 money.
 I
 can
 I


have
 the
 freedom
 to
 really
 focus
 on
 what


I
 enjoy
 enjoying
 doing.
 I
 probably
 don't


need
 to
 uh
 just
 uh
 do
 the
 work
 do


anything
 just
 for
 make
 a
 living
 for
 meet


the
 ends
 at
 the
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the


months.
 I
 think
 that
 is
 probably
 a


biggest
 luxury
 I
 have
 with
 all
 this


money.
 I
 can
 really
 focus
 on
 uh
 my


passion
 and
 and
 my
 my
 ambitions
 and
 then


to
 me
 at
 this
 moment
 is
 very
 very
 clear.


So
 I
 I
 want
 to
 continually
 build
 C
 to
 a


to
 a
 greater
 company.


Finally,
 what
 is
 your
 what
 is
 your


advice
 to
 young
 people?
 Actually
 I
 I
 I


uh
 we
 we
 we
 talk
 about
 a
 little
 bit


about
 that
 and
 uh
 again
 so
 I
 I
 want
 to


mention
 it's
 a
 as
 it's
 a
 movie
 it's
 a


first
 camp
 right
 and
 uh
 it's
 indeed
 I


think
 it's
 a
 uh
 that's
 probably
 the
 I
 I


watched
 the
 movie
 when
 I
 was
 young
 I
 was


in
 college
 and
 it's
 such
 a
 lasting


impact
 on
 me
 it's
 a
 we
 we
 are
 all


ordinary
 people
 right
 and
 uh
 we
 are
 we


it's
 hard
 for
 us
 to
 identify
 oursel


being
 the
 smartest
 and
 the
 and
 the
 most


savvy
 people
 in
 the
 Boom
 and
 we
 always


ask
 ourself
 like
 then
 my
 M
 really


matters
 and
 what
 can
 I
 do
 to
 make
 the


can
 I
 really
 make
 the
 impact
 I
 think


what
 I
 learned
 from
 that
 movie
 is
 by


just
 uh
 doesn't
 matter
 who
 you
 are
 like


what
 you
 do
 where
 you
 are
 just
 by
 giving


a
 little
 bit
 effort
 doing
 the
 good


things
 to
 people
 around
 you
 could
 be


your
 family
 could
 be
 your
 community


could
 be
 your
 your
 your
 friends
 and
 uh


and
 uh
 and
 uh
 and
 you
 you
 can
 live
 a


very
 very
 successful
 life
 and
 and


sometimes
 it's
 a
 you
 never
 know
 it's


coming
 what
 coming
 out
 of
 from
 this


ripple
 effect
 and
 sometimes
 can
 end
 up


in
 a
 in
 a
 in
 a
 in
 a
 in
 a
 big
 big
 impact


right
 to
 the
 to
 the
 society
 I
 think
 it's


like
 we
 all
 have
 a
 very
 short
 period
 of


the
 time
 for
 we
 only
 have
 this
 one
 life


I
 just
 encourage
 all
 the
 young
 people's


to
 rather
 than
 only
 just
 uh
 uh
 put
 a
 lot


of
 time
 to
 think
 about
 yourself
 and
 also


think
 about
 people
 around
 you
 and
 uh
 and


uh
 and
 think
 simply
 think
 about
 how
 to


can
 what
 you
 can
 do
 to
 to
 make
 their


life
 a
 little
 bit


and
 end
 up
 I
 feel
 you
 could
 be
 by
 doing


that
 you
 could
 be
 the
 biggest
 beneerary


benefit
 most
 benefit
 from
 it.


Well,
 it's
 a
 beautiful
 place
 to
 end.
 Uh


big
 thank
 you,
 incredibly
 impressive
 and


wow,
 what
 an
 interview.
 Big
 thank
 you.


Thank
 you.
 Thank
 you
 very
 much.
 Yeah,


thank
 you
 for
 having
 me.
