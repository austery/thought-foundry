Hi
 everyone,
 I'm
 Nicolola
 Tangen,
 the


CEO
 of
 the
 Norwegian
 Southern
 Wealth


Fund
 and
 today
 I'm
 in
 really
 great


company
 with
 one
 of
 my
 favorite
 people,


Jeff
 Garrett.
 Now
 Jeff
 is
 the
 dean
 of


the
 University
 of
 Southern
 California,


Marshall
 School
 of
 Business
 and
 has
 an


incredible
 track
 record
 and
 I
 know
 him


from
 when
 he
 was
 the
 dean
 at
 the
 Wharton


School.
 Actually,
 he
 was
 the
 first


person
 I
 called
 when
 I
 got
 the
 job
 in


the
 Norwegian
 Self
 to
 ask
 him,
 you
 know,


what
 am
 I
 going
 to
 do?
 Um,
 also
 Jeff
 has


held
 uh
 very
 important
 uh
 roles
 at


Oxford,
 Stanford
 and
 Yale.
 So
 Jeff,
 big


welcome.
 Hey
 Nikolai,
 it's
 great
 to
 be


on
 with
 you.
 What's
 the
 number
 one
 skill


a
 leader
 needs
 today?
 So
 you
 know
 I


think
 the
 the
 world
 of
 leadership
 is


changing
 a
 lot.
 Um
 you
 know
 for
 me
 maybe


it's
 a
 bit
 glib
 but
 I
 would
 say
 we
 used


to
 think
 about
 leaders
 as
 heroes
 and
 now


we
 need
 to
 think
 about
 leaders
 as


humans.
 So
 I
 think
 my
 answer
 would
 be
 to


be
 more
 human.
 Can
 it
 be
 taught?
 Uh


classic
 business
 school
 question.
 The
 my


classic
 answer
 to
 that
 is
 it
 might
 you


might
 not
 be
 able
 to
 teach
 leadership


but
 our
 students
 can
 certainly
 learn
 to


be
 leaders.
 And
 I
 think
 that
 means
 that


leadership
 education
 has
 to
 be
 very


experiential.
 What
 what
 does
 that
 mean?


Experiential
 I
 think
 means
 in
 the
 first


instance
 learning
 about
 who
 you
 are
 as
 a


person,
 who
 you
 want
 to
 be.
 Then
 second,


how
 do
 you
 interact
 with
 others?
 Become


self-aware
 and
 self-reflective.
 And
 then


once
 you've
 done
 those
 two
 things,
 you


can
 think
 about
 leading
 organizations.


But
 for
 me,
 it's
 very
 much
 inside
 out


these
 days.
 Start
 with
 the
 human
 and
 go


from
 there.
 And
 how
 does
 a
 business


school
 uh
 teach
 that
 kind
 of
 thing?
 How


does
 it
 help
 you
 to
 become
 more


self-aware
 and
 to
 explore
 your
 inner


self?
 Well,
 I
 again
 I
 maybe
 this
 is
 a


bit
 heretical
 to
 say,
 but
 I
 think
 a
 lot


of
 the
 value
 of
 business
 education
 has


always
 been
 outside
 the
 classroom.
 And
 I


think
 that's
 more
 true.
 It's
 probably


more
 true
 of
 leadership
 and


entrepreneurship
 than
 anything
 else.


Those
 are
 both
 learning
 by
 doing
 skills.


And
 so
 you
 got
 to
 do
 them
 a
 lot.
 And
 you


know
 how
 this
 works
 in
 business
 schools.


uh
 not
 only
 do
 do
 we
 do
 a
 lot
 of


team-based
 work,
 but
 our
 students
 run
 a


lot
 of
 clubs,
 they're
 involved
 in
 not


forprofits,
 they
 do
 lots
 of
 things


outside
 the
 classroom
 that
 sure
 it
 might


add
 another
 line
 to
 your
 CV,
 but
 what


it's
 really
 doing
 is
 is
 building
 your


leadership
 muscle.
 Now,
 the
 increased


complexity
 you
 are
 seeing
 in
 the
 world


now,
 how
 does
 that
 change
 uh
 the


leadership
 role?
 Um
 everything
 is
 much


harder,
 right?
 And
 and
 if
 you
 think


about
 that,
 you
 know,
 the
 the
 I
 think


what
 we're
 saying
 these
 days
 is
 that


agility
 has
 become
 a
 very
 important


skill,
 right?
 You
 can't
 just
 be
 on
 some


standard
 operating
 procedures
 pathway


because
 the
 world
 can
 can
 change
 in
 an


instant.
 Um
 so
 then
 that
 of
 course
 just


begs
 the
 question,
 how
 do
 you
 develop


agility?
 And
 for
 me,
 you
 know,
 there
 are


two
 Cwords
 that
 matter
 a
 lot
 and
 and
 I


think
 you
 embody
 both
 of
 these
 by
 the


way.
 Um
 the
 first
 one
 is
 curiosity.
 I


don't
 you
 know
 yes
 there
 are
 a
 whole


bunch
 of
 technical
 skills
 that
 people


need
 to
 succeed
 in
 a
 technology
 enabled


world
 but
 you've
 got
 to
 be
 curious
 about


broader
 stuff.
 And
 the
 second
 thing


second
 C
 word
 for
 me
 is
 context.
 I
 think


context
 really
 really
 matters.
 You
 know


culture,
 history,
 language,
 all
 the


things
 that
 that
 as
 I
 said
 you
 embody
 as


a
 person.
 Those
 are
 incredibly
 important


too.
 You
 can't
 you
 can't
 think
 you
 know


everything
 and
 you
 can't
 live
 in
 your


own
 little
 world.
 You've
 got
 to
 be
 more


uh
 externally
 oriented
 and
 really


externally
 aware
 I
 think.
 Where
 do
 you


find
 curious
 people
 with
 a
 sense
 of


context?
 I
 mean
 how
 do
 you
 how
 do
 you


screen
 for
 them?
 How
 do
 you
 Well,
 I
 mean


you
 know
 that
 the
 I
 think
 the
 admissions


answer
 these
 days
 in
 higher
 education


would
 be
 that
 we
 kind
 of
 use
 objective


indicators,
 you
 know,
 test
 scores,


grades,
 exam
 results.
 They're
 the
 first


filter.
 But
 the
 reason
 that
 that
 most
 of


elite
 higher
 education
 now
 focuses
 on


essays
 and
 interviews
 is
 that
 we
 really


want
 to
 know
 the
 full
 person.
 So
 you're


looking
 for
 more
 than
 test
 test
 takers


when
 you're
 looking
 for
 people
 who
 you


want
 to
 be
 emerging
 leaders.
 And
 you


know
 I
 think
 this
 is
 also
 a
 onew
 right?


What
 do
 employers
 want?
 Employers
 want


people
 who
 on
 day
 one
 can
 do
 the
 job
 but


can
 grow
 into
 becoming
 leaders
 in
 year


five
 or
 year
 10.
 and
 and
 that's
 going
 to


be
 hard
 to
 find
 if
 you
 just
 look
 at,
 you


know,
 objective
 indicators.
 Was
 there
 a


time
 in
 life
 um
 where
 you
 change
 your


view
 on
 what
 good
 leadership
 is?
 Well,


you
 know,
 I'm
 old
 and
 I've
 been
 around,


so
 I've
 had
 lots
 of
 experiences,
 but
 I


can
 tell
 you
 that
 co
 really
 had
 a
 big


impact
 on
 me
 in
 maybe
 three
 senses.
 The


first
 one
 is
 that
 I
 learned
 about
 myself


that
 I'm
 probably
 better
 suited
 to


strategy
 and
 strategic
 thinking
 than
 I


am
 to
 instantaneous
 operational


challenges.
 Right?
 The
 the
 whole
 the


whole
 co
 world
 was
 constant
 fire
 drills


and
 I
 wasn't
 as
 well
 suited
 to
 that.
 So


that
 was
 the
 first
 observation.
 But
 the


second
 one
 which
 really
 struck
 me
 was


that
 in
 an
 environment
 like
 co
 and
 maybe


in
 any
 crisis
 it
 kind
 of
 crowds
 out


strategy.
 Um
 it's
 inappropriate
 to
 be


thinking
 about
 the
 medium-term
 if
 people


are
 concerned
 about
 tomorrow.
 So


operations
 crowded
 out
 strategy
 for
 me


in
 co
 and
 then
 the
 third
 thing
 was
 as


you
 know
 I
 was
 doing
 a
 job
 transition


from
 uh
 from
 Wharton
 to
 Marshall
 from


Philadelphia
 to
 LA.
 Um,
 and
 I
 had
 to
 get


to
 know
 a
 whole
 bunch
 of
 people
 in
 Los


Angeles.
 And
 what
 I
 learned
 is
 there's


something
 unique
 about
 three-dimensional


humans.
 You
 know,
 you
 and
 I
 can
 have,
 I


think,
 a
 very
 good
 conversation


uh
 remotely
 today
 because
 we
 know
 each


other.
 If
 this
 was
 the
 first
 time
 you


and
 I
 had
 ever
 met,
 I
 think
 the
 the


tenor
 of
 our
 conversation
 would
 be


different.
 It
 would
 be
 much
 less
 rich.


So,
 so
 you
 know
 on
 the
 one
 hand
 I
 think


all
 the
 gains
 in
 technology
 that
 help
 us


do
 Zoom
 meetings
 and
 do
 this
 kind
 of


podcast
 incredible
 but
 there's
 still


something
 about
 in
 person
 now
 I
 think


the
 bar
 to
 that
 clearly
 is
 much
 higher


than
 it
 used
 to
 be
 and
 we
 should
 be


particularly
 since
 it's
 much
 more
 costly


in
 all
 senses
 to
 do
 stuff
 face
 to
 face


we
 we
 we
 should
 have
 a
 higher
 bar
 to


doing
 it
 but
 but
 the
 value
 to
 me
 the


intrinsic
 value
 I
 just
 felt
 in
 co
 I


missing
 so
 much
 trying
 to
 get
 to
 know


people
 in
 a
 two-dimensional
 world
 rather


than
 touch
 and
 feel
 in
 a


three-dimensional
 world.
 So,
 what
 what's


the
 first
 thing
 you
 do
 when
 you
 get
 a


new
 leadership
 role?
 Like,
 you
 know,
 you


you
 got
 one,
 I
 got
 one.
 Um,
 what
 what
 is


the
 advice
 you
 give
 to
 people?
 How


should
 they
 approach
 a
 new
 position?
 So


I
 think
 the
 the
 the
 piece
 of
 advice
 that


I
 give
 to
 people
 um
 in
 a
 university


context
 is
 don't
 read
 management
 books


that
 tell
 you
 you've
 got
 a
 100
 days
 to


change
 everything.
 Um,
 and
 the
 reason


for
 that
 in
 an
 academic
 context,
 and
 you


can
 tell
 me
 if
 you
 think
 it
 generalizes,


the
 reason
 you
 don't
 do
 that
 in
 an


academic
 context
 is
 even
 if
 you
 think


you
 know
 something
 about
 you're
 a
 domain


expert,
 right?
 I,
 you
 know,
 I'd
 been
 a


business
 school
 dean
 for
 10
 years
 when
 I


became
 the
 dean
 here,
 but
 I
 didn't
 know


the
 way
 Marshall
 worked
 in
 a
 cultural


sense
 in
 terms
 of
 the
 individuals.
 There


are
 always
 those
 nuances.
 So
 I
 think
 the


you
 know
 the
 the
 management
 cliche
 these


days
 is
 is
 the
 the
 right
 one
 which
 is
 to


be
 an
 active
 listener
 right
 you're


questioning
 things
 in
 your
 own
 head
 but


you
 don't
 ask
 questions
 of
 other
 people


because
 that
 can
 be
 a
 bit
 intimidating


and
 scary
 but
 in
 your
 own
 head
 you're


asking
 questions
 and
 the
 way
 to
 do
 that


is
 just
 to
 be
 a
 very
 active
 listener
 so


you
 can
 get
 up
 the
 knowledge
 curve
 as


quickly
 as
 possible.
 Do
 you
 think
 CEOs


are
 good
 listeners?
 um
 whether
 they
 are


or
 not
 you
 know
 there
 are
 there
 are
 you


know
 there
 is
 research
 showing
 that
 uh


the
 higher
 up
 the
 higher
 you
 are
 in
 the


system
 the
 more
 endorphins
 you
 get
 by


hearing
 your
 own
 voice
 you
 know
 it's


something
 not
 great
 about
 that


absolutely
 and
 I
 think
 we
 just
 have
 to


be
 anyone
 in
 a
 leadership
 position
 has


to
 be
 aware
 of
 that
 you
 know
 the
 the


thing
 that
 I've
 learned
 is
 that
 if
 I
 ask


questions
 of
 anybody
 uh
 they
 who
 works


for
 me
 they
 view
 it
 as
 a
 leading


question.
 If
 I
 throw
 out
 a
 thought


bubble,
 people
 take
 it
 really
 seriously,


even
 if
 I'm
 just
 trying
 to
 provoke


conversations.
 So,
 I
 think
 you've
 got
 to


have
 a
 you
 need
 to
 have
 some
 kind
 of


balance
 between
 confidence
 and
 humility


to
 make
 that
 work.
 And
 you
 know,
 one


thing
 that
 somebody
 said
 to
 me
 20
 years


ago
 with
 a
 kind
 of
 ride
 grin
 on
 their
 on


their
 face
 was
 something
 that
 that
 just


sounds
 right
 to
 me,
 which
 is
 if
 you're


in
 leadership
 position,
 you
 know,


there's
 a
 chance
 you're
 the
 smartest


person
 in
 the
 room,
 but
 you
 should
 do


everything
 you
 can
 not
 to
 show
 that


because
 if
 you
 just
 strut
 your
 stuff,


you're
 going
 to
 crowd
 out
 everything


else
 in
 the
 room
 and
 so
 the
 collective


intelligence
 doesn't
 increase.
 We
 have
 a


fund
 with
 9,000


uh
 holdings
 across
 the
 world.
 Uh
 and
 of


course
 we
 can't
 be
 on
 top
 of
 all
 of


that.
 You
 run
 a
 business
 school
 with


lots
 of
 different
 professors,
 topics,
 uh


all
 that.
 Uh
 h
 how
 do
 you
 stay
 on
 top
 of


a
 complex
 situation
 like
 that?
 So
 I'
 I'


I'd
 love
 you
 to
 tell
 me
 how
 you
 think


about
 it
 in
 terms
 of
 your
 you
 managing


the
 these
 massive
 global
 investments


that
 you
 have.
 But
 in
 a
 managerial


sense,
 uh
 what
 I
 feel
 all
 the
 time
 is


that
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 micromanage
 the


people
 who
 work
 in
 my
 organization
 for


two
 reasons.
 One,
 if
 I
 micromanage


stuff,
 it
 ends
 up
 on
 my
 desk
 and
 the
 the


pile
 just
 grows
 higher
 because
 I've
 got


limited
 bandwidth.
 But
 the
 second
 reason


not
 to
 micromanage
 I
 think
 is
 that
 it


doesn't
 give
 people
 an
 opportunity
 to


grow
 in
 their
 jobs.
 So
 I
 I
 want
 to


support
 people
 but
 I
 want
 to
 support


them
 to
 to
 become
 bigger
 richer
 uh


people
 not
 not
 just
 do
 their
 their
 job


narrowly.
 Now
 of
 course
 that
 comes
 with


a
 risk
 which
 is
 if
 you
 delegate
 a
 lot
 of


authority
 somebody
 might
 fail.
 So
 the


way
 I
 try
 to
 balance
 that
 is
 to
 allow


people
 allow
 people
 lots
 of
 opportunity


to
 grow
 but
 have
 some
 guard
 rails
 around


that
 so
 that
 if
 somebody
 look
 we
 all
 do


make
 mistakes.
 If
 you
 make
 a
 mistake
 you


don't
 want
 it
 to
 be
 really
 damaging
 for


your
 organization
 or
 for
 the
 individual.


You
 want
 people
 to
 grow
 but
 in
 an


environment
 in
 which
 some
 of
 it
 has
 been


derisked
 a
 little


bit.
 But
 can
 I
 ask
 you
 Nikolai?
 I
 mean


the
 you
 know
 you're
 you're
 in
 this
 world


where
 you've
 got
 you
 you
 literally
 as


the
 podcast
 shows
 you
 you
 have
 access


you
 have
 access
 and
 real
 investments
 in


the
 biggest
 companies
 in
 the
 world
 in


every
 sector
 I
 mean
 how
 can
 what
 what's


the
 discipline
 that
 allows
 you
 to
 manage


that
 well
 I
 guess
 uh
 pretty
 much
 the


same
 as
 you
 say
 right
 so
 first
 of
 all
 I


don't
 make
 investments
 myself
 I
 have
 you


know
 great
 colleagues
 we
 are
 700
 people


so
 got
 colleagues
 who
 who
 run
 it


very
 clear
 mandates,
 huge


accountability,
 delegation.
 Um,
 and
 I


agree
 totally
 on
 the
 micro
 managing


point
 of
 view.
 It's
 just
 totally


unbelievably
 destructive
 because
 you


kill
 pleasure
 and
 you
 just
 kill
 the


whole
 meaning
 of
 life.
 I
 just
 think
 it's


one
 of
 the
 worst
 things
 you
 can
 do.
 So,


I
 I
 just
 totally
 agree
 with
 you.
 So,


it's
 interesting.
 It's
 interesting
 that


you
 responded
 there
 with
 very
 personal


stuff
 as
 well
 as
 professional.
 I
 mean,
 I


think
 the,
 you
 know,
 the
 merging
 of


personal
 and
 professional
 is
 something


that's
 happening
 particularly
 with


younger
 people
 today,
 but
 I
 I'm


wondering
 how
 you
 think
 about
 that.
 I


mean,
 I
 know
 from
 your
 personal


background
 that
 you're
 you're
 super


interested
 in
 really
 diverse
 stuff,


right?
 You
 have
 an
 art
 history
 degree,


you
 have
 a
 psychology
 degree,
 of
 course,


you
 went
 to
 business
 school
 at
 Wharton,


but
 how
 do
 you
 think
 about
 how
 do
 you


think
 about
 your
 employees
 as
 full


people?
 And
 you
 know
 is
 are
 there
 any


difficult
 trade-offs
 there?
 Is
 it


positive
 sum?
 What
 what's
 your
 approach?


Well,
 uh
 for
 sure
 you
 need
 to
 look
 at


them
 as
 as
 whole
 people.
 Um
 you
 would


love
 for
 them
 to
 continue
 to
 to
 take


education
 to
 expand
 the
 uh
 you
 know
 the


skill
 sets.
 Uh
 I
 agree
 curiosity
 is
 is


um
 is
 really
 really
 important.
 Now
 one


of
 the
 fun
 things
 by
 working
 with


finance
 is
 just
 like
 the
 most


interesting
 thing
 you
 can
 do.
 I
 think


you
 know
 everything
 you
 eat
 and
 wear
 and


drive
 is
 made
 by
 a
 company.
 You
 need
 to


understand
 psychology,
 corporate


culture,
 you
 know,
 macro
 uh
 defense,
 uh


geopolitics,
 currencies,
 and
 it's
 all


changing,
 you
 know,
 100
 times
 a
 second.


So,
 and
 I
 can
 see
 I
 can
 see
 how
 much
 you


enjoy
 that,
 right,
 in
 terms
 of
 the


interviews
 that
 you
 do
 with
 the
 people


who
 come
 on
 the
 pod.
 Totally.
 Totally.


Now
 when
 you
 when
 you
 then
 um
 interview


uh
 MBA
 candidates
 are
 you
 looking
 for


different
 things
 than
 you
 did
 in
 the


past?
 Yes,
 we
 are
 looking
 for
 different


things
 um
 and
 not
 only
 in
 MBA
 students


in
 undergraduates
 in
 all
 business
 school


students
 and
 the
 way
 I
 think
 about
 it
 is


there
 are
 two
 tracks
 and
 students
 need


to
 be
 really
 good
 on
 both
 of
 them
 and


you
 want
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 the
 the


tracks
 run
 in
 parallel
 and
 don't


diverge.
 So
 the
 first
 track
 is
 technical


skills
 right?
 So
 it
 used
 to
 be


statistics
 and
 econometrics.
 Now
 data


science
 is
 everywhere.
 You've
 got
 to


have
 students
 who
 can
 be
 even
 if
 they're


not
 geeks,
 they've
 got
 to
 be
 able
 to


talk
 to
 the
 geeks.
 They've
 got
 to
 be


able
 to
 use
 AI
 tools.
 So
 the
 whole
 kind


of
 technical
 skills
 track
 I
 think
 has


been
 dialed
 up.
 Um
 you
 know,
 you
 look
 at


Wharton
 or
 you
 look
 at
 Marshall
 and
 the


the
 data
 sci
 finance
 used
 to
 be
 the


biggest
 thing
 by
 far.
 Now
 data
 science


is
 is
 rivaling
 it.
 And
 so
 you
 have
 these


two
 different
 versions
 of
 technical


skills
 that
 are
 incredibly
 important.


But
 you
 know
 in
 an
 AI
 world
 in
 which


machines
 are
 doing
 lots
 of
 the
 technical


things
 that
 humans
 used
 to
 do,
 what's


left
 for
 the
 humans?
 I
 think
 it's
 to
 be


human.
 That's
 what
 we
 do
 best.
 And
 so
 I


would
 say
 kind
 of
 technical
 fluency
 plus


human
 leadership.
 That's
 that's
 the
 the


combination
 that
 we're
 always
 we're


looking
 for
 in
 people
 and
 it's
 why
 what


we
 try
 to
 develop
 while
 while
 students


are
 in
 school.
 Do
 you
 think
 there
 are


some
 pockets
 of
 genuses
 which
 you
 are


not
 getting
 hold
 of?
 Of
 course.
 Uh
 you


know
 and
 where
 are
 and
 where
 and
 where


could
 they
 be?
 You
 know
 are
 you
 tapping


enough
 into
 uh
 you
 know
 the
 cultural


sector,
 the
 art
 sector.
 I
 mean
 are
 we


just
 perhaps
 missing
 out
 on
 some


incredible
 sources
 of
 talent?
 Yes.
 I


mean
 that
 I
 I
 think
 there's
 a
 kind
 of


search
 costs
 problem
 that
 exists
 in
 the


world
 but
 it
 exists
 in
 higher
 ed
 where


we
 can't
 find
 necessarily
 either
 the


best
 people
 or
 the
 best
 opportunities


for
 them
 and
 they
 can't
 find
 us.
 Um


that's
 a
 that's
 a
 real
 challenge
 in


anything
 as
 kind
 of
 industrial
 scale.
 I


think
 technology
 helps
 us
 there.
 But
 but


your
 second
 point
 about
 the
 importance


of
 broader
 thinking,
 this
 is
 actually
 I


I
 think
 this
 is
 the
 biggest
 question
 in


higher
 education
 because
 on
 the
 one
 hand


everyone
 wants
 ROI
 from
 their
 degrees,


right?
 And
 and
 the
 simplest
 definition


of
 ROI
 is
 can
 I
 get
 a
 good
 job
 when
 I


graduate?
 So
 ROI
 return
 on
 the


investment,
 right?
 So
 you
 get
 a
 payback.


Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Right.
 it
 it's
 ret
 it's
 ROI


in
 a
 different
 sense
 than
 you
 think


about
 it
 but
 it
 but
 I
 think
 for
 our


students
 it's
 very
 real
 right
 if
 if
 you


have
 the
 opportunity
 cost
 of
 being
 a


full-time
 student
 plus
 the
 financial


cost
 you've
 got
 to
 make
 a
 calculation
 of


is
 it
 worth
 it
 and
 in
 the
 American


context
 and
 you
 know
 this
 you
 came
 from


Norway
 to
 the
 US
 you
 know
 there
 was
 this


old
 idea
 that
 people
 could
 afford
 to
 go


to
 college
 to
 find
 themselves
 and
 do


really
 cool
 stuff
 and
 you
 know
 I
 don't


know
 be
 a
 protester
 or
 a
 musician
 or


whatever
 it
 is
 the
 pressure
 today


because
 of
 just
 the
 cost
 side
 is
 this


return
 on
 investment.
 So
 I
 think
 that


the
 challenge
 for
 us,
 but
 the


opportunity
 is
 to
 really
 respect
 that


ROI
 position
 and
 take
 careers
 and
 and


and
 launching
 our
 students
 into
 careers


really
 really
 seriously
 without
 turning


our
 back
 on
 the
 creative
 side
 because
 we


know
 that
 both
 are
 not
 only
 important
 to


being
 a
 good
 person,
 but
 they're
 really


important
 to
 being
 a
 successful


professional,
 too.
 So
 how
 do
 you
 change


the
 curriculum
 or
 the
 coursework
 in


order
 to
 give
 them
 a
 better
 return
 on


the
 investment
 they
 make
 and
 to
 and
 to


make
 them
 better
 able
 to
 run
 companies


and
 societies?
 So,
 I've
 mentioned
 two
 of


the
 things.
 I
 think
 you've
 got
 to
 nail


the
 technical
 fluency
 side.
 And
 again,


in
 business
 schools,
 I
 think
 that


doesn't
 mean
 you
 have
 all
 of
 our


students
 have
 to
 be
 super
 coders,
 but


they've
 got
 to
 be
 able
 to
 use
 and


leverage
 the
 insights
 that
 come
 from
 the


great
 software


engineers
 plus
 develop
 the
 leadership


muscle.
 And
 then
 I
 think
 all
 that
 comes


together.
 You
 know,
 it
 it
 it
 might
 sound


a
 little
 glib,
 but
 for
 me
 it's
 really


important.
 I
 would
 call
 it
 realworld


learning
 that
 yes,
 you
 know,
 what's
 in
 a


textbook
 is
 foundational,
 but
 it
 really


comes
 alive
 when
 you
 apply
 it
 and
 you


apply
 it
 in
 a
 in
 a
 real
 context
 in
 real


time
 that
 has
 real
 impact
 and
 typically


you
 do
 that
 in
 a
 world
 of
 real


constraints
 too,
 which
 means
 typically


means
 group
 work.
 So
 if
 it's
 a
 triangle


for
 me,
 technical
 skills,
 human


leadership,
 and
 real
 world
 learning,
 if


you
 can
 if
 we
 can
 do
 all
 of
 that,
 I
 I


think
 we're
 giving
 our
 students
 the
 best


chance
 to
 succeed
 in
 their
 lives,
 not


just
 in
 their
 professional
 lives.
 What


role
 does
 ethics
 and
 um
 social


responsibility
 have?
 Ethics
 is


everywhere.
 Um
 and
 you
 know,
 just
 think


about
 the
 the
 latest
 example
 of
 this
 in


AI,
 right?
 In
 AI,
 I
 think
 we
 need


students
 not
 only
 to
 be
 aware
 of
 I
 mean


let's
 think
 about
 three
 versions
 of


ethics
 there,
 right?
 One
 would
 be
 hey


can
 you
 use
 chat
 GPT
 to
 write
 a
 better


essay
 or
 do
 a
 better
 exam?
 Absolutely


you
 can.
 We've
 got
 to
 be
 but
 we've
 we've


got
 to
 think
 about
 our
 attitude
 to
 that.


Second
 version
 of
 ethics
 in
 artificial


intelligence
 would
 be
 you
 know
 all
 of


the
 somewhere
 between
 privacy
 and


dystopia.
 you
 know,
 are
 are
 robots
 going


to
 not
 only
 uh
 to
 run
 the
 world
 but
 make


but
 be
 a
 challenge
 to
 us?
 And
 then
 the


third
 version
 of
 ethics
 which
 I
 think
 is


you
 know
 we're
 seeing
 it
 on
 a
 daily


basis
 there
 is
 is
 is
 AI
 going
 to
 be
 a


giant
 job
 destroyer
 or
 not
 and
 how


should
 we
 think
 about
 that
 and
 can
 we
 be


proactive
 in
 in
 in
 you
 know
 making
 sure


that
 the
 AI
 revolution
 looks
 like
 all


the
 prior
 technological
 revolutions


where
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 job
 disruption


and
 displacement
 in
 the
 short
 term
 but


in
 the
 longer
 term
 everybody
 there
 are


new
 job
 opportunities
 that
 are
 created.


So,
 so
 that
 that's
 a
 very
 long-winded


way
 of
 saying
 I
 think
 ethics
 is


everywhere,
 but
 it
 but
 the
 maybe
 the


simple
 term
 of
 ethics,
 you
 know,
 is
 a


little
 bit
 misleading
 because
 it's
 got
 a


lot
 of
 multiple
 dimensions.
 Jeff,
 we


both
 have
 met
 uh
 many
 successful
 leaders


and
 when
 you
 abstract


um
 and
 think
 about
 what
 the
 best
 ones


have
 in
 common,
 what
 what
 do
 you
 find?


So,
 uh,
 I
 I,
 uh,
 a
 very
 successful
 CI
 C


CEO
 whose
 name
 I
 won't
 mention,
 I
 I
 once


kind
 of
 threw
 this
 softball
 question
 to


this
 person
 and
 said,
 "What's
 it
 take
 to


be
 a
 good
 CEO?"
 And
 the
 person
 um,


replied
 with
 a
 ry
 grin,
 "Oh,
 it's
 really


easy.
 All
 you've
 got
 to
 do
 is
 be
 able
 to


come
 up
 with
 a
 vision
 and
 communicate
 it


really


well.
 Have
 a
 strategy
 and
 be
 in
 the
 room


with
 all
 the
 strategists
 and
 be
 a
 good


enough
 person
 that
 people
 want
 to
 go
 on


the
 journey
 with
 you.
 Right?
 So
 vision,


strategy,


implementation.
 Easy
 to
 say,
 really
 hard


to
 do
 as
 you
 know.
 But
 I
 think
 that,
 you


know,
 the
 the
 probably
 the
 people
 who


are
 the
 best
 leaders
 understand
 those


three
 elements
 and
 they
 should


understand
 their
 own
 strengths
 and


weaknesses,
 right?
 You
 know,
 I
 said
 I


think
 I
 think
 I
 now
 know
 about
 myself.


I'm
 just
 not
 as
 good
 operationally
 as


maybe
 I
 can
 be
 at
 some
 of
 the
 other


elements,
 but
 I
 know
 operations
 and


implementation
 is
 critical.
 So,
 I've
 got


to
 think
 about
 how
 to,
 you
 know,


compensate
 for
 my
 own
 limitations
 there.


And
 so,
 if
 you're
 at
 top,
 how
 do
 you


develop
 uh
 the
 mid-level
 leaders
 into


superstars?
 What
 what's
 the
 key
 there?


Well,
 I
 think
 it's
 what
 we
 talked
 about


before.
 If
 you
 want
 to,
 you
 know,
 of


course
 you
 can
 support,
 as
 you
 said,
 you


can
 encourage
 uh
 you
 can
 encourage
 and


you
 can
 financially
 support
 people
 to


get
 uh
 more
 education,
 to
 do
 leadership


training
 programs,
 all
 that
 stuff
 is


very
 very
 valuable.
 But
 I
 think
 the
 most


valuable
 thing
 is
 on
 the
 job
 on
 the
 job


learning
 on
 the
 job
 training
 back
 to
 the


micromanagement
 point,
 you
 know,
 as
 I


said,
 I
 think
 there
 are
 two
 problems


with
 micromanagement.
 one,
 too
 much


stuff
 ends
 up
 on
 your
 desk
 and
 the
 pile


gets
 higher.
 But
 the
 second
 one
 is


you're
 just
 missing
 the
 opportunity
 to


help
 people
 who
 work
 with
 you
 develop


into
 being
 better
 at
 what
 they
 do,
 being


better
 people,
 being
 better


professionals.
 So,
 so
 I
 think
 that
 not


micromanaging,
 but
 also
 providing
 enough


supports
 to
 allow
 people
 to
 grow
 without


risking
 a
 lot
 personally
 and
 for
 the


organization.
 That
 that
 feels
 like
 the


right
 strategy
 to
 me.
 Oh,
 I
 think
 it's


great.
 I
 think
 that's
 why
 I've
 got
 so


much
 time
 at
 my
 hands
 because
 I
 delegate


so
 much.


But
 the
 but
 the
 time
 to
 I
 mean
 tell
 me


about
 that
 too
 from
 your
 perspective.
 I


mean
 you
 know
 I
 think
 the
 the
 the
 risk


that
 we
 all
 run
 if
 you've
 got
 a
 lot
 of


people
 in
 your


organization
 is
 that
 these
 are
 just


backto
 backto
 backto
 back
 meetings.
 You


know,
 I
 always
 I
 I
 I
 worry
 that
 I
 just


get
 trapped
 in
 my
 office
 and
 that's


probably
 bad
 for
 my
 mental
 health,
 but


it's
 also
 not
 good
 for
 my
 mental


functioning
 because
 I
 need
 time
 to
 be


thinking
 in
 a
 little
 more
 blue
 sky


world.
 So,
 how
 do
 you
 how
 do
 you
 manage


your
 life
 to
 to
 make
 that
 possible?


Well,
 first
 I
 have
 to
 to
 say
 one
 thing


because
 when
 I
 asked
 you
 for
 advice,
 uh


you
 know,
 when
 I
 asked
 you
 for


leadership
 advice,
 one
 of
 the
 clever


things
 you
 said
 to
 me
 was
 like,
 "Hey,


everybody
 thinks
 I'm
 uh
 traveling
 um
 you


know
 uh
 75%
 of
 my
 time,
 but
 I'm
 actually


only
 traveling
 50%
 of
 the
 time.
 So,
 it's


clear
 that
 I
 need
 to
 show
 everybody
 at


campus
 that
 I'm
 at
 work
 and
 I'm
 at


campus."
 So,
 you
 know,
 you
 just
 make


sure
 you
 are
 a
 bit
 loud
 when
 you
 are
 in


the
 office
 and
 walk
 around
 and
 make
 sure


that
 everybody
 knows
 about
 it.
 And
 I


think
 that's
 a
 really
 really
 good
 advice


that
 when
 you
 are
 uh
 you
 know
 at
 your
 at


the
 ranch
 people
 need
 to
 know
 about
 it.


Yeah.
 And
 that's
 hard
 to
 do
 because
 you


know
 something
 that
 I
 observed
 a
 long


time
 ago
 that
 feels
 like
 an
 iron
 law
 to


me
 is
 if
 uh
 two
 people
 decide
 to
 have
 a


meeting
 the
 meeting
 by
 default
 happens


in
 the
 more
 senior
 person's
 office
 and


that
 has
 a
 real
 negative
 to
 it
 which
 is


you
 don't
 get
 out.
 So
 again,
 you
 know,


you
 asked
 a
 question
 a
 little
 while
 ago


about
 how
 do
 you
 start?
 How
 do
 you
 start


a
 new
 position?
 That
 was
 also
 a
 good


piece
 of
 advice
 I
 got
 from
 somebody
 a


long
 time
 ago,
 and
 it's
 hard
 to
 hard
 to


live
 up
 to
 it
 just
 because
 of
 the
 time


constraints.
 But
 the
 advice
 was
 when
 you


first
 meet
 people,
 meet
 them
 where
 they


work,
 right?
 First
 of
 all,
 it's


respectful
 to
 do
 that.
 Second,
 you
 got


to
 get
 there.
 You
 got
 to
 figure
 out
 your


the
 lay
 of
 the
 land
 physically.
 And


third,
 you're
 probably
 going
 to
 bump


into
 a
 bunch
 of
 people
 that
 you


otherwise
 wouldn't
 see.
 So,
 so
 again,
 I


think
 it's
 hard
 for
 us
 to
 do
 that
 if
 you


feel
 that
 you've
 just
 got
 to
 be
 so


productive
 and
 it's
 really
 much
 easier


to
 have
 all
 the
 meetings
 in
 your
 office,


but
 it
 comes
 at
 a
 big
 downside.
 As
 a


leader,
 is
 there
 a
 trade-off
 between
 uh


being
 confident
 and
 being
 humble?
 Is


there
 a
 trade-off?
 I
 don't
 know.
 But
 you


know
 I
 always
 get
 asked
 the
 question
 I'm


sure
 you
 do
 too
 about
 you
 know
 back
 to


SWAT
 kind
 of
 analysis
 challenges
 and


opportunities.
 I
 say
 I
 don't
 see
 a
 lot


of
 challenges.
 What
 I
 do
 see
 is
 a
 lot
 of


challenging
 opportunities.
 And
 I'd
 say


the
 the
 same
 thing
 about
 uh
 about


humility
 and
 confidence
 that
 you
 want
 to


be
 humbly
 confident
 um
 is
 the
 is
 the


right
 place
 to
 be.
 And
 I
 think
 that


means,
 you
 know,
 feeling
 good
 enough


about
 yourself
 and
 understanding
 your


role,
 but
 back
 to
 your
 back
 to
 something


you
 said
 a
 few
 minutes
 ago,
 just
 not


getting
 getting
 captivated
 by
 the


endorphin
 rush
 of,
 hey,
 I'm
 in
 charge,


right?
 And
 and
 because
 all
 the
 negative


externalities
 that
 come
 from
 that
 in


terms
 of
 crowding
 out
 other
 people.
 Now,


um
 you
 have
 worked
 in
 academia
 uh
 well


most
 of
 your
 life
 actually.
 um
 what's


the
 key
 to
 good
 leadership
 in
 academia?


Is
 it
 different
 than
 running
 a
 company?


So
 I
 think
 historically
 university


leadership
 and
 corporate
 leadership
 were


very
 different
 but
 my
 sense
 is
 they're


converging
 a
 bit
 now.
 So
 the
 key
 I
 think


to
 understanding
 academic
 leadership
 is


that
 there's
 no
 command
 and
 control.
 I


can't
 tell
 people
 what
 to
 do.
 What
 there


is
 in
 universities
 is
 an
 ongoing
 set
 of


hearts
 and
 minds
 campaigns.
 You
 have
 to


convince
 people
 that
 they
 want
 to
 come


together
 to
 do
 something.
 And
 you
 know


when
 I
 think
 about
 that,
 I
 just
 have
 two


words
 in
 my
 head.
 Aspire
 and
 inspire.


You
 want
 to
 have
 an
 aspirational
 vision


that's
 motivating
 to
 people
 and
 then
 you


want
 to
 inspire
 them
 to
 get
 there.
 So


hearts
 and
 minds
 campaign.
 Yes.
 Command


and
 control.
 know
 and
 my
 sense
 is
 that


the
 the
 corporate
 world
 is
 moving
 a
 bit


in
 the
 in
 the
 hearts
 and
 minds
 direction


and
 that's
 because
 younger
 people
 are


just
 different.
 They
 they
 they
 value


meaning
 and
 purpose
 not
 only
 in
 their


personal
 lives
 but
 in
 their
 professional


lives
 much
 more
 than
 prior
 generations


do.
 And
 that
 creates
 a
 leadership
 and


management
 challenge,
 right?
 That
 young


people
 aren't
 going
 to
 do
 it
 because
 you


tell
 them
 to
 do
 it.
 They've
 got
 to
 want


to
 do
 it.
 they've
 got
 to
 they've
 got
 to


buy
 into
 your
 vision
 and
 and
 I
 think


that's
 you
 know
 that's
 a
 big
 challenge


but
 but
 it's
 an
 it's
 a
 good
 challenge


because
 you
 my
 sense
 of
 the
 you
 know


it's
 hard
 to
 make
 change
 in
 universities


because
 I
 can't
 just
 say
 let's
 do
 this


but
 the
 flip
 side
 of
 that
 is
 if
 you
 make


change
 it's
 actually
 going
 to
 endure
 and


probably
 work
 because
 people
 wanted
 to


go
 on
 that
 journey
 with
 you
 and
 and
 and


so
 you
 know
 my
 sense
 is
 again
 that
 that


that's
 the
 direction
 we're
 moving
 moving


in
 the
 corporate
 world.
 I
 I
 don't
 know


how
 quickly
 and
 I
 obviously
 it
 would


vary
 by
 sector.
 Do
 you
 wish
 you
 could


control
 more?
 Sometimes
 you
 know
 I


you're
 you
 know
 we're
 we're
 speaking
 in


we're
 speaking
 in
 late
 March
 in
 the
 US


where
 the
 the
 Trump
 administration
 is


creating
 new
 challenges
 for
 universities


almost
 on
 a
 daily
 basis
 and
 the
 the
 sort


of
 temptation
 to
 say
 hey
 if
 we
 could


just
 centralize
 power
 we
 could
 react


more
 effectively
 and
 more
 quickly.
 the


temptation
 is
 there,
 but
 I
 just
 think
 in


a
 in
 an
 academic
 context
 that
 that
 that


remains
 a
 non-starter
 because
 of
 the


because
 of
 the
 need
 to
 do
 hearts
 and


minds
 campaigns.
 Um,
 so
 so
 yeah,
 of


course
 in
 a
 in
 an
 instant
 you're
 going


to
 say,
 "God,
 I
 wish
 I
 could,
 you
 know,


I
 wish
 I
 could
 just
 handle
 this
 myself."


But
 when
 you
 look
 more
 broadly,
 I
 think


the
 the
 model
 that
 we've
 got,
 even


though
 it
 creates
 clearly
 big
 challenges


for
 for
 leaders
 in
 higher
 education,
 I


think
 the
 upside
 of
 our
 model
 is
 not


only
 clear,
 but
 it's
 one
 that's
 becoming


more
 relevant
 to
 the
 private
 sector
 as


well.
 Do
 you
 think
 there
 should
 be


closer
 ties
 between
 academic


institutions
 and
 and
 the
 private
 sector?


Um,
 I'm
 in
 a
 business
 school,
 so
 of


course
 I
 would
 say
 yes.
 Um,
 and
 let
 me


give
 you
 two
 two
 versions
 of
 why
 I
 think


I
 wouldn't
 say
 reducing
 the
 distance.


What
 I
 would
 say
 is
 more
 two-way
 uh


conversation,
 collaboration


uh
 with
 the
 private
 sector
 is
 important.


So
 in
 in
 a
 business
 school
 sense,
 let's


think
 about
 the
 curriculum.
 Uh
 let's
 say


you
 want
 to
 have
 the
 latest
 AI
 class.


The
 normal
 way
 a
 professor
 would
 develop


a
 develop
 expertise
 is
 to
 spend
 five


years
 studying
 it,
 two
 years
 to
 get
 the


articles
 published,
 and
 you
 know,
 maybe


the
 class
 appears
 seven
 or
 eight
 years


later.
 We're
 living
 in
 a
 world
 where,


you
 know,
 I
 don't
 know,
 the
 Deep
 Seek


says
 they're
 going
 to
 come
 out
 with
 a
 a


version
 two
 of
 their
 uh
 of
 their
 AI
 next


week.


the
 the
 real
 world
 is
 moving
 so
 quickly


the
 only
 way
 we
 can
 stay
 at
 the
 frontier


is
 to
 be
 in
 constant
 dialogue
 with
 the


with
 the
 private
 sector.
 So
 that's
 the


that's
 a
 business
 school
 answer.
 If
 I


think
 more
 broadly
 at
 the
 university,


you
 know,
 the
 big
 the
 big
 question
 which


has
 been
 true
 uh
 outside
 the
 US
 but
 is


looking
 even
 is
 looking
 true
 now
 inside


the
 US
 is
 that
 the
 model
 of
 scientific


research
 cannot
 rely
 100%
 on
 government


funding
 or
 on
 philanthropy.
 there's


going
 to
 have
 to
 be


more
 corporate
 supported
 research
 and


you
 know
 there
 going
 to
 be
 a
 lot
 of


debates
 about
 guard
 rails
 around
 that


and
 is
 this
 pro
 you
 know
 is
 this
 applied


research
 or
 pure
 research
 yes
 I
 think


that's
 a
 real
 issue
 but
 if
 I
 just
 look


at
 the
 you
 know
 the
 the
 financing
 uh
 of


the
 research
 enterprise
 corporations
 are


going
 to
 be
 more
 involved
 and
 we're


going
 to
 have
 to
 figure
 out
 how
 to
 do


that
 in
 in
 a
 way
 that
 you
 know
 allows


universities
 to
 remain
 true
 to
 their


values
 and
 allows


for
 unfettered
 discovery
 of
 new
 stuff.


Yes,
 we
 need
 all
 of
 that,
 but
 but
 we


also
 back
 to
 the
 return
 on
 investment


point.
 Our
 students
 want
 return
 on


investment.
 People
 who
 support
 us
 from
 a


research
 standpoint
 also
 want
 return
 on


investment.
 How
 does
 that
 leave
 your


view
 on
 undergraduate
 versus
 graduate


education?


So,
 let
 me
 answer
 that
 question
 only
 in


the
 business
 school
 context
 and
 then


maybe
 generalize
 it.
 I
 do
 think
 that
 the


traditional
 model
 in
 the
 US
 at
 least
 you


know
 the
 one
 that
 that
 you
 knew
 about


when
 you
 went
 to
 Wharton
 I
 think
 that


model
 is
 changing
 that
 model
 was
 do
 a


very
 broad-based
 liberal
 arts
 degree
 and


then
 three
 years
 later
 five
 years
 later


go
 back
 and
 get
 an
 MBA
 or
 become
 a


doctor
 or
 a
 lawyer
 or
 whatever
 it
 was


right
 broad-based
 undergraduate
 job


oriented
 graduate
 degree
 I
 think
 there


are
 two
 forces
 that


uh
 reducing
 that
 distance
 and
 putting


pressure
 to
 to
 do
 it
 all
 at
 once.
 The


first
 one
 is
 the
 one
 I've
 already


mentioned
 which
 is
 undergraduate


education
 is
 really
 really
 expensive
 and


not
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 can
 afford
 to
 spend


four
 years
 just
 finding
 themselves.
 They


it
 we
 have
 a
 responsibility
 to


undergraduates
 to
 help
 them
 launch
 the


next
 stage
 of
 their
 lives.
 But
 the


second
 one
 at
 the
 MBA
 level
 is
 just
 the


opportunity
 cost
 story.
 If
 you're
 a
 27y


old
 and
 you're
 doing
 really
 well
 in
 your


career,
 you
 can't
 afford
 not
 only
 the


price
 of
 an
 MBA,
 but
 but
 stepping
 out
 of


your
 career
 for
 two
 years.
 So,
 you
 know,


I
 was
 a
 big
 champion
 of
 undergraduate
 at


Wharton.
 I
 am
 at
 at
 at
 the
 Marshall


School
 as
 well.
 By
 the
 way,
 it's


important
 for
 me
 to
 say
 I
 don't
 think


that
 means
 MBA
 is
 less
 important
 than
 it


used
 to
 be.
 It's
 just
 important
 in
 a


different
 way.
 uh
 it
 used
 to
 be
 the
 MBA


used
 to
 be
 a
 passport
 to
 the
 next
 level


of
 success.
 It
 was
 a
 career
 accelerator.


I
 think
 now
 uh
 MBA
 is
 incredibly


valuable
 but
 it's
 incredibly
 valuable
 to


people
 who
 want
 to
 change
 what
 they're


doing
 in
 the
 jargon.
 The
 career
 pivot
 is


what
 the
 MBA
 is
 best
 placed
 for.
 And
 of


course
 that
 that
 then
 means
 that
 you've


got
 to
 you've
 got
 to
 actually
 rethink


your
 education
 at
 the
 MBA
 level
 because


it's
 not
 somebody
 like
 you
 who's
 in


finance
 and
 the
 way
 for
 you
 to
 get
 a


promotion
 is
 to
 go
 back
 and
 get
 a


finance
 MBA.
 No,
 that's
 not
 the
 story


today.
 It's
 for
 somebody
 maybe
 who
 is
 in


consulting
 who
 wants
 to
 move
 into


entertainment
 or
 technology.
 That


changes
 the
 way
 you
 do
 MBA
 education.


you've
 been
 very
 successful
 in


establishing
 some
 combined
 degrees
 which


combines
 some
 on
 the
 topics
 which


weren't
 historically
 linked.
 Tell
 us


about
 that.
 So
 that's
 a
 case
 you
 know
 I


always
 think
 that
 imitation
 is
 the


highest
 form
 of
 flattery
 and
 one
 of
 the


things
 that
 I
 was
 just
 struck
 by
 at


Wharton
 and
 you
 know
 this
 is
 that
 there


were
 some
 great
 degrees
 with
 other
 Penn


schools.
 So
 there
 was
 a
 management
 and


technology
 degree
 with
 engineering,
 a


global
 business
 degree,
 the
 Huntsman


program,
 the
 Lauder
 Institute.
 When
 I


came
 to
 USC,
 I
 saw
 that
 the
 business


school
 was
 really,
 really
 good,
 but
 it


was
 pretty
 self-contained.
 And
 so
 I
 just


wanted
 to
 um
 you
 know,
 adopt
 and
 adapt


uh
 things
 that
 I
 saw
 at
 Whartoot.
 So
 you


know,
 we
 we
 had
 a
 program
 with
 the
 film


school.
 USC's
 got
 the
 best
 film
 school


in
 the
 world.
 Gee,
 can
 we
 create
 a


degree
 there
 called
 business
 of


cinematic
 arts?
 Yeah,
 we
 could
 do
 that.


The
 best
 part
 of
 the
 engineering
 school


at
 USC
 is
 computer
 science.
 We
 were
 in


an
 AI
 age.
 We
 created
 a
 degree
 called
 AI


for
 business.
 I
 just
 thought
 those
 were,


you
 know,
 leverable
 opportunities.
 Yes,


you
 want
 the
 business
 school
 to
 be
 good


at
 all
 of
 the
 core
 things
 that
 business


schools
 do.
 But
 the
 rest
 of
 USC
 was
 an


opportunity
 and
 and
 an
 opportunity
 that


I
 hope
 is
 win-win.
 It's
 not
 only
 good


for
 the
 business
 school,
 it's
 good
 for


students
 in
 other
 parts
 of
 the


university
 as
 well.
 Jeff,
 let's
 move


tack
 a
 bit.
 Um
 the
 world
 is
 changing


changing
 very
 fast
 uh
 now
 and
 um
 you


know
 it's
 becoming
 more
 transactional.


Um


countries
 which
 previously
 cooperated


are
 competing
 to
 a
 higher
 degree.
 Just


what
 are
 the
 what
 are
 the
 implications


for
 society
 and
 for
 the
 world
 here?


Well,
 this
 is
 where
 I'm
 a
 I'm
 a
 classic


liberal
 in
 all
 senses.
 Um
 I
 at
 a
 as
 an


economic
 matter
 I
 think
 the
 the


shrinking
 of
 global
 markets
 is
 going
 to


is
 a
 big
 net
 negative.
 You
 know
 I
 think


the
 the
 thing
 that
 the
 tariff
 debate
 in


the
 US
 is
 showing
 finally
 is
 that


there's
 a
 real
 cost
 to
 reshoring
 stuff


which
 is
 prices
 go
 higher.
 You
 know,
 I


don't
 think
 Americans,
 for
 example,
 are


sufficiently
 aware
 of
 the
 fact
 that


globalization
 reduced
 prices
 and
 reduced


interest
 rates
 in
 America
 for
 decades.


So,
 I
 I
 I
 I
 I
 worry
 I
 understand
 the


political
 and
 and
 other
 maybe
 national


security
 imperatives
 of
 reshoring,
 but


it
 comes
 at
 an
 economic
 cost.
 And
 then


the
 other
 liberal
 side
 of
 me
 is
 the


Kantian
 one.
 you
 know,
 Kant
 said
 that
 if


we
 to
 paraphrase,
 it
 was
 in
 German
 and


complicated
 German,
 so
 I
 just


paraphrase,
 right?
 If
 if
 countries
 uh


know
 each
 other
 better
 economically,
 if


they
 if
 they
 can
 join
 activities,


they're
 less
 likely
 to
 go
 to
 war
 against


each
 other.
 And
 you
 know,
 I
 think
 both


are
 true.
 So,
 so
 I'm
 a
 classic
 liberal


and
 I
 just
 feel,
 you
 know,
 out
 of
 out
 of


place
 given
 the
 the
 dialogue
 today.
 you


know,
 if
 I
 was
 running
 for
 public
 office


and
 I
 said
 global
 markets
 are
 good
 and


they're
 reduce
 the
 the
 prospect
 of
 war,


so
 we
 should,
 you
 know,
 let's
 embrace


them.
 I'm
 I'm
 not
 getting
 very
 many


votes
 today.
 So,
 I
 think
 the
 challenge


for
 people
 who
 have
 my
 predelections


about
 global
 is
 good
 is
 to
 engage
 with


these
 new
 debates
 in
 a
 way
 that
 can


maybe
 change
 some
 hearts
 and
 minds,
 but


it's
 not
 going
 to
 be
 easy.
 Obviously,
 h


I've
 heard
 you
 say
 that
 you
 can
 look
 at


the
 the
 world
 through
 the
 lens
 of


electrical
 vehicles.
 What
 do
 you
 could


you
 explain
 that?
 Well,
 uh
 I
 will,
 but


you've
 got
 to
 tell
 me
 how
 and
 why
 Norway


was
 able
 to
 essentially
 to
 eliminate
 uh


combustion
 engines
 particularly
 when
 we


know
 electric
 vehicles
 don't
 do
 so
 well


in
 cold
 weather.
 So,
 can
 you
 answer
 that


first
 and
 then
 I'll
 I'll
 give
 you
 my


perspective
 on
 EVs?
 Well,
 I
 think
 it's


really
 interesting.
 you
 know
 the
 country


but
 the
 country
 has
 spent
 a
 lot
 of
 money


uh
 subsidizing
 electrical
 vehicles
 but


with
 huge
 success
 and
 so
 I
 think
 the


number
 now
 is
 something
 like
 90%
 of
 new


cars
 sold
 are
 electrical


um
 it
 uh
 came
 with
 a
 huge
 uh
 charging


network
 across
 the
 country
 so
 that
 you


could
 uh
 you
 know
 so
 that
 was
 not
 a


problem
 and
 you
 could
 drive
 in
 the
 taxi


lane
 um
 and
 you
 had
 you
 didn't
 have
 to


pay
 uh
 you
 know
 yearly
 fees
 to
 to
 own


the
 car
 and
 so
 on.
 So
 to
 be
 frank
 if
 you


didn't
 buy
 an
 electrical
 vehicle
 you


were
 a
 total
 you
 know
 I
 mean
 it


just
 didn't
 make
 it
 didn't
 make
 any


economic
 sense
 not
 to
 buy
 one
 and
 of


course
 lots
 of
 countries
 have
 created


subsidies
 for
 electric
 vehicles
 but


doesn't
 necessarily
 work.
 So
 you
 know
 in


the
 US
 right
 the
 US
 is
 now
 a
 fossil
 fuel


exporter
 and
 as
 you
 know
 uh
 petrol
 is


cheaper
 in
 the
 US
 than
 anywhere
 else
 in


the
 world.
 Norway
 is
 you're
 the
 last


person
 I
 need
 to
 say
 to
 that
 Norway
 is
 a


you
 know
 an
 oil
 superpower.
 Um
 so
 it's


interesting
 that
 that
 that
 logic
 which
 I


think
 is
 making
 EVs
 harder
 in
 the
 US


didn't
 didn't
 obtain
 in
 uh
 in
 Norway.


But
 the
 second
 point
 about
 subsidies
 and


regulatory
 stuff
 I
 think
 is
 going
 to
 be


so
 important
 going
 forward
 because
 the


the
 Chinese
 EV
 and
 BYD
 above
 all
 but


maybe
 Xiaomi
 as
 well
 that
 is
 going
 to
 be


that
 that
 is
 a
 transformative
 I
 I
 think


this
 is
 not
 an
 exaggeration
 that's
 a


transformative
 force
 for
 the
 global


economy
 the
 rise
 of
 the
 Chinese
 electric


vehicle
 and
 the
 question
 in
 Europe
 in


the
 US
 is
 what
 are
 we
 going
 to
 do
 about


that
 right
 and
 the
 the
 the
 Trump
 answer


today
 is
 maybe.
 Maybe
 today,
 maybe


tomorrow.
 I
 I
 don't
 know
 when
 the


podcast
 will
 come
 out.
 The
 the
 Trump


instinct
 is
 if
 I
 make
 tariffs
 high


enough
 on
 uh
 imported
 electric
 vehicles,


people
 have
 to
 make
 them
 in
 the
 United


States.
 Let's
 see
 if
 that
 works.
 If
 I


was
 in
 Germany
 today,
 you
 know,
 where
 VW


for
 the
 first
 time
 in
 its
 history
 is


thinking
 of
 closing
 some
 plants
 in
 this


decade,
 the
 conversation
 is
 even
 harder


because
 of
 course
 the
 German
 government


and
 German
 citizens
 want
 to
 protect
 the


German
 auto
 industry,
 but
 they
 know
 if


they
 protect
 it
 against
 Chinese
 electric


vehicles,
 the
 Chinese,
 they're
 not
 going


to
 have
 access
 to
 the
 Chinese
 market,


which
 they
 need,
 right?
 So,
 so
 maybe


back
 to
 YZV's
 uh
 window
 into
 everything


in
 the
 world,
 the


geopolitical
 element
 is
 clear,
 but
 think


about
 some
 of
 the
 other
 elements
 as


well.
 I
 mean,
 employment.
 I
 didn't


realize
 the


employment
 effects
 of
 the
 fact
 that


electric
 vehicles
 are
 so
 much
 simpler
 to


assemble.
 You
 just
 need
 many,
 many
 fewer


workers
 to
 put
 together
 an
 EV
 than
 a


traditional
 combustion
 engine.
 So
 let's


talk
 employment
 consequences
 and
 how
 we


think
 about
 you
 know
 the
 value
 of


manufacturing
 jobs
 and
 auto
 jobs
 a


European
 conversation
 American
 one
 too


and
 then
 the
 third
 element
 let's
 just
 go


with
 uh
 with
 the
 green
 energy
 side
 so


the
 we
 know
 that
 the
 the
 the
 entire


green
 energy
 supply
 chain
 now
 is


dominated
 by
 China
 um
 we
 also
 know
 that


a
 lot
 of
 stuff
 in
 the
 green
 energy


supply
 chain
 is
 very
 dirty
 power


intensive
 you
 know
 I've
 been
 spending
 a


bunch
 of
 time
 in
 Indonesia.
 Indonesia


thinks
 that
 nickel
 mining
 is
 their


future.
 Nickel
 mining
 is
 not
 a
 pleasant


business,
 but
 you
 need
 it
 if
 you're


going
 to
 if
 you're
 going
 to
 have
 longer


range
 electric
 vehicles.
 So,
 yeah,
 I
 do


think
 the
 the
 you
 know
 the
 that
 maybe


the
 highest
 level
 uh
 way
 to
 think
 about


this
 for
 me
 is
 if
 we
 think
 about
 the


20th
 century,
 probably
 the
 internal


combustion
 engine
 was
 the
 most
 the
 most


important
 development
 of
 the
 20
 20th


century.
 We
 could
 debate
 that,
 but
 if
 we


then
 in
 a
 like
 a
 two
 decade
 period
 do


away
 with
 uh
 internal
 combustion


engines,
 that'd
 be
 pretty
 amazing.


Against
 the
 backdrop
 uh
 we've
 kind
 of


painted
 here
 uh
 during
 this


podcast,
 what
 what
 is
 your
 advice
 to


aspiring
 leaders?
 Aspiring
 leaders,
 I'll


think
 about
 that
 in
 the
 in
 terms
 of


students.
 So
 the
 first
 one
 we've
 already


mentioned
 is
 my
 two
 Cwords.
 be
 curious


and
 really
 be
 aware
 of
 context.
 And
 for


young
 people,
 I
 think
 the
 context
 begins


with
 who
 they
 are
 and
 how
 they
 interact


with
 others.
 And
 then,
 you
 know,
 I
 get


asked
 all
 the
 time
 for
 have
 wise
 words


of
 wisdom
 about
 planning
 your
 career.
 I


just
 think
 that
 that's
 a
 a
 a
 folly,


right?
 The
 life
 is
 going
 to
 life
 is
 not


linear
 for
 many
 of
 us,
 any
 of
 us.
 I


mean,
 I
 don't
 know
 whether
 you
 feel
 that


way,
 but
 I
 certainly,
 you
 know,
 I've


lived
 a
 life
 that
 I
 couldn't
 have


planned
 because
 I
 didn't
 know
 it


existed.
 So,
 rather
 than
 trying
 to


develop
 a
 five
 or
 10
 year
 plan,
 I
 think


you
 want
 to
 prepare
 yourself.
 This
 is
 uh


the
 UCLA
 basketball
 coach,
 famous


basketball
 coach
 John
 Wooden
 said


something
 like,
 you
 know,
 good
 outcomes


are
 where
 uh
 opportunity
 and
 preparation


come
 together.
 you
 know,
 you
 want
 to
 be


prepared,
 but
 I
 think
 you
 want
 to
 go


into
 decisions
 always
 thinking
 about


opening
 up
 opportunities
 rather
 than


closing
 them
 off.
 So,
 having
 antenna
 up


for
 option
 value,
 increasing
 option


value,
 I
 think
 optionality
 just
 makes
 a


lot
 of
 sense
 to
 me.
 Well,
 uh
 Jeff,
 you


for
 sure
 are
 uh
 very
 curious
 as
 always.


It's
 been
 fantastic
 interacting
 with


you.
 Big
 thanks
 for
 all
 your
 advice
 that


I
 have
 got
 personally
 and
 now
 uh
 that


you
 have
 shared
 with
 uh
 all
 our
 podcast


uh
 listeners.
 So,
 a
 big
 thanks.
 The


thanks
 are
 all
 to
 you,
 Nikolai,
 not
 only


for
 giving
 me
 this
 opportunity,
 but
 for


all
 you're
 doing
 in
 the
 world
 and
 all


you're
 doing
 with
 the
 podcast.
 I
 mean,


the
 the
 something
 I
 said
 at
 the


beginning,
 I
 really
 believe
 the
 you


know,
 you
 have
 investment
 relationships


with
 all
 the
 greatest
 minds
 in
 business


and
 the
 fact
 that
 you're
 now
 sharing
 all


of
 that
 with
 all
 the
 people
 who
 consume


your
 podcast.
 I
 just
 think
 that
 was
 a


fantastic
 initiative.
 So,
 thank
 you
 and


congratulations
 for
 that
 and
 thanks
 and


thanks
 for
 having
 me.
 Thank
 you.
