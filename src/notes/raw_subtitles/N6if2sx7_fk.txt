2023 was a year which was
impacted by war, climate and inflation.
It was also the year when artificial
intelligence started to make an impact.
Climate risk is financial risk.
The transition to net zero
is really, really important.
In 2023, we saw floods, we saw harvests
being destroyed, and we saw people
actually unable to get to work
because of all these problems.
Changes now happen really, really quickly
and we need to be ahead of the curve.
It's important
that companies understand that
we are a long term and predictable owner.
So this year we're taking
transparency to a new level. 
Transparency is key both for building trust but
also for achieving better outcomes.
So in 2023, we were recognized
as the most transparent fund in the world,
and we achieved the highest results
in the category of responsible investment.
Throughout the year,
we took a firm stance on important issues
such as board diversity and executive pay.
And for the first time
we submitted our own
climate related shareholder proposals.
However, there's still a long way to go
for all the companies in our portfolio
to have net zero 2050 targets.
And we urge all the companies
not only to have targets
but also clear transition plans.
We want engagement, discussions
and input from all of our stakeholders.
That helps us improve
so we can continue to be a leading
responsible investor.
In 2023 we were even more transparent than before.
As investors, 
we make a living from information
and data is key
to absolutely everything we do.
From the analysis
and the investments to the companies
we speak with, to our view
of the climate risk and the portfolio.
Now we use even more advanced methods.
Artificial intelligence
or machine learning
can help us understand the sustainability
disclosures of companies
and base our work on data
that didn't even exist five years ago.
Our Responsible Investment report sums up
our ownership work in 2023 in detail
The meetings we had, the boards we met with,
the progress of our Climate Action Plan.
But now let's hear
from our great colleagues and topic
experts more about what we did
and why we did it.
So we were one of the first investors
to an extent go and speak out loud
about responsible AI.
So why did we develop the view
on this topic?
Companies should really embrace
the opportunities of AI, but
they need to do so in a responsible way
that also takes care of the risk.
Yes, definitely, and I think
one of the big conversation
is our understanding
is that this will have a huge impact
on the next years to come.
So it makes sense for us to come in early,
give our view on what we think
responsible use actually means
at this current point in time.
Absolutely.
So we took the approach
of trying to develop for us
as an investor,
what is most relevant for us to come out
and say to our portfolio companies,
and we really want to make sure
that we reflect the best practice,
that we stay slightly aspirational,
but also something that is achievable
for the companies we're invested in.
So we wanted to find out what are the best
companies out there already doing that.
Others should also learn from and do,
and that we should encourage.
What are the leading academics,
the leading civil society
organizations and other investors
that are thinking about this doing?
And so we did just that,
and we went out and talk to these people
in the companies, from healthcare
to tech to consumer
financials, where AI is really
at the forefront of their business.
And then we also wanted to make sure
that we made use of all the expertise
that we have internally in the fund.
We have a lot of people
working on AI for the fund,
and we wanted to make sure
that we made the most of the knowledge
that we have inside the fund.
And so we reached out to the people
working in our technology team.
We brought everyone together in a workshop
both the technology experts,
but also the people investing
in companies, in tech companies
and healthcare companies and other
companies where AI is the key element.
And we all sat down together
and what do we think are the key elements?
What are the opportunities,
what are the risks
and how do we address them?
So one thing is really how
we developed this view,
and we wanted to make sure that it was
airtight and relevant, to our portfolio,
but we also since then have done a lot
on the implementation side,
which you've been a part of, Mille.
What does that entail exactly?
Absolutely.
So we launched our view
at Arendalsuka
which is a political event
in southern Norway.
One part of implementation
that has been to spread our view.
So it's very important for us
to get our view across quite far and wide.
So we've sought key moments like events
and conferences to get this across.
In addition, we've also embedded
our view into our company dialog.
So AI is such an interesting topic
because it encompasses a lot of companies.
So as a user or a developer,
it will be relevant.
AI is also a topic where regulatory standards
have yet to fully materialize.
So we see that there is scope
for us as investors to come in
with our input and perspective
on what responsible AI means.
And we want to contribute
to well-functioning markets
and to raise market standards.
And that is why we have promoted
our standard setting work as well.
For instance,
by joining the OECD AI expert group 
on AI Risk and Accountability
and the World Economic Forum
Responsible Stewardship
for Investor Project.
AI is the one that I've been thinking
about my whole life.
These models are still not very good.
They hallucinate a lot.
They're not very smart.
They have all these problems, and yet
people are using their human ingenuity
to figure out how to work around that
and still leverage these tools.
We live in a more dangerous world,
and climate change is driving conflicts.
In my mind,
climate is as political as gravity.
In 2023,
we worked on the implementation
of our Climate Action Plan.
Here, our ambition is for portfolio companies
to reach net zero emissions by 2050.
To help this, we released a new document
in 2023, a sharpened climate
change expectations, and we published it
at New York Climate Week in September.
In this document, we spent more time
looking at transition plans
or the “How” of a company strategy,
the approach the company will take
and the technologies they'll use,
as well as the associated investments.
We then spent the rest of the year
scouring the globe for climate laggards
and climate leaders
to put our work to the test.
We talked to energy companies in Brazil,
mining companies
in Australia and steel companies
in China to name but a few.
We talked about
how to make jet fuel from food waste.
New batteries,
the size of soccer pitchers, but
also things like methane
leaks from coal mines.
We came across certain challenges as well.
Supply chain bottlenecks,
for example, and permitting delays
blocking some of these new technological advances.
Overall, we had 600 interactions
with companies in 2023 that covered
climate change and these covered
almost 70% of our financed emissions.
Those are the emissions that we're deemed
responsible for through our investments.
Now, companies won't always move
at our desired pace on these topics.
So in 2023, we also got serious
with some of the climate change laggards
in our portfolio.
We increased our votes
against company boards
and we also filed shareholder
proposals for the first time on climate.
Voting is one of our most
important ownership tools.
Every year we vote on more 
than 120,000 resolutions
at more than 12,000
annual shareholder meetings.
And this is really a way
we can drive change in the companies
we have invested in.
We had some against votes last year
and following which the companies want to
have a deeper conversation with us.
Our ambition is to be the most
transparent investment fund in the world,
and this extends to how
we vote at the meetings of the companies
that we're invested in.
For us, transparency's important
because it helps us to be a predictable
and responsible owner,
both to the individual companies
that we're invested in,
but also for the wider market, making
clear where we stand on different issues.
As a shareholder,
we have the right to vote on things
like the election of board members
and how executives are paid.
We can also vote on proposals
put forward by other shareholders,
which can be on a range of topics
like climate change and human rights.
Since 2016, we've published our vote 
guidelines which explain generally
how we vote on different issues
to help with our transparency.
These guidelines
sit alongside a range of other documents
which explain what we think
about different governance issues
and also the expectations we have
of the companies that we're invested
in on important sustainability topics.
Since 2021, we've been
publishing our voting intentions
five days before company meetings.
If we intend to vote against the board's
recommendation on any matters,
we provide a short explanation.
In 2023, we took this one step further
and started providing a rationale
any time we vote against a sustainability
related shareholder proposal,
even if this is in line
with what the board recommended.
By doing this, we want to be
as transparent as possible for companies,
but also for all the stakeholders,
including other investors,
who might be interested to see how we
voted, particularly on contentious votes.
We've been working
with some academic researchers
to understand
what impact our disclosures are having,
and the initial results suggest
it is effective.
If we vote against the proposal and state
that we intend to do so.
A proportion of other investors
follow suit and we see
descent levels on average
going up by three percentage points.
It is very well understood
that nature plays a critical role
when it comes to delivering products
and services
that are needed in the global economy.
Unfortunately, at the same time,
we're witnessing an unprecedented rate
of nature degradation and loss,
and this poses challenges for businesses
and for their investors.
We invest across different sectors
and markets, and this means
that we are exposed to nature risks
throughout our global portfolio,
especially when we take into account
our long term investment horizon.
Essentially,
we have nowhere to hide from interest.
We cannot divest from
the entire global economy.
Instead,
we need to tackle this challenge head on
and we need to do this
by improving the markets we invest in,
by making our portfolio more resilient
and by engaging with the companies
that we own to support them in
transitioning towards more environmentally
friendly business practices.
To achieve this,
we need the appropriate information
and we need the right tools to act.
One of these tools is a framework
developed by the Taskforce for Nature-
related Financial Disclosures,
or the TNFD for short.
For the past two years,
we have taken an active role in designing
and developing this framework.
We have been collaborating
with many different stakeholders
and we've been offering our insights
to ensure that the framework
is robust and practical
from our investor viewpoint.
As investors, we need consistent,
comparable and reliable information
from the companies we own, covering
the environmental and social issues
that are financially material
to their business,
including but not limited to nature risk.
Now, with the initial TNFD creation and
design phase largely completed,
it is time to turn to implementation
and to start using this tool actively.
This means asking companies that we own
to start applying the framework.
We think this will provide us
and other market participants
with important information
that we need to inform our decisions.
It also means that we will be applying
the framework ourselves
by assessing our global portfolio
to better understand
how our investments impact
and depend on nature,
and to use these insights to further
strengthen our responsible investment work.
With our 2023 Responsible Investment Report
we are actually sharing
an initial set of disclosures
inspired by the TNFD recommendations.
A big, big thank you 
to all of our topical experts.
As you’ve seen, 2023 has really
been an eventful year
for the fund.
There's so much more we've done in 2023
and you can read it all in our report
that's published on our website.
Happy reading.
