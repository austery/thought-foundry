When
 I
 was
 CEO,
 what
 I
 felt
 like
 was
 it


was
 very
 lonely.
 It
 was
 challenging.
 It


was
 hard.
 I
 was
 out
 navigating
 and


trying
 to
 find
 resources,
 support.


People
 would
 come
 before
 me
 who
 could


help
 me
 in
 that
 seat.
 Tracy
 Brick
 Cool


is
 the
 co-founder
 of
 Camdrick,
 a


long-term
 investment
 partnership
 focused


on
 building
 enduring
 businesses.
 She
 is


best
 known
 for
 working
 directly
 with


Warren
 Buffett
 at
 Berkshire
 Hathaway


where
 she
 served
 as
 his
 financial


assistant
 before
 becoming
 CEO
 of


Pampered
 Chef
 and
 serving
 on
 the
 board


of
 several
 Bergkshire
 companies


including
 Benjamin
 Moore
 and
 Craft
 Hind.


She
 combines
 investor
 discipline
 with


hands-on
 operating
 experience,
 bringing


a
 rare
 perspective
 on
 what
 it
 takes
 to


grow
 and
 sustain
 great
 companies.
 We


only
 invest
 in
 one
 or
 two
 companies
 a


year.
 We'll
 look
 at
 500.
 So,
 we're


really
 selective
 at
 finding
 the
 highest


quality
 businesses
 that
 have
 a
 long


runway.
 I
 also
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 investors


haven't
 actually
 been
 operators
 and
 so


it's
 really
 hard
 to
 go
 into
 a
 business


and
 say
 this
 is
 what
 you
 should
 go
 do
 to


operate
 a
 business
 if
 you've
 never


actually
 operated
 a
 business.


>> When
 it
 comes
 to
 hiring
 like
 what
 does


that
 process
 look
 like?
 Like
 what
 does


that
 nitty-gritty
 look
 like
 in
 the


details?


>> We
 very
 much
 describe
 the
 who
 process.


So
 by
 GHS
 smart
 um
 there's
 a
 book
 called


who
 WH
 it
 is
 I
 think
 single-handedly
 the


best
 simple
 book
 on
 hiring
 and
 there's
 a


few
 components
 to
 it
 and
 we've
 augmented


and
 added
 our
 own
 but
 the
 first
 is


building
 a
 really
 in-depth
 scorecard
 for


the
 role
 and
 so
 a
 good
 scorecard
 in
 my


our
 mind
 has
 three
 sort
 of
 critical


components
 the
 first
 is
 the
 second
 is


and
 then
 the
 third

>> Tracy,
 welcome
 to
 the
 show.


>> Thank
 you.
 It's
 an
 honor
 to
 be
 here.
 I


appreciate
 it.


>> I
 want
 to
 start
 with
 what
 you're
 reading


recently.


>> Yeah.
 So,
 on
 the
 biographies,
 I
 just


read
 Melinda
 Gates
 transition
 book
 that


she
 just
 came
 out
 with
 uh
 not
 too
 long


ago,
 which
 I
 thought
 was
 super


interesting.
 Reread
 Alvin
 Lolli's
 um
 you


know,
 American
 icon,
 which
 I
 think
 is


fascinating
 in
 terms
 of
 a
 turnaround
 and


the
 impact
 of
 that.
 Recently
 reread


Katherine
 Graham's
 autobiography.
 Yeah.


So
 do
 I.


>> Yeah.
 It's
 so
 amazing.
 So
 that's
 been
 my


focus
 and
 where
 I've
 found
 the
 most


interest
 recently.
 And
 then
 also
 several


books
 on
 parenting.
 So
 the
 anxious


generation
 obviously
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 are


talking
 about,
 but
 that
 has
 spawned
 me


going
 down
 a
 path
 on
 reading
 more
 about


kids
 and
 freerange
 kids,
 books
 like
 that


of
 how
 to
 think
 about
 parenting
 and
 sort


of
 this
 new
 world.


>> How
 many
 kids
 do
 you
 have?


>> We
 have
 four.


>> Oh
 gosh.
 Okay.
 What
 are
 the
 ages?


>> 10,
 seven,
 five,
 and
 two.


>> Okay.
 We
 had
 Allan
 on
 the
 show.
 I'm


curious
 what
 you
 took
 away
 from
 his


biography.


>> I
 thought
 it
 was
 single-handedly
 the


best
 book
 in
 navigating
 a
 turnaround.


The
 time
 in
 which
 he
 did
 a
 turnaround
 in


the
 business,
 how
 challenging
 it
 was,


the
 landscape
 in
 2008,
 2009,
 Ford,
 you


the
 auto
 industry,
 I
 mean
 really,
 really


challenging
 and
 just
 the
 discipline
 with


which
 he
 did
 it.
 everything
 from,
 you


know,
 his
 team
 coming
 in
 and
 with
 green


every
 week,
 even
 though,
 you
 know,
 he


was
 trying
 to
 get
 them
 to
 celebrate


having
 reds
 in
 the
 business
 and
 the


challenges
 and
 how
 to
 learn
 from
 those


and
 making
 mistakes
 is
 okay.
 Uh,
 so
 I


really
 appreciated
 that
 insight
 and
 just


how
 he
 did
 it.
 Having
 done
 a
 turnaround


at
 a
 much
 smaller
 scale,
 I
 was


incredibly
 impressed
 with
 his
 focus
 on


people,
 his
 focus
 on
 discipline,
 his


focus
 on
 building
 a
 culture
 of


continuous
 improvement,
 learning,
 making


mistakes.
 I
 thought
 that
 was
 just
 really


eye
 opening
 and
 just
 how
 he
 did
 it
 in


the
 backdrop
 of
 the
 time
 that
 he
 did
 it.


One
 of
 the
 things
 that
 he
 mentioned
 that


still
 sticks
 with
 me
 to
 this
 day
 is
 he


laid
 out
 his
 operating
 philosophy
 and


then
 he
 said,
 "Well,
 if
 you're
 not


partaking
 in
 that,
 you're
 choosing
 not


to
 be
 a
 part
 of
 our
 team."
 And
 I
 thought


that
 was
 a
 really
 interesting
 way
 of


putting
 it
 back
 on
 the
 person
 that


they're
 making
 a
 choice
 whether
 they


want
 to
 be
 part
 of
 the
 team
 or
 not.


>> Yes,
 I
 couldn't
 agree
 more.
 I
 think
 when


you're
 in
 a
 company
 and
 you
 set
 a


culture
 and
 expectations
 and
 an


operating
 system,
 then
 you
 say
 to
 your


employees,
 you
 is
 this
 what
 you
 want
 to


be
 part
 of?
 And
 if
 not,
 we
 understand


that
 and
 you
 can
 choose
 to
 lead
 the


business,
 but
 if
 you
 want
 to
 stay
 here,


you
 need
 to
 get
 on
 board.
 When
 I
 was


CEO,
 we
 were
 going
 through


transformation.
 And
 I
 said
 to
 our
 team,


uh,
 often
 they
 almost
 told
 me
 to
 stop


saying
 it
 was,
 if
 you're
 not
 having
 fun


4
 days
 out
 of
 five
 in
 this
 new
 culture


and
 environment,
 it's
 probably
 not
 right


fit
 for
 you.
 And
 we
 encourage
 you
 to


move
 on.
 We'll
 promote
 you
 to
 customer,


whatever
 it
 may
 be.
 I
 think
 you
 want


your
 team
 to
 be
 really
 committed,


engaged,
 focused
 on
 driving
 the
 results,


but
 also
 that
 it
 resonates
 with
 them
 and


they
 care
 about
 it.


>> And
 the
 turnaround
 you're
 talking
 about


is
 Pampered
 Chef.


>> Can
 you
 walk
 me
 through
 that?
 What
 was


that
 like?


>> It
 was
 really
 interesting.
 So,
 I
 took


the
 role
 at
 Pampered
 Chef
 having
 no


prior
 experience
 operating
 a
 business.
 I


had
 been
 at
 Berkshire
 for
 about
 5
 years.


I
 really
 had
 a
 view
 that
 the
 investing


landscape
 was
 shifting
 and
 more
 value


would
 be
 created
 going
 forward
 on
 the


operating
 side,
 but
 that
 very
 few


investors
 actually
 have
 operating


experience,
 especially
 on
 the
 more


buyout
 side.
 You
 see
 it
 more
 in
 venture,


but
 less
 on
 buyout.
 And
 I
 thought
 I'd
 be


a
 better
 investor
 if
 I
 went
 and
 got
 out


of
 the
 boardroom,
 got
 into
 the
 war
 room,


and
 actually
 went
 and
 operated
 a


business.
 So
 decided
 to
 become
 CEO
 of


Pampered
 Chef.
 Pampered
 Chef
 was
 a


business
 that
 was
 in
 need
 of


transformation.
 It
 had
 been
 in
 decline


since
 Berkshire
 bought
 it
 for
 about
 10


years.
 and
 the
 um
 fundamentals
 were


intact.
 It
 had
 a
 really
 strong
 brand
 and


a
 strong
 channel.
 So
 the
 moot
 was
 really


there
 uh
 in
 terms
 of
 the
 business
 but
 it


had
 lost
 its
 way.
 not
 dissimilar
 from
 a


lot
 of
 es
 and
 flows
 of
 consumer


businesses
 where
 you
 grow
 but
 your


customer
 changes
 or
 the
 world
 changes


and
 in
 that
 case
 the
 world
 had
 changed


quite
 significantly
 and
 the
 internet
 had


come
 along
 in
 the
 early
 2000s
 which
 had


fundamentally
 shifted
 the
 business
 and


then
 the
 customer
 started
 shopping


differently
 you
 shopping
 online
 um


Pampered
 Chef
 was
 originally
 started
 45


years
 ago
 now
 by
 Doris
 Christopher
 in


the
 basement
 of
 her
 home
 to
 really
 solve


this
 need
 of
 providing
 highquality


kitchen
 wear
 products
 uh
 to
 families
 you


around
 the
 country
 through
 a
 direct


sales
 model.
 So
 there
 were
 consultants


who
 sold
 the
 products.
 So
 in
 you
 2015


or
 14
 when
 I
 took
 over
 um
 it
 had
 10


years
 of
 decline.
 So
 it
 was
 a


interesting
 opportunity
 to
 come
 into
 a


business
 that
 was
 in
 need
 of


transformation
 where
 there
 was
 this


opportunity
 to
 rethink
 the
 business


model,
 rethink
 the
 approach
 but
 I
 had


never
 done
 it
 before.
 So
 it
 was
 a


fundamentally
 new
 role
 for
 me
 to
 take
 on


in
 an
 industry
 I
 didn't
 know.
 Uh


ironically
 I
 don't
 cook
 so
 I
 had
 to


learn
 the
 basics
 but
 it
 was
 a
 really


great
 opportunity
 to
 do
 that.


>> There's
 two
 things
 you
 said
 there
 that


are
 really
 interesting
 to
 me.
 One
 of


which
 was
 value
 creation
 moving
 from


investing
 to
 operating.
 Tell
 me
 more


about
 that.
 I
 think
 for
 a
 long
 time
 in


the
 investing
 world
 on
 the
 buyout
 side


what
 you
 saw
 was
 there
 was
 opportunity


to
 buy
 businesses
 at
 7
 8
 nine
 times
 and


then
 you
 know
 a
 few
 years
 later
 some


minor
 improvements
 sell
 them
 for
 10
 11


12
 times
 I
 think
 that
 that
 has
 shifted


because
 capital
 is
 now
 commoditized


there's
 a
 lot
 more
 capital
 available
 to


sellers
 than
 there
 ever
 has
 been.
 For


example,
 in
 the
 1980s
 there
 were
 you
 20


25
 private
 equity
 firms.
 In
 2020
 we
 got


close
 to
 20,000
 in
 the
 US.
 So


significant
 shift
 in
 terms
 of
 the


capital
 that
 was
 out
 there
 as
 sellers


rightfully
 so
 gaining
 more
 of
 that
 value


when
 they're
 being
 partnered
 with
 that


means
 you
 have
 to
 create
 more
 value


after
 the
 partnership
 starts
 and
 that


means
 more
 of
 a
 focus
 on
 operating.


Traditional
 private
 equity
 the
 focus
 is


very
 short-term.
 You
 know,
 you
 buy
 a


business,
 you're
 focused
 on
 selling
 it


three
 to
 four
 years
 later.
 And
 in
 doing


that,
 I
 think
 what
 ultimately
 happens
 is


you
 make
 short-term
 decisions
 about
 the


businesses.
 And
 if
 you're
 going
 to


really
 create
 long-term
 value,
 I
 think


there's
 a
 value
 of
 having
 a
 longer
 term


approach.
 When
 I
 wanted
 to
 go
 become
 an


operator,
 it
 was
 I
 know
 I'm
 going
 to


need
 to
 create
 value
 in
 companies
 once


you
 partner
 with
 them.
 How
 do
 I
 think


about
 that
 and
 how
 do
 I
 become
 a
 better


operator?
 It'll
 make
 me
 a
 better


investor.
 I
 want
 to
 go
 back
 to
 something


you
 said
 earlier
 about
 the
 changing


landscape
 and
 companies
 not
 adapting.
 Is


it
 complacency?
 Is
 it
 they're
 running


the
 business
 on
 a
 map
 that's
 outdated?


Like
 why
 is
 it
 companies
 have
 a
 hard


time
 adapting
 to
 reality?


>> I
 think
 there's
 a
 few
 reasons
 it


happens.
 One
 is
 I
 think
 change
 is


happening
 faster
 and
 faster
 than
 it
 ever


has.
 And
 it's
 very
 hard
 when
 you're


managing
 a
 business
 and
 you're
 focused


on
 your
 customer
 and
 you're
 focused
 on


your
 product
 or
 your
 service
 to
 also


focus
 on
 this
 outside
 world
 and


landscape.
 You
 have
 things
 like
 COVID


tariffs,
 supply
 chain.
 there's
 always


something
 happening
 now
 AI
 what
 does


that
 mean
 for
 your
 business
 and
 how
 do


you
 navigate
 it
 it's
 also
 a
 lot
 of
 false


starts
 you
 don't
 know
 is
 this
 one
 here


to
 stay
 or
 is
 this
 something
 that's


going
 to
 be
 gone
 quickly
 and
 I
 think
 as


a
 leader
 that's
 challenging
 to
 navigate


I
 think
 second
 is
 if
 you
 think
 about


most
 leaders
 they
 usually
 grow
 up
 in
 a


business
 oftentimes
 and
 when
 you
 grow
 up


in
 a
 business
 you
 become
 an
 expert
 in


that
 business
 in
 that
 field
 in
 that


industry
 but
 sometimes
 you
 don't
 have


the
 perspective
 of
 seeing
 other


industries
 that
 perhaps
 perhaps
 have


come
 before
 you
 that
 are
 different
 but


similar
 in
 terms
 of
 what
 happened
 and
 so


you
 lose
 some
 of
 that
 perspective.
 You


gain
 the
 depth
 of
 experience
 but
 that


perspective
 is
 harder
 to
 have
 and
 I


think
 for
 us
 is
 like
 how
 do
 we
 help


leaders
 think
 about
 that
 and
 help
 them


see
 around
 the
 curves
 that
 might
 be


challenging
 but
 I
 think
 those
 are
 a


couple
 of
 reasons
 that
 it's
 becoming


more
 difficult
 for
 leaders.


>> Let's
 go
 back
 uh
 all
 the
 way
 to
 the


beginning.
 You
 grew
 up
 on
 a
 firm
 in


Manhattan,
 Kansas.
 Is
 that
 correct?


>> Yeah.
 When
 I
 went
 to
 college,
 people


would
 often
 say,
 "Where
 are
 you
 from?"


And
 I'd
 say,
 "Manhattan."
 Because
 that's


what
 you
 say
 in
 Kansas.
 And
 people


started
 ask
 like,
 "Oh,
 are
 you
 from
 the


Upper
 East
 Side
 or
 where?"
 I'm
 like,


"Well,
 there's
 not
 really
 an
 upper
 east


side."
 And
 I
 quickly
 realized
 Kansas
 was


sufficient
 and
 saying
 where
 I'm
 from


because
 most
 people
 don't
 fully


appreciate
 there's
 another
 Manhattan


that's
 much
 smaller.


>> What
 are
 some
 of
 the
 lessons
 you


remember
 from
 growing
 up
 on
 the
 farm
 and


the
 responsibilities
 that
 you
 had
 at


such
 a
 young
 age
 and
 how
 you
 think
 about


that
 in
 relation
 to
 parenting
 now?
 I


joke
 I
 spent
 much
 of
 my
 life
 trying
 to


get
 off
 the
 farm.
 And
 now
 I
 want
 a
 farm


for
 my
 own
 kids
 because
 I
 think
 it's


such
 a
 valuable
 landscape
 to
 learn
 and


to
 learn
 work
 ethic
 and
 commitment
 and


problem
 solving,
 all
 the
 things
 that


come
 with
 with
 being
 on
 a
 farm.
 My
 dad,


you
 know,
 he
 owned
 this
 farm
 and
 he


loved
 it.
 And
 so
 the
 first
 lesson
 I


learned
 when
 you
 find
 something
 you


love,
 it
 really
 is
 a
 passion
 and


something
 that
 you
 enjoy
 and
 you're
 not


really
 working.
 My
 dad
 worked
 harder


than
 anyone
 I've
 ever
 seen.
 You
 know,


late
 at
 night,
 early
 in
 the
 mornings,


all
 summer
 long,
 all
 throughout
 the


winter,
 he
 took
 a
 small
 break,
 but
 that


was
 about
 it
 for
 him.
 And
 it
 wasn't


working.
 It
 was
 what
 he
 loved.
 That


passion
 was
 something
 that
 I
 recognized


and
 saw
 early
 on.
 Second,
 I
 learned
 a


lot
 of
 independence
 on
 a
 farm.
 Just
 the


nature
 of
 it
 is
 you're
 figuring
 things


out.
 There's
 a
 lot
 of
 inherent
 dangers


or
 risks.
 I
 was
 driving
 when
 I
 was,
 you


know,
 11,
 12
 years
 old
 on
 the
 farm,
 not


necessarily
 on
 the
 road
 yet,
 but
 I


learned
 how
 to
 navigate
 unfamiliar


situations,
 which
 was
 an
 important


lesson
 for
 me
 early
 on.
 And
 then
 I
 also


learned,
 you
 know,
 in
 essence
 business


from
 a
 very
 fundamentally
 young
 age.


When
 I
 was
 probably
 in
 third,
 fourth


grade,
 I
 started
 running
 my
 own
 farmers


market
 stand.
 And
 so
 my
 dad
 would
 take


me
 down
 in
 the
 morning,
 drop
 me
 off,
 I


would
 run
 it
 for
 the
 day
 and
 he'd
 come


pick
 me
 up
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day
 and
 we


got
 really
 busy
 and
 I
 started
 hiring
 my


friends
 and
 I
 got
 a
 practice.
 Do
 I
 pay


them
 by
 the
 hour?
 Do
 I
 pay
 them
 a


commission?
 Do
 I
 pay
 them
 a
 bonus?
 How


do
 I
 get
 the
 best,
 you
 know,
 um,


performance
 out
 of
 them?
 I
 started


thinking
 about
 supply
 and
 demand
 and


pricing.
 I
 saw
 as
 we
 grew
 watermelons,


beginning
 of
 the
 season,
 they
 were
 $8


each
 when
 they
 were
 very
 limited.
 By
 the


height
 of
 the
 season,
 when
 we
 had
 a
 lot,


they
 were
 $2
 each.
 Learning
 fundamentals


of
 a
 business
 was
 really
 valuable.
 Even


if
 it
 was a
 farmers
 market
 stand,
 I


could
 get
 better
 and
 better
 every
 week.


I
 could
 build
 the
 foundation
 of
 how
 to


have
 a,
 you
 know,
 repeatable,
 scalable


system
 to
 improve
 my
 odds
 of
 success.


And
 I
 saw
 our
 farmers
 market
 stand
 going


from
 making
 $500
 a
 week
 to
 a,000
 to,500


by
 the
 time,
 you
 know,
 I
 had
 really


scaled
 it
 up.
 Uh,
 which
 was
 great
 for
 me


and
 really
 just
 a
 fascinating
 learning


experience.
 Was
 this
 your
 parents


helping
 you
 or
 all
 self-driven
 like


reading
 and
 applying
 or?


>> Yeah,
 definitely
 self-driven.
 My
 dad
 um


I
 was
 the
 youngest
 of
 seven
 kids.
 He
 had


been
 married
 previously.
 So,
 four
 from


his
 first
 marriage
 and
 three
 from
 from


ours.
 And
 what
 I
 saw
 in
 that
 was
 like
 he


just
 let
 me
 he
 let
 me
 do
 a
 lot.
 Um


probably
 more
 so
 than
 your
 average
 kid


because
 he
 was
 older
 and
 he
 had
 seven


kids
 and
 he
 had
 sort
 of
 seen
 it
 all.
 And


my
 brother
 navigated
 sort
 of
 the
 farming


part
 of
 the
 business.
 That
 wasn't
 my


passion,
 but
 the
 business
 side
 I
 did


love.
 And
 so
 it
 started
 out
 small,
 my


own
 farmers
 market
 stand,
 but
 over
 time


it
 was
 running
 our
 whole
 store
 and


running
 more
 and
 more
 of
 the
 business.


And
 I
 think
 he
 appreciated
 it.
 It
 wasn't


my
 dad's
 passion
 either.
 He
 loved
 the


farming
 side
 and
 it
 was
 an
 opportunity


to
 really
 learn
 and
 grow
 and
 try


different
 things
 in
 a
 relatively
 safe


space,
 which
 is
 really
 amazing.


>> Where
 did
 the
 ambition
 come
 from
 to
 go


to
 Harvard?


>> It
 wasn't
 um
 as
 structured
 or
 as


disciplined
 as
 I
 would
 have
 thought.
 I


knew
 I
 wanted
 to
 leave
 the
 farm
 and
 as


much
 as
 I
 like
 the
 business
 side,
 it
 was


hard.
 It
 was
 very,
 very
 hard
 manual
 work


and
 I
 wanted
 to
 get
 off
 the
 farm
 and,


you
 know,
 go
 do
 something
 else.
 I
 didn't


know
 what
 that
 something
 else
 was,
 but
 I


knew
 I
 wanted
 to
 leave.
 In
 high
 school,


decided
 education
 was
 the
 way
 to
 get


there.
 And
 I
 had
 always
 had
 good
 grades


and
 done
 a
 lot
 of
 extracurriculars
 and


managed
 a
 lot
 on
 the
 farm,
 but
 I
 wanted


to
 apply
 to
 a
 lot
 of
 colleges.
 And
 I


didn't
 know
 which
 one.
 I
 didn't
 know


where.
 I
 just
 knew
 I
 could
 apply
 to
 all


these
 schools
 and
 I
 probably
 could
 get


into
 one
 or
 two
 that
 I'd
 be
 interested


in
 going
 to.
 So,
 I
 just
 sort
 of
 applied


everywhere
 because
 I
 didn't
 know
 anyone


at
 that
 time
 who
 had
 gone
 to
 Harvard
 or


other
 schools.
 I
 mean,
 really
 outside
 of


Kansas.
 And
 so,
 it
 was
 a
 great


opportunity
 for
 me
 to
 just
 put
 my
 hat
 in


the
 ring
 and
 sort
 of
 see
 what
 would
 come


from
 it.


>> And
 then
 you
 immediately
 went
 to
 HBS


after.
 What
 was
 the
 decision-m
 process


like
 to
 just
 do
 an
 undergrad
 and
 then


right
 into
 HBS?
 You
 knew
 what
 you


wanted,
 I
 assume.
 I
 think
 there
 were
 a


couple
 components.
 One
 is
 I
 had
 a
 mentor


who
 had
 done
 something
 similar
 a


different
 school
 and
 she
 had
 really


advocated
 if
 I
 knew
 what
 I
 wanted
 to
 do


that
 it
 was
 a
 path
 that
 allowed
 more


efficiency
 and
 also
 not
 having
 to
 you


revisit
 it
 later
 in
 life.
 At
 that
 stage


I
 had
 found
 business.
 I
 had
 found


investing.
 I
 knew
 I
 was
 passionate
 about


those
 areas.
 I
 felt
 like
 I
 had
 a
 clear


direction
 of
 what
 I
 wanted
 to
 go
 do.
 I


also
 think
 going
 straight
 from
 college


to
 business
 school
 which
 I
 advise
 to


students
 now
 is
 you
 really
 on
 three


metrics.
 So,
 you
 need
 to
 make
 sure


you're
 ready.
 Socially,
 you're
 going
 to


be
 with
 students
 who
 are
 much
 older
 than


you
 are
 on
 average.
 Academically,
 can


you
 bring
 something
 to
 the
 classroom


that's
 valuable
 and
 insightful?
 And
 then


career-wise,
 you're
 going
 to
 be


competing
 for
 jobs
 with
 other
 people
 who


have
 more
 experience
 than
 you.
 Socially,


I'd
 always
 felt,
 you
 know,
 like
 I
 was


older
 than
 my
 peers.
 I
 think
 the
 nature


of
 growing
 up
 again
 in in
 a
 farm
 or
 a


family
 business
 is
 you
 often
 times
 just


get
 more
 independence
 and
 you
 age
 a


little bit
 quicker.
 Second,
 I
 think
 in


terms
 of
 academically,
 I
 hadn't
 been
 in


a
 traditional
 career,
 but
 I
 had
 run
 our


family
 business
 from,
 you
 know,
 a
 young


age.
 And
 so,
 I
 felt
 like
 I
 had


experiences
 to
 draw
 from
 that
 would
 help


me
 in
 in
 the
 classroom
 and
 be
 relevant.


And
 then
 third,
 from
 a
 career


perspective,
 I
 didn't
 know
 where
 it


would
 go,
 but
 I
 felt
 like
 I'd
 figure
 it


out
 and
 I
 wasn't
 as
 worried
 about
 that.


That
 wasn't
 what
 I
 was
 going
 to
 business


school
 for.
 it
 was
 to
 to
 learn
 and
 grow


and
 become
 a
 better
 person
 in
 terms
 of


my
 own
 expertise
 and
 skills.


>> And
 then
 when
 it
 came
 to
 finding
 a
 job,


my
 understanding
 is
 you
 wrote
 a
 whole


bunch
 of
 letters
 to
 different
 CEOs.
 Tell


me
 about
 that.


>> I
 actually
 started
 writing
 letters
 in


college
 to
 CEOs
 and
 I
 just
 wanted
 to


learn.
 So
 I
 wrote
 letters
 to
 different


CEOs
 in
 business
 and
 in
 finance
 saying,


"Can
 I
 come
 and
 pick
 your
 brain?"
 I


wrote
 a
 letter
 to
 Ace
 Greenberg
 at
 Bear


Sterns
 and
 he
 graciously
 said,
 "Yes,


come
 down
 and
 visit."
 And
 so
 I
 came,


went
 to
 the
 trading
 floor,
 sat
 with
 him


for
 a
 couple
 of
 hours,
 and
 he
 just


answered
 my
 questions
 as
 I
 thought
 about


investing.
 He
 was,
 you
 know,
 obviously
 a


legend
 in
 the
 finance
 field,
 but
 he
 was


gracious
 and
 willing
 to
 spend
 time
 with


me.
 And
 I
 think
 that
 was
 a
 huge
 lesson


for
 me
 because
 people
 want
 to
 help
 other


people
 and
 they
 especially
 want
 to
 help


young
 people.
 Being
 a
 student,
 I
 was


able
 to
 get
 access
 to
 people
 who


otherwise
 probably
 would
 have
 said
 no,


and
 they
 probably
 should
 have
 in
 terms


of
 their
 time.
 They
 were
 very
 busy,
 but


it
 was
 a
 really
 great
 opportunity.
 I'd


written
 one
 of
 those
 letters
 to
 Warren


Buffett
 to
 bring
 a
 group
 of
 students
 out


to
 Omaha
 in
 college
 and
 got
 to
 know
 him


a
 little
 bit
 through
 that.
 I
 wasn't


actually
 writing
 letters
 for
 jobs.
 I
 was


writing
 letters
 to
 learn.
 And
 then
 when


I
 graduated,
 I
 had
 a
 full-time
 job
 lined


up.
 I
 had
 been
 an
 intern
 and
 then
 come


back
 full-time
 at
 a
 company.
 When
 I
 met


Warren
 over
 the
 student
 group
 visits,
 I


decided
 to
 write
 him
 a
 letter.
 Um,
 and


so
 that's
 how
 I
 ultimately
 ended
 up
 at


Bergkshire.


>> What
 do
 you
 take
 away
 from
 Bergkshire?


You
 worked
 there
 10
 years,
 right?
 I


think
 Warren
 is
 very
 gracious
 with
 his


learning
 and
 his
 knowledge
 and
 he
 shares


it
 widely.
 He
 shares
 it
 at
 the
 annual


meetings.
 He
 shares
 it
 at
 the
 annual


letters
 and
 I
 feel
 like
 I
 got
 a
 front


row
 seat
 to
 really
 understanding
 that


and
 seeing
 it
 in
 action.
 But
 I
 think
 the


lessons
 are
 timeless
 and
 they're
 what
 he


exposes
 relatively
 consistently
 through


those
 maxims
 which
 I
 think
 is
 great


because
 everyone
 can
 learn
 from
 him.
 But


really
 the
 value
 of
 long-term
 thinking


and
 long-term
 compounding,
 the
 eighth


wonder
 of
 the
 world
 is
 compounding
 and


the
 value
 of
 that
 and
 if
 you
 think
 long


term
 and
 are
 set
 up
 structurally
 to


think
 long
 term,
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 value


in
 that.
 Second,
 the
 value
 of
 people
 and


finding
 the
 right
 people
 with
 high


integrity,
 people
 who
 care
 about
 what


they're
 doing
 and
 then
 giving
 them
 the


right
 incentives
 and
 the
 right


encouragement.
 Warren
 gave
 those
 people


around
 him,
 his
 CEOs
 or
 others
 really


great
 autonomy
 and
 high
 expectations
 but


really
 let
 people
 have
 flexibility
 and
 I


saw
 the
 value
 of
 that.
 And
 then
 lastly


just
 the
 value
 of
 continuous
 learning


improvement.
 You
 know
 Warren
 reads
 every


single
 day
 get
 smarter
 is
 better.
 Those


in
 the
 Birkshire
 ecosystem
 do
 the
 same.


And
 I
 think
 that
 was
 something
 that


resonated
 with
 me
 from
 when
 I
 was
 a
 kid


on
 the
 farm.
 You
 know,
 my
 dad
 also


focused
 on
 getting
 better
 and
 continuous


improvement
 in
 a
 different
 field,
 but
 it


was
 something
 that
 I
 saw
 reinforced
 at


Bergkshire.


>> So,
 why
 leave?


>> Bergkshire
 is
 a
 phenomenal
 place.
 I


mean,
 it's
 unique.
 It's
 one
 of
 a
 kind.
 I


don't
 think
 there'll
 be
 another
 one
 by


any
 means,
 but
 Berkshire
 is
 very
 large


in
 terms
 of
 capital.
 It's
 hard
 to
 deploy


capital.
 It's
 hard
 to
 find
 really
 great


investments,
 but
 it's
 also
 especially


hard
 when
 you're
 very
 large.
 I
 saw
 this


opportunity
 to
 help
 midsize
 companies


with
 a
 long-term
 approach
 with
 creating


value.
 As
 much
 as
 I
 love
 my
 time
 at


Bergkshire
 and
 would
 have
 been
 happy


there
 forever,
 felt
 like
 there
 was
 this


opportunity
 to
 create
 something
 new
 and


special
 that
 was
 serving
 a
 market
 that


really
 wasn't
 I
 didn't
 think
 being


served
 well
 today.


>> You
 know,
 people
 talk
 a
 lot
 about


product
 market
 fit,
 sales
 tactics,
 or


pricing
 strategy,
 but
 the
 truth
 is


success
 in
 selling
 often
 comes
 down
 to


something
 much
 simpler,
 the
 system


behind
 the
 sale.
 That's
 why
 I
 use
 and


love
 Shopay
 because
 nobody
 does
 selling


better
 than
 Shopify.
 They've
 built
 the


number
 one
 checkout
 on
 the
 planet.
 And


with
 Shopay,
 businesses
 see
 up
 to
 50%


higher
 conversions.
 That's
 not
 a


rounding
 error.
 That's
 a
 game
 changer.


Attention
 is
 scarce.
 Shopify
 helps
 you


capture
 it
 and
 convert
 it.
 If
 you're


building
 a
 serious
 business,
 your


commerce
 platform
 needs
 to
 meet
 your


customers
 wherever
 they
 are
 on
 your


site,
 in
 store,
 in
 their
 feed,
 or
 right


inside
 their
 inbox.
 The
 less
 they
 think,


the
 more
 they
 buy.
 Businesses
 that
 sell


more,
 sell
 on
 Shopify.
 If
 you're
 serious


about
 selling,
 the
 tech
 behind
 the


scenes
 matters
 as
 much
 as
 the
 product.

Let's
 dive
 into
 Canbreak
 a
 little.


Compare
 and
 contrast
 the
 framework
 at


Bergkshire
 and
 what
 you're
 doing
 that's


different.


>> It's
 hard
 to
 say
 what's
 similar
 in
 the


sense
 because
 Bergkshire
 is
 so
 unique


and
 special.
 It's
 one
 of
 a
 kind
 and
 I


don't
 think
 we
 think
 that
 we're
 going
 to


to
 replicate
 that
 by
 any
 means.
 What


we're
 trying
 to
 do
 is
 really
 focus
 on


long-term
 creating
 a
 long-term
 structure


with
 a
 long-term
 horizon
 to
 buy
 and


build
 businesses
 with
 the
 right
 approach


that
 we
 think
 is
 valuable
 to
 the


companies,
 valuable
 to
 employees,


customers,
 and
 ultimately
 investors.


Second
 is
 finding
 highquality
 businesses


that
 have
 some
 sort
 of
 mo
 or
 competitive


advantage.
 Great
 businesses
 are
 hard
 to


find.
 And
 when
 you
 find
 a
 great
 business


with
 a
 motor
 competitive
 advantage
 and


you
 have
 a
 long
 runway,
 you
 can
 really


invest
 behind
 that.
 And
 then
 I
 think
 for


us
 in
 terms
 of
 one
 thing
 that
 we
 do


distinctively
 different
 than
 Bergkshire


is
 we're
 much
 more
 hands-on


operationally.
 And
 that
 came
 from
 when
 I


was
 CEO.
 When
 I
 was
 CEO,
 what
 I
 felt


like
 was
 it
 was
 very
 lonely.
 It
 was


challenging.
 It
 was
 hard.
 And
 I
 was
 out


navigating
 and
 trying
 to
 find
 resources,


support.
 People
 would
 come
 before
 me
 who


could
 help
 me
 in
 that
 seat.
 And
 I
 kept


thinking
 like
 it
 would
 be
 so
 nice
 if


there
 was
 someone
 who
 could
 tell
 me
 how


to
 do
 a
 great
 strategic
 planning
 process


or
 how
 to
 improve
 my
 hiring
 skills
 or


how
 to
 build
 the
 right
 culture
 or
 what


is
 great
 look
 like
 in
 these
 different


aspects
 of
 managing
 a
 business.
 And
 so


when
 Brian
 Humphrey
 and
 I
 started


Camrich,
 we
 really
 wanted
 to
 focus
 on


how
 do
 we
 build
 a
 system
 that
 we
 can


help
 these
 midsize
 companies
 and
 be
 the


resource
 that
 we
 wanted
 when
 we
 were


operators.
 We
 built
 the
 Camber
 business


system
 really
 focused
 on
 that.


>> There's
 so
 much
 to
 unpack
 there.
 I
 want


to
 go
 back
 to
 maybe
 the
 first
 jumping


off
 point
 there,
 which
 is
 long-term.


Everybody
 says
 long
 term
 that's
 become


this
 sort
 of
 thing
 that's
 easy
 to
 say


and
 what's
 the
 difference
 between
 saying


it
 and
 living
 it.


>> I
 think
 of
 it
 in
 three
 different
 ways.


One
 is
 do
 you
 think
 long
 term?
 Do
 you


have
 a
 long-term
 horizon
 in
 perspective?


A
 lot
 of
 people
 can
 say
 I
 think
 long


term
 and
 they
 may,
 but
 that's
 only
 one


component.
 The
 second
 is,
 do
 you
 have
 a


structure
 that
 actually
 allows
 you
 to


think
 long
 term?
 Because
 if
 you


naturally
 have
 a
 structure
 that
 doesn't


allow
 for
 that
 or
 doesn't
 encourage


that,
 you're
 going
 to
 be
 pitting


yourself
 with
 your
 long-term
 horizon


against
 your
 structure
 that
 is
 going
 to


encourage
 you
 to
 make
 shorter
 term


decisions.
 In
 essence,
 if
 you're
 focused


on
 selling
 a
 business
 in
 three
 to
 five


years,
 you're
 going
 to
 make
 short-term


decisions
 if
 your
 structure
 is
 going
 to


require
 you
 or
 incentivize
 you
 to
 do


that.
 And
 then
 the
 third
 is
 I
 think


there's
 differing
 degrees
 of
 long-term.


There
 is
 the
 50-year
 long-term
 which
 I


think
 is
 really
 really
 long-term
 and


then
 there's
 differing
 gradients
 of
 that


that
 can
 be
 utilized
 and
 be
 thought


about
 and
 I
 don't
 think
 all
 long-term
 is


equal
 and
 I
 don't
 think
 you
 need
 to
 do


50
 years
 um
 to
 be
 sort
 of
 long
 term.
 I


think
 there's
 some
 in
 the
 the
 middle


that
 allows
 you
 to
 take
 advantage
 of


that
 horizon,
 take
 advantage
 of
 that


structure,
 but
 give
 you
 some
 flexibility


where
 you're
 not
 locking
 yourself
 up


forever.


>> Even
 if
 you're
 a
 long-term
 thinker,
 it's


kind
 of
 weird,
 right?
 Because
 you're


thinking
 about
 longer
 duration,
 25
 or
 50


years,
 but
 you
 have
 to
 act
 today.


>> Yes.
 We
 always
 say
 that
 there's
 a


balance
 of
 sort
 short-term
 and
 long


term.
 You
 can't
 only
 think
 about
 the


long
 term.
 If
 you
 only
 think
 about
 the


long
 term,
 you
 probably
 won't
 get
 out
 of


the
 short
 term
 because
 you're
 going
 to


miss
 the
 situations
 of
 today,
 the


shortterm
 um
 sort
 of
 dynamics.
 When
 we


were
 at
 Pampered
 Chef,
 we
 were
 turning


around
 the
 business.
 Uh
 Brian
 was
 the


CFO,
 I
 was
 the
 CEO,
 and
 we
 had
 a


management
 team
 that
 was
 helping
 us


drive
 this
 transformation.
 And
 we
 were
 a


couple
 years
 into
 the
 turnaround,
 and


the
 business
 was
 actually
 doing
 quite


well.
 And
 then
 in
 year
 three,
 we
 had


this
 sort
 of
 setback.
 And
 what
 we
 saw


was
 we
 were
 focusing
 too
 much
 on
 the


long
 term.
 our
 long-term
 strategic


initiatives,
 our
 investments
 in
 the


international
 growth
 and
 new
 categories.


We
 had
 lost
 sight
 of
 the
 fundamentals


blocking
 and
 tackling
 of
 today.
 And
 what


we
 had
 thought
 was,
 hey,
 we
 had
 focused


on
 those
 for
 two
 years.
 We
 had
 improved


them.
 Now
 we
 could
 go
 set
 our
 sights
 on


longer
 term
 thinking.
 But
 the
 reality
 is


you
 have
 to
 manage
 the
 short
 term
 and


you
 have
 to
 manage
 the
 long
 term.
 And
 I


think
 for
 us
 is
 we
 had
 to
 refocus
 really


work
 on
 the
 sales
 today,
 the
 sort
 of


challenges
 we
 were
 facing
 in
 the
 moment


in
 order
 to
 give
 us
 the
 space
 to
 think


about
 the
 long
 term
 as
 well.


>> You
 mentioned
 blocking
 and
 tackling
 and


I
 think
 there's
 a
 point
 to
 be
 made
 there


perhaps
 about
 how
 we
 get
 trapped
 in


complexity
 and
 making
 things
 overly


complicated
 and
 sometimes
 it
 just
 comes


down
 to
 remembering
 the
 basics.
 As
 as


Munger
 would
 say,
 take
 a
 simple
 idea
 and


take
 it
 seriously.


>> Yes.
 Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 I
 think
 that
 often


times
 we
 think
 of
 the
 big
 things
 we


could
 go
 do,
 you
 know,
 what
 should
 the


strategy
 look
 like
 or
 what's
 the
 future


vision
 of
 this
 or
 what's
 it
 going
 to


mean
 versus
 how
 do
 we
 do
 the


fundamentals
 and
 do
 the
 fundamentals


well
 and
 I
 think
 some
 of
 the
 best
 you


CEOs
 out
 there
 focused
 on
 the


fundamentals.
 I
 mean
 Sam
 Walton
 at


Walmart,
 he
 was
 all
 about
 the


fundamentals
 and
 he
 was
 in
 a
 store
 every


week
 and
 you
 know
 multiple
 stores
 every


week
 focused
 on
 how
 do
 we
 deliver
 for


our
 customers
 more
 effectively.
 That
 is


a
 really
 important
 skill
 set
 that
 is


oftentimes
 undervalued
 or


underappreciated.
 And
 I
 think
 that's


really
 important
 especially
 in
 mid-size


companies
 where
 there's
 a
 lot
 of


blocking
 and
 tackling
 to
 be
 done
 every


single
 day.
 And
 often
 times
 that
 rises


all
 the
 way
 up
 to
 the
 management
 team


and
 the
 CEO.
 It's
 not
 something
 where


just
 your
 front
 line
 can
 handle
 the


blocking
 and
 tackling.
 Really,
 everyone


needs
 to
 be
 focused
 on
 it.


>> Was
 the
 turnaround
 at
 Pamper
 Chuff
 with


the
 same
 people
 or
 was
 there
 a


changeover
 in
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 team?
 In
 this


situation
 at
 Pamper
 Chef,
 we
 did
 change


much
 of
 the
 team.
 The
 business
 had
 been


in
 decline
 for
 about
 10
 years.
 And


during
 that
 period,
 we
 saw
 a
 lot
 of


probably
 great
 people
 in
 the


organization
 leave
 or
 they
 had
 the
 skill


sets
 that
 we
 needed
 for
 the


transformation
 weren't
 there
 or
 had


atrophied.
 And
 so,
 we
 needed
 an
 infusion


of
 talent.
 So,
 as
 an
 example,
 when
 I


started
 at
 Pampered
 Chef,
 10%
 of
 the


business
 was
 digital.
 90%
 was
 sold
 in


person
 through
 in-person
 parties.


Employees
 didn't
 even
 have
 laptops.
 And


what
 we
 saw
 was,
 wow,
 the
 customer
 is


shifting
 dramatically.
 They're
 shopping


more
 online.
 They're
 shopping
 more


mobile.
 And
 we're
 selling
 through
 an


in-person
 party
 model.
 So,
 we
 needed
 to


shift
 our
 mindset
 to
 say,
 okay,
 how
 do


we
 actually
 meet
 customers
 where
 they


are
 and
 what's
 important
 to
 them
 in
 that


process.
 And
 what
 we
 found
 in
 doing
 that


was
 we
 needed
 to
 be
 more
 digitally


focused.
 And
 we
 needed
 to
 shift
 our
 own


thinking
 about
 technology
 from
 back


office
 and
 support
 to
 a
 true
 revenue


generator.
 And
 so
 we
 needed
 a
 you
 a
 new


leader
 in
 technology
 and
 then
 ultimately


much
 of
 a
 new
 technology
 team
 and


marketing
 and
 sales
 to
 really
 complement


that.
 We
 brought
 in
 a
 new
 leader
 who


really
 transformed
 how
 we
 thought
 about


technology
 and
 then
 how
 we
 serve
 the


customer.
 We
 took
 the
 business
 from
 10%


sort
 of
 digital
 to
 75%.
 Now
 we
 still
 did


that
 through
 the
 channel.
 So
 through
 the


sales
 consultants,
 we
 didn't
 go
 on


Amazon
 or
 you
 sell
 direct,
 but
 we


actually
 really
 focused
 on
 how
 do
 we


utilize
 our
 you
 competitive
 advantage


which
 was
 the
 channel
 but
 help
 them
 be


more
 effective
 digitally.
 But
 I
 think


it's
 a
 good
 example
 of
 sometimes
 you


need
 a
 different
 skill
 set
 or
 a


different
 experience
 to
 go
 where
 you


need
 to
 go
 in
 a
 business
 and
 sometimes


the
 legacy
 team
 doesn't
 always
 have


that.


>> What
 was
 it
 like
 attracting
 talent
 to
 uh


declining
 business?
 And
 I
 liken
 this


maybe
 to
 sports,
 right?
 If
 you're
 on
 a


team
 that's
 0
 and
 17,
 it's
 really
 hard


to
 attract
 free
 agents
 that
 are
 capable


and
 competent
 and
 who
 can
 change
 the


culture.
 They're
 sort
 of
 waiting
 to
 see


progress
 before
 they
 jump
 in
 or
 waiting


to
 see
 a
 critical
 mass.
 How
 did
 you
 go


about
 attracting
 talent
 to
 that?


>> It
 was
 something
 we
 really
 focused
 a
 lot


on
 early
 on,
 understanding
 what
 was
 our


employee
 value
 prop.
 Why
 would
 someone


want
 to
 come
 to
 Pamper
 Chef?
 And
 what
 we


found
 was
 people
 weren't
 coming
 to


Pampered
 Chef,
 you
 know,
 because
 they


necessarily
 loved
 always
 loved
 the


product
 or
 our
 location
 or
 some
 other


factor.
 They
 were
 coming
 because
 they


wanted
 to
 learn
 and
 grow
 and
 we
 could


give
 them
 opportunities
 through
 being
 a


meritocracy
 that
 they
 could
 learn
 and


grow
 more
 quickly
 and
 get
 rewarded
 for


that
 and
 be
 excited
 by
 what
 we
 were


doing.
 And
 in
 essence,
 you
 know,
 we


really
 focused
 on
 storytelling
 and


saying,
 what
 are
 we
 going
 to
 go
 do
 and


we're
 transforming
 a
 business?
 We're


going
 to
 reinvent
 meal
 time.
 we're
 going


to
 focus
 on
 our
 purpose
 which
 was


imaging
 lives
 one
 meal
 and
 one
 memory
 at


a
 time.
 That's
 what
 we're
 going
 to
 focus


on.
 And
 that
 really
 started
 to
 resonate


with
 sort
 of
 employees
 who
 were


passionate
 about
 learning,
 growing,
 and


then
 doing
 something
 that
 was
 unique
 and


special.
 And
 then
 we
 focused
 on
 our


culture
 of
 how
 do
 we
 actually
 accomplish


that
 through
 the
 culture
 we
 were


creating
 both
 in
 terms
 of
 opportunities,


promotions,
 incentives,
 growth,
 but
 also


in
 terms
 of
 engagement,
 giving
 feedback,


helping
 people
 grow
 and
 develop.
 And
 we


ended
 up
 attracting
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 who


wouldn't
 normally
 go
 to
 a
 kitchenware


products
 business.
 I
 wouldn't
 normally


go
 to
 a
 kitchenware
 products
 business,


but
 saw
 this
 opportunity
 to
 build


something
 unique
 and
 special
 and
 really


focus
 on
 how
 could
 we
 do
 that
 here
 in


the
 company
 as
 well.


>> I
 love
 that.
 I
 want
 to
 go
 back
 to


structure
 being
 a
 critical
 important
 to


long-term
 thinking.
 I've
 always,
 as
 an


outsider
 to
 Birkshshire,
 thought
 a
 lot


of
 the
 success
 resulted
 from
 the
 fact


that
 nobody
 could
 come
 in
 at
 certain


point
 in
 time
 and
 tell
 Buffett
 to
 do


something
 different.
 The
 structure


aligned
 with
 what
 he
 was
 doing
 for
 a


long-term
 thinking
 point
 of
 view.
 And
 we


have a
 mutual
 friend,
 Brent
 Bash,
 who


set
 up
 the
 same
 thing
 uh
 from
 a
 wouldn't


call
 it
 a
 private
 equity
 model,
 but
 he


didn't
 take
 a
 seven-year
 fund
 where


there's
 a
 ticking
 clock.
 He
 made
 it
 28


years
 and
 called
 it
 permanent
 equity.


And
 that
 enables
 a
 lot
 more
 patient


deployment
 of
 capital,
 enables
 you
 to


make
 investments
 today
 that
 they're


going
 to
 bear
 fruit
 in
 five
 or
 six


years,
 but
 you
 won't
 do
 that
 if
 you're


just
 flipping
 a
 business.


>> Absolutely.
 I
 mean,
 I
 think
 that
 if
 your


time
 horizon
 is
 you
 3
 to
 5
 years
 in
 a


business,
 you
 know,
 I'm
 going
 to
 sell


the
 business
 in
 3
 to
 5
 years,
 everything


you're
 going
 to
 do
 is
 going
 to
 be


short-term
 in
 nature
 just
 because
 of


human
 nature
 and
 what
 how
 you're


incentivized.
 So
 you're
 going to
 come
 in


and
 say,
 "Okay,
 should
 I
 invest
 in


growing
 into
 new
 markets
 or
 should
 I


take
 price
 right
 now?
 Should
 I,
 you


know,
 really
 build
 a
 strong
 people


system
 and
 culture
 and
 engagement
 that


may
 not
 pay
 back
 for
 3,
 four,
 5
 years
 or


should
 I
 take
 costs
 out
 right
 now
 which


are
 going
 to
 increase
 my
 short-term


value?"
 Every
 decision
 you're
 probably


going
 to
 come
 up
 to,
 it's
 going
 to
 be


really,
 really
 hard
 to
 make
 a
 longer


term
 decision
 because
 the
 pressures
 are


so,
 you
 know,
 skewed
 to
 making
 a
 shorter


term
 action.
 And
 so
 I
 think
 that
 the


nature
 of
 the
 structure
 just
 creates
 the


wrong
 incentives.
 Any
 leader
 in
 a


business
 will
 say
 you
 you
 don't
 usually


get
 payback
 and
 things
 as
 quickly
 as
 you


think.
 And
 so
 to
 get
 payback
 in
 a
 year


or
 two
 years
 or
 three
 years,
 it's
 hard


versus
 okay,
 we're
 going
 to
 move
 into
 a


new
 market.
 You
 know,
 that
 might
 take
 us


a
 few
 years
 to
 get
 that
 set
 up
 or
 we're


going
 to
 invest
 in
 building
 a
 new
 crop


of
 talent
 in
 our
 organization
 so
 that


they're
 ready
 to
 lead
 in
 five
 years.


Those
 are
 things
 that
 are
 long-term
 in


nature.
 But
 if
 your
 structure
 or
 your


incentivized
 on
 a
 shorter
 term
 duration,


it's
 just
 hard
 to
 make
 those
 decisions.


>> And
 even
 when
 you
 make
 them,
 it's
 hard


internally
 often
 unless
 you
 have


everybody
 aligned
 in
 the
 same
 direction


because
 it's
 like,
 oh,
 we're
 making
 this


for
 5
 years,
 but
 all
 of a
 sudden
 the
 ROI


is
 not
 what
 we
 thought
 it
 would
 be.
 And


abandon
 ship
 sort
 of
 mentality.


>> Oh,
 absolutely.
 I
 mean,
 I've
 been
 in
 a


number
 of
 businesses
 where
 people
 will


say,
 "Oh,
 if
 we
 can
 just
 get
 the
 margins


from
 10%
 to
 12%
 or
 12,
 you
 know,"
 and


I'm
 like,
 "Well,
 that's
 that's
 really


hard
 to
 do."
 Like,
 that's
 hard
 to
 do.


But
 I
 remember
 when
 I
 took
 the
 role
 at


Pamper
 Chef,
 I
 had
 advised
 the
 business


for
 about
 a
 year.
 So
 I
 had
 a
 pretty
 good


sense
 of
 I
 think
 what
 needed
 to
 be
 done.


Then
 I
 just
 needed
 to
 go
 do
 it.
 And
 I


thought
 it
 would
 take
 me
 a
 year
 or
 two


um
 to
 go
 drive
 the
 change
 that
 was


needed
 to
 get
 the
 business
 back
 on


track.
 And
 it
 took
 almost
 three
 or
 four


because
 everything
 took
 longer
 and
 was


harder.
 You
 know,
 getting
 the
 right


team,
 getting
 the
 right
 culture,


investing
 in
 the
 right,
 you
 know,


systems
 in
 the
 business.
 We
 wanted
 to


update
 the
 marketing
 and
 update
 the


product.
 All
 of
 that
 took
 a
 fair
 amount


of
 time.
 And
 I
 think
 that
 if
 my
 task
 was


to
 go
 sell
 that
 business
 in
 three
 or


four
 years,
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 I
 would
 have


done
 all
 the
 same
 things.
 I
 probably


would
 have
 made
 some
 shorter
 term


decisions
 that
 ultimately
 probably
 would


have
 created
 less
 value
 in
 the
 business.


>> I
 think
 that's
 part
 of
 the
 reason
 that


culture
 changes
 are
 so
 hard
 is
 that


they're
 longer
 and
 harder
 than
 you


expect.
 There's
 a
 timeline
 mismatch
 as


well,
 too.
 Like
 CEO
 turnover,
 at least


in
 the
 S&P
 500,
 is
 as
 fast
 as
 it's
 ever


been,
 if
 not
 faster.
 And
 so
 you
 go
 in
 or


think
 of
 a
 coach
 in
 a
 sports
 team,


right?
 You
 go
 into
 a
 losing
 team,
 you're


going
 to
 throw
 a
 lot
 of
 Hail
 Marys


because
 the
 expectation
 is
 just
 that,


you
 know,
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 be
 here
 for


10
 years.
 I'll
 trade
 away
 that
 first


round
 draft
 pick.
 I'll
 I'll
 do
 these


things
 that
 maybe
 would
 pay
 off
 in
 3
 to


four
 years.


>> Yeah.
 And
 I
 think
 that,
 you
 know,
 we
 all


have
 incentives
 in
 life.
 And
 so


recognizing
 what
 the
 incentives
 are


often
 times
 show
 us
 what
 behaviors
 you


will
 we'll
 have
 or
 what
 decisions
 we'll


make.
 And
 I
 think
 you
 mentioned
 culture.


I
 think
 culture
 and
 people
 is
 the
 most


foundational
 and
 fundamental
 aspect
 of


any
 business,
 any
 size.
 I
 think
 in


mid-size
 companies
 in
 particular,
 it's


incredibly
 valuable
 because
 um
 you
 have


often
 times
 more
 limited
 resources.
 Your


team's
 smaller
 and
 so
 people
 are
 doing


more
 in
 terms
 of
 their
 scope
 of


responsibilities,
 their
 capabilities.


They
 oftentimes
 are
 very
 passionate
 and


committed,
 but
 we
 don't
 always
 invest
 in


that
 culture.
 And
 so,
 how
 do
 we


continue?
 And
 I
 think
 the
 best


businesses
 figure
 that
 out.
 But
 I
 think


as
 companies
 scale
 and
 you
 get
 bigger,


there's
 more
 complexity
 in
 terms
 of
 the


people
 side
 of
 things.
 So
 we
 always


start
 with
 people,
 you
 know,
 do
 we
 have


the
 right
 people
 in
 the
 right
 seats?
 Do


we
 have
 the
 right
 culture?
 Do
 we
 have


the
 right
 engagement?
 Do
 we
 have
 the


right
 talent
 development
 and
 talent


management?
 Is
 we
 think
 about


businesses?
 You
 can
 really
 enhance
 a


business
 by
 focusing
 on
 the
 people
 and


the
 foundation.
 We
 focus
 there
 first.
 We


focus
 on
 purpose
 second.
 What's
 the


purpose
 of
 the
 business?
 What's
 the


difference
 we
 make
 in
 the
 world?
 Are
 we


aligned
 around
 that?
 What's
 the
 strategy


to
 go
 execute
 that
 purpose
 and
 impact?


And
 then
 we
 think
 about
 performance


third.
 And
 so
 then
 we
 say,
 okay,
 how
 do


we
 actually
 achieve
 those
 goals?
 How
 do


we
 drive
 alignment
 and
 accountability?


And
 how
 do
 we
 focus
 on
 purpose?
 I
 think


if
 you
 start
 by
 focusing
 on
 performance,


then
 I
 think
 you
 miss
 out
 on
 really


these
 foundation
 settings
 which
 are
 so


critical
 to
 get
 alignment
 and
 to
 drive


ultimately
 the
 most
 value
 in
 businesses.


>> That's
 another
 thing
 that
 people
 just


throw
 out
 casually.
 People
 are
 our
 most


valuable
 asset.
 But
 it's
 so
 easy
 to
 say


those
 words
 and
 so
 hard
 to
 live
 that


because
 that
 means
 investing
 in
 your


people.
 It
 means
 probably
 lowering
 your


margins
 at
 certain
 points
 in
 time.
 It's


taking
 a
 disciplined
 approach
 to
 how
 we


think
 about
 people.
 So
 it's
 not
 just
 you


know
 how
 do
 I
 reward
 people
 more
 or
 you


know
 how
 do
 we
 have
 more
 you
 know


holiday
 parties
 or
 whatever
 it
 may.
 It's


actually
 taking
 a
 structured
 disciplined


approach.
 We
 always
 say
 with
 our


companies
 typically
 businesses
 have
 a


structured
 view
 to
 thinking
 about


strategy
 or
 KPIs
 or
 budgeting.
 They
 have


a
 calendar.
 they
 have
 you
 know


discipline
 and
 a
 pro
 approach
 to
 that.


We
 often
 say
 where's
 your
 people


calendar?
 What
 is
 your
 same
 level
 of


discipline
 approach
 you
 have
 on
 people


because
 you
 should
 have
 the
 same
 and
 we


put
 it
 in
 three
 buckets.
 You
 know
 how
 do


we
 attract
 the
 right
 talent?
 So
 that's


everything
 from
 you
 know
 hiring
 to


employer
 value
 proposition
 to
 what
 are


the
 most
 critical
 roles
 to
 get
 the
 right


people
 in.
 So
 on
 the
 attract
 bucket
 how


do
 we
 develop
 talent?
 Are
 we
 thinking


about
 where
 people
 are
 going
 in
 their


careers?
 Are
 we
 helping
 them
 get
 there?


How
 are
 we
 thinking
 about
 that?
 And
 then


engagement.
 Are
 we
 engaging
 our
 talent?


Are
 we
 thinking
 about
 the
 culture?
 Are


we
 thinking
 about
 incentives?
 Are
 we


thinking
 about
 communication?
 And
 how


are
 we
 doing
 that
 most
 effectively
 to


support
 the
 the
 whole
 organization?
 The


whole
 people
 framework
 is
 so
 significant


in
 terms
 of
 what
 you
 can
 do
 in
 an


organization,
 but
 it
 usually
 is
 an


afterthought.
 If
 you
 look
 at
 executive


teams,
 usually
 in
 mid-size
 companies,


there
 may
 not
 even
 be
 an
 HR
 leader.
 if


they
 are
 it's
 a
 more
 junior
 level


generalist
 type
 person
 versus
 a
 true


talent
 partner.
 And
 so
 that
 weight
 all


falls
 on
 usually
 the
 CEO
 to
 navigate
 it.


But
 that's
 a
 lot
 when
 you're
 trying
 to


navigate
 everything.
 And
 as
 you're


scaling,
 it
 becomes
 more
 and
 more


important
 because
 when
 you're
 small,


everyone
 is
 close
 to
 the
 CEO.
 They
 see


it.
 They
 feel
 the
 culture.
 They
 see
 the


work
 ethic
 and
 discipline.
 as
 you
 get


bigger,
 you
 need
 to
 sort
 of
 step
 away


and
 have
 more
 of
 a
 system
 and
 a


structure
 that
 allows
 for
 that
 to


continue
 because
 not
 everyone's
 going
 to


be
 sitting,
 you
 know,


shoulder-to-shoulder
 with
 the
 CEO.


>> How
 do
 you
 evaluate
 talent?


>> Yeah.
 So,
 we
 do
 a
 few
 things
 within
 our


businesses
 as
 we
 think
 about
 talent.


When
 we
 go
 into
 a
 new
 business,
 first
 of


all,
 we
 really
 try
 to
 understand
 what


are
 the
 mission
 critical
 roles
 in
 this


business.
 We
 find
 most
 mid-size


companies
 have
 between
 15
 and
 30
 roles


that
 are
 the
 most
 critical
 roles
 to
 get


right.
 And
 these
 are
 the
 ones
 that
 are


creating
 the
 most
 value.
 Each
 business,


it
 may
 be
 slightly
 different.
 It
 may
 be


sales
 in
 one
 business.
 It
 may
 be
 product


development
 in
 another.
 It
 may
 be


finance
 in
 another
 depending
 on
 what


they're
 doing
 and
 how
 they
 approach.
 But


do
 we
 really
 have
 clarity
 in
 what
 those


are?
 Do
 we
 have
 the
 right
 capabilities?


Sometimes
 you
 might
 have
 a
 mission


critical
 role
 that
 you
 don't
 have
 today


that
 you
 need
 the
 capabilities.
 So
 my


example
 earlier
 of
 Pamper
 Chef
 like
 when


I
 started
 a
 mission
 critical
 role
 for
 us


was
 technology.
 we
 did
 not
 have
 those


capabilities
 in
 terms
 of
 what
 we
 needed


to
 go
 do
 and
 so
 we
 had
 to
 build
 it.
 But


really
 assessing
 what
 are
 the
 mission


critical
 roles
 that
 we
 have
 and
 then


once
 we
 do
 that
 we
 assess
 okay
 who
 do
 we


have
 in
 those
 roles
 today?
 Are
 they
 rock


stars?
 Are
 there
 people
 who
 have
 you


know
 um
 a
 lot
 of
 opportunity
 in
 terms
 of


their
 progression
 or
 are
 they
 people
 who


are
 okay
 today
 but
 maybe
 aren't
 the


right
 people
 longer
 term.
 So
 we
 try
 to


really
 assess
 that
 in
 a
 disciplined
 way.


I
 find
 the
 best
 way
 is
 you
 go
 in
 and


with
 someone
 and
 I
 can
 usually
 send
 I


usually
 send
 like
 a
 list
 of
 questions


that
 are
 um
 I
 usually
 have
 a
 few


different
 frameworks
 but
 industry


questions,
 company
 questions,
 department


questions,
 you
 questions
 and
 I
 ask
 those


different
 questions
 and
 what
 I
 find
 is


you
 can
 usually
 get
 someone's
 sort
 of


assessment
 and
 understanding
 and
 their


view
 of
 a
 world
 pretty
 effectively
 by


just
 talking
 to
 them
 about
 what
 they're


seeing.
 And
 then
 that
 helps
 us
 learn
 and


get
 better
 about
 the
 business
 as
 well.


So
 that's
 you
 typically
 when
 we
 go
 into


business
 and
 what
 we
 do
 once
 we're
 in
 a


business
 then
 we
 really
 focus
 okay
 how


do
 we
 develop
 our
 talent
 and
 so
 we're


using
 different
 conversations
 and


different
 processes
 along
 the
 way
 to


really
 make
 sure
 that
 we're
 aligned
 in


doing
 that.
 For
 us
 it
 starts
 with
 do
 we


goal
 set
 at
 the
 beginning
 of
 the
 year?


Do
 we
 have
 clear
 KPIs?
 Because
 how
 do


you
 assess
 people
 if
 you
 don't
 have


clear
 KPIs?
 And
 so
 you
 have
 KPIs
 of
 what


are
 we
 going
 to
 go
 achieve
 and
 then
 you


give
 people
 the
 flexibility
 to
 go


achieve
 those.
 You
 don't
 tell
 them
 how


to
 achieve
 them.
 You
 say
 okay
 you
 have


the
 autonomy
 to
 go
 achieve
 these
 but
 you


give
 them
 the
 skills.
 So
 we
 do
 problem


solving
 training.
 We
 help
 support
 them


so
 that
 they're
 more
 equipped
 to


actually
 go
 achieve
 those
 goals
 and
 you


know
 they
 have
 visibility
 and
 then
 they


have
 the
 alignment.
 We're
 all
 going
 in


this
 direction.
 These
 are
 the
 most


important
 KPIs.
 And
 then
 we
 incorporate


conversations
 or
 feedback
 where
 we're


actually
 giving
 real-time
 feedback
 on


hey
 you
 did
 this
 really
 well.
 this
 is


what
 we
 could
 do
 better.
 And
 then


through
 that,
 you're
 implementing
 a


talent
 management
 process.
 And
 then


alongside
 of
 that,
 you're
 doing
 a


leadership
 development
 process
 where


you're
 identifying
 your
 leaders,
 you're


helping
 them
 understand
 the
 vision,
 the


expectations,
 the
 strategy.
 Ultimately,


they're
 helping
 shape
 that
 strategy.
 So


it's
 a
 very
 sort
 of
 structured
 way
 of


say
 how
 do
 we
 bring
 in
 people
 at
 the


right
 stages
 at
 the
 right
 time
 to
 really


help
 them
 enhance
 their
 own
 development,


their
 own
 learning,
 their
 own


contributions
 so
 that
 we
 can
 leverage


their
 expertise
 and
 their
 their
 insights


even
 more
 critically.


>> Are
 there
 tells
 in
 those
 interviews
 that


you're
 doing
 with
 people
 that
 maybe


they're
 not
 the
 right
 fit
 for
 where


you're
 going
 or
 that
 this
 person
 isn't


as
 good
 as
 you
 thought
 they
 were
 going


in?
 I
 would
 say
 um
 the
 biggest
 tell
 I
 I


say
 is
 called
 handwaving
 where
 you're


talking
 to
 someone
 about
 something,
 you


ask
 a
 question
 and
 rather
 than
 answering


the
 question,
 they
 sort
 of
 go
 all
 over.


They're
 sort
 of
 hand
 waving
 around
 or


you
 start
 to
 drill
 in
 more
 and
 the


handwaving
 begins
 where
 they
 can't


really
 understand
 or
 explain
 it.


Typically,
 people
 who
 really
 know
 their


craft
 and
 know
 their
 business
 and
 know


the
 fundamentals
 can
 really
 explain
 why


we
 do
 certain
 things,
 why
 we
 don't.
 They


may
 not
 have
 all
 the
 skills
 to
 go
 fix


it,
 but
 they
 understand
 what
 the
 issues


are
 and
 what
 the
 problems
 are.
 And
 then


our
 goal
 is
 to
 help
 them
 understand,


okay,
 this
 is
 how
 we
 can
 go
 address
 that


or
 solve
 it.
 But
 that
 usually
 is
 you
 the


biggest
 tell
 for
 me
 of
 um
 is
 can
 they


get
 clear?
 Can
 they
 get
 crisp?
 Do
 they


really
 understand
 what's
 going
 on
 in


their
 space?
 And
 it
 doesn't
 mean
 they


need
 to
 understand
 everything
 in
 the


business.
 You
 they
 need
 to
 understand


the
 area
 that
 they're
 responsible
 for.
 I


find
 oftentimes
 the
 best
 people
 just


have
 a
 natural
 interest,
 curiosity
 to


solve
 the
 issues
 or
 they'll
 have
 views


on
 things
 even
 outside
 of
 their
 area.


You
 know,
 if
 one
 of the
 questions
 I'll


often
 times
 ask
 is
 like,
 what
 are
 we
 not


doing
 that
 we
 should
 be?
 And
 people


often
 times
 will
 say
 stuff
 in
 their


area,
 but
 oftentimes
 they'll
 have
 stuff


in
 other
 areas
 too
 that
 hey,
 I
 really


thought
 if
 we,
 you
 know,
 could
 focus


more
 on
 selling
 to
 our
 customers


digitally
 that
 would
 allow
 us
 to


transform
 the
 business
 and
 we're
 not


doing
 that
 today.
 you
 things
 like
 that


help
 me
 sort
 of
 see
 do
 they
 have
 you


just
 that
 innate
 engagement
 or


excitement
 about
 the
 business
 and


curiosity.


>> I
 like
 that
 a
 lot.
 I
 think
 as
 you
 were


saying
 that
 what
 came
 to
 mind
 for
 me
 was


the
 ability
 to
 talk
 at
 different


resolutions


>> from
 like
 the
 1
 in
 level
 to
 the
 30,000


ft
 and
 then
 transcend
 the
 same
 problem.


>> For
 me
 and
 my
 role
 um
 it's
 understanding


where
 are
 we
 in
 that
 conversation
 and


who
 am
 I
 talking
 to?
 how
 do
 we
 get
 to


that
 level
 and
 what's
 the
 right
 level?


And
 I
 find
 that
 people
 who
 are
 on
 the


front
 line
 may
 not
 have
 the
 30,000
 view


on
 where
 we're
 going
 in
 the
 business,


but
 they're
 going
 to
 be
 really
 good
 at


that
 10-ft
 view
 and
 understanding
 the


problem
 that
 they're
 trying
 to
 solve
 or


the
 what's
 limiting
 them
 or
 holding
 them


back.
 So
 really
 sort
 of
 figuring
 out


what's
 the
 right
 level
 to
 have
 that


conversation.


>> How
 do
 you
 go
 about
 finding
 companies?


You've
 acquired
 a
 few
 now.


>> We
 find
 areas
 that
 we
 like.
 So
 we
 say
 if


we
 want
 to
 go
 fishing,
 we
 want
 to
 find
 a


pond
 with
 a
 lot
 of
 great
 fish.
 And
 so
 we


want
 to
 understand
 what
 is
 an
 industry


that
 we
 think
 has
 a
 strong
 mode
 or


competitive
 advantage
 and
 we
 usually


look
 at
 that
 by
 saying
 okay
 what
 are
 the


returns
 on
 capital
 in
 the
 space.
 So


quantitatively
 can
 we
 see
 if
 there
 is
 a


moat
 and
 then
 qualitatively
 can
 we


understand
 the
 moat
 more
 effectively?


How
 wide
 is
 the
 moat?
 Uh
 is
 it
 getting


wider
 or
 more
 narrow
 over
 time?
 Is
 it


durable?
 Like
 is
 it
 going
 to
 withstand


the
 test
 of
 time?
 And
 so
 we're
 trying
 to


sort
 of
 find
 those
 spaces.
 Once
 we
 find


industries
 that
 we
 think
 are
 a
 fit


there,
 we
 spend
 a
 fair
 amount
 of
 time


reaching
 out
 to
 businesses,
 finding


businesses,
 getting
 introduced
 to


businesses.
 We
 have
 operating
 advisors


who
 help
 us
 understand
 as
 well.
 And
 then


we
 really
 try
 to
 get
 smart
 and
 find
 how


do
 we
 add
 value
 in
 these
 companies.
 And


then
 another
 group
 of
 businesses
 we
 have


are
 just
 people
 who
 come
 to
 us,
 people


who
 hear
 about
 what
 we're
 doing,
 who
 are


excited.
 And
 so
 they'll
 come
 to
 us
 and


say,
 "Are
 you
 interested
 in
 my


business?"
 Um,
 which
 we
 appreciate.
 And


we
 always
 have
 the
 same
 assessment
 of


you
 know
 what's
 the
 mode
 of
 the
 business


you
 know
 quantitatively
 qualitatively


can
 we
 assess
 it
 and
 then
 how
 do
 we


think
 about
 those
 areas
 and
 what
 we've


also
 done
 is
 we
 have
 built
 a
 community


of
 3,000
 CEOs
 owners
 and
 founders
 that


we
 bring
 together
 to
 provide
 content
 and


resources
 and
 support
 and
 through
 that


we
 learn
 about
 new
 businesses
 we
 learn


new
 spaces
 which
 help
 us
 also
 be
 better


in
 terms
 of
 finding
 businesses
 that


might
 be
 a
 fit
 for
 us.
 We
 only
 invest
 in


one
 or
 two
 companies
 a
 year.
 We'll
 look


at
 500.
 So
 we're
 really
 selective
 at


finding
 the
 highest
 quality
 businesses


that
 have
 a
 long
 runway.


>> Is
 that
 the
 most
 important
 part
 of
 the


process
 evaluating
 the
 moat?


>> We
 call
 the
 five
 M
 that
 we
 look
 at.


First
 is
 moat.
 You
 know,
 what
 is
 the


moat?
 What's
 the
 competitive
 advantage?


Second
 is
 the
 market.
 You
 may
 have
 a


moat,
 but
 is
 the
 market
 growing
 and
 do


we
 think
 it's
 an
 attractive
 market?
 What


is
 the
 growth
 rate?
 What
 are
 the
 likely


dynamics
 of
 that?
 Third,
 we
 look
 at


management.
 Does
 it
 have
 a
 strong


management
 team
 today?
 Or
 is
 it


something
 where
 we
 think
 we
 can
 help


build
 the
 management
 team
 if
 there's


opportunities?
 Sometimes
 they'll
 be
 a


great
 business.
 It's
 got
 three
 strong


leaders,
 but
 they
 need
 to
 build
 out
 a


sales
 leader
 or
 a
 talent
 leader
 or


finance
 leader.
 We
 can
 we
 help
 them
 do


that?
 The
 fourth
 is
 what
 we
 call
 more


potential
 and
 there's
 some
 opportunity


that's
 not
 being
 fully
 leveraged
 today


that
 we
 think
 we
 can
 help
 them
 with.
 It


might
 be
 expanding
 into
 new
 markets.
 It


might
 be
 a
 more
 structured
 approach
 to


how
 they
 manage
 the
 business
 today.


There
 are
 a
 variety
 of
 different
 avenues


in
 terms
 of
 more
 potential
 but


absolutely
 a
 focus.
 And
 then
 for
 us
 the


fifth
 is
 margin
 of
 safety.
 And
 what
 we


mean
 by
 margin
 of
 safety
 is
 we
 don't


want
 to
 have
 have
 to
 have
 everything
 go


perfectly
 right
 in
 order
 for
 us
 to
 be


successful.
 We
 want
 to
 have
 a
 little
 bit


of
 flex
 so
 that
 if
 there
 is
 something


like
 COVID
 or
 a
 downturn
 or
 tariffs
 that


we
 can
 navigate
 that
 well
 with
 the


management
 team
 and
 we
 don't
 put
 undue


pressure
 on
 the
 business
 to
 make
 shorter


term
 decisions
 because
 of
 something


that's
 happening
 that
 may
 be
 outside
 of


our
 control.


>> What
 does
 moat
 mean?


>> For
 us
 moat
 is
 what
 we
 consider
 you
 a


competitive
 advantage.
 And
 the
 simple


example
 of
 like
 why
 a
 moat
 is
 it's
 a


castle,
 right?
 Do
 you
 have
 a
 castle
 that


is
 a
 strong
 business?
 And
 then
 the
 moat


you
 want
 to
 have
 around
 is
 what
 defends


the
 castle
 and
 what
 is
 going
 to
 protect


the
 castle.
 A
 wide
 moat
 is
 going
 to


protect
 a
 castle
 more.
 A
 narrow
 moat
 is


going
 to
 protect
 it
 less.
 A
 moat
 can
 be


driven
 by
 different
 dynamics.
 It
 might


be
 you
 have
 a
 brand
 and
 a
 channel
 that


in
 combination
 allow
 you
 to
 sort
 of
 keep


customers
 out
 of
 your
 business.
 You


might
 have
 a
 competitive
 position
 that


allows
 you
 to
 be
 the
 lowcost
 provider


that
 then
 allows
 you
 to
 sort
 of
 attract


customers
 and
 get
 route
 density
 in
 your


market
 and
 then
 drive
 down
 prices


further
 and
 costs
 further
 which
 then


allow
 you
 to
 attract
 more
 customers
 and


that
 will
 keep
 other
 people
 out
 of
 your


business.
 There's
 lots
 of
 different


types
 of
 moes.
 There's
 network
 effect.


There's
 limited
 supplier
 power
 customer


sort
 of
 concentration
 that
 can
 limit
 or


expand
 your
 moat.
 But
 we're
 really


focusing
 on
 how
 do
 we
 build
 a
 business


that
 keeps
 competitors
 or
 new
 entrance


out
 as
 effectively
 as
 possible.
 We
 find


that
 modes
 are
 changing
 every
 day
 and


some
 businesses
 that
 used
 to
 have


amazing
 modes
 like
 newspapers
 now
 have


eroded
 quite
 considerably
 and
 there's


other
 businesses
 where
 the
 modes
 are


getting
 stronger.
 So
 trying
 to
 find


those
 businesses
 where
 we
 think
 we
 can


expand
 the
 moat.


>> Where
 do
 you
 think
 modes
 are
 getting


stronger?
 It's
 hard,
 you
 know,
 in
 the


moment
 to
 look
 and
 say
 this
 mood
 is


getting
 stronger
 because
 typically
 it's


easier
 to
 look
 back
 over
 the
 course
 of


10
 years.
 The
 mode
 has
 gotten
 better
 or


gotten
 worse.
 I
 think
 AI
 is
 a
 good


example
 of
 that
 probably
 will
 erode
 a


lot
 of
 modes
 in
 a
 lot
 of
 industries
 and


businesses
 because
 it
 reduces
 the


friction
 or
 the
 cost
 for
 a
 new
 entrant


to
 come
 in
 and
 you
 they
 can
 navigate
 the


space
 more
 effectively.
 I
 do
 think
 there


probably
 will
 be
 a
 subset
 of
 businesses


where
 AI
 actually
 makes
 their
 moat


stronger
 and
 because
 they
 already
 have


some
 sort
 of
 structured
 system
 that
 is


allowing
 them
 to
 have
 a
 competitive


advantage
 and
 so
 it
 might
 be
 you
 know


maybe
 they've
 built
 out
 a
 salesforce


with
 a
 technician
 base
 that
 is
 hard
 to


replicate
 and
 for
 someone
 else
 to
 come


into
 that
 and
 now
 AI
 allows
 them
 to


quote
 more
 effectively
 or
 reduce
 their


cost
 or
 improve
 their
 productivity
 so


that
 then
 their
 costs
 go
 down
 and
 if


their
 costs
 go
 down
 then
 they
 can
 pass


that
 on
 to
 the
 customer
 and
 sort
 of


cycle
 that
 into
 keeping
 more
 customers


more
 effectively.
 I
 think
 it
 probably
 is


a
 little
 early
 in
 the
 context
 of
 AI
 to


see,
 okay,
 who's
 going
 to
 be
 the
 biggest


winner,
 who's
 going to
 be
 the
 biggest


loser
 because
 it's
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 of


a
 crapshoot
 at
 this
 stage.
 I'd
 say


>> I've
 been
 thinking
 about
 that
 a
 little


bit
 recently.
 There's
 a
 lot
 of
 service


businesses
 where
 AI
 could
 with
 somebody


with
 a
 background
 with
 AI
 who
 has
 a


reflexive
 AI
 mindset
 could
 come
 in
 and


probably
 lower
 costs
 and
 create
 a


temporary
 advantage
 over
 the
 next
 I


don't
 know
 3
 to
 5
 years
 but
 then
 you


could
 use
 that
 to
 create
 this
 flywheel


of
 pricing
 power
 with
 customers
 in
 the


sense
 of
 giving
 better
 pricing
 so
 you're


always
 booked
 but
 also
 in
 terms
 of
 oh
 we


can
 acquire
 businesses
 at
 the
 same


multiple
 and
 get
 a
 way
 better
 return


than
 other
 people.


>> Yeah.
 And
 I
 think
 probably
 the
 biggest


question
 on
 my
 mind
 is,
 you
 know,
 how


temporary
 is
 it
 and
 how
 quick
 is
 it?


Will
 just
 it'll
 be
 a
 race
 to
 the
 bottom


where
 now
 prices
 will
 just
 go
 down
 and


then
 other
 entrance
 will
 come
 into
 the


market
 and
 it'll
 the
 customers
 will


capture
 the
 value
 versus
 the
 companies


or
 do
 you
 already
 have
 a
 moat
 or
 can
 you


build
 a
 moat
 um
 in
 a
 in
 a
 time
 where
 it


actually
 allows
 you
 to
 sustain
 it
 and


then
 you
 ultimately
 get
 a
 stronger


business
 and
 that's
 I
 think
 is


interesting.
 We're
 spending
 some
 time


thinking
 about
 that
 as
 well
 and


especially
 in
 the
 service
 businesses
 and


I
 think
 there
 are
 some
 that
 it's
 just


harder
 for
 new
 entrant
 to
 come
 in.
 If


it's
 a
 regulated
 space
 where
 you
 have
 to


get
 credentialed
 in
 and
 there's
 limited


number
 of
 credentials
 that's
 harder
 for


someone
 to
 come
 in.
 If
 it's
 you
 you
 have


a
 huge
 salesforce
 or
 a
 service
 um
 force


that's
 going
 out
 and
 implementing
 and


supporting
 your
 customers.
 That's
 harder


for
 someone
 else
 to
 come
 and
 replicate.


Not
 impossible
 but
 harder.
 And
 so
 do
 you


have
 that
 aspect
 of
 your
 mode
 already


that
 you
 can
 reinforce
 and
 what
 does


that
 look
 like?
 But
 I
 think
 that


disruption
 is
 coming.
 You
 know,
 it's
 I


think
 it's
 going
 to
 happen
 pretty
 widely


in
 terms
 of
 different
 businesses
 and


industries.
 So
 if
 you
 have
 a
 great


business
 today,
 are
 you
 thinking
 about


that
 and
 can
 you
 reinforce
 your
 mode
 and


make
 it
 stronger?


>> When
 it
 comes
 to
 quantitative
 assessment


of
 these
 businesses,
 what
 are
 you


looking
 at?


>> Yeah,
 in
 essence,
 we're
 looking
 at
 like


a
 return
 on
 invested
 capital.
 Um
 and
 as


we
 think
 about
 that
 is
 it
 going
 up
 is
 it


going
 down
 is
 it
 staying
 the
 same
 do
 we


think
 that
 that
 is
 reasonable
 for
 the


space
 what
 we
 find
 is
 that's
 one
 part
 of


it
 like
 you
 need
 to
 understand
 the


quantitative
 and
 typically
 if
 you
 have
 a


moat
 you
 can
 see
 it
 you
 can
 see
 it
 in


your
 returns
 uh
 in
 the
 business
 on
 what


you're
 doing
 and
 you
 know
 your
 return
 on


capital
 but
 beyond
 the
 quantitative
 is


then
 the
 qualitative
 you
 is
 like
 can
 you


define
 it
 can
 you
 explain
 why
 do
 you


understand
 that
 that
 I
 think
 becomes


more
 important
 because
 if
 you
 looked
 at


the
 newspapers
 I
 would
 say
 once
 the


remote
 started
 to
 erode
 quantitatively


it
 still
 looked
 good
 for
 quite
 a
 period


of
 time
 even
 though
 qualitatively
 it
 was


starting
 to
 erode
 at
 that
 stage
 the


financials
 lagged
 and
 then
 it
 caught
 up


but
 I
 think
 that's
 typically
 what
 we're


trying
 to
 do
 is
 look
 at
 both
 the


quantitative
 and
 the
 qualitative
 side


>> and
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 return
 on
 invested


capital
 what
 is
 that


>> for
 us
 it's
 really
 looking
 at
 you
 know


what's
 the
 earnings
 in
 the
 business
 and


then
 what's
 the
 capital
 required
 in
 the


business
 to
 report
 those
 earnings.
 And


so
 you
 can
 do
 the
 calculation
 and
 get
 a


ratio.
 We
 typically
 say
 like
 an
 okay


business
 is
 maybe
 20%
 return
 on
 capital.


A
 great
 business
 is
 probably
 looking
 at


50%
 plus
 in
 terms
 of
 return
 on
 capital.


>> And
 when
 you
 say
 earnings
 like
 there's
 a


lot
 of
 uh
 ways
 that
 people
 are
 defining


that
 now
 between
 EBITD,
 IBIDA
 uh


operating
 earning
 like
 what
 is
 earnings?


>> We
 usually
 look
 at
 EBIT
 or
 you
 know


earnings
 before
 interest
 and
 taxes.
 Our


view
 on
 sort
 of
 evidas
 there
 are
 some


industries
 where
 it
 makes
 sense
 but
 in


most
 industries
 depreciation


amortization
 is
 real
 and
 so
 if
 you
 focus


on
 that
 I
 think
 you
 sometimes
 um
 give


yourself
 false
 confidence
 in
 terms
 of


what
 the
 business
 really
 looks
 like
 and


what
 it
 really
 generates
 because
 in


essence
 you're
 trying
 to
 get
 a
 proxy
 for


cash
 cash
 flow
 and
 cash
 generation.
 So


when
 we
 look
 at
 it,
 we'll
 look
 usually


look
 at
 EBIT
 as
 sort
 of
 an
 earnings


approach
 and
 then
 we'll
 um
 focus
 in


terms
 of
 what's
 the
 capital
 in
 the


business.
 But
 earnings
 we
 usually
 define


as
 EBIT.
 In
 some
 cases
 we'll
 look
 at
 EBI


but
 we
 try
 to
 be
 pretty
 selective
 of
 how


we
 do
 that
 in
 the
 industries
 where


depreciation
 amortization
 are
 real.


>> And
 how
 are
 you
 defining
 capital?
 Is


that
 just
 equity?


>> In
 capital
 we're
 looking
 at
 a
 few


different
 things.
 What's
 the
 capital


actually
 required
 in
 the
 business?
 So


what
 you're
 putting
 into
 it,
 you
 your


PP&E,
 if
 you
 need
 like
 lots
 of
 AR
 to


support
 your
 business,
 really
 trying
 to


fundamentally
 understand
 what
 capital
 is


required
 uh
 to
 support
 this
 business,


what
 inventory
 is
 required
 to
 support


the
 business.
 Uh,
 every
 business
 is
 a


little
 bit
 different,
 but
 there
 might
 be


a
 business
 where
 the
 earnings
 look


really
 great,
 but
 then
 they
 have
 a
 huge


inventory
 on
 their
 balance
 sheet
 to


support
 that
 that
 level
 of
 uh,
 earnings.


And
 then
 that
 business
 is
 probably
 a


little
 less
 like
 a
 less
 good
 business


because
 you
 have
 to
 have
 this,
 you
 know,


inventory
 to
 support
 it.
 And
 that


sometimes
 may
 be
 you
 have
 a
 lot
 of


locations,
 so
 you
 need
 to
 have


facilities
 with
 all
 the
 inventory.
 It


may
 be
 your
 customers
 require
 you
 to


have
 a
 lot
 of
 inventory
 to
 support
 the


business.
 There's
 a
 lot
 of
 different


dynamics
 that
 um
 you
 play
 into
 that,
 but


we're
 really
 trying
 to
 understand
 what


capital
 is
 required
 to
 support
 the
 level


of
 earnings
 that
 you
 have
 in
 this


business.
 Your
 best
 businesses
 usually


don't
 require
 a
 lot
 of
 capital.
 There


are
 caveats
 to
 that
 too.
 I
 mean,
 you
 you


can
 get
 a
 higher
 return
 on
 capital,
 but


also
 potentially
 someone
 can
 enter
 the


business
 more
 quickly
 if
 you
 don't
 have


capital
 in
 the
 business.
 If
 you
 have


capital
 in
 your
 business,
 that's
 usually


harder
 for
 someone
 to
 enter,
 but
 you
 can


get
 other
 types
 of
 modes
 or
 impacts.
 Um,


and
 I
 think
 you're
 seeing
 a
 shift
 in


this.
 If
 you
 look
 at
 the
 tech


businesses,
 historically,
 there
 wasn't
 a


lot
 of
 capital
 required.
 Google
 or


others,
 they
 had
 network
 effect
 and


these
 other
 dynamics
 that
 drove
 the


moat.
 And
 so,
 you
 didn't
 have
 capital.


Now
 with
 AI,
 that's
 shifting
 quite


considerably.
 Um,
 but
 also
 that
 probably


makes
 it
 harder
 for
 someone
 else
 to
 come


into
 the
 business
 as
 well.


>> And
 when
 you
 look
 at
 market,
 what
 makes


an
 attractive
 market?


>> So,
 when
 we
 look
 at
 market,
 you
 we're


looking
 for
 a
 few
 things.
 One
 is
 what's


it
 growing?
 What's
 the
 growth
 rate
 in


it?
 Is
 it
 growing
 at
 GDP?
 Is
 it
 growing


above
 GDP?
 Do
 we
 think
 that
 that's


sustaining?
 You
 know,
 there
 might
 be
 a


situation
 where
 the
 business
 is
 growing


very
 the
 industry
 or
 the
 market's


growing
 very
 fast
 right
 now,
 but
 you're


it's
 going
 to
 decline
 over
 the
 next
 5


years
 or
 no,
 we
 think
 it's
 going
 to


continue
 to
 grow
 at
 20%
 plus
 a
 year
 for


10
 plus
 years.
 So,
 trying
 to
 understand


what
 the
 growth
 rate
 is.
 How's
 it
 relate


to
 GDP?
 Second,
 we're
 trying
 to


understand
 what
 are
 the
 dynamics
 of
 the


market.
 Um,
 is
 it
 a
 situation
 where


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 fragmented
 players?
 Is


there,
 you
 know,
 a
 couple
 behemoths?
 um


is
 it
 one
 where
 um
 there's
 opportunity


for
 consolidation
 or
 not?
 We're
 trying


to
 just
 understand
 what
 the
 dynamics
 are


and
 sort
 of
 how
 it
 works.
 Are
 the
 other


players
 in
 the
 market
 rational
 if
 it's


you
 know
 more
 concentrated?
 Um
 what
 are


how
 do
 we
 think
 about
 the
 path
 forward


and
 what
 that
 might
 look
 like
 and
 where


do
 we
 think
 we
 would
 play
 in
 that
 market


and
 what
 do
 we
 think
 the
 path
 forward


would
 be.
 Um
 but
 we're
 first
 starting


with
 sort
 of
 growth
 rate
 and
 dynamics.


We've
 already
 talked
 a
 little
 bit
 about


management
 and
 I
 I
 think
 most
 of
 our


listeners
 will
 understand
 a
 little
 bit


of
 margins
 of
 safety
 enough
 for
 the


conversation.
 Anyway,
 what
 did
 you
 mean


by
 more
 potential?
 Is
 that
 like
 a


lottery
 ticket?


>> No,
 it's
 less
 of a
 lottery
 ticket,
 but


really
 like
 where's
 the
 opportunity
 to


sort
 of
 grow
 this
 business
 and
 what
 does


it
 look
 like?
 So,
 for
 example,
 we


partnered
 with
 a
 company
 Marine
 Concepts


sells
 boat
 covers.
 Now,
 when
 we


partnered
 with
 the
 company,
 it
 was


started
 by
 drumman
 Randy
 Kent
 based
 out


of
 Lake
 of
 the
 Ozarks.
 He
 had
 a
 facility


and
 a
 market
 in
 Lake
 of
 the Ozarks.
 He


had
 great
 market
 share
 there,
 great
 NPS.


The
 product
 was
 incredibly
 um
 you
 know


strong.
 He
 had
 moved
 a
 little
 bit
 and


sold
 some
 in
 Florida,
 but
 really
 he


hadn't
 expanded
 beyond
 that.
 So
 the
 more


potential
 there
 was
 can
 we
 take
 this


company
 that
 has
 a
 great
 product,
 has
 a


great
 reputation,
 great
 NPS,
 great


margins
 and
 expand
 it.
 And
 in
 this
 case


we
 wanted
 to
 build
 out
 a
 dealer
 network.


So
 can
 we
 expand
 that
 through
 a
 dealer


network
 and
 growth?
 So
 that
 was
 the
 more


potential
 in
 that
 business
 was
 how
 do
 we


expand
 it
 and
 doing
 something
 that


they're
 not
 doing
 today
 versus
 a


business
 where
 you
 may
 come
 in
 and
 it's


already
 at
 full
 potential
 right
 the


business
 is
 operating
 super
 well
 not
 as


many
 growth
 drivers
 or
 growth


opportunities
 left
 where
 what
 are
 you


going
 to
 go
 do
 like
 it's
 growing
 at
 GDP


probably
 like
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 hard
 to


really
 go
 accelerate
 growth
 in
 coke


whereas
 for
 us
 u
 playing
 in
 the
 mid-size


market
 there's
 a
 lot
 more
 opportunity
 or


JM
 test
 that
 was
 a
 40-year-old
 business


that
 we
 partnered
 with
 family
 business


started
 ed
 by
 the
 Morrison
 family
 grew


20%
 a
 year
 over
 the
 last
 20
 years
 in


sort
 of
 tent
 branches
 and
 regions
 today


but
 an
 opportunity
 to
 move
 in


geographically
 into
 new
 regions
 increase


penetration
 in
 our
 existing
 markets
 and


then
 three
 look
 at
 potential


acquisitions
 for
 other
 family
 businesses


that
 want
 a
 long-term
 partner
 and
 so
 for


us
 that
 was
 the
 more
 potential
 in
 that


business
 so
 each
 business
 is
 a
 bit


different
 but
 really
 understanding


what's
 not
 being
 sort
 of
 fully
 optimized


today
 we
 always
 start
 with
 sort
 of
 our


purpose
 which
 is
 helping
 organizations


and
 people
 reach
 their
 full
 potential.


And
 so
 as
 we
 think
 about
 a
 new


partnership,
 how
 do
 we
 think
 about
 what


that
 full
 potential
 may
 be?
 And
 then


what's
 what's
 the
 opportunity
 for
 us
 to


help
 get
 help
 them
 get
 there?
 And
 do
 we


bring
 some
 sort
 of
 skill
 set,


experience,
 perspective
 that
 can
 help


accelerate
 that?


>> And
 when
 you
 look
 at
 sort
 of
 the


potential,
 does
 that
 factor
 into
 the


margin
 of
 safety
 or
 no,
 that's
 like
 in


addition
 to
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 a
 margin


of
 safety
 anyway.
 This
 is
 more
 like
 an


added
 layer
 to
 that.
 I
 think
 if
 we
 think


of
 this
 as
 like
 a
 growth
 potential,
 but


it
 may
 contribute
 to
 margins
 of
 safety.


If
 we
 said,
 you
 know,
 if
 this
 business


will
 work
 at
 this
 valuation,
 even
 if
 we


don't
 do
 anything
 and
 then
 we're
 able
 to


go
 drive
 this
 growth,
 then
 that
 gives
 us


more
 comfort
 and
 the
 margin
 of
 safety


and
 where
 where
 we
 are.
 But
 um
 they
 can


be
 interconnected,
 but
 it's
 not


necessarily
 have
 to
 be.


>> And
 so
 what
 happens?
 What's
 the
 playbook


post
 close?
 So
 you
 you've
 found
 a


company,
 you
 love
 the
 management
 team,


you
 love
 the
 people,
 it's
 in
 a
 great


market,
 you
 think
 there's
 potential
 for


more.
 Day
 one,
 now
 what?


>> Actually,
 before
 even
 day
 one,
 like
 when


we
 close,
 during
 the
 process
 where
 we're


getting
 to
 know
 each
 other,
 we're
 doing


diligence,
 we're
 sort
 of
 spending
 time


with
 them,
 really
 understanding
 um
 what


are
 their
 views
 on
 the
 industry,
 what


are
 their
 views
 on
 the
 business,
 what


does
 management
 think
 the
 biggest


opportunities
 are.
 We're
 oftentimes


doing
 interviews.
 So
 our
 Camber
 business


system
 team
 will
 spend
 time
 meeting
 with


70
 75
 people
 in
 the
 business
 and


understanding
 where
 they
 think
 the


opportunities
 are
 as
 well.
 So
 we're


doing
 that
 during
 that
 sort
 of
 um


diligence
 process
 going
 up
 to
 the
 close.


Once
 we
 close
 um
 with
 a
 business,
 we're


really
 trying
 to
 understand
 where
 are


they
 on
 their
 own
 journey.
 And
 so
 we


have
 a
 diagnostic
 to
 assess
 on
 all
 these


frameworks,
 people
 you
 attracting


talent,
 developing
 talent,
 engaging


talent,
 strategy,
 KPIs,
 budgets,
 what's


their
 self
 diagnostic
 on
 their
 sort
 of


sophistication
 in
 these
 areas.
 And
 so


they'll
 do
 that
 and
 then
 we'll
 do
 that


and
 then
 we'll
 come
 in
 and
 say,
 okay,


given
 this,
 what
 what
 do
 we
 want
 to
 go


build
 together?
 What
 does
 it
 look
 like?


There's
 a
 few
 sort
 of
 critical


components
 of
 the
 initial
 partnership


that
 we
 do.
 Usually
 it's
 a
 part
 of
 a


strategic
 planning
 process.
 Um
 our
 KBS


team
 will
 come
 in
 and
 work
 with
 the


management
 team
 to
 sort
 of
 really
 think


about
 what's
 the
 future
 direction
 of
 the


business
 and
 what
 are
 the
 opportunities,


what
 are
 we
 doing
 well
 today,
 where
 are


there
 opportunities
 we're
 not,
 you
 know,


doing
 as
 well
 today,
 where
 can
 we
 sort


of
 grow,
 where
 are
 the
 challenges
 facing


the
 business.
 So
 having
 those
 types
 of


conversations
 and
 that
 really
 is
 a


collaborative,
 you
 know,
 hands-on


experience
 that
 we're
 partnering
 with


them
 to
 assess.
 As
 we're
 doing
 that,


we're
 simultaneously
 saying,
 okay,
 do
 we


have
 the
 right
 capabilities?
 Do
 we
 have


the
 right
 roles?
 Do
 we
 have
 the
 right


people
 to
 help
 support
 that
 growth?
 If


we
 say,
 you
 know,
 we
 want
 to
 go
 expand


into
 new
 markets,
 you
 know,
 do
 we
 have


that
 capability?
 Do
 we,
 if
 we
 want
 to
 go


do
 acquisitions,
 do
 we
 have
 that


capability?
 If
 not,
 how
 do
 we
 build
 that


capability
 or
 add
 that
 talent
 internally


that
 allows
 us
 to
 have
 that
 sort
 of


flexibility?
 And
 then
 we're
 really


building
 a
 road
 map
 out
 for
 the
 first
 12


to
 18
 months
 of,
 okay,
 what
 are
 we
 going


to
 go
 do
 together
 and
 what
 does
 that


look
 like?
 We
 uh
 say
 from
 our


perspective,
 you
 know,
 I've
 been
 CEO,
 my


partner's
 been
 CFO.
 We
 don't
 want
 to
 be


the
 CEO
 and
 CFO.
 Again,
 we're
 not
 trying


to
 do
 your
 job.
 We're
 trying
 to
 be
 the


resource
 that
 we
 wanted.
 And
 so,
 we're


being
 helpful
 on
 the
 biggest
 strategic


decisions
 you're
 making
 in
 a
 business


and
 really
 partnering
 with
 them
 and
 then


giving
 them
 feedback
 and
 help
 along
 the


way
 in
 those
 critical
 areas.
 Talk
 to
 me


a
 little
 bit
 more
 about
 that
 in
 in
 the


sense
 of
 you're
 the
 majority
 owner
 now


and
 you
 have
 a
 CEO
 founder
 uh
 who's
 run


the
 company
 successfully
 and
 you're
 not


telling
 them
 what
 to
 do
 but
 you're


nudging
 like
 how
 does
 that
 work?


>> Yeah.
 I
 think
 of
 it as
 like
 co-creation.


So
 they
 have
 a
 view.
 They're
 going
 to
 be


smarter
 about
 the
 industry
 than
 we
 we


ever
 will.
 They'll
 have
 the
 depth
 of


knowledge,
 experience,
 what's
 worked,


what
 hasn't
 worked.
 What
 we'll
 bring
 is


outside
 perspective
 and
 a
 lot
 of


questions.
 And
 so
 we'll
 say,
 "Have
 you


thought
 about
 this
 or
 what
 about
 that?"


Or,
 "Hey,
 there's
 an
 industry
 that's


like
 this
 that
 you
 we've
 seen
 that
 10


years
 ago
 this
 happened
 and
 it
 looks


like
 it
 might
 be
 similar.
 What
 might
 be


similar
 or
 different?"
 So,
 we're
 trying


to
 do
 that
 together
 in
 partnership
 with


them
 so
 that
 we
 can
 co-create
 and
 get
 to


a
 shared
 vision
 of
 the
 world
 and
 what
 we


want
 to
 go
 build
 and
 what
 that
 looks


like.
 And
 so,
 in
 essence,
 we
 think
 of
 it


as
 like
 we're
 their
 strategic
 partner
 in


assessing
 that.
 And
 then
 once
 we've


assessed
 that,
 we
 sort
 of
 come
 in
 and


help
 them
 with
 sort
 of
 the
 skills
 and


frameworks
 to
 go
 do
 it.
 So
 for
 example,


we
 have
 someone
 on
 our
 team
 who
 really


specializes
 in
 sort
 of
 KPIs
 and
 the


budgeting
 process.
 So
 he's
 going
 to
 help


them
 implement
 a
 KPI
 process
 if
 they


don't
 have
 one
 already
 to
 say,
 okay,
 how


do
 you
 build
 KPIs?
 What
 do
 good
 KPIs


look
 like?
 What
 are
 the
 important


drivers
 in
 this
 business?
 What
 are
 the


right
 benchmarks?
 You
 know,
 how


aggressive
 do
 you
 want
 to
 be
 or
 not?
 And


sort
 of
 helping
 them
 think
 through
 that.


on
 the
 budgeting
 or
 we
 sort
 of
 think
 of


it
 as
 resource
 allocation
 side.
 Do
 we


have
 the
 right
 resources
 to
 sort
 of
 fund


our
 future
 growth
 and
 what
 we
 want
 to
 go


do?
 Um
 how
 do
 we
 become
 more
 efficient


in
 in
 some
 areas
 so
 that
 we
 can
 go


invest
 in
 other
 areas?
 So
 we're
 helping


do
 that
 or
 we
 have
 someone
 on
 our
 people


team
 who's
 going
 in
 on
 the
 people
 side


and
 saying
 okay
 we
 understand
 that
 uh
 we


need
 to
 go
 drive
 this
 growth
 in
 the


business.
 We
 want
 to
 drive
 this
 growth.


Okay,
 what
 are
 the
 mission
 critical


roles
 that
 we
 have
 today?
 Do
 we
 have
 the


right
 skills
 in
 those
 roles
 and
 the


right
 people
 in
 those
 roles?
 If
 not,


what
 changes
 might
 we
 need
 to
 make?
 And


then,
 oh
 wow,
 we're
 going
 to
 really
 need


to
 engage
 our
 middle
 level
 management
 if


we're
 going
 to
 go
 grow
 and
 expand.
 Do
 we


have
 the
 right,
 you
 know,
 development


for
 them?
 Okay,
 we
 need
 to
 be


implementing
 quarterly
 director
 days


with
 that
 group
 so
 that
 we
 can
 help
 them


become,
 you
 know,
 better
 leaders
 so
 that


they
 can
 help
 us
 at
 this
 new
 stage
 of


growth.
 or
 you
 know
 perhaps
 we
 haven't


done
 a
 lot
 on
 the
 engagement
 or


communication
 side
 and
 we
 need
 to


implement
 quarterly
 town
 halls
 where


we're
 helping
 the
 company
 understand
 the


vision
 and
 the
 strategy
 and
 direction
 so


that
 we
 can
 help
 accelerate
 growth
 so


that
 everyone
 feels
 they
 understand
 the


vision
 they're
 bought
 into
 what
 we're


trying
 to
 go
 do
 and
 they
 want
 to
 sort
 of


help
 us
 at
 that
 next
 phase


>> and
 when
 you
 say
 KBS
 you
 mean
 the


Kendrick
 business
 system


>> correct


>> and
 these
 are
 all
 the
 components
 of
 it


that
 we're
 talking
 about
 now
 why
 come
 up


with
 a
 repeatable
 system
 and
 is
 it


similar
 to
 the
 Danaher
 one
 or
 different


maybe
 give
 me
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 compare


and
 contrast


>> I
 was
 CEO
 I
 wanted
 to
 go
 out
 and
 learn


from
 others
 and
 what
 I
 found
 was
 some
 of


the
 best
 companies
 out
 there
 have
 a


scalable
 repeatable
 business
 system


Danaher
 Marman
 Toyota
 it
 is
 an


integrated
 way
 of
 how
 they
 manage
 the


business
 so
 that
 it's
 not
 peacemeal
 but


really
 it's
 a
 holistic
 approach
 where


the
 components
 of
 the
 approach
 reinforce


each
 other
 and
 if
 you
 do
 one
 in


isolation
 you
 get
 less
 value
 than
 if
 you


do
 them
 together
 and
 they're


complimentary
 in
 nature.
 And
 so
 you


could
 have
 a
 strategy
 process,
 but
 if


you
 don't
 have
 the
 right
 people
 and
 the


right
 skills,
 you're
 going
 to
 be
 less


effective
 at
 implementing
 that
 strategic


process.
 If
 you
 have
 amazing
 people
 and


a
 great
 culture
 and
 great
 environment,


but
 you
 don't
 have
 KPIs
 and
 alignment,


you're
 not
 going
 to
 be
 able
 to
 achieve


as
 much
 with
 those
 people.
 So
 by
 adding


these
 different
 components
 and
 focusing


on
 what
 matters
 most
 in
 a
 business,
 you


create
 more
 value
 overall.
 And
 I
 think


you
 there's
 amazing
 examples
 Dan
 or
 her


being
 one
 of
 that's
 created
 tremendous


of
 value
 by
 having
 a
 structured


systemized
 way
 of
 managing
 a
 business.


And
 what
 we
 found
 is
 that
 most
 midsize


companies
 they're
 struggling
 with
 the


same
 things.
 How
 do
 I
 get
 the
 right


people
 in
 the
 right
 seats?
 How
 do
 I


build
 the
 right
 culture
 and
 right


engagement?
 How
 do
 I
 get
 the
 right


strategy
 without
 you,
 you
 know,
 paying


Mckenzie
 or
 Bane
 to
 help
 me?
 How
 do
 I
 go


and
 execute
 that
 strategy
 and
 drive


accountability
 and
 action
 into
 the


businesses?
 And
 so
 what
 we're
 trying
 to


do
 is
 saying
 rather
 than
 you
 have
 to
 go


figure
 that
 out,
 we've
 done
 the
 work
 to


say,
 hey,
 here
 are
 the
 structured
 ways


to
 go
 do
 it
 and
 this
 is
 the
 sequencing


that
 works
 for
 where
 you
 are
 in
 your


business
 that
 we
 can
 help
 you
 with.
 And


so
 that
 very
 much
 has
 been
 our
 approach


to
 how
 we
 think
 about
 it
 um
 with
 our


business
 system.
 And
 what
 we
 did
 is
 we


went
 and
 learned
 from
 some
 of those
 best


out
 there
 from
 Danahur,
 from
 Marman,


from
 um
 Constellation
 and
 others
 and


sort
 of
 took
 parts
 of
 each
 that
 we
 liked


where
 we
 thought
 that
 they
 were
 the
 most


successful
 and
 sort
 of
 took
 those
 and


distilled
 them
 into
 our
 own
 business


system.
 Ours
 probably
 has
 more
 of
 a


focus
 on
 people
 um
 and
 culture
 than


others
 do,
 but
 I
 think
 that's
 a
 function


of
 where
 the
 world
 is
 today
 and
 compared


to
 20
 or
 30
 years
 ago
 where
 a
 lot
 of


those
 um
 business
 systems
 were
 started


and
 but
 has
 similar
 approaches
 in
 terms


of
 continuous
 improvement
 or
 strategic


planning
 or
 KPIs
 that
 many
 business


systems
 have
 and
 we
 feel
 like
 you
 know


we're
 standing
 on
 the
 shoulders
 of
 those


giants
 who've
 done
 a
 great
 job
 of


building
 them
 and
 we
 can
 enhance
 them


and
 tailor
 them
 for
 sort
 of
 our
 types
 of


businesses.
 Why
 do
 you
 think
 more
 people


don't
 copy
 the
 Danaher
 business
 system?


I
 mean,
 a
 great
 recent
 example
 of
 that


is
 Larry
 Culp
 using
 it
 to
 turn
 around


GE.


>> Yeah.


>> Uh
 it's
 a
 proven
 system.
 It's


successful.
 It
 probably
 takes
 a
 couple


years
 to
 implement,
 I
 would
 imagine,


throughout
 the
 organization,
 but
 it


works.


>> So,
 I
 think
 more
 people
 don't
 do
 it


because
 it's
 really,
 really
 hard.
 It


requires
 extensive
 discipline
 and


structure
 and
 focus
 and
 adherence
 to
 the


system
 for
 it
 to
 work.
 You
 can't
 just
 do


a
 piece
 of
 it
 or
 one
 part
 or
 for
 six


months
 and
 you
 actually
 have
 to
 have
 it


become
 part
 of
 the
 DNA
 and
 the
 culture


of
 the
 business.
 So
 I
 think
 in
 longer


term
 like
 holds
 people
 don't
 do
 it


because
 it's
 a
 discipline.
 I
 think
 in


shorter
 term
 holds
 if
 you
 are
 you
 know


private
 equity
 you
 don't
 have
 the
 time


period
 to
 get
 the
 benefits
 of
 doing
 it


and
 so
 why
 would
 you
 spend
 two
 years


going
 and
 implementing
 something
 that


you're
 not
 going
 to
 probably
 reap
 the


full
 benefit
 of
 in
 year
 three
 or
 year


four
 when
 you
 need
 to
 exit
 the
 business.


And
 so
 for
 us
 having
 a
 longerterm


horizon,
 we
 can
 invest
 in
 that
 and
 we


see
 the
 value
 of
 it.
 Um,
 and
 we
 have
 the


team
 to
 help
 support
 the
 discipline
 and


the
 adherence
 to
 it.
 I
 also
 think
 a
 lot


of
 investors
 haven't
 actually
 been


operators.
 And
 so
 it's
 really
 hard
 to
 go


into
 a
 business
 and
 say
 this
 is
 what
 you


should
 go
 do
 to
 operate
 a
 business
 if


you've
 never
 actually
 operated
 a


business.
 And
 so
 you're
 you
 probably


don't
 have
 the
 same
 insights
 or
 the


value
 of
 that
 or
 understand
 the
 value
 of


it.
 And
 you
 might
 have
 an
 operating
 team


who's
 you
 know
 doing
 it
 for
 you
 but
 you


know
 usually
 a
 lot
 of
 firms
 the


operating
 team
 sort
 of
 secondass


citizens
 where
 they're
 not
 at
 the
 same


seat
 of
 the
 table
 as
 the
 investing


organization.


>> So
 you
 started
 KBS
 in
 2020.


>> Mhm.


>> What's
 changed
 over
 the
 5
 years?
 What


have
 you
 learned
 from
 implementing
 this


over
 the
 last
 half
 decade?


>> Yeah.
 So
 um
 we
 we
 actually
 started
 it


when
 we
 were
 at
 Camp
 Chef,
 right?


without
 ever
 the
 fun
 foundational
 pieces


where
 we
 were
 learning
 and
 trying
 things


and
 then
 we
 formally
 sort
 of
 codified
 it


when
 we
 started
 camber
 in
 2020.
 It
 has


changed
 a
 lot
 and
 it
 gets
 better
 every


year
 and
 every
 season
 in
 every
 business


we
 work
 in
 and
 we
 think
 of
 it
 as
 this


it's
 living
 and
 breathing.
 It's
 not
 a


stagnant
 system
 you
 go
 and
 implement
 and


then
 you
 forget
 about
 it.
 It
 really
 is


focused
 on
 continuous
 improvement
 and


each
 company
 we
 engage
 with
 helps
 us
 get


better
 at
 it.
 But
 the
 mistakes
 um
 that


we
 learned
 from
 started
 very
 early
 on.


So
 when
 we
 were
 at
 Pampered
 Chef,
 we


first
 rolled
 out
 KPIs.
 Um
 we
 rolled
 out


KPIs
 to
 the
 entire
 organization
 and
 we


said,
 "Okay,
 great.
 We're
 going to
 do


KPIs.
 We're
 going to
 roll
 it
 out
 you
 500


employees.
 We'll
 roll
 it
 out
 to


everybody."
 And
 that
 was
 a
 huge
 mistake.


You
 we
 just
 it
 was
 too
 fast
 and
 the


organization
 wasn't
 ready.
 Um
 they
 you


we
 should
 have
 started
 and
 sequenced
 it


and
 started
 just
 with
 the
 executive
 team


in
 year
 one.
 Once
 you
 have
 the
 executive


team
 understanding,
 aligned,
 working


towards
 it,
 then
 you
 go
 to
 the
 next


level
 and
 then
 ultimately
 you
 go
 to
 the


next
 level.
 We
 thought
 we
 could
 move


faster
 and
 just
 roll
 it
 out
 because
 it


was
 a
 small
 business.
 You
 know,
 related


to
 that,
 when
 we
 rolled
 out
 our
 KPIs,


we're
 like,
 "Okay,
 great.
 You
 have
 KPIs,


go
 figure
 them
 out."
 And
 what
 we
 fig
 we


thought
 was
 like
 employees
 will
 figure


out
 how
 to
 go
 do
 it.
 Well,
 it
 turns
 out


you
 have
 to
 help
 people
 and
 you
 have
 to


understand
 problem
 solving
 and
 help
 them


understand
 how
 do
 I
 go
 solve
 a
 KPI.
 Just


because
 you
 give
 me
 a
 KPI
 doesn't
 mean
 I


actually
 understand
 how
 do
 I
 go
 drive


it.
 It
 doesn't
 mean
 I'm
 not
 capable
 or
 I


can't
 figure
 it
 out,
 but
 it's
 going
 to


be
 much
 more
 effective
 if
 I
 give
 you


problems
 solving
 training
 to
 help
 you


have
 some
 case
 studies
 and
 examples
 of


what
 this
 looks
 like
 in
 action.
 On
 the


people's
 side,
 when
 we
 first
 started,
 we


rolled
 out
 360°ree
 feedback
 in
 year
 one.


And
 what
 we
 found
 with
 360°ree
 feedback


where
 people
 get
 feedback
 from
 not
 just


their
 manager,
 but
 peers
 as
 well
 as


direct
 reports,
 is
 if
 you're
 in
 an


organization
 where
 you
 don't
 have
 trust


or
 psychological
 safety,
 it
 doesn't


work.
 um
 you
 know
 the
 feedback
 isn't


very
 good.
 It's
 shallow.
 People
 are


defensive.
 People
 attack
 like
 it's
 not


productive
 or
 constructive
 feedback.


>> So
 in
 doing
 that
 what
 we
 realized
 was


okay
 organizations
 aren't
 ready
 for
 this


in
 terms
 of
 people
 in
 year
 one.
 We
 need


to
 build
 up
 to
 it.
 We
 need
 to
 build


communication
 and
 engagement
 in
 the


organization
 and
 transparency.
 We
 need


to
 show
 them
 that
 we're
 going
 to
 you


know
 do
 this
 first.
 We
 need
 to
 explain


why
 we're
 doing
 development.
 It's
 not
 to


you
 exit
 people.
 s
 to
 help
 them
 in
 terms


of
 their
 career
 progression.
 And
 so
 by


learning
 those
 things
 along
 the
 way,
 we


get
 better
 at
 what
 we're
 doing.
 In
 the


recent
 years,
 we've
 realized
 just
 more


simple,
 like
 clearer,
 less
 um
 as
 concise


as
 possible.
 Dawson
 Shamblin,
 who
 leads


our
 KBS
 team,
 is
 terrific
 at
 this.
 He's


just
 a
 natural
 learner
 and
 working
 on


improving
 the
 system.
 And
 after
 each


partnership,
 we
 reflect
 and
 say,
 "Okay,


what
 went
 well?
 What
 could
 have
 gone


better?
 what
 do
 we
 think
 needs
 to
 shift


and
 alter?
 And
 it's
 also
 great.
 We'll
 go


into
 businesses
 and
 we
 learn
 of
 what


they're
 doing
 really
 well
 and
 like,
 oh


wow,
 they
 actually
 do
 that
 better
 than


us.
 Okay,
 can
 we
 tweak
 this
 or
 you
 can


we
 utilize
 them?
 And
 we
 see
 it
 in
 our


community,
 too.
 The
 group
 of
 3,000


owners,
 CEOs,
 we
 learn
 from
 them
 of
 how


they're
 navigating
 these
 types
 of
 topics


and
 that
 helps
 us
 get
 better.
 Uh,
 as


well,


>> I
 love
 the
 idea
 of
 the
 the
 community.


There's,
 you
 know,
 I
 think
 you
 had


mentioned
 there's
 sort
 of
 like


accelerators
 for
 startup
 companies,
 but


there's
 no
 real
 accelerators
 or
 network


for
 midsize
 businesses.


>> Yeah.
 My
 view
 is
 that
 mid-size
 companies


are
 in
 this
 middle
 um
 sort
 of
 gap
 area.


On
 the
 smaller
 side,
 their
 startups
 have


accelerators,
 they
 have
 different


programs.
 Bigger
 companies
 have
 more


resources.
 They
 can
 bring
 in
 a


consulting
 firm
 or
 someone
 to
 help
 them


or
 pay
 for
 a
 resource
 on
 a
 specific


topic.
 If
 you're
 in
 the
 middle,
 you're


constrained
 by
 resources
 typically,
 both


time,
 people,
 and
 dollars.
 And
 so,
 but


you
 have
 many
 of
 the
 same
 challenges
 to


figure
 out
 and
 to
 navigate.
 And
 so,
 we


built
 the
 camera
 community
 for
 what
 we


wanted,
 which
 was
 resources
 and
 people


to
 learn
 from
 that
 have
 done
 this
 and


have
 made
 mistakes
 and
 learned
 and


gotten
 better.
 And
 by
 bringing
 those


people
 together,
 we're
 sharing
 our
 own


resources
 and
 content
 and
 perspective


and
 experience,
 but
 also
 other
 people
 in


the
 community
 are
 sharing
 theirs
 as


well.
 And
 so
 that
 sort
 of
 shared


ecosystem
 of
 learning,
 improving,


getting
 better
 um
 has
 made,
 you
 know,


everyone
 in
 the
 community
 participates


better
 in
 their
 businesses,
 but
 also
 um


helps
 us
 as
 well.


>> And
 then
 how
 do
 you
 think
 about
 debt


when
 you
 take
 over
 a
 company?


>> Yeah,
 so
 we're
 pretty
 conservative.
 Um


so
 back
 to
 that
 margin
 of
 safety.
 We


believe
 if
 everything
 has
 to
 go
 well
 and


to
 be
 you
 know
 to
 be
 successful
 in
 the


business
 that
 makes
 us
 nervous
 and


leverage
 is
 one
 of
 those
 things
 that
 you


the
 more
 leverage
 you
 put
 on
 the


business
 the
 more
 everything
 has
 to
 go


well
 for
 that
 to
 to
 be
 able
 to
 service


that.
 So
 maybe
 a
 traditional
 private


equity
 might
 put
 four
 to
 six
 times
 the


leverage
 on
 a
 business.
 We'll
 probably


do
 two
 or
 three
 times.
 We
 might
 also
 use


a
 term
 of
 like
 a
 seller
 note
 where
 the


seller
 is
 helping
 finance
 um
 that
 which


is
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 friendly
 than
 bank


debt
 or
 some
 other
 debt
 option.
 And
 so


we're
 in
 general
 a
 little
 bit
 more


conservative.
 Our
 view
 is
 that
 leverage


amplifies
 returns
 on
 the
 upside
 but
 also


on
 the
 downside.
 And
 so
 we
 want
 to
 have


a
 bit
 more
 margin
 of
 safety.
 We
 don't


want
 to
 put
 the
 company
 at
 risk.
 We


don't
 want
 to
 push
 ourselves
 to
 make


short-term
 decisions
 because
 of
 a


structural
 decision
 that
 maybe
 juiced


returns
 a
 little
 bit
 but
 isn't
 actually


what
 we
 think
 is
 best
 for
 the
 business.


I
 have
 a
 hunch,
 maybe
 correct
 me
 if
 I'm


wrong,
 but
 when
 you're
 buying
 these


businesses,
 they
 don't
 have
 a
 lot
 of


debt
 on
 them.


>> No,
 typically
 not.
 Most
 entrepreneurs
 we


meet
 at
 some
 point
 had
 some
 moment
 in


their
 business
 where
 it
 was
 a
 bet
 the


business
 type
 situation
 and
 oftent
 times


that
 might
 have
 been
 leverage
 or


something
 else
 where
 they
 almost
 lost


the
 whole
 business.
 And
 when
 you
 have


those
 situations
 you've
 gone
 through,


typically
 as
 an
 entrepreneur,
 you're


like,
 I
 don't
 ever
 want
 to
 be
 there


again.
 So,
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 ever
 put


myself
 at
 risk.
 And
 so
 oftentimes
 I


think
 some
 mid-size
 companies
 are


actually
 you
 know
 you
 almost
 debt
 too


debt
 adverse
 where
 you
 know
 they
 won't


even
 have
 you
 know
 mortgage
 on
 a


property
 or
 you
 know
 use
 financing
 on
 um


an
 area
 where
 it
 might
 actually
 be


prudent.
 Um
 and
 they
 be
 more
 inclined
 to


take
 equity
 or
 more
 expensive
 capital
 or


not
 use
 you
 the
 capital
 options
 they


have
 because
 they're
 so
 afraid
 of


something
 bad
 happening.
 And
 it


typically
 is
 stemming
 from
 something
 bad


happened
 at
 some
 stage
 and
 they
 almost


lost
 their
 business
 and
 they
 don't
 want


to
 be
 ever
 close
 to
 that
 again
 which
 we


can
 respect
 and
 we
 understand
 you
 know


if
 you
 have
 a
 great
 business
 you
 don't


want
 to
 put
 yourself
 in
 a
 situation


where
 your
 business
 is
 at
 risk
 because


of
 a
 capital
 financing
 decision.


>> You
 guys
 have
 embraced
 AI
 internally
 at


Campre.
 How
 are
 you
 using
 it?


>> Yeah
 so
 we
 think
 of
 AI
 in
 three


different
 ways.
 one
 is
 at
 Campbreak.
 How


do
 we
 become
 use
 it
 um
 and
 ultimately


become
 smarter,
 more
 efficient,
 more


productive
 in
 our
 own
 processes
 and
 how


we
 operate?
 And
 so
 that's
 everything


from
 you
 we
 use
 it
 for
 better


note-taking
 um
 research
 on
 businesses
 um


moving
 faster
 as
 we
 sort
 of
 deep
 dive
 in


a
 space
 and
 getting
 smarter
 um
 as
 we


think
 about
 uh
 the
 businesses
 more


holistically
 we
 definitely
 are
 using
 it.


The
 second
 way
 we're
 thinking
 about
 it


is
 what
 are
 the
 industries
 and


businesses
 where
 AI
 will
 affect
 the


industry
 and
 potentially
 strengthen
 the


moat
 as
 we
 sort
 of
 talked
 about
 a
 bit


earlier
 and
 um
 are
 there
 spaces
 that
 we


think
 are
 attractive.
 looking
 in
 sort
 of


what
 we
 call
 sort
 of
 AI
 enabled
 services


businesses
 where
 we
 think
 it
 can


strengthen
 the
 mode
 of
 the
 business
 that


we're
 still
 earlier
 stages
 on
 because
 I


think
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 uncertainty
 of


what
 it
 happens
 in
 different
 businesses


but
 we're
 spending
 time
 thinking
 about


that
 and
 then
 the
 third
 is
 in
 our


companies
 and
 in
 our
 companies
 there's


two
 I
 think
 main
 ways
 we
 think
 it
 can
 be


helpful
 one
 is
 just
 structured
 way
 to


help
 our
 businesses
 think
 about
 the
 key


management
 aspects
 where
 they
 can
 be


more
 effective
 So
 an
 example
 would
 be


hiring.
 We
 have
 a
 hiring
 process.
 We


have
 a
 structured
 um
 you
 know
 you
 do
 a


scorecard
 and
 you
 do
 this
 in
 terms
 of


sourcing
 and
 then
 you
 do
 this
 in
 terms


of
 selection
 and
 an
 interview
 process.


And
 if
 you
 do
 this
 you
 know
 it
 will


improve
 your
 odds
 of
 success.
 But
 it's


very
 hard
 to
 be
 disciplined
 to
 it


because
 it
 takes
 time
 and
 it
 takes
 you


requiring
 u
 to
 step
 back
 and
 think
 about


it.
 You
 need
 to
 build
 a
 case
 study.
 You


need
 to
 do
 all
 of
 these
 things.
 And
 so,


can
 we
 build
 a
 hiring
 tool
 that
 takes


away
 some
 of
 the
 work
 required
 that


allows
 you
 to
 still
 adhere
 to
 the


process
 with
 discipline,
 but
 not
 all
 the


time
 to
 build
 the
 process?
 So,
 can
 we


build
 a
 scorecard
 for
 a
 role
 more


effectively?
 Can
 we
 pull
 from
 other


similar
 type
 roles
 and
 pre-populate
 it


and
 make
 you
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 efficient


as
 a
 hiring
 manager?
 So,
 we're
 spending


time
 on
 AI
 on
 topics
 like
 that
 that
 will


affect
 every
 business.
 And
 then
 we're


spending
 time
 on,
 you
 know,
 can
 we
 think


about
 our
 productive
 like
 workflows
 in


our
 business
 and
 how
 do
 we
 be
 more


effective?
 I
 think
 people
 are
 starting


with
 like
 the
 simple
 stuff
 like
 how
 do
 I


become
 more
 efficient
 or
 can
 I
 think


about
 my
 call
 center
 but
 we're
 thinking


probably
 more
 on
 the
 revenue
 generating


side.
 Uh
 can
 we
 quote
 you
 can
 right
 now


we
 have
 a
 business
 that
 takes
 48
 hours


to
 quote
 can
 we
 get
 that
 down
 to
 48


minutes
 um
 but
 without
 sacrificing


quality
 u
 by
 utilizing
 AI
 more


effectively.
 Um
 are
 there
 other


workflows
 like
 that
 on
 sort
 of
 the
 sales


or
 marketing
 or
 um
 productivity
 side


where
 we
 can
 significantly
 improve
 um


how
 we
 are
 engaging
 with
 customers
 or


making
 decisions
 or
 speeding
 up
 things


that
 will
 then
 allow
 us
 to
 attract
 more


customers
 or
 service
 our
 customers


better.
 And
 so
 that's
 the
 third
 aspect


that
 we're
 working
 on


>> when
 it
 comes
 to
 hiring.
 Like
 what
 does


that
 process
 look
 like?
 like
 what
 does


that
 nitty-gritty
 look
 like
 in
 the


details?
 You've
 u
 you
 guys
 have
 recently


hired
 a
 new
 CEO
 for
 one
 of the
 companies


you
 had.
 What
 is
 that
 process
 like?


>> Yeah,
 so
 um
 we
 very
 much
 describe
 the


WHO
 process.
 So
 by
 GHS
 smart
 um
 there's


a
 book
 called
 who
 it
 is,
 I
 think


single-handedly
 the
 best
 simple
 book
 on


hiring.
 And
 if
 you
 read
 that
 book,


almost
 everyone
 will
 become
 a
 better


hiring
 manager.
 And
 there's
 a
 few


components
 to
 it
 and
 we've
 augmented
 and


added
 our
 own.
 But
 the
 first
 is
 building


a
 really
 in-depth
 scorecard
 for
 the


role.
 Most
 people
 completely
 skip
 this


process.
 They
 just
 jump
 to
 I'm
 going
 to


write
 a
 JD.
 I'm
 going
 to
 post
 the
 role.


I'm
 going
 to
 start
 interviewing
 and
 then


I'll
 sort
 of
 figure
 it
 out.
 And
 people


usually
 do
 that
 because
 you're
 in
 pain.


You're
 trying
 to
 fill
 a
 role
 and
 you
 you


don't
 have
 someone
 in
 the
 role
 or
 um
 you


don't
 have
 the
 right
 person
 and
 so
 you


just
 want
 to
 get
 going.
 And
 we
 always


say
 by
 doing
 that
 you
 may
 save
 your
 time


today
 but
 you're
 going
 to
 lose
 time
 down


the
 road
 because
 you're
 not
 aligned
 with


your
 counterparts
 on
 it.
 you
 don't


market
 to
 the
 right
 people,
 you
 don't


interview
 the
 right
 candidates
 or
 you


know
 you
 hire
 the
 wrong
 person
 and
 then


you've
 got
 to
 exit
 that
 person
 and
 you


lose
 lots
 of
 time
 and
 money
 in
 doing


that.
 So
 how
 do
 you
 actually
 start
 up


front
 and
 get
 aligned
 and
 get
 clarity
 on


what
 you
 need
 in
 the
 role?
 And
 so
 a
 good


scorecard
 in
 my
 our
 mind
 has
 three
 sort


of
 critical
 components.
 The
 first
 is


what's
 the
 mission
 of
 the
 role?
 And
 so


really
 clearly
 what
 are
 you
 going
 to
 go


drive
 in
 this
 role
 and
 how
 do
 you
 make


it
 like
 specific?
 You
 want
 it
 time


bound.
 you
 want
 is
 as
 like
 um
 as


measurable
 as
 possible.
 So
 if
 you're


hiring
 a
 VP
 of
 sales,
 you
 might
 say,
 "We


want
 to
 double
 revenue
 over
 three
 years


by
 improving
 um
 our
 industrial
 account


management
 and
 adding
 large
 industrial


contracts
 and
 we
 want
 to
 build
 a
 team


of,
 you
 know,
 farmers
 or
 we
 want
 to


build
 a
 team
 of
 hunters,
 whatever
 it
 may


be.
 And
 by
 doing
 that,
 what
 do
 you
 want


to
 achieve?
 What's
 the
 time
 you
 want
 to


achieve
 it?"
 and
 some
 level
 of
 the
 how.


And
 the
 how
 is
 important
 because
 sales


leaders
 are
 very
 different.
 Like
 if


you're
 going
 to
 sell
 through
 Amazon,
 you


probably
 need
 a
 different
 sales
 leader


than
 if
 you're
 going
 to
 sell
 direct
 or


if
 you're
 going
 to
 sell
 through
 large


customers.
 And
 so
 can
 you
 are
 you


clearly
 articulating
 what
 you
 need?
 So


that
 mission
 is
 important.
 The
 second
 is


the
 outcomes.
 So
 three
 to
 five
 really


clear
 outcomes
 of
 what
 you're
 going
 to


go
 drive.
 So
 that
 might
 be
 growth
 within


revenue,
 but
 it
 also
 might
 be
 we
 need
 to


grow
 margin
 or
 we
 need
 to,
 you
 know,


improve
 from
 four
 national
 accounts
 to


10.
 whatever
 the
 outcomes
 are
 that
 you


need
 for
 that
 role
 as
 clear
 and
 crisp
 as


possible.
 And
 then
 the
 third
 are


competencies
 and
 what
 are
 the


competencies
 needed
 for
 this
 role
 and
 we


think
 of
 competencies
 on
 two
 levels.
 One


is
 functional.
 So
 there's
 some
 roles


where
 you
 you
 need
 a
 certain
 type
 of


competency.
 So
 you
 might
 need
 analytical


or
 you
 might
 need
 relationship
 based


whatever
 it
 is
 for
 that
 role.
 And
 then


there's
 company
 to
 big
 cultural


competencies.
 We
 need
 everyone
 to
 be


humble
 or
 open
 to
 feedback
 or
 aggressive


whatever
 it
 is
 for
 your
 business.
 And
 so


the
 scorecard
 is
 putting
 those
 things


together.
 The
 hiring
 manager
 puts
 those


together
 and
 then
 shares
 that
 with
 their


counterparts
 and
 so
 other
 stakeholders


and
 then
 you
 beat
 it
 up.
 And
 what
 you'll


find
 is
 people
 will
 say,
 "Whoa,
 you


think
 we
 need
 to
 grow
 through
 national


accounts?
 I
 think
 we
 should
 be
 going
 to


mom
 and
 pops."
 And
 that
 conversation
 is


had
 early
 in
 the
 process
 where
 you
 can


get
 alignment,
 have
 disagreement,
 but


then
 move
 forward
 on
 what
 you
 want
 to
 go


do.
 Once
 you
 have
 that
 scorecard,
 then


you,
 the
 hiring
 manager
 or
 the
 recruiter


or
 the
 search
 firm
 know
 like,
 okay,
 this


is
 what
 the
 person
 needs
 to
 go
 do.
 I
 can


find
 people
 who
 can
 go
 do
 this.
 I
 can


build
 a
 JD
 that's
 going
 to
 market
 to


people
 who
 want
 to
 go
 do
 this
 and
 I
 can


more
 clearly
 articulate
 it.
 And
 then


that
 scorecard
 then
 flows
 through
 the


interview
 process.
 So
 now
 I
 have
 know


how
 to
 interview.
 So
 that's
 the
 first


component
 is
 the
 scorecard.
 The
 second


component
 is
 the
 sourcing.
 And
 so
 most


sourcing
 in
 most
 companies
 is
 very


reactive.
 you
 know,
 I
 I
 post
 the
 job
 and


people
 apply.
 And
 my
 view
 is
 like


oftentimes
 the
 people
 applying
 aren't


always
 the
 people
 you
 want,
 right?


They're
 the
 people
 usually
 who
 don't


have
 a
 job
 or
 unsatisfied
 in
 their
 job.


Oftentimes
 your
 best
 performers
 are


happy
 in
 their
 job
 and
 they're
 doing


really
 well.
 And
 so
 you
 need
 to
 go
 find


those
 people.
 And
 so
 having
 the
 hiring


manager
 or
 the
 recruiter
 reaching
 out


and
 taking
 ownership
 of
 that
 to
 actually


find
 the
 people
 that
 you
 want
 to
 have


and
 not
 just
 waiting
 for
 people
 to
 come


to
 you.
 So
 really
 diving
 into
 more


specifics
 of
 how
 do
 you
 go
 source?
 And


then
 the
 third
 is
 around
 selection
 and


how
 do
 you
 improve
 your
 selection


process
 and
 this
 is
 what
 most
 people


think
 about
 when
 they
 think
 about
 hiring


is
 the
 selection
 part.
 Our
 selection
 has


a
 few
 different
 sort
 of
 components
 to


it.
 So
 the
 first
 is
 actually
 like
 the


hiring
 manager
 we
 do
 a
 screening
 with


the
 recruiter
 but
 then
 the
 hiring


manager
 going
 deep
 on
 different
 areas


that
 we
 think
 are
 important
 in
 the
 role


from
 the
 scorecard.
 So
 the
 outcomes
 um


the
 competencies
 in
 that
 first
 interview


and
 then
 actually
 having
 an
 interview


panel
 that
 have
 different
 people


interviewing
 different
 areas.
 So
 what
 we


find
 most
 interviews
 start
 with
 like


tell
 me
 a
 little
 bit
 about
 yourself
 and


you
 know
 tell
 me
 about
 your
 background


and
 then
 20
 minutes
 later
 then
 you've


had
 that
 same
 conversation
 or
 that


candidate's
 had
 that
 same
 conversation


with
 three
 or
 four
 different
 people


versus
 saying
 you
 know
 your
 job
 is
 to


interview
 on
 uh
 outcomes
 and
 all
 you're


going
 to
 focus
 on
 are
 these
 outcomes.


Your
 job
 is
 to
 focus
 on
 functional


competencies.
 All
 you're
 going
 to
 focus


on
 is
 are
 they
 analytical
 if
 that's
 what


you're
 looking
 for,
 right?
 Relationship


based.
 And
 then
 the
 um
 one
 person


focusing
 on
 cultural.
 I'm
 like
 in
 your


interview
 comes
 in,
 you're
 not
 worried


about
 what
 their
 past
 role
 is
 or
 how


competent
 they
 are
 in
 terms
 of
 the


outcomes.
 You're
 worried
 about
 their


culture.
 And
 so
 having
 the
 interview
 set


up
 from
 that
 and
 then
 we
 augment
 those


interviews
 with
 a
 behavioral
 assessment.


So
 we
 usually
 do
 behavioral
 and


cognitive
 which
 we
 think
 helps
 us
 better


understand
 some
 of the
 cultural
 and


aptitude
 aspects.
 We
 usually
 do
 a
 case


study,
 which
 is
 a
 deep
 dive
 on
 real


topics
 that
 we're
 facing.
 And
 then
 we


usually
 do
 a
 top
 grading
 interview,


which
 is
 a
 in-depth,
 usually
 90
 minute


to
 three-hour
 interview
 where
 we're


going
 through
 every
 past
 role
 that


they've
 done,
 what
 were
 the
 outcomes
 or


the
 scope
 of
 responsibility,
 how
 did


they
 perform,
 what
 would
 their
 manager


say
 about
 them,
 those
 types
 of


conversations.
 So,
 it's
 a
 pretty


in-depth
 process
 been
 followed
 based
 on


sort
 of
 who,
 but
 it
 significantly


improves
 your
 outcome
 of
 success.
 One
 of


the
 businesses
 you're
 not
 interested
 in


acquiring
 is
 insurance.
 I'd
 love
 to
 hear


more
 about
 that.


>> Yeah,
 I
 think
 there's
 a
 lot
 of


industries
 we
 don't
 invest
 in.


Healthcare,
 financials,
 insurance,
 real


estate.
 Typically,
 we
 want
 to
 focus
 on


what's
 our
 circle
 of
 competence.
 Where


do
 we
 think
 we
 have
 you
 value
 and


expertise
 that's
 going
 to
 enhance
 what


we're
 doing?
 So,
 we
 focus
 on
 services,


industrials,
 consumer,
 um,
 both
 by
 our


background,
 but
 also
 where
 we
 think


there's
 attractive
 opportunities.


insurance
 is
 a
 you
 can
 be
 a
 really
 good


business,
 but
 a
 lot
 of
 capital
 has
 come


into
 it
 in
 the
 last
 15
 years.
 And
 so
 it


probably
 is
 a
 more
 competitive
 business.


Um
 there's
 more
 risk
 in
 it
 than
 there


has
 been.
 And
 there
 probably
 will
 be


times
 where
 it's
 a
 really
 good
 business,


but
 there'll
 be
 times
 where
 there's
 more


capital,
 so
 the
 pricing
 gets
 less


disciplined
 and
 then
 it
 ends
 up
 being


less
 attractive
 of
 a
 business.
 There
 are


other
 dynamics
 that
 are
 attractive,
 like


if
 we
 ever
 found,
 you
 know,
 the
 perfect


insurance
 business.
 It's
 not
 saying
 we


wouldn't
 do
 it.
 Um
 but
 it's
 probably
 not


a
 focus
 for
 us
 for
 those
 dynamics
 and


the
 fact
 that
 where
 we
 are
 playing


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 opportunity
 and
 so


there's
 just
 more
 there
 than
 we
 see
 sort


of
 possible
 in
 insurance
 or
 some
 of


these
 other
 sectors
 and
 some
 of
 them
 are


just
 more
 complex.
 The
 risks
 are
 higher.


If
 you
 mispric
 insurance
 you
 don't


understand
 your
 costs
 for
 a
 long
 time


but
 it
 can
 you
 know
 be
 very
 very


difficult
 to
 an
 organization
 and
 you
 can


erode
 you
 know
 all
 your
 profits
 if
 you


mispric.


>> You've
 been
 on
 a
 lot
 of
 boards
 so
 you've


been
 on
 the
 Dairy
 Queen
 board.
 John


Mansville
 Craft
 Heinds.
 I
 would
 love
 to


hear
 about
 what
 you've
 learned
 from


those
 experiences
 and
 then
 how
 you
 took


that
 and
 you're
 applying
 that
 now
 at


Camp
 Brick.


>> Yeah.
 So,
 I'd
 say
 you
 each
 board
 I've


been
 on
 I've
 learned
 different
 things
 um


both
 in
 terms
 of
 what
 to
 do
 sometimes


what
 not
 to
 do
 and
 some
 of
 them
 have


been
 unique
 where
 you
 know
 it
 was
 the


CEO
 reporting
 to
 me
 directly
 and
 not
 a


formal
 board
 and
 other
 times
 a
 more


formal
 public
 board
 or
 private
 board.


And
 what
 I
 find
 is
 for
 the
 most
 part


most
 boards
 don't
 add
 a
 lot
 of
 value
 to


the
 businesses
 and
 I
 think
 they


oftentimes
 go
 too
 deep
 on
 areas
 that
 are


less
 critical
 and
 not
 enough
 time
 on
 the


areas
 that
 are
 most
 critical
 that
 they


can
 provide
 the
 most
 value.
 So
 within


each
 business
 really
 understanding
 what


are
 the
 you
 know
 three
 to
 five
 big


levers
 that
 are
 going
 to
 shift
 and


create
 the
 most
 value
 in
 this
 business


and
 how
 do
 you
 spend
 your
 time
 talking


about
 those
 levers
 versus
 all
 the


smaller
 things
 that
 might
 be
 urgent.


They
 might
 be
 happening.
 They
 may
 be


important,
 but
 they're
 not
 going
 to


fundamentally
 change
 the
 direction
 of


the
 business.
 And
 so,
 I
 think
 the
 best


boards
 figure
 out
 what
 those
 are,
 focus


on
 them,
 and
 drive
 conversation
 around


them,
 and
 then
 provide
 insights
 or
 value


to
 the
 management
 team.
 I
 think
 most


management
 teams
 would
 come
 out
 of
 most


board
 meetings
 and
 say,
 "That
 wasn't
 a


good
 use
 of
 my
 time
 because
 I
 was
 just


updating
 and
 telling
 them
 what
 I
 did,


you
 know,
 for
 the
 last
 quarter
 or


whatever
 it
 may
 be
 versus
 more
 forward


thinking.
 This
 is
 what
 I'm
 struggling


with."
 And
 most
 boards
 don't
 have
 the


context
 in
 the
 business
 enough
 to
 be


able
 to
 add
 value.
 So
 how
 do
 you
 make


sure
 the
 board
 is
 knowledgeable
 enough


about
 the
 business
 and
 can
 also
 ask
 the


right
 questions
 even
 if
 they're
 not


going
 to
 be
 as
 deep
 as
 the
 CEO
 or
 the


management
 team.
 And
 I
 think
 it's
 a
 fine


line
 of
 you
 know
 getting
 that
 right


balance.
 But
 those
 are
 some
 of the


things
 that
 I've
 learned
 as
 I've
 thought


about
 different
 boards
 and
 how
 we
 think


about
 our
 boards.


>> And
 do
 you
 think
 the
 role
 of
 the
 board


is
 different
 in
 public
 companies
 versus


private
 companies?


>> Yes
 and
 no.
 I
 mean
 absolutely
 like


there's
 a
 public
 dynamic
 where
 you
 have


a
 fiduciary
 responsibility.
 There's
 a


enhanced
 governance
 um
 and
 some
 other


dynamics
 that
 are
 important
 and
 you
 know


regulated
 in
 terms
 of
 where
 you
 need
 to


spend
 your
 time.
 I
 think
 there's
 some


that's
 less
 valuable
 earnings
 and


quarterly
 reports.
 I
 think
 that's


probably
 less
 valuable
 to
 value
 creation


in
 the
 business.
 I
 think
 on
 the
 private


side
 people
 set
 up
 their
 boards
 in


different
 ways.
 Sometimes
 it's
 set
 up


more
 as
 governance
 and
 oversight
 and


shareholder


um
 you
 management.
 Other
 times
 it's
 set


up
 more
 as
 advisory
 or
 insights
 and
 I


think
 different
 private
 boards
 do
 it


differently.
 I
 think
 our
 view
 is
 that
 um


you
 probably
 you
 want
 somewhere
 in
 the


middle
 where
 you're
 having
 some


governance
 but
 at
 Camber
 we
 provide
 most


of
 that
 but
 really
 it's
 the
 valuable


insights,
 perspective,
 relationships,


introductions
 that
 are
 going
 to
 create


the
 most
 value
 that
 we
 want
 our
 boards


focused
 on.
 Is
 there
 a
 moment
 without


naming
 the
 company
 where
 you
 were
 in
 a


board
 meeting
 and
 you
 were
 just
 taken


back
 by
 what
 was
 happening
 or


>> like
 in
 a
 bad
 way?


>> Yeah.


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean
 many
 of
 them
 uh
 and
 some
 of


them
 good
 boards
 but
 I
 remember
 there


was
 a
 a
 board
 meeting
 we
 were
 in
 and
 we


were
 like
 assessing
 the
 packaging
 of
 the


products
 and
 you
 in
 detail
 which
 I
 think


that's
 very
 important.
 The
 packaging
 of


a
 product
 is
 very
 important.
 I
 don't


know
 if
 the
 board
 is
 the
 best
 people
 to


be
 assessing
 and
 commenting
 on
 the


packaging
 of
 business.
 Like
 I
 think


that's
 what
 the
 the the
 management
 team


and
 the
 marketer
 should
 be
 doing
 and
 I


think
 those
 are
 you
 conversations
 you


have
 to
 be
 like
 thoughtful
 about
 or
 you


know
 you're
 on
 in
 a
 slide
 deck
 and
 it's


slide
 112
 and
 you
 know
 you're
 being
 read


the
 slides
 and
 like
 really
 like
 this
 is


how
 we're
 going
 to
 use
 this
 time
 like
 I


don't
 think
 any
 slide
 deck
 should
 be
 112


for
 a
 board.
 I
 mean,
 usually
 there's
 20


slides
 maybe
 that
 get
 to
 the
 heart
 of


the
 most
 important
 topics
 you're
 facing


at
 a
 time.
 And
 then
 most
 of
 the
 time


should
 be
 discussion
 and
 not


presentation.
 It's
 not
 a
 dog
 and
 pony


show,
 but
 I
 think
 it's
 set
 up
 typically


for
 the
 management
 team
 to
 come
 up
 and


say
 all
 the
 things
 that
 we've
 done
 and


how
 smart
 we
 are
 and
 how
 talented
 we
 are


and
 how
 you
 should
 be
 applauding
 us
 and


the
 board,
 you
 know,
 is
 doing
 that
 on


the
 other
 side
 versus
 is
 that
 going
 to


create
 the
 most
 value
 versus,
 hey,
 these


are
 the
 three
 biggest
 issues
 we're


facing
 right
 now.
 this
 is
 what
 we're


struggling
 with.
 This
 is
 what
 we
 need


your
 help
 with
 and
 this
 is
 what
 we
 want


your
 perspective
 and
 insights
 on.
 Now,


that's
 a
 completely
 different
 dynamic.


You
 need
 to
 have
 psychological
 safety.


You
 need
 to
 have
 trust.
 You
 need
 the


management
 team
 to
 be
 open
 to
 receive


the
 feedback.
 You
 need
 to
 have
 board


members
 who
 are
 capable
 of
 providing


valuable
 feedback.
 You
 need
 all
 of
 those


dynamics
 to
 to
 come
 together.


>> You
 mentioned
 Katherine
 Graham
 and
 her


biography
 earlier.
 I
 want
 to
 circle
 back


to
 this
 because
 it
 just
 brought
 back
 a


little
 bit
 of
 a
 memory.
 uh
 and
 it


involves
 Buffett.
 But
 it
 was


interesting,
 she
 had
 mentioned


something,
 if
 I
 can
 get
 this
 right,


where
 he
 had
 brought
 all
 these
 annual


reports
 to
 her
 and
 he
 was
 teaching
 her


sort
 of
 like
 the
 financial
 aspect
 of


running
 the
 Washington
 Post.
 And
 one
 of


the
 things
 he
 mentioned
 that
 stood
 out


to
 me
 was
 he
 was
 just
 showing
 her
 a


balance
 sheet
 over
 five
 or
 10
 year


period
 of
 time.
 What
 can
 you
 learn
 from


a
 balance
 sheet,
 just
 a
 pure
 balance


sheet
 over
 that
 period
 of
 time?
 What


insights
 do
 you
 get?


>> I
 mean,
 you
 can
 see
 a
 lot
 in
 a
 balance


sheet.
 You
 can
 see
 how
 much
 inventory
 do


you
 have.
 You
 can
 see
 what
 capital
 is


required.
 You
 can
 see
 are
 your
 accounts


receivables
 like
 are
 they
 going
 up?
 Are


they
 going
 down?
 Like
 there's
 a
 lot
 of


insights
 that
 you
 can
 see
 from
 all
 three


financial
 statements.
 And
 then
 if
 you
 if


you
 start
 to
 understand
 the
 business


drivers
 of
 the
 business,
 you
 can


understand
 this
 as
 well.
 And
 I
 think


what
 you
 typically
 you'll
 see
 is
 that


most
 leaders
 don't
 always
 I
 think
 we


assume
 they
 understand
 all
 of
 that
 in
 a


business.
 And
 I
 think
 some
 do
 and


understand
 it
 fundamentally
 really
 well.


Some
 understand
 it,
 you
 know,
 tactically


well.
 Sometimes
 people
 understand
 it
 in


their
 like
 in
 practice
 but
 not


necessarily
 the
 theoretical
 like
 how
 it


actually
 works.
 And
 you
 when
 I
 think


it's
 really
 valuable
 though
 for
 your


leaders
 and
 not
 to
 assume
 your
 leaders


understand
 all
 of
 that
 because
 some


people
 are
 more
 financially
 literate
 or


financially
 like
 have
 more
 financial


acumen
 than
 others.
 And
 it
 doesn't
 mean


they
 can't
 learn
 it
 but
 if
 you
 equip


them
 with
 those
 skills
 they're
 going
 to


be
 better.
 If
 you
 think
 about
 a
 CEO
 for


example
 oftentimes
 CEOs
 are
 great


operators.
 They
 usually
 have
 come
 from


sales
 or
 marketing
 or
 operations.
 They


seldom
 come
 from
 finance
 and
 it's
 not


usually
 the
 the
 career
 career


trajectory.
 And
 so,
 have
 they
 actually


learned
 those
 aspects?
 And
 where
 along


the
 way
 did
 they
 learn
 them?
 And
 do
 they


understand?
 And
 oftentimes
 in
 a


business,
 you're
 making
 really
 important


operational
 decisions,
 but
 you're
 also


making
 really
 important
 capital


allocation
 decisions.
 And
 you
 can
 really


uh
 ruin
 a
 good
 business
 with
 poor


capital
 allocation
 decisions.
 And
 we


think
 of
 big
 ones,
 acquisitions
 being


the
 biggest,
 where
 we
 destroy
 value


often
 by
 acquiring
 a
 business
 that
 isn't


a
 very
 good
 business
 or
 paying
 their
 own


valuation
 for
 it.
 But
 there's
 capital


allocation
 decisions
 every
 day
 in
 a


business.
 You
 know,
 should
 we
 invest
 in


this
 factory?
 Should
 we
 open
 this


distribution
 center?
 Should
 we
 move
 into


this
 new
 market?
 Um,
 we
 think
 of
 hiring


with
 the
 same
 level
 of
 complexity.
 like


you
 know
 it's
 not
 a
 capex
 decision
 but


if
 you
 thought
 of
 it
 as
 a
 capex
 decision


if
 you're
 going
 to
 hire
 someone
 for


hundred
 grand
 right
 a
 year
 and
 you
 think


the
 you
 discount
 the
 value
 of
 that
 you


know
 it's
 a
 million
 dollar
 investment


that
 you're
 making
 in
 that
 person
 if


you're
 you
 can
 fire
 them
 but
 you


probably
 won't
 they'll
 stay
 at
 the


organization
 so
 do
 you
 have
 that
 same


level
 of
 discipline
 and
 rigor
 in
 your


decision-
 making
 on
 all
 those
 types
 of


topics
 and
 CEOs
 who
 are
 more
 equipped
 at


like
 fundament


understanding
 capital
 allocation
 usually


can
 make
 better
 decisions
 in
 their


businesses.
 Now,
 a
 lot
 of
 entrepreneurs,


they
 do
 that
 instinctively.
 They've
 had


to
 do
 it.
 They
 figure
 it
 out.
 But


sometimes
 just
 taking
 a
 step
 back
 and


helping
 a
 leader,
 making
 sure
 a
 leader


understands
 it.
 When
 I
 started
 as
 CEO,


we
 took
 all
 of
 our
 leaders
 through
 a


business
 driver
 meeting
 and
 training


that
 we
 did
 once
 a
 year,
 which
 was
 what


are
 the
 business
 drivers?
 let's
 go


through
 an
 income
 statement
 and
 let's


understand
 what
 are
 all
 the
 components


of
 an
 income
 statement
 and
 we
 just
 did


it
 for
 everybody
 just
 because
 it's
 also


something
 that
 people
 assume
 they
 should


know
 and
 so
 if
 they
 don't
 they
 often


times
 feel
 embarrassed
 or
 they
 don't


feel
 like
 they
 should
 ask
 and
 so
 we


would
 go
 through
 it
 and
 explain
 what


everything
 is
 because
 ultimately


finance
 is
 just
 a
 vocabulary
 and
 a


language
 that
 you
 people
 if
 explained
 to


can
 understand
 but
 if
 you've
 never
 been


explained
 to
 it
 it's
 can
 be
 tough
 to


understand
 and
 you
 you
 you
 just
 need


someone
 to
 walk
 you
 through
 it.


>> How
 do
 you
 evaluate
 integrity
 when
 it


comes
 to
 hiring?


>> We
 think
 of
 it
 as
 in
 one
 of
 those
 like


cultural
 competencies
 and
 how
 do
 you


assess
 it?
 So,
 one
 you
 can
 try
 to
 get
 to


situational
 questions.
 You
 tell
 me
 about


a
 time
 you,
 you
 know,
 struggled
 with


something.
 Tell
 me
 about
 a
 time
 you
 made


a
 mistake.
 Tell
 me
 about
 a
 time
 um
 you


you
 did
 the
 wrong
 thing.
 Whatever
 it
 may


be,
 and
 see
 what
 people
 share.
 We
 use
 it


through
 our
 behavioral
 assessment.
 So


like
 the
 it's
 actual
 way
 to
 um
 get
 at


sort
 of
 motivators
 and
 drivers
 and
 some


of
 those
 things
 come
 through
 like


integrity
 or
 others
 and
 then
 we
 get
 it


at
 it
 through
 reference
 checks.
 You
 know


both
 ones
 they
 provide
 but
 also
 ones


that
 they
 don't
 provide.
 Our
 view
 is


like
 the
 hiring
 process
 is
 fundamentally


you're
 trying
 to
 learn
 as
 much
 as
 you


can
 about
 a
 person
 and
 how
 they'll


behave
 in
 the
 role.
 You
 don't
 actually


know
 until
 they
 get
 into
 the
 role,
 but


you
 can
 improve
 your
 odds
 of
 success
 by


being
 disciplined
 on
 some
 of
 those


dynamics.


>> I
 remember
 that
 when
 I
 got
 hired
 at
 a


three-letter
 agency
 and
 they
 were
 doing


my
 background
 check,
 they
 talked
 to


numerous
 references
 that
 I
 hadn't


provided
 and
 I
 always
 found
 that
 an


interesting
 insight
 because
 the
 ones


that
 you
 provide
 are
 the
 least
 likely
 to


give
 insightful
 information.


>> Yeah.
 Um,
 so
 they
 would
 go
 and
 they
 um


they
 just
 talk
 to
 anybody
 in
 my
 life
 who


would
 have
 been
 around
 like
 including
 a


neighbor
 to
 my
 my
 house
 and
 like
 does
 he


party?
 What
 time
 is
 he
 coming?
 Oh,
 I


don't
 know
 what
 questions
 they
 asked,


but
 I
 always
 found
 it
 interesting
 cuz
 my


neighbor
 came
 over
 one
 night
 to
 my
 mom.


It
 was
 just
 like
 I
 always
 knew
 that
 boy


of
 yours
 was
 going
 to
 get
 in
 trouble
 and


it
 was
 just
 a
 background
 check
 like
 and


it
 was
 a
 reference
 check
 and
 it
 was a


really
 interesting
 way
 to
 find
 out


information
 about
 people.


>> Yeah.


>> Uh
 in
 a
 non-controlled
 sort
 of


>> Yeah.
 It
 can
 be
 really
 helpful
 to
 see
 um


what
 people
 share.
 We
 also
 in
 our


interview
 process
 based
 off
 of
 who
 also


um
 when
 you
 go
 through
 the
 top
 grading


exercise,
 you
 know,
 I
 go
 through
 each


role
 you've
 had,
 what
 your
 scope
 was,


what
 you
 did,
 what
 were
 your
 outcomes,


but
 then
 I
 ask
 who
 your
 manager
 was.
 I


write
 that
 person's
 name
 down.
 And
 so
 if


you
 say
 your
 manager,
 Sally
 Smith,
 okay,


okay,
 what
 what
 years
 was
 Sally
 your


manager,
 you
 know,
 write
 them
 down.
 And


what
 was
 Sally's
 role?
 Okay,
 she
 was
 the


manager
 of
 this.
 And
 then
 when
 I
 call


Sally,
 what
 is
 she
 going
 to
 say
 about


you
 know
 your
 biggest
 strengths
 and
 what


is
 she
 going to
 say
 about
 your
 biggest


development
 errors?
 And
 just
 shifting


that
 from
 when
 from
 if
 like
 if
 I
 call


versus
 when
 I
 call
 people
 shift
 what


they
 say
 they're
 more
 audit
 and
 also


just
 by
 writing
 down
 Sally's
 name
 like
 I


I
 know
 who
 your
 manager
 was
 now
 versus


you
 know
 often
 times
 you
 don't
 know
 who


their
 manager
 was
 so
 you
 couldn't
 even


get
 to
 it
 if
 you
 wanted.
 And
 so
 getting


people
 to
 be
 more
 not
 necessarily
 more


honest,
 but
 more
 direct
 and
 more


forthright
 with
 what
 they're
 sharing
 is


a
 way
 to
 also
 get
 some
 of
 that
 out.
 And


then
 ideally
 you
 do
 verify
 it
 and
 have


those
 conversations
 and
 see
 if
 what
 they


said
 and
 what
 Sally
 said
 match
 up.
 It's


really
 helpful.


>> This
 whole
 world
 is
 so
 interesting
 to
 me


because
 I
 for
 15
 years
 I
 effectively


worked
 with
 people
 you
 could
 trust
 uh
 by


default.
 there
 wasn't
 a
 it
 was
 a


non-representative
 portion
 of
 society


and
 then
 getting
 outside
 of
 that
 and


learning
 you
 know
 not
 everybody
 has


integrity
 and
 not
 everybody
 does
 the


right
 thing
 and
 not
 everybody
 is


trustworthy
 and
 it's
 so
 weird
 just


coming
 from
 an
 area
 where
 I
 would
 say


you
 know
 a
 disproportionate
 percentage


of
 people
 were
 uh
 had
 integrity
 and


trustworthy
 and
 all
 of
 these
 things
 that


we
 look
 for
 on
 the
 outside
 and
 then
 you


go
 outside
 and
 it's
 like
 whoa
 that's


that
 is
 a
 non-representative
 sample
 of


the
 population.


>> Yeah.
 And
 I
 think
 like
 I
 by
 and
 large


think
 people
 want
 to
 do
 the
 right
 thing


and
 want
 to
 do
 good
 and
 are
 trustworthy.


But
 I
 think
 people
 have
 blind
 spots


about
 themselves.
 They
 as
 you're
 talking


they
 want
 to
 impress
 you.
 You
 know,
 it's


a
 bit
 like
 dating
 where
 you're
 not


always
 you're
 covering
 up
 a
 little
 bit


and
 putting
 your
 best
 foot
 forward.
 And


we
 want
 to
 disarm
 people
 and
 try
 to
 get


them
 to
 be
 as
 honest
 as
 possible
 because


what
 we
 find
 sometimes
 is
 you
 could
 be
 a


great
 person
 and
 really
 talented
 but


just
 not
 be
 the
 right
 fit
 for
 what
 we


need
 in
 this
 role.
 And
 so
 try
 to
 get


people
 to
 be
 as
 upfront
 and
 honest
 and


then
 ideally
 screen
 out
 those
 that


perhaps
 aren't.
 But
 you
 know
 our
 our


view
 is
 we
 want
 to
 help
 everyone
 find


the
 right
 role
 and
 right
 fit
 for
 them.


>> Do
 you
 keep
 tabs
 on
 those
 people
 after?


So
 it's
 like
 oh
 this
 person
 was
 great.


They're
 not
 a
 fit
 for
 this
 role
 but
 you


know
 something
 comes
 up
 in
 6
 months
 and


you're
 like
 oh
 yeah
 think
 of
 this
 person


again.


>> Yeah
 we
 love
 to
 keep
 a
 talent
 bench.


both
 people
 we've
 interviewed
 but
 also


people
 that
 we
 just
 know
 and
 we
 think


are
 impressive
 that
 you
 know
 if
 we
 have


this
 type
 of
 role
 or
 in
 this
 geography


that
 we
 can
 reach
 out
 to.
 Um
 we
 think


it's
 a
 great
 way
 to
 cultivate
 talent
 um


and
 sort
 of
 see
 opportunities
 but
 we


definitely
 like
 we'll
 get
 to
 know
 people


and
 then
 a
 year
 two
 3
 years
 later
 there


might
 be
 some
 role
 that's
 a
 fit
 that
 we


end
 up
 working
 on.
 I
 always
 say
 life
 is


long.
 You
 know,
 people
 come
 back
 in
 and


out
 of
 your
 life
 in
 different
 ways.
 And


um
 when
 you
 meet
 really
 great
 people,


you
 try
 to
 keep
 them
 close
 because


really
 great
 people
 just
 not
 only
 from
 a


cultural
 or
 integrity
 perspective,
 but


also
 from
 a
 competency
 and
 a
 capability


perspective
 are
 rare
 to
 find
 that


combination.
 So
 when
 you
 find
 them,
 you


know,
 how
 do
 you
 keep
 them
 close?


>> You've
 studied
 a
 lot
 of
 business


history.
 I'm
 curious
 about
 some
 of
 the


principles,
 lessons,
 and
 stories
 that


you
 constantly
 find
 yourself
 thinking


about.
 Oh,
 there's
 I
 think
 too
 many
 to


tell.
 I
 mean,
 I
 think
 we've
 talked
 a
 lot


about
 long
 term.
 You
 know,
 one
 thing


that
 Warren
 always
 said
 to
 the
 CEOs
 is


like
 think
 about
 this
 business
 as
 if


it's
 your
 family's
 only
 asset
 and
 you


can't
 sell
 it
 for
 50
 years.
 Make


decisions
 with
 that
 in
 mind.
 And
 that
 to


me
 embodies
 like
 true
 long-term


thinking,
 how
 to
 think
 about
 your


business.
 And
 that's
 one
 that
 I
 sort
 of


come
 back
 to.
 Now,
 maybe
 not
 be
 thinking


about
 every
 business
 for
 50
 years,
 but
 I


think
 that's
 something
 I
 think
 a
 lot


about.
 But
 I
 feel
 I
 I
 learned
 through


those
 types
 of
 examples
 and
 those
 types


of
 stories
 like
 most
 of
 us
 do
 I
 think


and
 so
 trying
 to
 remember
 those
 is


really
 valuable
 or
 you
 know
 Warren's


comment
 on
 your
 reputation
 and
 if
 you


lose
 money
 I'll
 be
 understanding
 but
 if


you
 lose
 a
 reput
 a
 shred
 of
 reputation


I'll
 be
 ruthless.
 We
 think
 about
 that
 or


you
 know
 the
 newspaper
 tests
 like
 if


this
 were
 on
 the
 front
 page
 of
 the


newspaper
 by
 a
 fair
 critical
 reporter


that
 your
 family
 would
 read
 how
 would


you
 feel
 about
 it?
 Things
 like
 that
 you


always
 stand
 out
 to
 me.
 I
 want
 to
 speak


just
 a
 little
 bit
 about
 inflation.
 How


do
 you
 think
 about
 inflation
 in
 relation


to
 investing?


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 I
 think
 that
 um
 a
 few


things.
 One
 is
 when
 we
 think
 about


businesses,
 we
 try
 to
 find
 businesses


that
 we
 think,
 and
 this
 goes
 back
 to


like
 has
 the
 moat,
 is
 that
 typically


they're
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 insulated
 from


inflation
 because
 they
 usually
 can
 pass


it
 on
 to
 their
 customers.
 If
 you
 have
 a


better
 business
 that's
 higher
 quality,


that
 has
 a
 moat,
 you
 usually
 can
 pass
 on


inflation.
 And
 so
 it's
 less
 it's
 an


issue,
 but
 it's
 less
 of
 an
 issue
 um
 for


the
 businesses
 that
 can
 do
 that.
 And
 so


we're
 trying
 to
 be
 thoughtful
 about


that.
 Second,
 with
 our
 businesses,
 you


know,
 even
 if
 there
 is
 inflation
 and
 we


don't
 want
 to
 pass
 it
 on
 or
 pass
 on
 all


of
 it,
 it's
 like
 how
 do
 we
 improve


productivity
 in
 our
 business
 so
 that
 in


essence
 we're
 combating
 some
 of
 the


inflation
 we
 may
 be
 experiencing.
 And
 we


think
 most
 businesses
 can
 improve


productivity
 you
 two
 to
 five
 percent
 a


year
 every
 year
 just
 by
 being


disciplined
 about
 it.
 And
 so
 that's
 a


way
 to
 also
 counter
 some
 of
 the
 impacts


with
 it.


>> But
 I
 think
 that's
 like
 the
 level
 of
 how


we
 think
 about
 it
 in
 our
 businesses.
 You


also
 have
 as
 you
 think
 about
 you
 new


investments
 um
 what
 that
 means
 in
 terms


of
 your
 willingness
 to
 pay
 the


consequences
 with
 that
 ultimately


translates
 into
 interest
 rates
 as
 well.


Those
 are
 all
 things
 that
 we
 factor
 in.


That
 being
 said,
 like
 I've
 never
 been
 a


macro
 investor.
 I
 think
 it's
 hard
 to


predict
 the
 macro.
 It's
 hard
 to
 invest


based
 on
 that.
 And
 so
 I'd
 much
 rather


focus
 on
 the
 fundamentals
 of
 find
 high


quality
 businesses
 at
 reasonable


valuations
 that
 have
 good
 dynamics
 and


aspects
 of
 the
 business.
 And
 then
 you


can
 absorb
 more
 dynamics
 like
 inflation


or
 tariffs
 or
 things
 like
 that
 that
 are


going
 to
 inevitably
 probably
 happen
 at


some
 time
 in
 some
 space.


>> The
 president
 today
 came
 out
 and


suggested
 that
 financial
 reporting


should
 move
 to
 6
 months
 instead
 of


quarterly.
 Um,
 so
 I'm
 wondering
 how
 you


think
 about
 in
 terms
 of
 quarterly


reporting
 versus
 annual
 reporting
 and


how
 that
 affects
 behavior
 of
 CEOs.


>> Quarterly
 uh
 reporting,
 especially
 in


the
 public
 markets,
 is
 a
 net
 negative


for
 companies,
 for
 investors.
 I
 think


it's
 intended
 to
 provide
 transparency,


but
 it
 it
 ends
 up
 doing
 short-term


thinking.
 What
 am
 I
 going
 to
 do
 to
 drive


the
 results
 this
 quarter?
 And
 you
 see
 it


all
 the
 time,
 right?
 I'm
 going
 to
 try
 to


move
 sales
 into
 this
 quarter.
 I'll
 get
 a


discount
 if
 you
 you
 buy
 my
 product
 this


quarter.
 I
 need
 to
 like
 hit
 my
 number
 or


I'm
 going
 to
 invest
 in
 something
 that
 I


can
 do
 this
 quarter
 or
 next
 quarter
 to


achieve
 it.
 So,
 I
 think
 it
 fundamentally


doesn't
 support
 what's
 best
 for
 the


company
 and
 what's
 best
 for
 the


investor.
 That
 being
 said,
 I
 think
 that


you
 want
 someone
 and
 presumably
 I
 think


the
 CEO
 can
 do
 it
 managing
 the
 business


more
 frequently
 than
 every
 six
 months
 or


every
 year.
 Like
 if
 you're
 only
 going
 to


look
 at
 your
 financials
 or
 your


performance
 once
 a
 year
 or
 once
 every


six
 months,
 I
 think
 you're
 going
 to
 miss


opportunities
 to
 make
 adjustments
 where


needed
 in
 the
 business.
 But
 I
 don't


think
 you
 necessarily
 need
 investors
 to


do
 that
 if
 you
 have
 the
 right
 management


team
 and
 you
 have
 confidence.
 I
 think


the
 challenge
 is
 if
 you
 don't
 have
 the


right
 management
 team,
 are
 you
 getting


visibility
 into
 that
 and
 how
 to
 navigate


it?
 I
 would
 probably
 heir
 on
 side
 of
 not


having
 quarterly
 earnings
 because
 of
 all


the
 negative
 aspects,
 but
 I
 think
 you've


got
 to
 solve
 that
 other
 issue
 in
 terms


of
 are
 you
 managing
 the
 business
 close


enough?


>> Are
 there
 public
 companies
 or
 public


company
 CEOs
 that
 you
 admire?


>> Yeah,
 of
 course.
 I
 mean,
 I
 think
 there's


business
 like
 I
 think
 there's
 different


things
 that
 I'd
 say
 in
 terms
 of


admiring.
 So
 I
 think
 if
 you
 look
 at
 like


Danaher
 that
 business
 you
 Mitch
 Rails


and
 Steve
 Rails
 and
 ultimately
 the
 CEOs


that
 have
 followed
 is
 remarkable
 both


the
 performance
 of
 the
 business
 the


success
 of
 the
 business
 how
 they've
 done


it
 their
 system
 incredibly
 uh
 I
 have
 a


lot
 of
 respect
 for
 them
 I
 mean
 if
 you


look
 at
 Nick
 Howie
 of
 Transdime
 like
 the


performance
 he's
 no
 longer
 CEO
 but
 the


performance
 during
 his
 CEO
 you
 know


tenure
 was
 significant
 I
 mean
 remarkable


performance
 and
 he
 had
 his
 own
 business


system
 in
 terms
 of
 how
 he
 was
 doing
 that


I
 think
 there's
 other
 people
 I
 have


tremendous
 respect
 from
 like
 what


they've
 accomplished.
 I
 mean,
 if
 you


look
 at
 Bezos's
 build
 at
 Amazon,
 I
 mean,


that's
 incredibly
 remarkable
 in
 terms
 of


the
 world
 and
 the
 impact
 that
 it's
 had.


I
 learn
 a
 lot
 from
 other
 people
 who
 have


come
 before
 us
 in
 terms
 of
 how
 they


manage
 and
 what
 they
 do.
 I
 think
 the


pressure
 is
 there's
 a
 lot
 for
 any
 CEO,


especially
 public
 CEOs
 in
 terms


especially
 right
 now
 um
 of
 what
 they're


expected
 to
 have
 a
 view
 on,
 what
 they're


expected
 to
 manage,
 what
 you
 know
 the


consequences
 of
 having
 those
 views
 and


everything.
 I
 think
 is
 particularly


challenging
 for
 any
 CEO
 but
 especially


those
 in
 the
 public
 public
 view.


>> How
 do
 you
 think
 about
 the
 role
 of


politics
 in
 sort
 of
 companies?
 Should


companies
 have
 political
 opinions?


>> I
 don't
 think
 there's
 a
 right
 answer
 or


a
 wrong
 answer
 to
 that.
 I
 think
 you
 need


leaders
 who
 are
 authentic
 and
 genuine


and
 if
 they
 are
 people
 who
 have
 views


and
 share
 those
 views
 or
 want
 to
 share


those
 views
 and
 that's
 key
 to
 who
 they


are
 in
 the
 business,
 I
 think
 that
 I
 can


understand
 why
 they
 do
 that
 and
 the


benefit
 of
 that.
 That
 being
 said,
 I


think
 we're
 in
 a
 very
 divisive
 time


right
 now.
 And
 I
 think
 sometimes
 people


have
 a
 lot
 of
 views
 and
 they
 share
 those


views
 and
 they
 assume
 their
 customers


have
 the
 same
 views.
 And
 sometimes
 I


think
 there's
 businesses
 where
 that
 may


not
 be
 the
 best
 approach
 um
 for
 the


companies.
 By
 and
 large,
 my
 approach
 is


I
 think
 that
 CEOs
 should
 be
 really


thoughtful
 before
 they
 have
 views
 on


topics
 publicly,
 especially
 if
 those
 are


topics
 that
 their
 customers
 or
 their


employees
 may
 have
 differing
 views.
 But


if
 it's,
 you
 know,
 a
 founder
 or
 someone


who
 has
 strong
 views,
 I
 don't
 think
 they


necessarily
 have
 to
 cover
 those
 up


either.
 So,
 I
 think
 it's
 a
 little bit
 of


a
 it
 depends
 answer,
 which
 is
 feels
 like


a
 copout,
 but


>> I
 think
 that's
 the
 best
 answer
 I've


heard
 in
 a
 long
 time.
 Tracy,
 we
 always


end
 these
 interviews
 with
 the
 same


question,
 which
 is
 what
 is
 success
 for


you?
 Yeah,
 I
 mean
 success
 for
 me
 is


really
 leaving
 things
 better
 off
 than
 I


found
 them.
 And
 that
 is
 both
 in
 terms
 of


the
 companies
 I
 work
 with,
 the
 people
 I


engage
 with,
 my
 family,
 building
 my
 own


life
 and
 building
 the
 lives
 around
 me
 of


the
 people
 around
 me
 to
 be
 something


great
 that
 they
 care
 about
 that
 are


special
 that
 are
 impactful
 and
 that
 are


sort
 of
 creating
 value
 for
 them
 and


creating
 value
 for
 those
 around
 them.


>> That's
 a
 beautiful
 answer.
 Thank
 you
 so


much
 for
 taking
 the
 time
 today.


>> Yeah,
 of
 course.


>> Thanks
 for
 listening
 and
 learning
 with


us.
 Until
 next
 time.
