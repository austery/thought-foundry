In
 the
 first
 day,
 I
 think
 we
 added
 like


60K.
 I
 remember
 one
 of
 our
 engineers
 was


like,
 "Guys,
 we
 added
 60K
 today.
 Oh
 my


god."
 And
 you
 I
 jumped
 in
 was
 like,


"Yep,
 it's
 cool,
 but
 like
 this
 is,
 you


know,
 this
 is
 like
 launch
 day.
 This
 is


going
 to
 go
 away."
 And
 that
 didn't


happen.
 Every
 single
 day,
 we
 kept
 adding


more
 and
 more
 ARR.
 In
 the
 first
 2


months,
 we
 went
 from
 0
 to
 20
 million
 of


ARR.
 Everyone
 we
 were
 talking
 to
 had


never
 seen
 anything
 like
 it.
 We
 were


actually
 we
 were
 going to
 go
 out
 of


business
 last
 year.
 You
 know,
 we
 spent


seven
 years
 building
 out
 the
 core


technology
 of
 the
 product.
 couldn't


figure
 out
 how
 to
 actually
 effectively


monetize
 it.
 We
 had
 one
 last
 experiment


that
 we
 ran
 um
 is
 it's
 a
 product
 called


Bolt.
 Finding
 product
 market
 fit.
 It
 is


purely
 how
 many
 people
 you
 talk
 to.
 It


is
 purely
 that
 you
 people
 there
 maybe


early
 in
 their
 product
 career
 to
 kind
 of


have
 lots
 of
 cool
 ideas
 about
 things


they
 could
 build
 and
 whatever
 that
 are


not
 really
 attached
 to
 the
 reality
 of


the
 actual
 end
 user
 customer
 using
 the


product,
 what
 they're
 trying
 to
 do
 with


it,
 the
 challenges
 they're
 currently


running
 into
 with
 it.
 One
 of the
 things


we
 really
 invested
 in
 early
 on
 with
 Bolt


was
 like
 community.
 You
 know,
 we've


hired
 in
 a
 couple
 of
 folks
 who
 their


entire
 job
 is
 just
 talking
 to
 our
 users.


And
 so
 I
 think
 that's
 really
 the
 only


way
 you
 can
 meaningfully
 scale
 the
 full


cycle
 of
 user
 feedback
 is
 just
 having


great
 people
 that
 are
 in
 your
 community


or
 on
 your
 actual
 core
 team.
 That's


their
 entire
 job
 and
 they're
 all
 working


together.
 You
 have
 to
 learn
 how
 to
 be


intellectually
 honest
 with
 yourself.
 And


it's
 like,
 am
 I
 not
 giving
 up
 because


that's
 what
 people
 say
 you
 should
 do,
 or


am
 I
 not
 giving
 up
 because
 I
 actually


really
 like
 I
 have
 conviction
 in
 this


and
 like
 I
 just
 want
 to
 see
 this
 I
 I


really
 want
 to
 see
 this
 made
 possible.
 I


I
 think
 the
 only
 way
 I
 learned
 how
 to


determine
 when
 it
 was
 time
 to
 pivot


versus
 time
 to
 iterate
 was
 just


I'm
 Eric
 Simons.
 I'm
 the
 co-founder
 and


CEO
 of
 Stack
 Blitz
 and
 we're
 the


creators
 of
 Bolt.
 new.
 People
 went
 to


bolt.new,
 typed
 in
 the
 idea
 of
 a
 website


or
 whatever
 that
 they
 wanted
 to
 make,


hit
 enter,
 and
 30
 seconds
 later,
 they


had
 a
 a
 web
 application
 ready
 to
 go.


First
 two
 months
 of
 launching
 Bolt,
 we


went
 from
 0
 to
 20
 million
 of
 ARR.
 The
 3


months
 since
 then,
 we've
 added
 another


20
 million
 of
 ARR
 just
 about,
 and
 we
 now


have
 almost
 4
 million
 registered
 users


and
 are
 continuing
 to
 grow
 like
 a
 weed.


I
 like
 computers
 from
 a
 pretty
 early


age.
 I
 was
 like
 building
 computers
 like


be
 gaming
 computers
 and
 that
 sort
 of


thing.
 That
 was
 actually
 when
 my


co-founder
 and
 I
 met
 was
 when
 we
 were


you
 I
 think
 around
 12
 or
 13.
 The
 first


product
 that
 my
 co-founder
 and
 I
 built.


We
 basically
 built
 a
 version
 of
 Dropbox


before
 Dropbox
 existed.
 And
 this
 is
 back


in
 like
 2006
 or
 7.
 At
 that
 time,
 the
 way


that
 you
 kind
 of
 bring
 your
 digital


documents
 between
 school
 and
 home
 was


like
 USB
 flash
 drives.
 You're
 like
 12
 or


13
 or
 whatever.
 You're
 going
 to
 forget


this,
 right?
 You're
 going to
 leave
 this


at
 home.
 Happened
 all
 the
 time.
 And
 so


we
 had
 the
 idea
 of
 like,
 hey,
 let's
 just


make
 a
 digital
 storage
 service
 that


people
 can
 upload
 their
 homework
 to
 or


whatever.
 And
 it
 took
 off
 like
 wildfire


like
 the
 entire
 many
 school
 districts
 in


Illinois
 and
 just
 kind
 of
 across
 the


Midwest
 started
 using
 this
 thing.
 I


think
 at
 that
 time
 I
 was
 I
 was
 like
 18


or
 19.
 I
 for
 come
 out
 Silicon
 Valley.
 We


had
 gone
 through
 one
 of these


accelerator
 program.
 At
 that
 time
 they


would
 give
 you
 like
 20K.
 So
 we
 went


through
 that
 money
 and
 then
 we're
 out
 of


money
 but
 we
 the
 product
 wasn't
 ready
 to


launch.
 And
 so
 I
 was
 like
 what
 do
 you


do?
 We
 just
 so
 happened
 to
 had
 access
 to


the
 AOL
 building
 at
 that
 time
 because


one
 of
 our
 investors
 said
 was
 renting


office
 space
 out
 of
 there.
 So
 I
 had
 a


key
 card
 to
 get
 into
 the
 AOL
 building


and
 so
 there's
 couches
 here,
 you
 know,
 I


could
 sleep
 on
 the
 couch,
 there's
 a
 gym


and
 so
 they
 have
 showers.
 I
 was
 19.


Expectations
 for
 quality
 of
 of
 living


are
 pretty
 low,
 I
 think,
 at
 that
 age.


And
 so
 I
 I
 ended
 up
 just,
 you
 know,


starting
 to
 live
 out
 of
 out
 of
 their


headquarters.
 I
 I
 would
 I
 was
 just


coding
 from
 9:00
 a.m.
 to
 11:00
 p.m.


12:00
 p.m.
 I
 did
 that
 for
 like
 I
 think


like
 4
 months
 um
 until
 they
 they


eventually
 someone
 like
 someone
 finally


caught
 on
 that
 I
 was
 living
 in
 their


headquarters
 and
 they
 they
 found
 me
 and


threw
 me
 out
 at
 like
 5:00
 in
 the


morning.
 I
 didn't
 know
 anyone
 in
 Silicon


Valley.
 I'm
 not
 from
 California.
 I
 went


and
 like
 slept
 on
 a
 table
 at
 Starbucks


until
 they
 opened.


Thinking
 was
 a
 company
 that
 we
 didn't


really
 intend
 to
 be
 a
 company.


Basically,
 we
 had
 a
 whole
 bunch
 of


different
 startup
 ideas
 we
 were
 trying


on
 the
 side.
 We
 were
 building
 lots
 of


different
 web
 applications
 as
 a
 result


for
 each
 of
 these
 startups
 to
 stay


afloat.
 We
 were
 like,
 "Okay,
 you
 know,


we
 actually
 know
 a
 lot
 about
 building


web
 applications
 cuz
 we're
 we're
 doing


it
 so
 much.
 We
 could
 probably
 like
 teach


folks
 online
 and,
 you
 know,
 charge
 for


like
 our
 courses
 and
 and
 make
 money
 to


keep
 us
 afloat
 so
 we
 can
 keep
 trying


other
 ideas."
 Kind
 of
 the
 funny
 thing
 is


like
 of
 all
 the
 things
 we
 were
 working


on
 at
 that
 time,
 Thinkster
 was
 the
 most


successful
 of
 all
 of
 them.
 We
 were


teaching
 a
 lot
 of
 people.
 We
 had
 like
 I


think
 it's
 at
 like
 100,000
 something


people
 that
 were
 you
 know
 using
 this


site
 uh
 to
 learn
 how
 to
 do
 web


development.
 And
 the
 biggest
 problem
 the


people
 learning
 were
 having.
 I
 mean
 this


is
 common
 with
 anyone
 that's
 learning


how
 to
 program
 is
 not
 even
 like
 learning


how
 to
 write
 the
 code
 but
 it's
 actually


setting
 up
 your
 development
 environment


which
 is
 basically
 mean
 setting
 up
 your


computer
 to
 be
 able
 to
 even
 like
 run


code.
 That
 is
 a
 huge
 huge
 huge
 challenge


whether
 you're
 like
 a
 beginner
 or
 you're


an
 advanced
 developer.
 We
 were
 running


into
 this
 problem
 with
 the
 people
 using


Thinkster
 of
 they
 they
 just
 couldn't
 get


the
 stuff
 set
 up
 in
 their
 environment
 to


even
 learn
 how
 to
 write
 the
 code.
 And
 we


had
 the
 realization
 like
 okay
 actually


it
 should
 be
 possible
 theoretically
 to


just
 kind
 of
 like
 run
 an
 entire
 dev


environment
 inside
 of
 the
 browser


itself.
 You
 know
 not
 using
 servers,
 not


install
 anything
 locally
 like
 we
 can


actually
 run
 it
 in
 a
 web
 page,
 you
 know,


inside
 of
 a
 browser
 tab.
 And
 we
 were


looking
 at
 all
 these
 different


technologies
 that
 have
 released
 in


browsers
 and
 we
 were
 like
 someone
 must


have
 done
 this
 already,
 right?
 Like
 cuz


we
 we
 were
 just
 trying
 to
 solve
 our
 own


problem.
 We
 weren't
 trying
 to
 start
 a


company
 like
 we
 were
 just
 trying
 to


teach
 people
 on
 Thinkster.
 We
 looked


around
 and
 there
 was
 just
 nothing.
 There


is
 nothing
 that
 could
 actually
 do
 it.
 I


kind
 of
 knew
 that
 this
 is
 like
 something


very
 different
 at
 that
 point
 because
 it,


you
 know,
 it's
 like
 I'd
 never
 run
 it


across
 something
 like
 this
 where
 I
 kind


of
 technically
 knew
 the
 underpinnings


that
 this
 should
 be
 possible,
 but
 yet
 no


one
 had
 gone
 and
 done
 it.
 That
 key


insight
 was
 really
 what
 led
 us
 to
 start


stacks
 cuz
 we
 were
 like,
 "Okay,
 well


that
 would
 be
 huge
 for
 people
 learning


how
 to
 code
 to
 not
 have
 to
 set
 up


environments.
 It
 would
 make
 it
 way
 more


accessible.
 people
 could
 just
 use
 this


as
 an
 environment
 to
 just
 keep
 building


in
 like
 why
 would
 you
 even
 need
 to
 set


up
 a
 local
 environment
 necessarily.
 So


that
 was
 kind
 of
 the
 origin
 story
 of


stacks
 and
 it
 came
 out
 of
 thankster


directly.


We
 had
 spent
 half
 a
 decade
 building


building
 out
 this
 technology.
 The
 the


problem
 is
 that
 anyone
 that
 really


understands
 how
 to
 write
 software


already
 knows
 how
 to
 get
 stuff
 set
 up
 on


their
 local
 computer
 and
 will
 tend
 to


actually
 just
 gravitate
 towards
 that


because
 they
 are
 super
 familiar
 with
 it.


The
 issue
 is
 if
 you're
 going
 to
 build


something
 that's
 web-
 based
 that
 is


getting
 people
 to
 actually
 leave
 their


their
 environment
 is
 a
 huge
 challenge.


We
 tried
 out
 a
 whole
 bunch
 of
 different


experiments
 um
 over
 the
 course
 of
 the


past,
 you
 know,
 2
 years
 or
 whatever.
 All


of
 them
 were
 very
 cool.
 generally
 like


the
 people
 that
 that
 try
 these
 things


out
 thought
 they
 were
 really
 awesome
 but


it
 didn't
 move
 the
 needle
 from
 like
 a
 a


monetization
 standpoint.
 My
 co-ounder


and
 I
 have
 like
 talked
 about
 you
 know
 do


should
 we
 pack
 it
 in
 shut
 down
 the


company
 and
 so
 that
 was
 you
 know
 like


last
 year
 we
 made
 the
 decision
 my


co-founder
 and
 I
 um
 with
 our
 with
 our


board
 and
 stuff
 of
 like
 okay
 we're
 going


to
 spend
 the
 rest
 of
 this
 year
 going
 and


trying
 everything
 that
 we
 think
 is
 cool


idea
 and
 and
 if
 that
 doesn't
 work
 out


we'll
 have
 left
 no
 stone
 unturned
 and


we'll
 go
 and
 kind
 of
 prepare
 to
 kind
 of


start
 spinning
 things
 down.
 How
 would
 I


walk
 away
 from
 this
 knowing
 that
 I
 I


gave
 it
 everything
 I
 had?
 Like
 last
 year


when
 as
 this
 was
 kind
 of
 going
 on
 with


the
 company,
 I
 also
 had
 my
 first
 child


and
 if
 you
 talk
 to
 anyone
 that
 has
 a


kid,
 you
 don't
 get
 a
 lot
 of
 sleep.
 It's


pretty
 high
 stress.
 So,
 I
 had
 a
 lot
 of


challenges
 kind
 of
 going
 on
 just
 from


the
 personal
 side,
 the
 work
 side.
 I
 woke


up
 one
 morning
 last
 April
 after
 my


daughter
 was
 born
 and
 I
 was
 like,
 I'm


going
 to
 do
 an
 iron
 man,
 like
 a
 full


iron
 man.
 And
 and
 I
 and
 it
 was
 like
 6


months
 from
 that.
 I
 never
 ran
 a
 marathon


or
 whatever.
 the
 six
 months
 um
 you
 know


of
 last
 year
 I
 was
 kind
 of
 bringing
 full


intensity
 to
 every
 part
 of
 my
 life
 like


physically
 going
 and
 training
 for
 this


thing
 mentally
 with
 with
 my
 job
 uh
 going


and
 you
 know
 really
 figuring
 out
 leaving


no
 stone
 unturned
 and
 just
 trying
 a
 lots


of
 different
 experiments
 etc
 and
 so
 kind


of
 bringing
 full
 intensity
 to
 those


things
 and
 and
 I
 got
 to
 tell
 you
 I've


never
 been
 happier
 in
 my
 life
 um
 I've


never
 been
 happier
 in
 my
 life
 really


investing
 in
 in
 myself
 my
 co-workers
 and


my
 products
 and
 my
 family
 and
 my


business
 with
 just
 such
 uh
 intense


dedication
 and
 I
 is
 okay
 with
 whatever


the
 outcome
 was.
 If
 we
 end
 the
 year
 and,


you
 know,
 our
 destiny
 is
 the
 same,
 so
 be


it.
 Let
 the
 the
 universe,
 you
 know,
 let


the
 universe
 decide,
 right?
 Um,
 I've


done
 everything
 that
 I
 possibly
 can
 do.


And
 Bolt
 was
 like
 the
 last
 the
 last


experiment
 we
 had
 before
 we're
 going
 to


kind
 of
 start
 winding
 things
 down.
 Uh,


what
 Bolt
 allows
 you
 to
 do
 is
 like
 to


actually,
 you
 know,
 using
 just
 text,
 you


can
 type
 in
 an
 idea
 of
 an
 app
 or
 a


website
 you
 want,
 it'll
 build
 it.
 The


launch
 strategy
 for
 Bolt
 was
 like
 we
 put


out
 a
 tweet.
 Like
 that
 was
 it.
 There
 was


no
 blog
 post.
 There's
 no
 press
 release.


So
 there's
 just
 like
 a
 tweet
 and
 and


that
 tweet
 ended
 up
 going
 viral.
 So
 what


ended
 up
 happening
 is
 people
 they
 saw


our
 tweet,
 they
 went
 to
 bolt.new,
 typed


in
 the
 idea
 of
 a
 website
 or
 whatever


that
 they
 wanted
 to
 make,
 hit
 enter,
 and


30
 seconds
 later
 they
 had
 a
 a
 web


application
 ready
 to
 go.
 In
 the
 first


day,
 I
 think
 we
 added
 like
 60K.
 I


remember
 one
 of
 our
 engineers
 was
 like,


"Guys,
 we
 added
 60K
 today.
 Oh
 my
 god."


And
 you
 I
 jumped
 in
 was
 like,
 "Yep,
 it's


cool,
 but
 like
 this
 is,
 you
 know,
 this


is
 like
 launch
 day.
 This
 is
 going
 to
 go


away."
 And
 that
 didn't
 happen.
 Every


single
 day,
 we
 kept
 adding
 more
 and
 more


ARR.
 In
 the
 first
 2
 months,
 we
 went
 from


0
 to
 20
 million
 of
 ARR.
 Everyone
 we
 were


talking
 to
 had
 never
 seen
 anything
 like


it.
 It
 was,
 I
 mean,
 just
 an
 unbelievable


shift
 in
 the
 destiny
 of
 of
 our
 company.

So
 I'd
 actually
 had
 the
 idea
 for
 Bolt


about
 a
 year
 ago,
 February
 of
 24.
 At


that
 time,
 the
 Frontier
 models
 like


OpenAI
 or
 whatever
 have
 you.
 You
 we
 had


actually
 tried
 to
 build
 a
 prototype
 with


Bolt.
 We
 spent
 a
 couple
 of
 weeks
 doing


that.
 What
 we
 ended
 up
 finding
 was
 the


output
 just
 was
 not
 good
 enough.
 Like


you
 would
 tell
 it
 to
 build
 an
 app
 and
 it


just
 oftent
 times
 it
 would
 be
 broken
 or


it
 wouldn't
 look
 good.
 it
 wouldn't


function
 properly,
 which
 kind
 of
 like


ruins
 the
 experience.
 So,
 we
 we
 put
 that


project
 on
 the
 shelf
 and
 we're
 like,


"Okay,
 maybe
 we'll
 come
 back
 to
 this
 at


some
 point
 in
 the
 future
 when
 when
 these


AI
 models
 get
 better."
 Back
 in
 May,
 we


just
 so
 happened
 to
 kind
 of
 get
 a
 sneak


preview
 of
 the
 new
 stuff
 that
 was
 coming


from
 Enthropic
 with
 Sonnet
 3.5
 coding


model
 that
 has
 changed
 software


development
 period.
 You
 we
 got
 a
 kind
 of


sneak
 peek
 of
 it
 and
 we
 were
 like,
 "This


is
 good.
 I
 mean,
 this
 is
 going
 to
 change


everything
 we
 think."
 And
 so
 we
 kind
 of


pulled
 the
 pulled
 bull
 off
 the
 shelf
 and


yeah
 took
 the
 the
 latest
 APIs
 from


Enthropic
 pulled
 them
 together
 and


launched
 it
 within
 90
 days
 of
 that
 back


after
 chatbt
 had
 launched
 a
 lot
 of


companies
 were
 just
 kind
 of
 like
 adding


AI
 stuff
 to
 their
 products
 and
 not
 even


in
 a
 very
 thoughtful
 way
 but
 it
 was
 kind


of
 like
 people
 just
 wanted
 to
 be
 like


relevant
 and
 kind
 of
 you
 know
 show
 that


they
 were
 had
 an
 AI
 strategy
 and
 we


didn't
 cuz
 we
 were
 just
 like
 we
 don't


see
 the
 value
 of
 this.
 it's
 not
 clear


how
 this
 is
 actually
 going
 to
 make
 the


experience
 that
 much
 better,
 right?
 And


all
 of
 our
 competitors
 went
 were
 you


churning
 on
 AI
 ideas.
 We
 held
 off
 u


because
 we
 just
 didn't
 see
 we
 didn't


have
 conviction
 on
 it.
 I
 think
 in
 in


retrospect
 the
 right
 move
 and
 when
 we


did
 find
 the
 right
 thing,
 we
 went
 all


in.
 And
 you
 kind
 of
 look
 at
 like
 the


competitors
 that
 we
 were
 going
 up


against
 then
 versus
 now
 it's
 like
 a
 lot


of
 them
 have
 either
 shut
 down
 some
 of


them
 have
 kind
 of
 started
 to
 pivot
 to
 AI


but
 like
 from
 like
 a
 user
 and
 revenue


perspective
 it's
 like
 bolt
 is
 the
 number


one
 thing


you
 know
 we
 get
 thousands
 of
 emails
 and


tickets
 and
 tweets
 and
 etc
 per
 day


sorting
 the
 the
 signal
 from
 the
 noise
 is


is
 you
 know
 very
 difficult
 challenge
 But


one
 of the
 things
 we
 really
 invested
 in


early
 on
 with
 Bolt
 was
 like
 community.


Like
 we
 have
 a
 very
 great
 community


around
 Bolt
 where
 you
 know
 folks
 really


love
 the
 product
 and
 there's
 these


people
 that
 that
 are
 really
 smart,


genuine,
 awesome
 folks
 that
 have
 stepped


up
 and
 really
 became
 like
 kind
 of


leaders
 in
 this
 community.
 Yeah.
 So


that's
 really
 how
 we've
 been
 able
 to


scale
 the
 both
 the
 support
 but
 also
 the


product
 feedback
 function
 because
 these


are
 folks
 that
 are
 like
 in
 our
 Discord


or
 Reddit
 or
 Twitter
 or
 whatever
 and


they're
 hearing
 what
 people
 are
 running


into.
 then
 they
 themselves
 might
 be


running
 into
 it
 and
 they'll
 and
 they'll


be
 like,
 "Hey,
 this
 is
 something
 we're


hearing
 a
 lot
 of.
 Here's
 maybe
 how
 you


you
 guys
 go
 about
 fixing
 it,
 etc."
 And


we
 also
 have
 people
 on
 our
 team
 who,
 you


know,
 we've
 hired
 in
 a
 couple
 of
 folks


who
 their
 entire
 job
 is
 just
 talking
 to


our
 users,
 helping
 them
 get
 unstuck
 with


stuff,
 hearing
 their
 feedback,
 etc.
 And


so,
 I
 think
 that's
 really
 the
 only
 way


you
 can
 meaningfully
 scale,
 you
 know,


uh,
 support
 and
 and
 the
 the
 full
 cycle


of
 user
 feedback
 is
 just
 having
 great


people
 that
 are
 in
 your
 community
 or,


you
 know,
 on
 your
 uh,
 actual
 core
 team.


That's
 their
 entire
 job
 and
 they're
 all


working
 together.
 You
 know,
 just
 bring


in
 all
 the
 data
 points,
 make
 good


decisions,
 and
 get
 the
 proper
 things


prioritized
 in
 the
 product.
 We
 like
 to


work
 on
 things
 that
 users
 have


specifically
 either
 like
 really
 asked


for
 where
 it's
 a
 big
 a
 big
 pain
 point
 or


alternatively,
 it's
 something
 that
 we've


validated
 that
 people
 want.
 I
 think
 it's


very
 easy
 for
 entrepreneurs
 and
 yeah,


people
 that
 are
 maybe
 early
 in
 their


product
 career
 to
 kind
 of
 have
 lots
 of


cool
 ideas
 about
 things
 they
 could
 build


and
 whatever
 that
 are
 not
 really


attached
 to
 the
 reality
 of
 the
 actual


end
 user
 customer
 using
 the
 product,


what
 they're
 trying
 to
 do
 with
 it,
 the


challenges
 they're
 currently
 running


into
 with
 it.
 And
 so
 a
 lot
 of
 this
 comes


down
 to
 just
 experience
 and
 like


fortunately
 we've
 been
 doing
 this
 for
 a


long
 time.
 Like
 my
 co-founder
 and
 I
 have


been
 building
 stuff
 for
 almost
 20
 years.


You
 know,
 having
 a
 good
 sense
 of
 these


are
 cool
 ideas,
 but
 we
 should
 probably


get
 to
 them
 later.
 These
 are
 really


important
 ideas.
 We
 should
 do
 them
 now.


These
 are
 really
 important
 high
 priority


things.
 They
 need
 to
 be
 fixed
 and
 you


know
 uh
 sorting
 accordingly


and
 and
 one
 of
 the
 interesting
 things


too
 actually
 about
 what
 we
 did
 is
 we


actually
 open
 sourced
 the
 core
 version


of
 bullet
 when
 we
 launched
 and
 like
 even


today
 it's
 like
 I
 think
 it's
 like
 the


most
 popular
 AI
 product
 you
 know
 by


users
 of
 revenue
 that
 actually
 has
 an


open
 source
 version.
 Like
 there's


nothing
 else
 out
 there
 that
 really
 has


that
 other
 than
 us.
 But
 it
 was
 clear
 to


us
 was
 like
 this
 is
 this
 is
 knowledge


that
 someone's
 going
 to
 open
 source
 this


at
 some
 point
 and
 we
 think
 it'll
 just
 be


actually
 a
 lot
 better
 for
 us
 and
 the
 AI


model
 providers
 etc.
 if
 this
 is


available
 for
 people
 to
 try
 out
 and
 fork


and
 improve
 and
 whatever
 have
 you
 which


ended
 up
 being
 a
 really
 key
 decision
 cuz


a
 lot
 of
 people
 use
 Bolt
 because
 they


can
 play
 around
 with
 the
 open
 source


version
 and
 fork
 fork
 it
 and
 make
 it


better
 and
 you
 know
 whatever
 have
 you.


We've
 invested
 a
 ton
 in
 the
 open-
 source


world
 in
 large
 part
 because
 like
 our


product
 really
 wouldn't
 work
 without


amazing
 open
 source
 software
 that's
 been


built
 for
 web
 development
 and
 and


otherwise.
 For
 us,
 it's
 you
 it's
 also


really
 important
 that
 that
 those
 people


building
 different
 web
 development
 tool


chains
 like
 Vit
 or
 whatever
 have
 you


also
 care
 about
 us
 and
 they
 want
 to
 make


sure
 that
 their
 these
 open
 source


projects
 work
 well
 in
 our
 technology
 and


our
 environment.
 And
 that's
 been
 really


key
 for
 us.
 Yeah,
 we
 became
 the
 largest


backer
 of
 Vit
 back
 in
 2021.
 We
 have


multiple
 people
 on
 our
 team
 that
 all


they
 do
 is
 work
 on
 open
 source
 full-time


you.
 So
 I
 think
 uh
 developers
 love
 our


products.
 I
 think
 in
 some
 part
 because


we
 genuinely
 care
 about
 open
 source
 and


ensuring
 that
 folks
 uh
 working
 on
 open


source
 get
 compensated
 and
 have
 a
 way
 to


actually
 continue
 working
 on
 it
 in
 a


sustainable
 way.


I
 I
 think
 the
 only
 way
 I
 learned
 how
 to


determine
 when
 it
 was
 time
 to
 pivot


versus
 time
 to
 iterate
 was
 just
 trying
 a


lot
 of
 startup
 ideas.
 like
 that
 was
 you


over
 the
 course
 of
 like
 a
 decade
 through


that
 I
 kind
 of
 I
 I
 ended
 up
 building
 a


good
 gut
 instinct
 of
 when
 when
 we
 were


kind
 of
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 line
 on
 a


certain
 idea
 and
 it
 was
 like
 okay
 we


need
 to
 like
 pivot
 and
 try
 something


else
 instead.
 So
 my
 recommendation
 would


be
 to
 to
 if
 you
 think
 you
 need
 to
 go


deep
 on
 something
 and
 go
 along,
 do
 it.


And
 typically
 you're
 gonna
 you're
 you're


eventually
 going
 to
 find
 out
 one
 way
 or


the
 other
 if
 you
 were
 right
 or
 wrong
 and


then
 you
 learn
 from
 that.
 And
 and
 then


then
 if
 you
 were
 wrong,
 if
 you're
 like,


"Hey,
 we
 went
 really
 deep
 and
 it
 didn't


pan
 out."
 You
 have
 to
 just
 take
 that
 as


a
 lesson
 as
 part
 of
 the
 journey.
 When
 I


was
 younger
 and
 heard
 people
 give
 the


advice
 that
 I'm
 giving
 right
 now,
 the


takeaway
 that
 I
 would
 take
 then
 was


okay,
 so
 just
 don't
 give
 up
 like
 like
 no


matter
 what,
 just
 kind
 of
 like
 hold
 on


to
 this
 idea
 and
 don't
 give
 up,
 which
 is


like
 like
 I
 think
 generally


directionally
 good
 advice.
 But
 there's


actually
 like
 kind
 of
 a
 line
 where
 you


have
 to
 learn
 how
 to
 be
 intellectually


honest
 with
 yourself
 and
 it's
 like
 am
 I


am
 I
 not
 giving
 up
 because
 because


that's
 what
 people
 say
 you
 should
 do
 or


am
 I
 not
 giving
 up
 because
 I
 actually


really
 like
 I
 have
 conviction
 in
 this


and
 like
 I
 just
 want
 to
 see
 this
 I
 I


really
 want
 to
 see
 this
 made
 possible


and
 then
 seeing
 it
 all
 the
 way
 through


right
 cuz
 I
 think
 when
 you're
 when


you're
 starting
 and
 you're
 trying
 to


find
 that
 passion
 in
 that's
 kind
 of
 one


challenge
 and
 then
 the
 other
 side
 of
 is


you
 know
 we
 saw
 which
 is
 okay
 we
 built


this
 amazing
 thing
 Now,
 how
 do
 you


actually
 turn
 into
 a
 business?
 The


important
 part
 there
 is,
 you
 know,
 when


you're
 driving
 through
 hell,
 don't
 stop.


If
 you're
 going
 to
 go
 and
 and
 build
 a


business,
 go
 and
 try
 all
 the
 way
 through


and
 don't
 leave
 any
 stones
 unturned


because
 what
 you
 don't
 want
 then
 is
 to


look
 back
 and
 go,
 "Ah,
 man,
 we
 had
 this


really
 cool
 thing.
 I
 think
 it
 could
 have


been
 really,
 really
 important,
 but
 we


didn't
 actually
 we
 didn't
 do
 a
 full
 core


press
 and
 really
 make
 sure
 that
 we


exhausted
 all
 options
 before,
 you
 know,


spinning
 down
 or
 whatever.


AI's
 impact
 on
 software
 development
 is


uh
 I
 mean
 huge
 like
 I
 think
 I
 think
 it's


it's
 clear
 at
 this
 point
 that
 software


development
 is
 going
 to
 be
 probably
 the


number
 one
 application
 of
 AI
 that
 as
 far


as
 like
 a
 high
 leverage
 uh
 high
 impact


high
 revenue
 sort
 of
 thing.
 All
 the


world's
 software
 I
 think
 is
 going
 to
 be


meaningfully
 written
 by
 AI
 in
 years.
 I


think
 I
 think
 probably
 you
 know


singledigit
 sort
 of
 years.
 That
 doesn't


mean
 that
 software
 developers
 are
 going


away.
 There's
 a
 lot
 of
 things
 in


software
 development
 that
 are
 just


monotonous
 and
 not
 intellectually


challenging,
 right?
 It's
 just
 common


stuff
 that
 you're
 having
 to
 do
 to
 build


an
 application
 and
 AI
 just
 kind
 of


obliterates
 all
 that.
 Can
 just
 take
 care


of
 all
 that
 stuff
 for
 you
 so
 you
 can


actually
 work
 on
 like
 more
 complicated


high
 high
 value
 intellectually


challenging
 sort
 of
 tasks.
 And
 so
 I


think
 we're
 continue
 to
 see
 more
 and


more
 of
 that,
 right?
 We're
 see
 more
 and


more
 software
 built
 and
 it's
 also
 it's


enabling
 people
 to
 that
 are
 not
 software


developers
 to
 actually
 go
 and
 build


software,
 right?
 Whether
 you
 have
 an


idea
 for
 a
 website
 or
 an
 app
 like
 you


can
 go
 to
 Bolt
 today
 and
 do
 that.
 The


next
 5
 years
 of
 Bolt
 I
 think
 is
 it's


it's
 going
 to
 be
 something
 that
 from
 the


Fortune
 100
 to
 10year-olds
 people
 are


building
 the
 future
 of
 how
 you
 you
 know


stream
 movies
 online,
 how
 you
 check
 your


bank
 account
 using
 a
 mobile
 app
 to
 a


game
 that
 a
 10-year-old
 had
 the
 idea
 of,


right?
 All
 these
 things
 and
 some
 of
 that


stuff
 you
 can
 even
 do
 now
 with
 Folk,


right?
 But
 the
 the
 quality
 and
 the
 scale


of
 which
 you're
 going to
 be able
 to
 do


this
 stuff
 is
 going
 to
 be
 giant,
 right?


compared
 to
 to
 what
 you
 can
 do
 now.


Yeah.
