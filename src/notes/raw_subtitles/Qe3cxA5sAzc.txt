You
 said
 the
 Federal
 Reserve
 is
 going
 to


start
 expanding
 its
 balance
 sheet.


>> My
 guess
 is
 that
 my
 guess
 is
 that
 they


will
 have
 to
 otherwise
 they
 will
 lose


control
 over
 the
 the
 repo
 market
 and


they
 don't
 want
 that
 to
 happen.


>> Joseph,
 great
 to
 see
 you.
 Welcome
 back


to
 Monetary
 Matters.


>> Thanks
 so
 much
 for
 inviting
 me.
 It's
 a


pleasure
 to
 be
 here
 and
 congratulations


on
 the
 success
 on
 your
 show.
 Such
 great


guests
 over
 the
 past
 few
 months.


>> Appreciate
 you
 saying
 that.
 Joseph,


obviously
 you're
 writing
 at
 fedgu.com.


You
 used
 to
 be
 a
 senior
 trader
 for
 the


New
 York
 Federal
 Reserve,
 which
 is


where,
 you
 know,
 the
 bulk
 of
 the


monetary
 operations
 go.
 Just
 coming
 out


of
 the
 Federal
 Reserve
 meeting,
 we
 had


the
 interest
 rate
 cut
 from
 4.1%
 roughly


to
 to
 3.8%
 roughly.
 A
 lot
 of
 questions


about
 what
 the
 the
 Federal
 Reserve
 is


going
 to
 do
 in
 December.
 Is
 there
 going


to
 be
 a
 cut?
 The
 market
 was
 pricing
 a


cut.
 Pal
 said,
 "Not
 so
 fast."
 Uh
 his


exact
 words
 were
 a
 cut
 in
 December
 is


not
 a
 foregone
 conclusion.
 Far
 from
 it.


which
 for
 Jay
 Powell
 that's
 basically


saying
 like
 did
 I
 stutter?
 You
 know


that's
 a
 that's
 a
 big
 big
 bombshell.
 But


Joseph
 want
 to
 set
 aside
 rates
 for
 a


second.
 You
 know
 the
 20
 minute
 30-minut


mark
 we
 we'll
 talk
 more
 about
 rates.


Want
 to
 start
 out
 with
 the
 balance
 sheet


and
 money
 market
 which
 is
 your


expertise.
 That's
 what
 you
 were
 doing
 at


at
 the
 New
 York
 Fed.
 Powell
 dropped
 a


big
 announcement
 that
 the
 Federal


Reserve's
 reduction
 in
 its
 balance
 sheet


or
 quantitative
 tightening
 QT
 is
 going


to
 be
 effectively
 over
 on
 December
 1st.


So
 break
 this
 down
 for
 our
 audience
 here


today.
 what's
 the
 significance
 of
 it
 and


what's
 your
 interpretation
 of
 the
 the


specific
 mechanics?


>> First,
 I'll
 talk
 a
 little
 bit
 about
 why


they
 start
 they're
 stopping
 QT
 and
 then


I'll
 talk
 about
 the
 much
 more
 much


bigger
 question
 that
 is
 what
 the
 final


composition
 of
 the
 Fed's
 balance
 sheet


is
 going
 to
 be
 going
 forward
 because


that's
 the
 part
 that's
 actually
 going
 to


have
 a
 market
 impact.
 So,
 the
 Fed
 has


been
 shrinking
 its
 balance
 sheet
 through


QT
 for
 some
 time.
 And
 when
 they
 shrink


their
 balance
 sheet,
 what
 they're
 doing


is
 they're
 solely
 withdrawing
 liquidity


out
 of
 the
 financial
 system.
 Now
 they


want
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 their
 balance


sheet
 is
 just
 small
 enough
 so
 that
 the


banking
 system
 has
 enough
 uh
 cash
 to


function.
 Now
 a
 bank
 holds
 deposits
 at


the
 Fed.
 They're
 called
 reserves.
 So


that's
 what
 they're
 thinking
 about.
 Now


the
 problem
 is
 that
 the
 Fed
 doesn't


actually
 know
 what
 the
 right
 size
 uh


well
 right
 size
 for
 their
 balance


sheeting
 is
 or
 another
 way
 of
 saying


this
 is
 how
 many
 reserves
 banking
 system


needs.
 Now
 they
 have
 models
 and
 so
 forth


but
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day
 they
 don't


really
 know.
 Now,
 the
 last
 time
 they
 did


QT,
 they
 kept
 shrinking
 their
 balance


sheet.
 And
 in
 September
 of
 2019,
 there


was
 a
 tremendous
 spike
 in
 the
 repo


market
 that
 forced
 them
 to
 intervene.


Now,
 the
 Fed
 thinks
 that
 one
 of
 the


reasons
 why
 there's
 that
 huge
 spike
 in


the
 repo
 market
 back
 then
 was
 because


they
 overdid
 QT.
 So,
 they're
 very
 eager


to
 avoid
 that
 right
 now.
 So,
 when


they're
 looking
 at
 whether
 or
 not


they're
 shrinking
 their
 balance
 sheet


too
 much,
 they
 look
 at
 market
 rates,


specifically
 market
 rates
 in
 short-term


funding
 markets
 like
 repo
 rates
 and
 the


federal
 funds
 rate.
 Now,
 over
 the
 past


few
 months,
 what
 we've
 seen
 is
 that
 uh


the
 reverse
 repo
 facility
 balances
 have


gone
 down
 slowly
 and
 now
 are
 basically


around
 zero.
 So
 reverse
 repo
 facility
 is


basically
 a
 place
 where
 money
 market


funds
 park
 their
 excess
 cash
 and
 the
 Fed


looks
 at
 it
 as
 kind
 of
 a
 repository
 of


excess
 liquidity
 in
 the
 financial


system.
 So
 when
 that
 facility
 went
 to


zero
 repo
 rates
 began
 to
 gradually
 drift


higher
 and
 over
 the
 past
 few
 weeks


they've
 traded
 higher
 than
 Fed
 funds
 and


higher
 than
 interest
 on
 reserves.
 That


sends
 a
 strong
 signal
 to
 the
 Fed
 that


you
 know
 maybe
 we
 should
 stop
 doing
 this


QT
 and
 that's
 what
 Cher
 Powell
 mentioned


today.


Now
 QT
 has
 actually
 uh
 been
 tapered
 over


the
 past
 few
 months.
 So
 it's
 really
 not


a
 big
 deal
 in
 the
 market
 anymore.
 Uh
 but


they
 noted
 today
 that
 they're
 going
 to


stop
 it
 effective
 December.
 So
 that's


kind
 of
 the
 big
 thing
 they
 did
 with


their
 balance
 sheet.
 Now
 from
 my


perspective
 when
 I
 look
 at
 repo
 rates


and
 since
 the
 Fed
 likes
 to
 focus
 on


this,
 if
 you're
 at
 the
 Federal
 Reserve,


one
 of
 the
 most
 important
 things
 you
 can


do
 is
 you
 have
 to
 control
 short-term


interest
 rates
 because
 that's
 how
 you


adjust
 policy,
 right?
 you're
 trying
 to


toggle
 short-term
 interest
 rates
 to


adjust
 the
 financial
 conditions
 through


the
 wider
 uh
 market
 and
 impact
 the
 real


economy.
 So,
 your
 bread
 and
 butter
 is


being
 able
 to
 control
 short-term


interest
 rates.
 So,
 repo
 rates
 are
 part


of
 that
 complex
 and
 it's
 driven
 by


supply
 and
 demand
 like
 anything
 else.


Part
 of
 the
 supply
 of
 funding
 available


to
 lend
 and
 repo
 is
 related
 to
 the
 size


of
 the
 Fed's
 balance
 sheet.
 That's


that's
 definitely
 true
 there.
 But
 the


demand
 though,
 that's
 largely
 because


the
 United
 States
 runs
 a
 2
 trillion


fiscal
 deficit
 and
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the


day,
 some
 of
 the
 people
 who
 buy
 the


Treasury
 debt
 finances
 those
 purchases


uh
 in
 the
 repo
 market.
 So
 that's
 kind
 of


necessary
 because
 let's
 say
 that
 you're


issuing
 $2
 trillion
 in
 debt.
 Let's
 say


that
 you
 you're
 you're
 um
 you
 know
 the


US
 Treasury,
 you
 show
 up
 to
 the
 market,


you
 sell
 like
 10
 billion.
 Most
 people


don't
 have
 that
 lying
 uh
 you
 know
 under


a
 couch
 or
 in
 their
 pocket
 or
 something


like
 that.
 So
 you
 need
 someone
 who's
 be


able
 to
 elastically
 expand
 their
 balance


sheet.
 So
 buy
 that
 on
 leverage
 because


if
 you
 buy
 it
 on
 leverage
 you
 get
 the


money
 instantly,
 right?
 You
 don't
 have


to
 rely
 on
 you
 know
 inflows
 from
 your


investors
 or
 premium
 payments
 from
 your


uh
 insurance
 people
 who
 buy
 insurance


from
 you.
 So
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day
 uh
 a


lot
 of
 the
 purchases
 in
 the
 cash


treasury
 market
 uh
 to
 finance
 the
 US


Treasury
 are
 funded
 in
 the
 repo
 market


and
 as
 you
 have
 tremendous
 uh
 issuance


demand
 for
 repo
 increases.
 So
 the
 Fed


right
 now
 they're
 stopping
 their
 balance


sheet
 thinking
 that
 you
 know
 this
 is


this
 is
 going
 to
 have
 an
 impact
 on
 uh


repo
 rates
 but
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day
 as


long
 as
 the
 fiscal
 deficit
 continues
 to


grow
 you
 have
 increasing
 demand
 for
 repo


funding.
 And
 so
 rates
 are
 going
 to
 go


higher.
 So
 my
 expectation
 is
 that
 uh


they're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 be
 adding


liquidity
 into
 the
 financial
 system


shortly.
 And
 they
 can
 do
 this
 in
 a


couple
 ways.
 One
 thing
 that's
 different


this
 time
 compared
 to
 the
 past
 is
 that


they
 have
 something
 called
 a
 standing


repo
 facility.
 And
 what
 that
 means
 is


that
 uh
 if
 you
 are
 a
 securities
 dealer,


you
 can
 go
 and
 borrow
 from
 the
 Fed
 uh
 in


borrow
 repo
 from
 the
 Fed
 basically


anytime
 you
 want.
 and
 they've
 been
 doing


that
 but
 really
 not
 a
 lot
 and
 also


obviously
 not
 enough
 to
 constrain
 the


repo
 rates
 and
 there
 are
 probably


technical
 technical
 reasons
 for
 that
 um


with
 regard
 to


okay
 super
 in
 the
 weeds
 but
 if
 if
 you're


an
 SRF
 you're
 barring
 in
 triparty
 repo


and
 that's
 not
 balance
 sheet
 friendly


it's
 not
 netible
 and
 so
 I
 think
 that's


part
 of
 reason
 uh
 but
 what
 they're


likely
 to
 do
 going
 forward
 is
 once
 they


realize
 that
 stopping
 QT
 uh
 does
 not
 put


downward
 pressure
 on
 repo
 rates.
 Once


they
 see
 rep
 rates
 continue
 to
 rise,


they're
 probably
 going
 to
 be
 buying
 a


lot
 of
 bills
 to
 add
 liquidity
 into
 the


financial
 system.
 They
 call
 these


reserve
 management
 purchases
 and
 they


did
 that
 in
 2019
 as
 well.
 So
 that
 could


happen
 actually
 maybe
 as
 soon
 as


December.
 I
 mean
 it's
 really
 hard
 to
 say


about
 about
 these
 things
 because
 so
 much


of
 it
 is
 uh
 opaque.
 Um
 like
 the
 spike
 in


repo
 markets
 in
 September
 2019
 came
 kind


of
 out
 of
 the
 blue.
 I
 I
 was
 there
 at


that
 time.
 It
 was
 kind
 of
 exciting.
 Um


so
 I
 I
 expect
 them
 to
 be
 expanding
 their


balance
 sheet
 again
 shortly.
 But
 you


know
 that
 that's
 actually
 pretty


technical.
 The
 really
 really
 big
 picture


that's
 going
 toffect
 impact
 markets


going
 forward
 is
 just
 what
 the
 ultimate


composition
 of
 the
 Fed's
 balance
 sheet


will
 be.
 Now,
 that's
 kind
 of
 important


because
 the
 way
 that
 the
 Fed
 impacts


market
 pricing
 through
 their
 balance


sheet
 is
 through
 the
 supply
 and
 demand


of
 Treasury
 securities
 to
 the
 private


sector.
 So,
 if
 the
 Fed,
 for
 example,
 is


going
 out
 and
 buying
 a
 bunch
 of
 10ear


treasuries,
 there's
 less
 treasury


treasuries
 available
 for
 the
 private


sector,
 right?
 Less
 supply,
 uh
 lower


lower
 interest
 rates.
 Now,
 right
 now,


the
 Fed
 has
 a
 portfolio
 whose
 duration


is
 pretty
 high,
 much
 higher
 than
 the


overall
 markets.
 That's
 by
 design.
 They


bought
 all
 these
 Treasury
 securities


because
 they
 wanted
 to
 put
 downward


pressure
 on
 longdated
 interest
 rates.


So,
 they
 swallowed
 out
 a
 whole
 bunch
 of


duration


on
 the
 FOMC
 right
 now,
 and
 this
 is


something
 they're
 still
 discussing.
 But


from
 what
 we've
 heard,
 and
 we've
 heard


from
 a
 couple
 governors
 right
 now,
 is


that
 they're
 going
 to
 be
 pretty
 hawkish


on
 the
 balance
 sheet.
 Uh,
 Governor


Waller,
 for
 example,
 would
 like
 to,
 you


know,
 maybe
 just
 hold
 uh,
 you
 know,
 hold


a
 lot
 more
 Treasury
 bills,
 as
 many


Treasury
 bills
 as
 they
 have
 reserve


balances.
 So,
 that'd
 be
 upping
 it


significantly
 by
 over
 a
 couple
 trillion.


So,
 what
 does
 that
 mean?
 Well,
 if
 you're


holding
 uh,
 if
 you
 have
 to
 hold,
 let's


say,
 three
 trillion
 bills,
 that
 means


you're
 going
 to
 have
 hold
 fewer
 coupons,


and
 that
 means
 that
 the
 private
 sector


is
 going
 to
 have
 to
 hold
 a
 lot
 more


duration.
 So,
 you
 know,
 that's
 kind
 of


uh
 super
 hawkish
 um
 in
 that
 it
 will


increase
 the
 supply
 of
 duration
 to
 the


market
 and
 maybe
 they'll
 do
 that
 solely


and
 really
 depends
 on
 uh
 who's
 on
 the


committee.
 Another
 member
 uh
 Governor


Bowman
 has
 actually
 even
 suggested
 that


the
 Fed
 should
 outright
 sell
 mortgage


back
 securities.
 Now,
 I
 mean
 that's


going
 to
 be,
 you
 know,
 so
 if
 you
 sell


mortgage
 back
 securities,
 the
 market's


going
 to
 have
 to
 absorb
 it.
 that
 means


higher
 mortgage
 rates
 and
 uh
 you
 know


that's
 that
 could
 be
 potentially
 pretty


disruptive
 and
 uh
 I
 think
 it's
 going
 to


make
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 in
 the
 White
 House


unhappy.


But
 listen,
 I
 think
 what
 I've
 taken
 away


from
 this
 so
 far
 is
 that
 the
 people
 who


have
 been
 very
 hawkish
 on
 the
 balance


sheet
 uh
 have
 been
 the
 Trump
 appointees,


the
 same
 people
 who
 have
 been
 clamoring


for
 rate
 cuts
 over
 the
 past,
 you
 know,


few
 meetings.
 So
 I
 think
 that
 suggests


that
 maybe
 there's
 there's
 the
 Fed
 is


still
 functioning
 as
 a
 you
 know
 pretty


independent
 organization.
 I'm
 just


talking
 about
 Governor
 Bowman
 invol
 and


governor
 uh
 Waller
 because
 they
 were
 the


people
 who
 have
 been
 climbing
 for
 rate


cuts
 in
 the
 past
 recent
 month
 going
 so


far
 as
 to
 descent.
 So


there's
 a
 narrative
 out
 there
 that
 all


these
 guys
 because
 they're
 Trump


appointees
 that
 they're
 just
 going
 to


you
 know
 cut
 rates
 and
 do
 what
 the
 boss


says.
 But,
 uh,
 what
 they're
 saying
 with


the
 balance
 sheet
 is
 very
 hawkish.
 So,
 I


think
 that
 it's
 it's
 more
 complicated


than
 that
 narrative.


>> So,
 I
 I'll
 get
 back
 to
 the
 balance
 sheet


in
 a
 second,
 but
 what
 you're
 saying
 is


that
 the
 President
 Trump
 appointees
 on


the
 Federal
 Reserve
 Board
 are
 uh
 uh
 they


are
 not
 being
 super
 dovish
 and
 doing


whatever
 the
 president
 wants
 on
 the


balance
 sheet.
 Counter
 to
 the
 narrative


that
 they
 are
 doing
 whatever
 the


president
 wants
 on
 the
 interest
 rate


story.
 How
 are
 you
 evaluating
 that


narrative?


>> So,
 what
 I'll
 just
 add
 one
 more
 thing


here.
 So
 in
 in
 uh
 the
 in
 2019
 the
 Fed


had
 a
 confidential
 memo
 that
 was


subsequently
 declassified
 to
 the
 public


and
 in
 that
 memo
 they
 said
 that
 you
 know


if
 we
 were
 more
 hawkish
 on
 the
 balance


sheet
 longer
 dated
 interest
 rates
 would


go
 up
 and
 we
 could
 cut
 more
 on
 the
 front


end.
 And
 my
 sense
 is
 that
 rather
 than


you
 know
 these
 these
 Trump
 appointees


just
 you
 know
 trying
 to
 please
 the
 big


man
 uh
 they
 are
 being
 very
 political
 and


diplomatic
 in
 that
 they
 are
 giving
 the


president
 the
 rate
 cuts
 he
 wants
 but
 on


the
 other
 hand
 taking
 it
 away
 by
 being


more
 hawkish
 on
 the
 balance
 sheet.
 So


you
 end
 up
 with
 a
 steeper
 curve
 but
 the


impact
 on
 the
 economy
 is
 about
 the
 same.


So
 I
 I
 think
 that's
 actually
 what's


happening
 at
 the
 Fed.
 So
 it
 doesn't
 seem


like
 the
 Fed
 is
 uh
 completely


uh
 part
 of
 the
 executive
 uh
 just
 yet.


Probably
 will
 be
 in
 the
 coming
 years
 and


maybe
 it
 should
 be.
 I
 I
 don't
 know,
 but


not
 yet.
 Now
 on
 the
 interest
 rate
 part,


I
 think
 we
 should
 kind
 of
 level
 set
 a


little
 bit.
 So
 the
 last
 time
 we
 had
 a


Fed
 meeting,
 we
 had
 the
 dot
 plot
 and
 the


dot
 plot
 guided
 towards
 two
 more
 cuts


this
 year.
 So
 a
 rate
 cut
 today
 and
 a


rate
 cut
 in
 December.


Now,
 between
 then
 and
 now,
 it's
 been
 a


difficult
 time
 because
 of
 the
 government


shutdown.
 The
 Fed
 has
 been
 basically


flying
 blind,
 not
 receiving
 a
 lot
 of
 the


important
 data
 that
 would
 usually
 inform


their
 decisions.
 Now,
 they
 do
 have


access
 to
 private
 data
 like
 ADP,
 like


Adobe
 data,
 and
 they
 have
 their
 own


internal
 network
 where
 they
 go
 and
 they


talk
 to
 people
 and
 they
 write
 the


Beechbook
 about
 it.
 Now
 between
 then
 and


now
 it
 seems
 like
 the
 uh
 well
 inflation


has
 come
 in
 a
 little
 bit
 better
 than


expected
 but
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day
 it's


still
 around
 3%.
 And
 the
 labor
 market


still,
 you
 know,
 kind
 of
 slow,
 trudging


along,
 low
 hiring,
 low
 firing,
 not
 doing


anything
 there,
 but
 not
 deteriorating.


And
 heading
 into
 today,
 the
 market
 was


fooling
 pricing
 in
 one
 cut
 today
 and
 one


cut
 in
 December.
 But
 the
 papa
 surprised


the
 market
 by
 just
 openly
 pushing
 back


against
 that.
 I
 think
 his
 memorable


words
 were
 not
 a
 foregone
 conclusion,


forcefully
 suggesting
 that
 maybe
 he's


not
 going
 to
 cut
 rates
 in
 December.


I
 think
 the
 rationale
 for
 that
 seems
 to


be
 that
 the
 labor
 market
 is
 not


deteriorating
 as
 much
 and
 if
 you
 look
 at


these
 GDP
 now
 casts
 it
 looks
 like
 growth


is
 you
 know
 growth
 is
 okay
 so
 that
 leads


us
 to


and
 you
 know
 not
 fully
 pricing
 in
 a


December
 cut
 maybe
 it
 won't
 be
 there
 and


that
 I
 think
 that's
 where
 we
 are
 in


rates
 right
 now


>> so
 going
 into
 today
 there
 there
 was


fully
 priced
 as
 you
 said
 that
 there


would
 be
 a
 cut
 in
 December
 that
 cut
 has


been
 taken
 away
 a
 good
 chunk
 of
 those


odds.
 So
 the
 interest
 rate
 market
 has


changed.
 Interesting
 when
 Powell
 said


that
 not
 a
 foregone
 conclusion
 about


December.
 You
 know
 the
 market
 stock
 S&P


was
 down
 around
 76
 basis
 points
 regained


a
 lot
 of
 that.
 So
 just
 goes
 to
 show
 we


are
 not
 in
 2022
 anymore
 and
 you
 know
 the


days
 of
 Jay
 Powell's
 hawkishness
 causing


the
 stock
 market
 to
 decline
 two
 three
 4%


in
 a
 day
 and
 you
 know
 a
 large
 bare


market
 in
 2022
 was
 we
 were
 not
 in
 that


day.
 we
 not
 those those
 days
 are
 over


you
 know
 um
 at least
 at
 least
 so
 far.


Joseph
 want
 to
 get
 back
 to
 the
 balance


sheet
 your
 your
 first
 comment.
 So
 the


Federal
 Reserve
 has
 been
 withdrawing


liquidity
 since
 the
 middle
 of
 2022.
 Um


just
 $8.9
 trillion
 to
 around
 $6.5


trillion.
 So
 you
 know
 2.2.3
 trillion
 of


liquidity
 removal
 balance
 sheet
 uh


reduction.
 And
 it's
 been
 a
 a
 long
 and


slow
 and
 somewhat
 steady
 process.
 That


process
 is
 going
 to
 go
 on
 for
 30
 to
 32


more
 days,
 but
 it
 is
 going
 to
 end
 on


December
 1st.
 And
 the
 uh
 the
 treasuries


are
 going
 to
 just
 constantly
 be


reinvested.
 So
 held
 steady.
 The
 mortgage


back
 securities
 that
 the
 Federal
 Reserve


owns
 are
 going
 as
 they
 mature,
 they
 are


going
 to
 be
 reinvested
 into
 Treasury


bills.
 So
 the
 aggregate
 balance
 sheets,


the
 Federal
 Reserve's
 assets
 are
 going


to
 stay
 flat,
 but
 the
 composition
 is


going
 to
 change
 and
 mortgage
 back


securities
 are
 going
 to
 basically
 be


converted
 as
 they
 mature
 into
 Treasury


bills.
 That
 itself
 is
 kind
 of
 a
 form
 of


tightening,
 right?
 Because
 mortgage
 back


securities
 have
 more
 duration
 and


convexity
 risk
 and
 just
 replacing,
 you


know,
 treasury
 bill
 has
 almost
 no
 risk


at
 all.
 So
 you're
 you're
 supplying
 the


private
 sector
 with
 an
 increased
 uh


mortgage
 back
 security.
 So
 it's
 it
 is


still
 somewhat
 a
 form
 of
 tightening,


right?


>> Well,
 I
 I
 would
 point
 out
 that
 mortgage


back
 securities
 that
 the
 Fed
 holds
 have


very
 low
 coupons.
 So
 they're
 not
 going


to
 prepay
 quickly.
 So
 someone
 who
 so


mortgage
 back
 securities
 get
 paid
 down


either
 monthly
 as
 principal
 payments
 go


go go
 through
 and
 that
 takes
 30
 years
 or


if
 someone
 refinances
 their
 mortgage


that
 is
 to
 say
 takes
 out
 a
 new
 loan
 to


repay
 the
 old
 loan.
 Now
 because
 the
 Fed


bought
 these
 mortgages
 during
 the
 very


low
 interest
 rates
 of
 the
 pandemic
 uh


these
 are
 like
 you
 know
 2
 and
 a
 half
 3%


mortgages
 and
 no
 one's
 going
 to
 u
 you


know
 take
 out
 a
 new
 mortgage
 to
 repay


that.
 So
 the
 monthly
 principal
 payments


that
 the
 Fed
 is
 receiving
 each
 month,


it's
 really
 low.
 It's
 like,
 you
 know,


say
 14
 15
 billion
 a
 month.
 So
 it's
 I


don't
 think
 it's
 going
 to
 have
 a
 big


impact.


Uh
 but
 but
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 the
 mortgage


portfolio
 though,
 the
 Fed
 would
 like
 to


have
 no
 mortgages
 on
 its
 balance
 sheet.


It
 wants
 to
 have
 a
 final
 portfolio


that's
 old
 treasuries.
 The
 rationale
 for


that
 is
 that
 they
 feel
 that
 owning


mortgages
 is
 basically
 the
 Fed


allocating
 credit
 to
 the
 private
 sector


and
 they
 don't
 want
 to
 do
 that
 even


though
 they've
 been
 doing
 that
 for
 for


quite
 some
 time
 and
 to
 an
 enormous


enormous
 size
 too,
 right?
 They
 have
 a


couple
 trillion
 under
 balance
 sheet.
 So


if
 they
 wanted
 to
 go
 to
 an
 old
 Treasury


portfolio,
 uh
 they
 probably
 have
 to
 wait


30
 years.
 Now
 that's
 a
 long
 time
 and
 you


don't
 really
 set
 goals
 and
 just
 take
 30


years
 to
 achieve
 them.
 So
 there
 is
 a


possibility
 that
 they
 could
 try
 to
 speed


that
 up
 a
 little
 bit
 by
 selling


mortgages.
 I
 think
 that's
 really


unlikely.
 It'd
 be
 a
 very
 hawkish


outcome.
 We
 haven't
 seen
 them
 do
 that


before.
 Uh
 looking
 across
 the
 world,
 the


Bank
 of
 England
 has
 uh
 shrink
 their


balance
 sheet
 by
 by
 selling
 outright,


but
 uh
 usually
 people
 just
 let
 them
 roll


off.
 So
 that
 that
 is
 a
 possibility.
 So
 I


think
 that's
 a
 that
 is
 one
 of
 the


interesting
 things
 that
 happened
 today.


mortgage
 principal
 principal
 is
 going
 to


reinvest
 it
 in
 not
 just
 treasuries
 but


treasury
 bills
 and
 Paul
 noted
 that's


part
 of
 the
 effort
 to
 reduce
 the


duration
 of
 their
 overall
 portfolio
 but


again
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 so
 slow
 and
 and


so
 minor
 it's
 not
 going
 to
 be
 meaningful


I
 don't
 think
 it'll
 affect
 the
 market


>> and
 and
 now
 let's
 connect
 the
 balance


sheet
 to
 repo
 as
 you
 said
 the
 Federal


Reserve's
 reverse
 repo
 facility
 which


are
 liabilities
 of
 the
 Federal
 Reserves


has
 been
 shrinking
 down
 and
 are
 now


effectively
 at
 zero.
 So
 the
 excess
 cash


parked
 at
 the
 Federal
 Reserve
 has
 been


deployed
 into
 the
 financial
 system
 as


the
 Treasury
 has
 increased
 a
 lot
 of


Treasury
 bills
 that
 have
 been
 bought
 by


the
 money
 market
 funds
 that
 were
 buying


um
 the
 the
 uh
 that
 were
 investing
 in
 in


the
 repo
 facility.
 Um
 and
 and
 so
 now


they
 are
 lending
 to
 hedge
 funds
 who
 are


now
 buying
 the
 treasuries
 on
 on
 credit


you
 know
 10
 50
 100
 times
 levered
 um
 I've


heard
 200
 300
 400
 times
 levered
 um
 in


the
 in
 the
 so-called
 basis
 trade
 so


Joseph
 you
 know
 broad
 painting
 painting


with
 a
 very
 broad
 brush
 the
 US
 deficit


and
 US
 increased
 treasury
 issuance
 from


2000
 to
 2010
 bought
 was
 funded
 a
 lot
 by


foreigners
 a
 lot
 of
 which
 were
 China


let's
 say
 2010
 to
 2022
 was
 financed
 by


the
 Federal
 Reserve
 in
 yeah
 a
 ton
 but


also
 domestic
 banks,
 domestic


households,
 domestic
 corporates.
 A
 lot


of
 the
 financing
 of
 the
 treasury
 and
 you


know
 you've
 pointing
 this
 out
 on


fedgu.com
 has
 been
 now
 from
 the
 hedge


funds.
 So
 it's
 it's
 levered
 like
 a
 bank


buying
 treasuries,
 but
 they're
 borrowing


in
 the
 repo
 market
 and
 they're
 borrowing


from
 money
 market
 funds
 and
 as
 a
 result


the
 demand
 for
 borrowing
 as
 you
 say
 is


insatiable.
 So
 the
 the
 repo
 rates
 are


spiking
 and
 ever
 so
 slightly.
 So,
 you


know,
 as
 Powell
 noted
 today,
 over
 the


past
 three
 weeks,
 there
 have
 been


elevated
 signs
 of
 I'll
 call
 it
 stress


where
 sofur
 rates
 are
 10,
 maybe
 20
 basis


points
 above
 the
 the
 Federal
 Reserve


rates.
 And,
 you
 know,
 I'll
 go
 both
 for


the
 New
 York
 Fed
 as
 well
 as
 your
 website


to
 get
 the
 exact
 data,
 but
 uh
 even
 the


effective
 federal
 funds
 rate,
 which
 is


supposed
 to
 be
 the
 most
 vanilla
 rate
 in


the
 world,
 is
 like
 three
 to
 five
 basis


points
 above
 where
 it
 should.
 So,
 stress


is
 in
 the
 the
 money
 markets.
 Tie
 this


all
 together.
 explain
 this
 to
 me
 as
 well


as
 to
 the
 audience
 because
 I
 I
 really


need
 your
 your
 expertise
 here.
 And
 then


also
 uh
 expl
 you
 know
 in
 on
 your
 uh
 your


most
 recent
 piece
 on
 fat.com
 balance


sheet
 dominance
 you
 talk
 about
 how
 the


Federal
 Reserve
 is
 losing
 control
 of
 its


balance
 sheet
 policy
 to
 the
 growing


fiscal
 deficit.
 Explain
 explain
 that
 as


well.


>> Well
 well
 Jackie
 you
 you
 actually
 had
 a


really
 good
 description
 on
 what's


happening.
 US
 Treasury
 issuing
 a
 lot
 of


debt.
 The
 marginal
 buyer
 of
 that
 debt


finances
 in
 repo
 at
 the
 moment
 it's


these
 guys
 who
 are
 financing
 it
 uh


buying
 treasuries
 selling
 treasury


futures
 and
 their
 basis
 trade
 and
 so
 as


long
 as
 the
 US
 as
 in
 this
 current


configuration
 as
 long
 as
 the
 fiscal


deficit
 grows
 there's
 going
 to
 be
 more


demand
 for
 repo
 financing
 okay
 demand


continues
 to
 grow
 what
 about
 the
 supply


of
 funds
 well
 we
 exhausted
 all
 the
 money


market
 funds
 and
 right
 now
 the
 marginal


lenders
 are
 the
 commercial
 banks
 and


Because
 repo
 rates
 are
 trading
 above


interest
 on
 reserves,
 you
 have
 some


commercial
 banks
 that
 are
 happily
 taking


money
 that
 they
 have
 on
 deposit
 at
 the


Fed
 and
 lending
 it
 in
 repo
 instead,


but
 they're
 the
 amount
 of
 cash
 they
 have


is
 is
 not
 unlimited.
 So
 eventually


they're
 going
 to
 run
 out
 of
 cash,
 too.


And
 so
 repo
 rates
 will
 continue
 to
 go


higher
 and
 maybe
 spike.
 If
 you're
 the


Fed,
 you
 have
 to
 control
 short-term


interest
 rates.
 So,
 that
 means
 you're


committed
 to
 continuing
 to
 add
 liquidity


into
 the
 financial
 system
 to
 keep
 these


short-term
 interest
 rates
 under
 control.


And
 that
 means
 you
 lose
 control
 of
 your


balance
 sheet
 because
 by
 pitting
 rates,


you
 you
 lose
 control
 over
 quantities.


You
 that's
 just
 how
 this
 is
 set
 up
 here.


So,


that
 seems
 to
 be
 the
 game
 we've
 been
 in


actually
 the
 past
 few
 years.
 We
 didn't


see
 it.
 So
 when
 the
 Fed
 first
 lost


control
 over
 short-term
 interest
 rates


in
 2019,
 uh
 they
 added
 a
 whole
 bunch
 of


uh
 reserves
 by
 buying
 by
 buying
 Treasury


bills
 and
 then
 we
 had
 2020
 where
 they


just
 kind
 of
 threw
 in
 the
 kitchen
 sink


and
 you
 know
 increase
 the
 amount
 of


liquidity
 in
 the
 financial
 system
 by
 by


trillions.
 But
 we've
 burned
 through
 all


that.


So
 uh
 we're
 back
 to
 where
 we
 are
 in
 2019


where
 you
 have
 to
 just
 keep
 adding


otherwise
 you'll
 lose
 control
 for


short-term
 interest
 rates.
 So,
 that's


kind
 of
 an
 interesting,
 I
 think,


conundrum
 they
 have.
 They
 really
 have
 no


way
 out
 of
 it.
 Uh
 because
 it
 is


absolutely
 essential
 for
 a
 central
 bank


to
 be
 able
 to
 control
 short-term


interest
 rates.


>> Yeah.
 And
 just
 to
 underscore
 that
 point,


like
 if
 the
 Federal
 Reserve
 cuts


interest
 rates
 to
 zero
 on
 its
 statement,


but
 actual
 interest
 rates
 in
 the
 market


are
 still
 at
 4%.
 Then
 they
 have
 no


control
 whatsoever.
 Like
 they're


basically
 that's
 like
 if
 you
 or
 me
 on
 a


podcast
 said
 interest
 rates
 are
 0%.
 It's


it's
 what
 actually
 happens
 in
 the


market.
 And,
 you
 know,
 99.9%
 of
 the


time,
 the
 Federal
 Reserve
 has
 close
 to


perfect
 control
 over
 these
 short-term


interest
 rates,
 but
 you're
 starting
 to


to
 see
 a
 discrepancy
 where
 those
 those


interest
 rates
 are
 are
 going
 up.
 And
 I
 I


have
 the
 the
 data
 from
 the
 New
 York
 Fed


and
 from
 you
 that
 the
 the
 uh
 sofur
 over


the
 OBFR
 over
 overnight
 something
 you


you
 could
 explain
 it
 is
 uh
 now
 10
 to
 15


basis
 points
 wide.
 So,
 those
 repo
 rates


are
 going
 up
 marginally.
 And


interestingly,
 we're
 it's
 it's
 in
 the


middle
 smack
 riddle
 smack
 in
 the
 middle


of
 the
 quarter.
 It's
 not
 like
 it's
 June


30th
 and
 all
 the
 banks
 are
 pulling
 out,


you
 know,
 they're
 they're
 repo
 financing


to
 make
 it
 look
 good
 for
 investors
 and


and
 regulators
 for
 their
 quarterly


reporting.
 This
 is,
 you
 know,
 there's
 no


window
 dressing
 at
 all.
 Um,
 and
 these


these
 repo
 rates
 are
 going
 up
 a
 lot.
 Is


do
 you
 think
 this
 is
 what
 really
 drove


the
 Federal
 Reserve
 to
 make
 this


decision
 of
 boom,
 December
 one,
 we
 are


stopping
 quantitative
 tightening?
 And


also
 explain
 the
 framework.
 Powell


talked
 about
 that
 framework.
 Um
 maybe
 it


was
 Roberto
 Pley's
 thing.
 I
 know
 this


from
 you.
 Talk
 about
 that
 that
 framework


for
 reserve
 scarcity.


>> Yeah,
 I
 think
 it's
 from
 Roberto.
 Roberto


is
 the
 solo
 manager.
 So
 Roberto
 or
 his


team
 came
 up
 with
 a
 really
 interesting


graph.
 I
 think
 it's
 like
 a
 hexagon
 or


octagon
 or
 something
 like
 that
 that
 has


different
 corners
 trying
 to
 measure
 out


when
 uh
 liquidity
 in
 the
 financial


system
 is
 scarce.
 So
 he'll
 look
 at


things
 like
 how
 sensitive
 is
 the
 Fed


funds
 rate
 to
 changes
 in
 in
 reserves?


How
 high
 are
 repo
 rates?
 uh
 let's
 say
 uh


are
 pe
 are
 banks
 holding
 back
 their


payments
 throughout
 the
 day
 trying
 to


conserve
 liquidity
 uh
 is
 there
 increased


uh
 let's
 say
 you
 know
 intraday
 intraday


overdraft
 things
 like
 that
 uh
 so
 that's


kind
 of
 the
 indicators
 it
 look
 but
 it


looks
 like
 they
 looked
 at
 all
 those
 and


decided
 that
 yes
 indeed
 report
 rates


trading
 far
 above
 IR
 that's
 not
 good
 I


don't
 want
 September
 of
 2019
 to
 re
 to


reoccur
 again
 so
 I'm
 going
 to
 stop
 it
 uh


in
 December
 1st
 So
 that's
 the
 end
 of
 the


balance
 sheets
 QT
 story
 for
 now.
 Jack,
 I


think
 we've
 been
 through
 QE
 and
 QT


before.
 This
 is
 like
 the
 entire
 cycle,


right?
 So
 we're
 right
 back
 uh
 back
 back


uh
 back
 to
 where
 we
 were
 a
 few
 years


ago,
 I
 guess.


>> And
 do
 you
 think
 the
 Federal
 Reserve
 I


think
 you
 already
 said
 yes,
 you
 I
 think


you
 said
 the
 Federal
 Reserve
 is
 going
 to


start
 expanding
 its
 balance
 sheet.


>> My
 guess
 is
 that
 my
 guess
 is
 that
 they


will
 have
 to
 otherwise
 they
 will
 lose


control
 over
 the
 repo
 market
 and
 they


don't
 want
 that
 to
 happen.
 So
 I
 think


what
 they
 misunderstand
 is
 that
 you
 know


de
 repo
 rates
 rise
 not
 because
 reserves


are
 scarce
 but
 because
 you
 have
 a


tremendous
 tremendous
 fiscal
 deficit


that's
 financed
 and
 repo
 and
 without


paying
 attention
 to
 the
 demand
 side
 of


that
 uh
 you
 are
 going
 to
 uh
 be
 misled


and
 end
 up
 in
 a
 situation
 where
 repo


rates
 do
 once
 again
 spike
 like
 they
 did


in
 2019
 and
 hopefully
 they'll
 realize


that
 be
 again
 because
 it
 would
 be
 very


embarrassing
 to
 make
 the
 same
 mistake


twice.
 And
 how
 are
 they
 going
 to
 expand


their
 balance
 sheet?
 Are
 they
 going
 to


be
 themselves
 buying
 treasuries?


>> Yeah,
 they'll
 buy
 Treasury
 bills.
 So,
 a


lot
 of
 people
 think
 that
 the
 Fed


expanding
 their
 balance
 sheet
 is
 QE
 and


it's
 easing,
 but
 that's
 not
 how
 the
 Fed


looks
 at
 it.
 So,
 the
 Fed
 looks
 at
 QE
 in


a
 specific
 way
 that
 they're
 taking


duration
 out
 of
 the
 market.
 So,
 they're


buying
 longerdated
 uh
 Treasury


securities.
 So
 the
 private
 sector
 has


less
 of
 a
 supply
 and
 longerdated


Treasury
 securities
 putting
 downward


pressure
 on
 interest
 rates.
 Now
 from


this
 perspective
 when
 the
 Fed
 is
 buying


Treasury
 bills
 which
 are
 shortdated,


it's
 it's
 neutral.
 It's
 not
 having
 an


impact
 on
 the
 market
 even
 though
 many


people
 will
 perceive
 it
 as
 such.
 So


that's
 probably
 what
 they'll
 begin
 to


do.
 I
 suspect
 they'll
 have
 to
 do
 it
 I
 I


think
 in
 size
 too
 because
 if
 you
 look
 at


how
 well
 you
 look
 at
 a
 couple
 things.


One
 is
 you
 look
 at
 the
 fiscal
 deficit.


It's
 two
 trillion
 a
 year
 roughly


speaking.
 The
 second
 thing
 you
 want
 to


look
 at
 is
 the
 growth
 in
 repo
 volumes.


Now
 silver
 volumes
 grew
 800
 billion
 a


year.
 So
 that's
 telling
 you
 that
 you


know
 there's
 a
 tremendous
 demand
 for


leverage
 repo
 financing.
 Where
 is
 that


cash
 going
 to
 come
 from?
 So
 it
 looks


like
 you're
 probably
 going
 to
 be
 have
 to


add
 well
 expand
 your
 balance
 sheet
 by
 a


few
 hundred
 billion
 a
 year
 to
 be
 able
 to


to
 meet
 all
 that
 demand.
 So
 it's


complicated
 because
 once
 you
 you
 let's


say
 that
 you
 add
 liquidity
 in
 the


system,
 someone
 lends
 it
 and
 it
 ends
 up


into
 someone
 else's
 hands
 and
 maybe
 it


can
 be
 relent
 again.
 So
 how
 these
 thing


these
 effects
 actually
 circulate
 and
 net


out
 it's
 hard
 to
 say.
 Uh
 but
 it's


definitely
 going
 to
 be
 I
 think
 in
 a
 few


hundred
 billion
 range.
 And
 yeah,
 you've


got
 this
 great
 chart
 from
 your
 most


recent
 article
 on
 fedtoguide.com
 showing


that
 secured
 overnight
 financing


volumes,
 sofur,
 has
 gone
 up
 from
 a


trillion
 dollars
 in
 2022
 to
 $3
 trillion


now.
 Wow.
 So,
 a
 good
 chunk
 of
 the


deficit.


>> That's
 all.
 Yeah,
 it's
 financed
 financed


um


>> in
 the
 leveraged
 hedge
 fund
 community.


Uh


>> those
 guys
 these
 guys,
 they're
 not
 just


buying
 cash
 treasuries
 for
 the
 heck
 of


it,
 right?
 It's
 part
 of
 a
 spread
 trade


or
 basis
 trade
 where
 they
 buy
 cash


treasuries
 and
 sell
 treasury
 futures.


So,
 treasury
 futures
 are
 overvalued


because
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 mutual
 funds,
 they


want
 to
 have
 exposure
 to
 treasuries,
 but


they
 don't
 actually
 uh
 they
 don't


actually
 want
 to
 go
 and
 have
 u
 a
 repo
 a


repo
 loan
 and
 buy
 cash
 treasuries.


They'd
 rather
 just
 do
 it
 in
 futures.
 So,


they
 buy
 futures.
 It's
 easier
 for
 them


uh
 to
 manage
 that.
 And
 so
 that
 leads
 to


an
 overvaluation
 of
 treasury
 futures


relative
 to
 cash
 treasuries
 which
 leads


which
 creates
 this
 trade
 where
 hedge
 fun


can
 go
 and
 then
 sell
 these
 uh
 expensive


treasury
 futures
 on
 one
 hand
 and
 buy


cash
 treasuries
 on
 the
 other
 hand
 and


see
 that
 basis
 converge.
 And
 Joseph


Powell
 today
 in
 in
 the
 October
 FOMC


press
 conference
 said
 that
 they
 plan
 on


holding
 the
 assets
 constant
 from


December
 1st
 effectively.
 Uh
 but
 in


terms
 of
 the
 liabilities,
 bank
 reserves


are
 going
 to
 go
 down.
 So
 the
 assets
 of


commercial
 banks,
 the
 liability
 of
 the


Fed,
 basically
 the
 money
 that
 the


Federal
 Reserve
 owes,
 you
 know,


commercial
 banks
 is
 going
 to
 go
 down
 and


that's
 going
 to
 be
 offset
 by
 an
 increase


in
 other
 Federal
 Reserve
 liabilities,


namely
 cash,
 you
 know,
 which
 we're
 all


familiar
 with.
 you
 know
 the
 thing
 that


uh
 is
 in
 wallets
 and


how
 do
 you
 think
 that
 is
 going
 to
 affect


liquidity
 conditions
 because
 presum
 you


know
 presumably
 people
 are
 not
 buying


treasuries
 or
 securities
 with
 physical


cash
 I
 bet
 but
 it's
 almost
 impossible


and
 you
 know
 they
 commercial
 banks
 are


and
 bank
 reserves
 are
 what
 add
 liquidity


and
 what
 are
 liquidity
 basically
 so
 um


just
 explain
 the
 significance
 of
 of
 that


comment


>> so


over
 time
 uh
 people
 go
 and
 they
 So
 the


Fed,
 if
 you
 have
 paper
 currency,
 that's


a
 liability
 of
 the
 Fed.
 If
 you
 look
 at


it,
 it
 says
 Federal
 Reserve
 notes.
 The


amount
 of
 uh
 paper
 currency
 outstanding


actually
 grows
 every
 year
 in
 line
 with


the
 economy.
 Um,
 strangely
 speaking,


when
 you
 actually
 look
 at
 it,
 a
 lot
 of


the
 paper
 currency
 is
 actually
 held


abroad
 outside
 of
 the
 US.
 Uh,
 probably


by,
 you
 know,
 cartels
 or
 people
 who
 want


to
 avoid
 their
 their
 own
 their
 own


monetary
 system.
 So
 that
 that
 paper


currency
 grows
 with
 the
 with
 the
 economy


roughly
 speaking.
 Where
 does
 how
 do
 you


get
 that
 paper
 currency?
 Well,
 you
 go
 to


a
 bank,
 right?
 So
 let's
 say
 you
 have
 a


deposit
 at
 a
 bank.
 You
 ask
 the
 bank
 say,


"Hey,
 I
 have
 $100
 on
 deposit
 at
 your


bank.
 Give
 me
 $100
 in
 currency."
 And


where
 does
 the
 bank
 get
 that
 currency?


Well,
 a
 bank
 gives
 the
 Fed
 $100
 in


reserve.
 And
 the
 bank
 and
 the
 Fed
 sends


over
 an
 armored
 card
 to
 the
 bank
 with
 a


$100
 bill.
 And
 when
 you
 say
 the
 the
 bank


gives
 the
 Fed
 a
 reserve,
 what
 you
 mean


is
 the
 bank
 asks
 the
 Fed,
 "Destroy
 this


$100
 of
 reserve
 that
 I
 have.
 Destroy


it."
 Right.


>> No.
 No.
 It's
 just
 like
 when
 we
 go
 to
 the


commercial
 bank,
 like
 we
 take
 we
 have


$100
 in
 our
 checking
 account
 and
 we
 take


$100
 out.
 Well,
 that
 $100
 in
 our


checking
 account,
 it's
 evaporated.
 It's


erased.
 And
 I
 have
 a
 So,
 it's
 the
 exact


same
 exact
 same
 mechanism.
 And
 you
 know


over
 time
 if
 the
 Fed
 keeps
 its
 balance


sheet
 constant
 uh
 because
 demand
 for


currency
 gradually
 increases
 over
 time


you'll
 have
 fewer
 reserves
 and
 more


currency
 as
 people
 just
 naturally
 go
 and


ask
 for
 more
 currency
 with
 the
 expansion


of
 the
 US
 economy.
 But
 again
 that's
 is


what
 he's
 saying.
 I
 continue
 to
 believe


that
 he's
 going
 to
 have
 to
 add
 liquidity


into
 the
 system
 to
 to
 control
 short-term


interest
 rates.
 But
 if
 I'm
 wrong
 uh


that's
 what
 that's
 what
 will
 play
 out.


We
 just
 slowly
 have
 fewer
 reserves
 as


currency
 liabilities
 increase.


>> And
 what's
 your
 current
 read
 of
 the


stress
 in
 money
 markets?
 Is
 it
 a
 drip


drip
 uh
 you
 know
 very
 very
 slow
 thing
 or


do
 you
 think
 there's
 a
 chance
 that


things
 could
 get
 unhinged
 quite
 quickly.


I
 remember
 you
 know
 just
 entering
 the


business
 in
 in
 2019
 and
 you
 know
 first


started
 studying
 and
 and
 writing
 about


that
 repo
 spike.
 I
 had
 you
 know
 almost


no
 knowledge
 about
 it
 whatsoever.
 But
 uh


I
 remembered
 it
 kind
 of
 came
 out
 of


nowhere.
 Do
 you
 know
 what
 do
 you
 think


is
 more
 likely
 that
 you're
 going
 to
 see


a
 spike
 that's
 going
 to
 cause
 the


Federal
 Reserve
 to
 intervene
 or
 is
 there


going
 to
 the
 Federal
 Reserve


intervention
 that
 you
 are
 predicting?
 Do


you
 think
 what
 are
 you
 assessing
 the


odds
 that
 that
 is
 going
 to
 be
 a


proactive
 measure?


>> So
 I
 think
 one
 thing
 that's
 different


today
 is
 that
 we
 do
 have
 a
 standing
 repo


facility
 and
 so
 if
 there
 really
 is
 an


emergency
 need
 for
 cash,
 they
 can
 always


go
 to
 the
 Fed.
 So
 I
 think
 that
 makes


huge
 spikes
 less
 likely.


Uh
 but
 the
 thing
 is
 the
 repo
 market
 is


mostly
 an
 overnight
 market.
 So
 in
 the


morning
 at
 7:00
 a.m.
 it
 opens.
 If
 you


are
 someone
 who
 wants
 to
 borrow
 money,


you
 go
 and
 you
 call
 up
 your
 contacts
 and


you
 ask
 them
 for
 money
 and
 they
 give
 it


to
 you.
 And
 usually
 you
 know
 each
 other.


So
 it's
 kind
 of a
 handshake
 deal.
 You


know
 set
 quantities
 and
 you
 know
 prices


are
 market
 prices.
 Uh
 but
 the
 thing
 is


the
 people
 who
 lend
 cash,
 they
 don't


actually
 have
 super
 great
 visibility
 as


to
 how
 much
 cash
 they
 have
 available
 to


lend.
 Uh
 for
 example,
 um
 let's
 say
 that


you
 are
 money
 market
 fund.
 Uh
 you
 know,


you
 know
 that
 uh
 on
 certain
 days
 your


clients
 withdraw
 money,
 maybe
 they
 want


to
 do
 a
 big
 M&A
 deal,
 maybe
 they
 have
 to


pay
 taxes,
 you
 know,
 maybe
 you
 have
 less


cash
 to
 lend.
 And
 if
 you're
 a
 commercial


bank
 lending
 in
 the
 repo
 market,
 again,


you
 are
 you
 have
 inflows
 and
 outflows.


you
 know
 sometimes
 you
 have
 more
 cash
 to


lend
 than
 other
 times.
 So
 the
 supply
 of


cash
 after
 the
 RP
 goes
 to
 zero
 becomes
 a


little
 bit
 more
 volatile.
 And
 from
 the


demand
 side,
 you
 know,
 if
 you
 are,
 let's


say,
 in
 a
 basis
 trade
 or
 if
 you're


financing
 a
 worth
 a
 an
 inventory
 of


securities,
 you
 got
 to
 get
 funded,


right?
 So
 you're
 borrowing
 short-term


overnights
 and
 your
 liabilities
 are
 are


longerdated.
 So
 uh
 you
 got
 to
 get


financed
 no
 matter
 what.
 That
 inelastic


demand
 is
 what
 creates
 the
 huge
 spikes


because
 no
 matter
 what
 you
 got
 to
 get
 uh


financed.
 But
 also
 note
 though
 that


these
 are
 overnight
 loans.
 So
 even
 if


they
 spike
 significantly
 on
 an


annualized
 basis,
 it's
 it's
 not
 that


much
 money
 becomes
 a
 problem
 if
 it


persists
 for
 a
 few
 days.
 But
 uh
 if
 it's


just
 one
 day,
 it's
 it's
 tolerable.


>> So
 we
 had
 that
 repo
 spike
 to
 you
 know
 on


an
 annualized
 basis
 absurd
 levels
 in


September
 2019.
 We
 now
 have
 the
 standing


repo
 facility.
 Why
 haven't
 banks
 jumped


in
 and
 started
 to
 use
 that
 standing
 repo


facility?
 Um
 I
 have
 the
 overnight


repurchase
 agreements,
 you
 know,
 now
 at


$2
 billion.
 So
 $2
 billion
 of
 the


standing
 repo
 facility
 has
 been
 tapped.


Why
 isn't
 it
 more
 if
 these
 disequilibria


in
 in
 money
 markets
 are
 making


themselves
 apparent?


>> That's
 an
 interesting
 question.
 So


it
 is
 being
 used
 a
 lot
 more
 than
 it
 has


in
 the
 past,
 right?
 It
 used
 to
 be
 zero


for
 a
 long
 time.
 Now,
 it's
 it
 could
 be


that
 banks
 are
 just
 not
 as
 comfortable


as
 just
 borrowing
 from
 the
 Fed.
 It's


possible
 that
 there
 could
 be
 some
 kind


of
 stigma
 like
 borrowing
 from
 the


discount
 window.
 Uh
 I
 don't
 know.
 But


another
 possibility
 is
 that
 when
 you're


borrowing
 from
 the
 Fed,
 you're
 using


Repo
 and
 on
 a
 platform
 called
 triparty.


And
 in
 that
 platform,
 it's
 not
 netable.


So
 if
 you
 are
 uh
 for
 example
 if
 you're


borrowing
 10
 billion
 and
 then
 lending
 it


out
 to
 someone
 else
 at
 10
 10
 billion
 to


someone
 else
 uh
 if
 it's
 a
 netible
 uh
 if


it's
 a
 netable
 transaction
 then
 on
 your


balance
 sheet
 it
 doesn't
 increase
 its


size
 right
 10
 billion
 in
 liabilities
 10


billion
 assets
 it
 nest
 zero


>> so
 that
 netting
 netting
 is
 kind
 of


important
 because
 uh
 a
 lot
 of
 times
 if


you're
 part
 of
 a
 bank
 holding
 company


the
 size
 of
 your
 balance
 balance
 sheet


incurs
 regulatory
 costs.
 But
 if
 you're


borrowing
 repo
 from
 the
 Fed,
 it's
 not


netable
 and
 so
 you're
 expanding
 your


balance
 sheet
 that
 incurs
 regulatory


costs
 and
 that
 has
 to
 be
 taken
 into


account
 as
 well.
 So
 that's
 a
 possibility


as
 well.
 Um
 I'm
 sure
 the
 Fed
 is


encouraging
 dealers
 to
 borrow
 more,
 but


so
 far
 it
 just
 hasn't
 been
 super


effective
 in
 providing
 um
 I
 guess


something
 of
 a
 selfsealing
 for
 repo


rates.
 So
 the


uh
 the
 the
 spread
 of
 10
 to
 15
 basis


points
 of
 sec
 so sofur
 over
 fed
 funds


over
 OBFR
 is
 not
 sufficient
 to
 uh
 induce


dealers
 and
 uh
 banks
 to
 and
 other
 people


to
 tap
 the
 uh
 standing
 repost
 facility.


You're
 you're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 see
 uh
 a


bigger
 spike.


>> Looks
 like
 that's
 how
 it
 is
 so
 far.
 So


far.
 Yeah.


>> Yeah.
 I
 I
 gotcha.
 Um,


all
 right.
 Well,
 let
 let's
 turn
 Joseph


to
 the
 more
 vanilla
 more
 typical
 topics


of
 just
 interest
 rate
 cuts.
 Um,
 what
 was


what
 was
 your
 take
 of
 of
 the
 meeting


today
 and
 I
 guess
 the
 significance
 of


the


Powell's
 comment
 that
 don't
 take
 it
 for


granted
 that
 we're
 going
 to
 cut
 in


December
 because
 the
 market
 was
 a
 little


greedy
 coming
 into
 it.
 Nick
 Timosro


asked
 the
 first
 question
 and
 said,
 you


know,
 are
 are
 you
 alarmed
 by
 the
 fact


that
 the
 market
 has
 basically,
 you
 know,


taken
 it,


you
 know,
 priced
 in
 so
 so
 many
 so
 many


cuts.


>> Yeah,
 he
 was
 being
 hawkish.
 Uh


so
 I
 think
 what
 he's
 really
 doing
 is


being
 cautious.
 So
 he
 doesn't
 want
 to


commit
 to
 that
 December
 cut
 because
 he


just
 doesn't
 know.
 He
 doesn't
 have
 any


data.
 He
 doesn't
 know
 what's
 going
 on.


And
 I
 think
 he
 looks
 at
 uh
 financial


conditions,
 sees
 that
 they're
 loosening.


I
 think
 he
 looks
 at
 those
 GDP
 now


predictions.
 It
 looks
 like
 the
 economy


is
 booming.
 I
 think
 he
 looks
 at
 uh
 and


you
 know
 looks
 at
 the
 labor
 market.
 It's


not
 getting
 better
 but
 it's
 not
 getting


worse.
 Part
 of
 it
 could
 be
 just
 due
 to


reduced
 labor
 supply.
 Last
 time
 he


thought
 that
 you
 know
 we've
 had
 such
 a


decline
 in
 the
 supply
 of
 labor
 that
 even


zero
 jobs
 growth
 a
 month
 would
 be
 okay


would
 be
 at
 the
 break
 even
 rate.
 So
 I


think
 he's
 looking
 at
 all
 this
 and


saying
 I
 have
 no
 idea
 what's
 going
 to


happen.
 I
 don't
 like
 all
 these
 cuts


placed
 into
 the
 market
 because
 you
 know


maybe
 things
 are
 not
 as
 bad
 as
 I
 I
 think


they
 are.
 So
 I
 think
 uh
 I
 think
 that's


that's
 what
 happened
 there.
 So
 really


that
 it's
 a
 hard
 place
 to
 be
 in
 because


you
 just
 don't
 know
 don't
 have
 the
 data


to
 make
 good
 decisions,


>> right?
 And
 we
 had
 two
 dissents.
 One
 from


uh
 Governor
 Myin
 who
 asked
 no
 25
 basis


points
 not
 enough.
 We
 should
 do
 50.
 and


then
 Schmid
 uh
 who's
 a
 bank
 president


who's
 a
 voting
 member
 um
 he
 he
 opted
 to


not
 cut
 it
 all.


>> So
 he's
 a
 Fed
 president
 he's
 been
 pretty


hawkish
 and
 I
 think
 there's
 an


interesting
 question
 what
 will
 happen
 to


the
 Fed
 presidents
 who
 are
 supposed
 to


be
 reappointed
 in
 in
 February.
 So
 there


was
 a
 question
 about
 that.
 One
 of
 the


thinking
 was
 that,
 you
 know,
 if
 you
 have


a
 more
 Trump
 centered
 uh
 board
 of


governors
 who
 could
 veto
 Fed
 president


appointments,
 maybe
 they
 would
 just
 swap


all
 the
 Fed
 presidents
 out
 with
 someone


who
 is
 or
 people
 who
 are,
 you
 know,
 more


pro
 rate
 cut.
 Doesn't
 look
 like
 that's


happening
 so
 far,
 but
 yeah,
 he
 wanted
 to


have
 uh
 no
 change
 in
 the
 policy
 rate.


And
 Governor
 Myron,
 as
 you
 mentioned,


would
 like
 50
 basis
 point
 cuts,
 and
 I


think
 he's
 going
 to
 do
 that
 uh
 at
 each


meeting,
 ask
 for
 50
 basis
 point
 cuts.


And
 he
 has
 some
 interesting
 reasons
 why,


right?
 He
 gave
 a
 good
 speech
 that


clearly
 shows
 that,
 you
 know,
 there's


been
 a
 lot
 of
 changes
 in
 fiscal
 policy


in
 other
 policies
 that
 make
 make
 it
 so


that
 maybe
 the
 Fed
 can
 be
 a
 little
 bit


more
 dovish.
 In
 the
 beginning
 of
 the


year,
 Cherpa
 was
 looking
 at
 everything


that
 was
 happening
 with
 policy
 with


tariffs,
 with
 immigration,
 with


regulation,
 all
 forth,
 and
 he
 cher
 was


like
 just
 shrugged
 his
 shoulders
 and


said
 that
 I
 don't
 know
 what's
 going
 to


happen,
 so
 I'm
 just
 going
 to
 do
 nothing.


Basically
 commit
 to
 being
 late.
 uh


Governor
 Myron
 and
 Governor
 Bowman
 is


actually
 thinking
 that,
 you
 know,
 that's


not
 a
 good
 idea.
 I
 think
 we
 should
 be


more
 forward-looking.
 And
 one
 of
 the


things
 that
 uh
 Governor
 Myron
 has
 been


saying
 is
 that
 since
 we
 have
 less


immigration,
 that
 means
 less
 demand
 for


shelter.
 That's
 going
 to
 put
 down


pressure
 on
 on
 rents.
 That's


disinflationary,
 right?
 And
 that's
 been


playing
 out
 over
 the
 past
 few
 months
 and


at
 the
 recent
 CPR
 report
 as
 well.
 So
 if


you
 take
 into
 account
 some
 of
 these


policy
 changes,
 you
 could
 make
 an


argument
 that
 rates
 should
 be
 lower.
 But


again,
 it's
 very
 very
 difficult
 to
 uh
 to


know
 how
 these
 policies
 will
 play
 out,


especially
 since
 they're
 changing
 all


the
 time.
 Like
 the
 president
 is
 in
 Asia


making
 all
 sorts
 of
 trade
 deals,


encouraging
 more
 investment
 and
 so


forth.
 Looks
 like
 uh
 he's
 going
 to
 have


a
 summit
 with
 President
 Xi
 and
 looks


like
 tariffs
 on
 China
 will
 come
 down.
 So


it
 is
 hard
 to
 make
 u
 forward-looking


prognostics.
 But
 on
 the
 immigration
 side


though
 over
 the
 past
 few
 months
 that's


been
 very
 clear
 and
 it
 is
 also
 going
 to


obviously
 have
 downward
 pressure
 on
 on


rent.


>> Right.
 And
 so
 you
 said
 uh
 President


Trump
 looks
 like
 he's
 going
 to
 meet
 with


President
 Xi
 lower
 tariffs
 on
 China.
 He


said
 that
 he
 expects
 to
 lower
 the


fentinel
 tariff
 uh
 from
 potentially
 from


20%
 to
 10%.
 There's
 so
 much
 uncertainty


because
 only
 a
 few
 weeks
 ago,
 earlier
 in


October,
 Trump,
 President
 Trump
 posted


on
 Truth
 Social
 that
 uh
 President
 China


is
 is
 not
 being
 very
 nice
 and
 that
 he's


going
 to,
 you
 know,
 spike
 them
 to
 a
 huge


level.
 So,
 it's
 very
 very
 hard
 to


interpret
 the
 future
 here.
 Um,
 Governor


Myin
 Aly
 has
 made
 the
 argument
 that
 the


cocktail
 of
 lower
 immigration,
 tariffs,


etc.
 is
 going
 to
 lead
 inflation
 to
 be


lower,
 therefore
 interest
 rates
 should


be
 lower.
 So,
 he's
 a
 doubbish
 center.


And
 then
 of
 course
 there
 is
 the
 argument


um
 that
 tariffs
 and
 the
 the
 Trump
 uh


policy
 the
 the
 one
 big
 beautiful
 bill
 is


going
 to
 be
 inflationary.
 Um
 how
 where


do
 you
 fall
 on
 that
 spectrum
 of
 the


current
 Trump
 administration's
 policies?


Are
 they
 are
 they
 inflationary
 and


therefore
 you
 know
 the
 Fed
 should
 be


hawkish
 or
 are
 they
 disinflationary
 and


therefore
 the
 Fed
 should
 be
 doubbish?


>> They're
 both
 inflationary
 and


disinflationary.
 I
 I
 don't
 know
 how


super
 complicated,
 right?
 You
 put


tariffs
 on,
 obviously
 that's
 going
 to


have
 some
 import
 impact
 on
 prices.
 So


far,
 not
 a
 lot.
 Um,
 you
 decrease
 the


growth
 of
 population,
 that's
 going
 to


have
 some
 impact.
 It's
 going
 to
 put


upward
 pressure
 on
 wages,
 which
 I
 think


is
 part
 of
 the
 reason
 why
 the
 president


got
 elected,
 but
 it's
 also
 going
 to
 put


downward
 pressure
 on
 things
 like
 shelter


because
 housing
 is
 it's
 less
 not


elastic,
 right?
 So,
 you
 can't
 suddenly


build
 a
 whole
 bunch
 of
 housing.
 So
 once


you
 have
 less
 population
 growth,
 rents


will
 come
 down.
 And
 looking
 at
 his
 other


uh
 other
 let's
 say
 expensing
 for


example,
 OBBA
 does
 a
 lot
 of


encouragement
 for
 people
 to
 build
 in


America.
 Well,
 that
 short
 term
 you're


going
 to
 have
 more
 demand
 and
 real


resources
 that's
 going
 to
 put
 prices
 up.


But
 if
 you
 do
 increase
 factories
 and
 so


forth
 in
 the
 United
 States,
 that


increases
 supply
 going
 forward.
 So


that's
 disinflationary.
 So
 there's
 a


whole
 lot
 of
 moving
 parts.
 It's
 not
 easy


to
 say.
 And
 of
 course
 the
 president
 is


doing
 something
 very
 interesting
 with


international
 trade.
 He's
 basically


confiscating
 the
 foreign
 reserves
 of
 um


allied
 countries
 and
 forcing
 them
 to


take
 that
 money
 and
 build
 factories
 in


the
 United
 States
 instead
 of
 buying


treasuries.
 So
 you
 know
 maybe
 that
 will


also
 have
 a
 increase
 in
 supply
 in
 the


coming
 years.
 So
 I
 think
 the
 big
 picture


is
 that
 they
 are
 trying
 to
 increase


supply
 and
 get
 uh
 and
 get
 inflation


lower.
 But
 in
 the
 short
 term
 though,
 uh


it
 we
 might
 might
 not
 see
 that
 impact.


>> Thank
 you,
 Joseph.
 How
 are
 you
 thinking


about
 the
 stock
 market
 right
 now?


>> Obviously,
 we're
 in
 a
 huge
 bubble,


right?
 Uh


>> but


>> yeah,
 obviously
 I
 mean
 things
 only
 go


up.
 Everything
 goes
 up.
 So
 when
 I
 look


at
 the
 stock
 market,
 I
 it
 kind
 of


reminds
 me
 as
 to
 how
 gold
 traded
 the


past
 few
 weeks,
 right?
 You
 go
 into
 a


period
 where
 you
 just
 go
 straight
 up,


straight
 up,
 screw
 up,
 look
 like
 you're


going
 parabolic,
 and
 then
 suddenly
 you


decline.
 So


I
 feel
 like
 when
 I
 look
 at
 the
 markets,


we're
 entering
 this
 phase
 with
 it
 seems


like
 it
 we
 stocks
 only
 go
 up.
 I've


noticed
 that
 when
 we
 have,
 you
 know,
 bad


data,
 oh
 that
 means
 rate
 cuts,
 market
 go


up.
 If
 you
 have
 good
 data,
 that
 means


the
 economy
 is
 good,
 market
 go
 up.
 And


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 pouring
 in
 here


just
 chasing
 momentum.
 They
 have
 a
 lot


of
 different
 narratives,
 but
 at
 the
 end


of the
 day,
 you
 know,
 people
 are
 just


buying
 because
 the
 market
 goes
 up.
 And


it's
 been
 working
 very
 well.
 And
 I
 I


think
 feel
 like
 when
 you're
 in
 this


phase
 in
 the
 market,
 you
 can
 it's
 hard


to
 say
 how
 high
 you
 can
 go.
 You
 know,


maybe
 you
 really
 just
 follow
 the
 com


blueprint
 and
 go
 higher
 than
 anyone


imagined.
 Uh
 but
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day


though,
 it's
 most
 likely
 followed
 by
 a


sharp
 uh
 decline.
 And
 that
 worries
 me
 a


little
 bit
 because
 so
 much
 of
 the


economy
 is
 dependent
 upon
 the
 wealth


effect.
 if
 we
 do
 actually
 go
 have
 some


kind
 of
 blowoff
 top
 and
 afterwards
 we


have
 a
 decline
 that
 almost
 guarantees
 us


to
 be
 in
 a
 recession
 and
 not
 just
 that
 I


think
 from
 a
 there's
 so
 many
 people
 who


have
 basically
 just
 spending
 their
 day


just
 buying
 stuff
 in
 the
 market
 right
 I


go
 to
 a
 cafe
 I
 see
 this
 nice
 old
 man
 sit


down
 open
 his
 laptop
 I
 think
 he's


looking
 at
 photos
 of
 his
 grandkids
 but


actually
 he's
 you
 know
 he's
 drawing


candles
 and
 trying
 to
 figure
 out
 you


know
 when
 to
 buy
 and
 when
 to
 sell
 so


it's
 really
 very
 much
 a
 speculation


nation
 here.
 And
 usually
 speaking,
 most


of
 these
 guys,
 they
 lose
 money.
 And
 I


think
 that's
 going
 to
 upset
 a
 lot
 of


people.
 So,
 uh,
 I
 understand
 the


president
 likes
 the
 stock
 market
 higher,


likes
 to
 claim
 credit
 when
 it
 goes


higher.
 It's
 definitely
 making
 people


like
 him,
 but
 you
 know,
 if
 you
 take


credit
 on
 the
 way
 up,
 you
 will
 get


blamed
 on
 the
 way
 down.
 So,
 that
 may
 not


be
 super
 wise.
 And
 Joseph,
 you
 noted
 um


for
 for
 being
 a
 giant
 bull
 on
 on
 the


equity
 market
 uh
 throughout
 2023
 and


2024


um
 primarily
 for
 reasons
 of
 just
 very


very
 strong
 uh
 earnings
 growth
 and
 GDP


growth,
 consumption
 as
 well
 as
 declining


inflation.
 All
 of
 which
 has
 been
 proven


right.
 How
 much
 of
 it
 do
 you
 think
 is


just
 the
 earnings
 growth
 is
 really


Nvidia
 as
 well
 as
 other
 companies
 that


benefit
 from
 uh
 AI
 capital
 expenditure?


You
 know,
 most
 of
 that
 money
 being
 spent


by
 extremely
 large
 companies,
 Meta,


Amazon,
 Google,
 uh
 you
 know,
 Microsoft,


the
 list
 goes
 on.
 Uh
 Open
 AI,
 which
 is


not
 publicly
 traded,
 but
 may
 may
 IO
 in


2027,
 who
 knows?
 And
 you
 know,
 with
 the


exception
 of
 OpenAI,
 these
 are
 very
 very


profitable
 companies.
 And
 so
 just
 you


know,
 the
 the
 profits
 and
 the
 profit


expectations
 for
 Nvidia
 just
 keeps
 on


going
 up.
 Nvidia
 is
 now
 a
 five
 trillion


dollar
 company
 and
 you
 know
 Joseph
 you


could
 be
 right
 the
 other
 bears
 you
 know


could
 be
 right
 obviously
 you
 you
 know


not
 having
 been
 a
 bear
 throughout
 all


this
 but
 uh
 you
 know
 recently
 you
 I


guess
 sounds
 like
 you're
 a
 little
 more


bearish
 on
 the
 economy
 on
 tariffs
 but


it's
 just
 that
 doesn't
 matter
 you're


right
 on
 the
 wrong
 issues
 and
 AI
 capex


just
 continues
 to
 to
 the
 moon
 until
 it


eventually
 goes
 down
 and
 implodes
 but


you
 know
 there's
 a
 you
 can
 call
 a
 bubble


and
 be
 right
 three
 years
 later
 but


that's
 not
 that's
 not
 the
 same
 as
 being


right
 you
 know
 Well,
 to
 call
 first
 off,


I
 want
 to
 be
 totally
 clear
 that
 I
 have


not
 been
 on
 mark
 the
 equity
 market
 this


year.
 My
 call
 on
 the
 equity
 market,
 I've


been
 bare
 most
 of
 the
 year
 worked
 really


well
 until
 uh
 until
 the
 president
 posted


that
 we
 should
 buy
 stocks
 and
 then
 it


did
 not
 work
 out
 well.
 So,
 no
 it
 um
 so


I've
 not
 been
 doing
 well
 not
 have
 a
 good


call
 on
 the
 equity
 market
 this
 year.
 So,


keep
 that
 in
 mind
 as
 I
 say
 this.
 Now


the
 companies
 have
 been
 spending
 a
 lot


on
 capex
 and
 the
 market
 has
 perceived


that
 as
 positive.
 But
 at
 the
 end
 of the


day
 you
 have
 all
 these
 companies
 that


are
 generating
 a
 lot
 of
 cash.
 They
 used


to
 give
 it
 back
 to
 their
 shareholders


through
 buybacks.
 Now
 they
 just


basically
 burn
 it
 on
 investments
 that


you
 know
 may
 or
 may
 not
 pay
 off.
 And
 you


know
 a
 lot
 of
 reports
 suggest
 that
 the


AI
 stuff
 super
 cool
 doesn't
 seem
 really


to
 be
 making
 money
 so
 far
 and
 doesn't


seem
 to
 have
 a
 clear
 path
 to
 do
 so.
 So


that
 kind
 of
 I
 think
 that
 kind
 of
 speaks


to
 the
 market
 sentiment.
 Whereas
 I
 feel


like
 if
 the
 market
 could
 easily
 perceive


these
 investments
 as
 being
 a
 waste
 of


money
 and
 penalize
 the
 companies
 for
 it


today,
 they're
 perceived
 as,
 you
 know,


everything
 is
 great.
 You
 know,
 you
 have


all
 these
 daisy
 chains
 of
 investments


and
 so
 forth.
 So
 I
 think
 it's
 really


just
 sentiment
 and
 momentum.
 I
 I


wouldn't
 really
 read
 anything
 more
 into


it.
 Everyone
 has
 a
 good
 narrative
 as
 to


why
 they
 buy
 something,
 but
 at
 the
 end


of
 the
 day,
 you
 know,
 it
 goes
 up,
 you


feel
 good,
 and
 you
 buy
 more.


>> And
 how
 are
 you
 thinking
 about
 foreign


ownership
 of
 equities
 as
 well
 as
 the


valuation
 of
 the
 dollar?
 This,
 you
 know,


view
 and
 theory
 that
 tariffs
 would
 spark


a
 sell-off
 in
 US
 assets,
 both
 treasuries


as
 well
 as
 stocks.
 You
 know,
 the
 world,


the
 rest
 of
 the
 world
 owns
 a
 lot
 of
 US


assets,
 as
 you
 know.
 Um,
 you
 know,
 that


theory
 hasn't
 really
 played
 out.
 Yes,


you've
 seen
 an
 increased
 hedging
 uh


amount.
 But
 in
 terms
 of,
 you
 know,
 the


the
 Iceland,
 Norway
 selling
 Nvidia,
 they


really
 haven't.
 They've
 they've
 been


buying
 more
 Nvidia
 and
 they've
 been


doing
 dollar
 swaps
 and
 hedging
 off
 that


currency
 risk,
 but
 have
 they
 been


selling
 Nvidia?
 No.
 No.
 No.
 They
 sold
 uh


I
 think
 in
 one
 month
 or
 two
 months
 and


they
 came
 back
 in
 size.
 They
 they
 just


can't
 get
 enough
 of
 that
 stuff.
 I
 I
 was


speaking
 with
 some
 of
 our
 investors
 and


they
 felt
 that
 you
 know
 US
 tech
 is
 the


place
 to
 be
 and
 you
 can
 see
 that
 in
 the


$5
 trillion
 market
 cap
 of
 Nvidia.
 Now


that
 kind
 of
 surprises
 me
 really.
 So
 we


have
 this
 administration
 that's
 you
 know


doing
 a
 lot
 of
 things
 that
 if
 you
 were


foreigner
 I
 feel
 like
 you
 would
 be
 a


little
 bit


a
 little
 bit
 more
 cautious
 but


apparently
 not.
 Apparently
 number
 go
 up.


What
 I
 do
 think
 this
 means
 to
 me
 though


is
 that
 when
 the
 downturn
 does
 come,
 I


think
 you
 would
 be
 very
 nonlinear.
 So


you
 you
 kind
 of
 have
 this
 built-in


dollar
 exposure
 built
 into
 the
 to
 the


market
 that
 is
 I
 think
 very
 very
 large


and


could
 potentially
 mean
 the
 downside


could
 be
 larger
 than
 it
 would
 usually
 be


because
 let's
 say
 that
 we
 do
 have
 real


recession.
 Let's
 say
 we
 have
 a
 tumble
 of


the
 market.
 Okay,
 then
 that
 would
 mean


the
 Fed
 will
 cut
 rates
 rapidly
 and
 that


would
 mean
 the
 dollar
 would
 depreciate


maybe
 a
 lot.
 Uh,
 you
 know,
 that's
 a


that's
 a
 recipe
 for
 disaster
 for
 a


foreign
 investor
 because
 you're
 losing


as
 the
 stock
 price
 goes
 down
 and
 you'll


lose
 as
 the
 dollar
 depreciates
 as
 well.


So,
 you
 you
 definitely
 need
 to
 get
 out


and
 because
 there's
 such
 large
 foreign


exposure
 to
 the
 US
 equity
 markets,
 that


decline
 could
 be
 significant.
 So
 I
 think


this
 is
 one
 of
 the
 mechanisms
 going


forward
 that
 if
 we
 do
 have
 a
 blow
 up
 top


that
 actually
 leads
 to
 a
 sharp
 decline


uh
 could
 accelerate
 that
 to
 be
 something


that
 that
 that's
 quite
 deep.
 So
 it's


just
 another
 mechanism
 uh
 in
 the
 market


that
 I
 think
 we
 should
 be
 aware
 of.
 Well


Jose,
 I
 guess
 let's
 just
 talk
 about
 this


issue
 of
 Federal
 Reserve
 independence.


You
 know,
 if
 President
 Trump
 is


appointing
 people
 who
 are
 going
 to
 be


calling
 for
 interest
 rate
 reductions,


which
 the
 president
 wants,
 that
 would
 be


a
 Federal
 Reserve
 that
 is
 no
 longer


independent.
 That
 is
 a
 strong
 influence


um
 by
 by
 the
 executive
 branch
 by
 by


government.
 And
 you
 know,
 President


Trump
 himself
 has
 said,
 "I
 think
 I


should
 have
 a
 say
 about
 interest
 rates."


That's
 kind
 of
 declaring
 that
 he
 doesn't


believe
 in
 central
 bank
 independence.


That's
 my
 interpretation.
 a
 lot
 of


people
 view
 number
 one
 do
 you
 think
 that


that
 is
 a
 a
 departure
 from
 central
 bank


independence
 number
 two
 do
 you
 think


that
 that
 is
 a
 bad
 thing
 which
 you
 know


I'd
 say
 a
 lot
 of
 economists
 think
 is
 a


bad
 thing


>> so
 obviously
 the
 president
 would
 like
 to


set
 interest
 rates
 what
 president


doesn't
 right
 so
 I'll
 say
 this
 about


central
 bank
 independence
 now
 I
 think


central
 bank
 independence
 can
 be
 a


really
 good
 thing
 because
 we
 are
 in
 a


political
 process
 where
 know
 the


executive
 would
 always
 like
 to
 have


lower
 interest
 rates
 to
 temporarily


boost
 the
 economy
 And
 we've
 seen
 that


happen
 with
 Nixon,
 for
 example,
 trying


to
 get
 lower
 interest
 rates,
 boost
 his


chances
 in
 the
 election,
 and
 then


afterwards,
 you
 know,
 maybe
 we
 have


inflation,
 but
 hey,
 I'm
 not
 up
 for


re-election
 anymore.
 So,
 I
 think
 that's


the
 fear
 there.
 But
 that
 tells
 you
 one


thing
 very
 clearly
 in
 that
 a
 central


bank
 is
 never
 really
 independent.
 It's


always
 operates
 under
 uh
 the
 elected


government.
 So,
 we've
 had
 an
 independent


central
 bank
 in
 the
 US
 since
 the
 1950s.


And
 yet
 we
 did
 have
 that
 episode
 happen


with
 Nixon
 and
 we
 have
 this
 episode


happening
 right
 now.
 So
 central
 bank
 is


composed
 of
 people
 and
 they
 always


operate
 under
 uh
 political
 constraints.


So
 that's
 one
 thing.
 But


more
 broadly
 speaking
 though,
 if
 you


look
 across
 the
 world,
 so
 let's
 say
 that


you
 have
 central
 bank
 independence
 in


the
 UK
 and
 France,
 they
 didn't
 get
 that


until
 the
 1990s.
 And
 it
 wasn't
 because


they
 had
 a
 whole
 bunch
 of
 inflation
 and


finally
 the
 legislator
 said,
 "We
 can't


take
 this
 anymore.
 we
 got
 to
 give
 our


centric
 independence.
 It
 was
 they
 were


having
 you
 know
 low
 inflation
 leading
 up


to
 the
 independence
 and
 they
 just


decided
 to
 change
 the
 system
 probably


just
 to
 you
 know
 uh
 get
 in
 line
 with


what
 other
 people
 are
 doing.
 So
 even


without
 central
 bank
 independence
 you


can
 still
 have
 low
 inflation
 and
 you
 can


even
 look
 across
 the
 world
 uh
 to
 China


which
 has
 a
 you
 know
 very
 complicated


managed
 economy.
 They
 don't
 have
 central


bank
 independence
 and
 they
 still
 have


low
 inflation.
 So
 you
 can
 have
 a
 central


bank
 independence
 and
 still
 get


inflation
 and
 you
 can
 not
 have
 an


independent
 central
 bank
 and
 have
 low


inflation.
 So
 it's
 not
 necessary
 and


it's
 not
 sufficient.


Now
 this
 is
 but
 the
 last
 point
 that
 I'm


going
 to
 make
 is
 I
 think
 it's
 more


important
 and
 that
 the
 central
 banks


today
 are
 very
 different
 from
 the


central
 banks
 in
 the
 past.
 Today
 the
 Fed


is
 super
 super
 powerful
 much
 more


powerful
 than
 the
 central
 bank
 has
 ever


been.
 you
 not
 only
 have
 interest
 rate


policy,
 you
 have
 balance
 sheet
 policy


where
 you
 can
 go
 and
 buy
 you
 know


trillions
 of
 mortgage
 back
 securities,


get
 mortgage
 rates
 super
 low,
 uh
 make
 uh


you
 know
 a
 whole
 generation
 of
 people


locked
 out
 of
 the
 housing
 market
 today.


And
 of
 course
 you
 also
 have
 regulatory


power
 over
 banks
 whereas
 you
 can
 control


who
 gets
 access
 to
 credit.
 You
 know


maybe
 uh
 in
 some
 countries
 they
 could
 do


this
 uh
 make
 sure
 that
 loans
 are
 given


to
 green
 endeavors
 for
 example.
 So
 a


central
 bank
 today
 is
 super
 super


powerful.


>> Although
 the
 Federal
 Reserve
 has


abandoned
 that
 I
 should
 note,
 right?


>> Yes.
 But
 you
 know
 I'm
 just
 talking
 about


central
 the
 Fed
 as
 an
 example.
 So
 the


ECB
 also
 super
 powerful
 as
 well.
 Central


banks
 in
 general
 today
 are
 much
 more


powerful
 than
 they
 are
 in
 the
 past.
 And


when
 you
 look
 at
 the
 political
 issues


today
 as
 a
 society,
 the
 one
 of
 the
 most


pressing
 ones
 is
 like
 home
 ownership,


right?
 a
 whole
 bunch
 of
 people
 can't


afford
 homes
 because
 a
 whole
 bunch
 of


people
 uh
 well
 home
 prices
 have
 gone
 up


in
 part
 because
 mortgage
 rates
 are
 low


and
 of
 course
 it's
 wealth
 inequality.


People
 who
 own
 financial
 assets
 well


they're
 doing
 pretty
 well.
 We
 have
 this


K-shaped
 economy.
 So
 some
 of
 the
 most


important
 distributional
 things
 in
 our


society
 are
 basically
 determined
 by
 a
 a


small
 group
 of
 people
 sitting
 at
 the


central
 bank.
 So
 if
 you
 believe
 that
 we


should
 have
 a
 democratic
 society,
 it


seems
 to
 me
 that
 it
 makes
 sense
 for
 the


public
 to
 have
 some
 say
 in
 matters
 that


have
 huge
 distributional
 impacts
 on
 the


society.
 So
 you
 can
 make
 the
 argument


that
 because
 central
 banks
 today
 are


much
 more
 powerful
 than
 the
 past,
 they


have
 to
 be
 less
 independent
 or
 you
 could


pair
 them
 down,
 maybe
 separate


regulatory
 power
 out,
 maybe
 make
 them


single
 mandate,
 inflation
 only
 and
 so


forth.
 So
 uh
 yeah
 I
 think
 you
 can
 make
 a


good
 argument
 that
 uh
 central
 bank
 is


too
 powerful
 to
 not
 have
 any
 kind
 of


democratic
 say
 simply
 you
 know
 so
 I


think
 that's
 an
 argument
 you
 can
 make


and
 so
 it's
 not
 super
 unreasonable
 for


from
 my
 perspective
 uh
 for
 you
 to
 say


that
 uh
 maybe
 the
 Fed
 shouldn't
 be


independent
 and
 I
 understand
 that
 um
 you


know
 it's
 a
 it's
 a
 policy
 decision
 right


there
 they're there
 pluses
 and
 minuses


it's
 not
 just
 oh
 my
 god
 God,
 we
 have


independent
 central
 bank,
 these
 guys


would
 be
 so
 wise
 and
 smart
 and


everything
 will
 be
 okay.
 That's
 just
 not


how
 the
 world
 works.


>> Joseph,
 this
 uh
 near
 consensus
 among


economists
 that
 central
 bank


independence
 is
 good
 and
 necessary
 to


have
 stable
 uh
 prices
 and
 not
 have


runaway
 inflation.
 Have
 you
 always


disagreed
 with
 that
 or
 do
 you
 has
 that


been
 a
 process
 and
 you
 you
 know
 if
 so


you
 tell
 us
 about
 that
 process?


So


what
 you
 read
 in
 textbooks
 is
 what


you're
 what
 you're
 saying
 Jack
 and
 one


of
 the
 things
 that
 I
 have
 come
 to


realize
 in
 my
 life
 is
 that
 uh
 a
 lot
 of


the
 things
 you
 read
 in
 textbooks
 sound


reasonable
 but
 are
 not
 actually
 true
 and


they're
 basically
 the
 work
 of
 very
 high


IQ
 people
 but
 we
 don't
 have
 a
 lot
 of


direct
 experience.
 So
 that
 sounds


totally
 reasonable,
 but
 it's
 just
 just


not
 true.
 And
 I've
 well
 we've
 talked


about
 many
 examples
 why
 that's
 just
 not


true.
 Uh
 one
 thing
 I'll
 note
 is
 that


inflation
 is
 unpopular.
 So
 you
 have


other
 checks
 on
 inflation
 and
 that's
 a


democratic
 process.
 One
 of
 the
 reasons


why
 President
 Biden
 was
 not
 su
 okay
 Vice


President
 Harris
 was
 not
 successful
 in


the
 last
 election
 was
 because
 inflation


was
 too
 high.
 So
 boom,
 you
 have
 you


mismanaged
 the
 economy.
 Inflation
 was


too
 high.
 you
 got
 kicked
 out
 of
 office.


That
 works,
 right?
 And
 uh
 I
 mean
 it


works
 in
 Argentina
 as
 well.
 Inflation


too
 high.
 You
 have
 this
 guy
 with
 a


chainsaw
 going
 on
 and
 cutting
 things.
 So


you
 have
 this
 democratic
 accountability


there
 as
 well.
 So
 that's
 another
 thing


to
 keep
 in
 mind.
 It's
 just
 not
 about
 the


central
 bank.
 And
 one
 other
 thing
 is


that
 inflation
 is
 a
 complicated
 thing.


Uh
 so
 at
 at
 the
 high
 level,
 it's
 when


demand
 pushes
 against
 supply.
 But
 it


it's
 not
 demand
 and
 supply
 are
 not
 all


about
 interest
 rates,
 right?
 We've
 seen


over
 the
 past
 few
 years
 that
 interest


rates
 went
 up
 to
 you
 know
 multi-deade


highs,
 but
 because
 of
 all
 the
 fiscal


spending,
 it
 just
 didn't
 work.
 And


because
 of
 um
 you
 know
 COVID
 and
 things


like
 that,
 supply
 chain
 stuff,
 inflation


was
 high.
 So
 it's
 not
 all
 about
 interest


rates.
 So
 it
 doesn't
 really
 make
 sense


to
 give
 inflation


just
 to
 one
 organization
 who
 does
 not


have
 the
 tools
 to
 carry
 it
 out.
 Now
 a


lot
 of
 the
 research
 that
 people
 cite
 and


saying
 that
 central
 banks
 have
 better


outcomes
 for
 inflation
 blah
 blah
 blah
 a


lot
 of
 that
 was
 done
 during
 the
 great


moderation
 when
 we
 had
 China
 entering


into
 the
 global
 stage.
 Now
 the
 central


banks
 were
 doing
 their
 thing
 and


inflation
 came
 down
 to
 2%
 and
 they
 kind


of
 patted
 themselves
 on
 the
 back
 being


like
 my
 gosh
 I
 convinced
 everyone


inflation
 expectations
 stable
 and
 got


inflation
 down
 it's
 all
 me.
 So
 you
 got


to
 give
 uh
 central
 bank
 independence.


But
 on
 the
 other
 hand,
 you
 had
 literally


several
 hundred
 million
 people
 enter
 the


global
 labor
 force
 with
 the
 China


entering
 WTO.
 I'd
 say
 that
 had
 a
 pretty


big
 impact
 on
 uh
 on
 inflation
 as
 well.


So
 you
 have
 all
 these
 things
 that


determine
 inflation
 that
 are
 definitely


far
 more
 than
 interest
 rates.
 So
 to


think
 that
 you
 could
 have
 some
 kind
 of


uh
 entity
 that
 interest
 rates
 rates
 and


inflation
 would
 be
 under
 control,
 I
 I


don't
 think
 that's
 how
 the
 world
 works.


for
 for
 the
 sake
 of
 argument,
 I'll
 just


uh
 you
 know
 push
 back
 a
 little
 bit
 which


is
 that
 you
 were
 correct
 when
 you
 said


or
 you
 basically
 implied
 that
 the
 you


know
 this
 whole
 central
 bank


independence
 thing
 is
 a
 very
 new
 thing


1980s
 in
 other
 countries
 1990s
 and
 I'll


say
 you're
 correct
 but
 I'll
 say
 you
 know


the
 era
 where
 we
 had
 you
 know
 runaway


inflation
 where
 we
 didn't
 have
 central


bank
 independence
 was
 the
 1970s
 and
 you


know
 that
 whole
 oh
 Richard
 Nixon
 just


let
 interest
 rates
 go
 up
 you
 know
 he
 he


asked
 interest
 rates
 to
 to
 not
 go
 up
 too


much
 isn't
 it
 a
 le
 lesson
 from
 the
 1970s


that
 that
 ran
 a
 muck.
 And
 I
 would
 also


make
 the
 argument
 that
 you
 know
 pre-1971


the
 US
 was
 on
 the
 gold
 standard
 and
 the


rest
 of
 the
 world
 was
 also
 constrained


to
 a
 lesser
 degree
 because
 they
 were
 on


the
 dollar
 standard
 the
 Bretton
 wood


system
 and
 then
 of
 course
 you
 know
 we


were
 on
 the
 gold
 standard
 uh
 in
 in
 the


1920s
 and
 then
 you
 know
 going
 going
 back


there's
 been
 various
 metallic
 standards


that
 were
 constraining
 the
 amount
 of


basically
 you
 know
 the
 print
 this
 let


let
 the
 central
 banks
 have
 interest


rates
 wherever
 they
 want
 and
 let
 the


government
 set
 set
 interest
 rates.


that
 that
 is
 a
 you
 know
 often
 been


accompanied
 by
 uh
 monetary
 instability.


So
 just
 what
 do
 you
 make
 about
 about


that
 argument?


>> You're
 right.
 There's
 a
 different
 regime


back
 then
 and
 it's
 and
 it's
 difficult


because
 of
 all
 the
 uh
 differences
 in
 the


system,
 but
 you
 don't
 have
 to
 go
 back


that
 far.
 You
 could
 just
 go
 back
 let's


say
 four
 years.


We
 have
 independent
 central
 banks
 across


the
 western
 world.
 inflation
 to
 the
 moon


or
 you
 can
 go
 back
 to
 uh
 today


inflation's
 at
 3%
 and
 has
 been
 for
 some


time


>> we
 have
 independent
 central
 banks
 right


so
 you
 know
 it's
 not
 it's
 not
 all
 about


that
 you
 have
 um
 you
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 other


factors
 that
 have
 have
 to
 uh
 that
 matter


as
 well


>> that's
 true
 uh
 what
 if
 Joe
 Biden
 during


2022


was
 you
 know
 tweeting
 and
 saying
 that


Jay
 Powell
 is
 out
 of
 control
 raising


interest
 rates
 from
 50
 basis
 points
 to


125
 basis
 points.
 Maybe
 I'm
 thinking


about
 firing
 him.
 You
 know,
 would
 that


have
 been
 a
 good
 thing?
 Clear
 clearly


the
 Federal
 Reserve
 raising
 interest


rates
 in
 2022
 was
 um
 you
 know,
 not
 just


good
 and
 necessary,
 but
 like
 probably


overdue.
 Um
 you
 know,
 would
 you
 have,


you
 know,
 supported
 President
 Biden
 uh


just
 stopping
 Fed
 rate
 cuts
 or
 as
 well?


>> In
 2022,
 it
 seems
 like
 inflation
 was


pretty
 high.
 So,
 I
 think
 that
 was
 the


right
 thing
 to
 do.
 And
 I
 think
 they
 did


have
 political
 support
 to
 to
 do
 that
 at


that
 time.


>> Um
 but
 again
 inflation
 is
 not
 all
 about


rate
 rates
 and
 also
 the
 central
 bank


always
 operates
 within
 the
 political


constraints
 and
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day


when
 inflation
 was
 out
 of
 control
 the


elected
 government
 lost
 and
 we
 got


replaced
 so
 there
 was
 democratic


accountability
 as
 well.
 So
 it
 worked.
 Um


um
 so
 I
 wouldn't
 be
 too
 worried
 about


about
 um
 the
 Fed
 losing
 independence.
 It


probably
 will.
 It
 looks
 like
 we're
 in


that
 kind
 of
 political
 era,
 but
 it


doesn't
 mean
 that
 we'll
 go
 into


hyperinflation,
 right?
 A
 lot
 of
 people


point
 out
 that
 oh
 my
 god,
 we'll
 begin
 we


end
 up
 like
 Ergodon.


>> That's
 an
 extreme
 example,
 right?


Remember,
 we've
 uh
 countries
 have
 been


under
 uh
 politically
 controlled
 central


banks
 for
 a
 long
 time
 and
 things
 were


okay.
 So,
 that's
 not
 the
 only
 outcome.
 I


think
 that's
 very
 obvious


fear-mongering.


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 hyperinflation
 means
 50%


inflation
 or
 50,000%
 inflation.
 Uh
 I
 I


just
 think
 that
 in
 the
 United
 States


that
 is
 is
 very
 unlikely
 just
 to
 to
 put


put
 my
 views
 on
 there.
 So,
 Joseph,
 the


price
 of
 gold
 has
 been
 rallying
 like


crazy
 despite
 the
 recent
 pullback
 over


the
 past,
 let's
 say,
 10
 days.
 Um,
 a
 lot


of
 people
 attribute
 the
 surge
 in
 gold
 to


fears
 of
 central
 bank
 independence
 and


basically
 the
 Federal
 Reserve
 is
 is
 is


cutting
 uh
 cutting
 rates.
 How
 are
 you


thinking
 about
 precious
 metals?
 Uh,
 and


yeah,
 what's
 your
 outlook
 on
 it
 and
 it


potential
 relationship
 with
 with
 the


Feds?


>> It's
 just
 momentum
 like
 everything
 else.


So,
 there's
 a
 popular
 thing
 like
 you
 got


debasement,
 right?
 So
 what
 does
 that


mean
 for
 a
 fiat
 currency
 debasement


means
 your
 money
 is
 worth
 less
 than
 it


was
 before
 that's
 inflation
 right?
 So


debasement
 100%
 happening.
 Got
 a
 $2


trillion
 deficit
 got
 inflation
 was
 2%


now
 it's
 3%.
 So
 your
 money
 fiat
 money


being
 debased.
 No
 doubt
 about
 it.
 Does


that
 mean
 gold
 has
 to
 go
 to
 the
 moon


10,000
 100,000?
 That's
 up
 to
 you
 to


decide.
 So
 the
 debasement
 trade
 and
 all


these
 things
 there
 I
 think
 I
 think
 of
 it


as
 just
 momentum
 like
 everything
 else


like
 we
 see
 in
 Bitcoin
 like
 we
 see
 in
 AI


stocks
 like
 see
 in
 uranium
 stocks
 and
 so


forth.
 a
 bunch
 of
 people
 just
 buying


something
 that
 works,
 making
 a
 lot
 of


money,
 and
 then
 when
 it
 collapses,
 move


on
 on
 to
 the
 next
 thing.
 So,
 I
 wouldn't


read
 too
 much
 in
 these
 macro
 narratives.


I
 think
 we
 just
 have
 a
 class
 of


investors
 who
 understand
 now
 that


basically
 everything
 is
 like
 an
 NFT.
 You


buy
 it,
 it
 goes
 up.
 You
 squeeze
 it,
 it


goes
 up,
 and
 then
 you
 try
 to
 go
 to
 the


next
 thing,


>> right?
 And
 gold
 has
 no
 real
 intrinsic


value
 in
 terms
 of
 trying
 to
 value
 it.


So,
 there's
 no
 reason
 for
 it
 can't
 go
 to


10,000.
 No
 reason
 it
 can't
 go
 to
 2,000


or
 or
 lower.
 um
 as
 opposed
 to
 stocks


that
 you
 know
 valuation
 anchor
 what
 he


said
 Palentland
 here
 is
 trading
 at
 let's


600
 PE
 so
 I'm
 not
 sure
 I'm
 not
 sure
 that


really
 matters
 either


>> yeah
 fair
 fair
 point
 um
 Joseph
 um


closing
 closing
 thought
 for
 you
 is
 you


know
 in
 preparing
 for
 this
 interview
 I


read
 your
 most
 recent
 pieces
 on


fedgu.com
 they
 are
 just
 so
 good
 I
 mean


you're
 such
 a
 good
 writer
 obviously


you're
 such
 a
 smart
 thinker
 and
 good


writer
 but
 in
 particular
 there's
 no


fluff
 in
 your
 pieces
 and
 it's
 it's


amazing
 like
 I
 guess
 only
 like
 some
 like


novels
 and
 literary
 authors
 who
 are


famous
 for
 this
 quality
 is
 is
 where
 I


see
 such
 a
 an
 economy
 of
 words.
 Uh
 so
 I


just
 want
 to
 give
 you
 a
 shout
 out
 there.


Your
 most
 recent
 your
 your
 penultimate


piece
 uh
 on
 Wells
 Fargo
 was
 interesting.


Just
 share
 your reviews
 on
 the
 overall


commercial
 banking
 sector
 as
 well
 as


this
 thing
 that
 you
 talked
 about
 uh
 with


swap
 spreads.
 So
 not
 so
 far
 but
 you
 know


interest
 rate
 swaps
 uh
 have
 been


negative.
 So
 basically
 swaps
 are
 a
 lower


interest
 rate
 than
 treasuries
 but
 they


have
 been
 getting
 less
 negative
 and
 you


attributed
 this
 to
 Wells
 Fargo
 Fargo's


asset
 cap
 being
 being
 lifted.
 Explain


just
 your
 your
 thoughts
 on
 on
 this
 issue


as
 well
 as
 just
 your
 overall
 uh
 outlook


of
 of
 commercial
 bankings
 in
 in
 this


context
 you
 know
 which
 which
 have
 most


of
 the
 big
 ones
 have
 have
 reported


earnings
 so
 far.


>> So
 based
 on
 the
 recent
 earnings
 of
 the


big
 commercial
 banks
 and
 the
 big


regional
 ones
 as
 well
 the
 US
 economy
 is


doing
 fine.
 I
 mean
 if
 uh
 JP
 Morgan
 asked


about
 the
 state
 of
 the
 US
 consumer
 flat


out
 and
 said
 the
 US
 consumer
 is
 fine.
 So


everything
 seems
 to
 be
 okay
 and
 these


big
 banks
 they
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 information


about
 the
 economy
 because
 everyone
 has


accounts
 there.
 They
 see
 your
 credit


card
 spending
 and
 so
 forth.
 So
 they
 have


the
 absolute
 best
 data
 and
 they
 think


the
 consumer
 is
 fine.
 And
 with
 regard
 to


credit
 concerns
 we
 see
 that
 report
 in


the
 market
 as
 well.
 If
 you
 look
 at
 the


loan
 loss
 reserves
 the
 banks
 hold


delinquencies
 they're
 all
 fine
 as
 well.


excuse
 me,
 uh
 they've
 actually
 improved


over
 over
 the
 quarter
 sequentially.
 So


from
 their
 perspective,
 the
 US
 economy


is
 good
 and
 I
 think
 that's
 the
 key


takeaway
 from
 bank
 earnings
 reports.
 Now


with
 respect
 to
 the
 other
 stuff,
 you


know,
 Wells
 Fargo
 had
 an
 asset
 cap
 on


them.
 Yours
 Fargo
 is
 one
 of
 the
 largest


banks
 in
 the
 US.
 Also,
 they
 have
 a


sophisticated
 markets
 practice.
 So
 when


you
 have
 an
 asset
 cap
 on
 you,
 you
 kind


of
 limits
 your
 ability
 to
 do
 new


businesses.
 Once
 that
 cap
 was
 removed,


uh
 they
 actually
 grew
 their
 markets


business
 by
 about
 a
 hundred
 billion


dollars
 and
 50
 billion
 of
 that
 seems
 to


be
 increasing
 lending
 and
 repo.
 50


billion
 seems
 to
 be
 in
 higher
 inventory


of
 securities.
 Now
 what
 that
 means
 is


that
 you
 kind
 of
 have
 the
 pipes
 in
 the


financial
 system
 are
 wider
 and
 so
 that


helps
 get
 cash
 to
 where
 it
 is.
 That
 that


narrow
 spreads
 and
 you
 you
 can
 see
 that


I
 think
 a
 little
 bit
 in
 how
 quickly
 the


RP
 was
 emptied.
 So
 now
 you
 can
 have
 uh


money
 market
 funds
 instead
 of
 lending
 to


the
 RP
 they
 lend
 to
 Wells
 Fargo
 who
 then


lends
 to
 someone
 else.
 Pipes
 are
 wider


and
 the
 swap
 spreads
 are
 also
 less


negative.
 There's
 a
 lot
 of
 things


driving
 that
 but
 one
 of
 the
 things
 I


think
 contributed
 to
 that
 is
 that
 there


is
 more
 balance
 sheet
 capacity
 available


throughout
 the
 broader
 financial
 system


because
 Wells
 Fargo,
 one
 of
 the
 largest


banks
 in
 the
 US
 uh
 had
 his
 asset
 cap


removed.
 So
 that
 was
 a
 smart
 thing
 uh


the
 the
 Federal
 Reserve
 and
 other


regulators
 did
 and
 I
 think
 we're
 going


to
 see
 more
 of
 that
 as
 they
 try
 to


deregulate
 the
 bank
 uh
 reduce


regulations
 on
 bank
 reduce
 capital


requirements.
 So
 that
 that
 is
 a
 a


bullish
 thing
 for
 the
 US
 economy
 but


it's
 going
 to
 play
 out
 slowly
 and


gradually.


>> Joseph,
 you
 got
 this
 phenomenal
 chart
 uh


on
 an
 issue
 I've
 actually
 you
 know
 been


pleased
 to
 cover
 a
 lot
 on
 monetary


matters.
 The
 commercial
 bank
 loans
 to


non-bank
 financial
 institutions.


a
 huge
 amount
 of
 loans,
 commercial
 and


industrial
 loans
 that
 banks
 were
 making


actually,
 you
 know,
 disappeared


overnight
 because
 they
 were
 reclassified


as
 loans
 to
 non-banks.
 So,
 the
 old
 model


of
 a
 bank
 lends
 to
 a
 company
 or
 an


industrial
 facility,
 a
 factory,
 that's


kind
 of
 out
 the
 window.
 Now,
 the
 bank
 is


lending
 to
 a
 a
 private
 credit
 company
 or


a
 business
 development
 company.
 Uh,
 and


then
 those
 companies
 make
 the
 loan.
 So,


the
 banks
 you
 could
 say
 is
 derisks.
 It


has
 a
 more
 senior
 position.
 But
 uh
 you


know
 increasingly
 banks
 are
 are
 not


really
 lending
 to
 the
 economy.
 Um
 and
 I


was
 actually
 at
 a
 conference
 so
 you
 know


this
 data
 is
 recent
 that
 uh
 like
 nine
 to


10%
 of
 bank
 loans
 are
 to
 non-bank
 uh


financial
 institutions
 or
 non-depository


financial
 institutions.
 Uh
 what
 do
 you


think
 is
 the
 significance
 of
 this
 and
 do


you
 think
 it
 makes
 in
 any
 way
 the


Federal
 Reserve's
 jobs
 harder?


>> No,
 it
 makes
 the
 Federal
 jobs
 much


easier
 because
 it
 derisks
 the
 banking


sector.
 In
 the
 past,
 you
 if
 you
 were
 a


bank,
 you
 would
 lend
 to
 a
 company
 and


you
 know,
 you'd
 have
 some
 risk
 there.


Now,
 what
 you
 do
 if
 you're
 a
 bank,
 you


lend
 to
 a
 a
 private
 credit
 fund
 or
 some


kind
 of
 private
 investor.
 They're


usually
 teams
 of
 people
 from
 very
 highly


regarded
 companies,
 you
 know,
 your
 big


asset
 managers
 like
 a
 like
 a
 Black


Rockck
 or
 or
 something
 like
 that.
 And


then
 those
 guys
 then
 take
 the
 money
 and


they
 lend
 to
 other
 companies.
 So,
 let's


say
 that
 the
 company
 has
 a
 default.
 What


happens?
 Well,
 uh
 the
 private
 credit


lender
 deals
 with
 it.


And
 when
 the
 private
 credit
 fund
 has


exhausted
 their
 resources,
 then
 it


becomes
 the
 bank's
 problem.
 So,
 the
 bank


has
 this
 extra
 layer
 between
 them
 and


the
 ultimate
 borrower
 that
 insulates


them
 from
 credit
 risk.
 And
 that's
 the


reason
 why
 they
 do
 it
 because
 it's
 uh


from
 a
 because
 there's
 less
 risk.
 It's


cheaper.
 There's
 less
 it
 costs
 the
 bank


less
 capital
 uh
 to
 make
 that
 loan
 uh
 to


the
 NBFI
 than
 it
 is
 to
 the
 ultimate


borrower.
 So
 we
 have
 this
 basically
 this


shadow
 banking
 sector
 that
 gets
 his


financing
 from
 the
 commercial
 banking


sector
 and
 then
 lends
 it
 to
 the
 real


economy.
 So
 it
 makes
 the
 Fed's
 job
 more


difficult
 in
 that
 it
 doesn't
 really
 know


where
 the
 money
 goes,
 but
 it
 makes
 the


banking
 system
 safer.
 And
 I
 think
 that's


really
 what
 the
 Fed
 cares
 about.
 Uh


because
 when
 the
 banking
 system
 fails,


you
 know,
 that
 affects
 everyone.
 When


you
 have
 some
 private
 credit
 fund
 in
 the


shadows
 that
 fails,
 you
 know
 that


they're
 not
 tradable.
 So
 they
 don't


really
 cause
 panic
 in
 the
 market.
 And


also
 no
 one
 has
 deposits
 there.
 I
 mean


they
 borrow
 from
 wealthy
 individuals
 and


so
 forth,
 but
 it's
 not
 like
 a
 systemic


event
 that
 impacts
 the
 broader
 public.


>> Yeah.
 When
 when
 you
 describe
 it,
 it


sounds
 like
 nothing
 can
 go
 wrong.
 And
 I


understand
 the
 argument,
 but
 often


Joseph,
 as
 you
 know,
 what
 causes


financial
 crises
 is
 are
 not
 um
 risky


things.
 It's
 things
 that
 seem
 very
 safe


like
 mortgages.
 you
 know
 that
 all
 the


analysis
 going
 to
 subprime
 mortgages


were
 was
 correct
 that
 like
 during
 a


recession
 housing
 prices
 never
 go
 down


and
 everyone
 pays
 back
 off
 their
 loans


and
 but
 that
 you
 know
 Denuad
 had
 an


obvious
 credit
 bubble
 so
 it
 kind
 of


seems
 like
 everything
 you
 said
 is


correct
 but
 because
 it's
 so
 safe
 and
 so


great
 it's
 going
 to
 keep
 on
 happening


and
 happening
 until
 it
 gets
 to
 wretched


excesses
 to
 to
 use
 a
 uh
 Charlie
 Meris


ism


>> well
 it's
 not
 safe
 it's
 just
 that
 the


risk
 is
 borne
 by
 people
 that
 is
 not
 it's


not
 borne
 by
 the
 public
 like
 if
 you
 were


if
 it
 was
 born
 by
 the
 commercial
 banks


at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 Hey,
 the
 government


has
 to
 go
 bail
 them
 out
 because
 banks


are
 too
 big
 to
 fail.
 Uh
 but
 your
 private


credit
 funds,
 your
 big
 financial


sponsors,
 those
 guys,
 they're
 not
 too


big
 to
 fail.
 They
 can
 go
 bust.
 And
 so
 uh


I
 think
 it's
 just
 placing
 risk
 uh
 away


from
 the
 public.
 And
 maybe
 that
 would


align
 symptoms
 a
 little
 bit
 because


let's
 say
 that
 you
 are
 a
 big
 gibb,
 you


know,
 you
 can
 do
 whatever
 government


will
 bail
 you
 out.
 So
 that's
 a
 bad


incentive.
 But
 if
 you
 move
 that
 risk
 to


the
 uh
 the
 private
 financial
 companies,


they
 won't
 get
 bailed
 out.
 At
 at
 least
 I


don't
 think
 maybe
 the
 Trump


administration
 is
 different.
 And
 maybe


that
 makes
 them
 uh
 makes
 their


incentives
 more
 aligned
 with
 uh
 with


their
 with
 just
 being
 more
 prudent
 with


their
 risk.
 So
 right
 now
 it
 does
 seem


like
 there
 are
 people
 worried
 about


what's
 happening
 in
 the
 private
 credit


space.
 If
 you
 look
 at
 the
 publicly


traded
 private
 credit
 funds,
 they're


called
 BDC's.
 they've
 been
 taking
 a
 big


haircut
 on
 their
 price.


So,
 uh
 it
 does
 seem
 like
 there's
 some
 uh


concern
 over
 there.
 But
 again,
 if
 a
 if
 a


private
 fund
 goes
 bust,
 it's
 not


systemic.


It's
 mostly
 money
 from
 wealthy


institutions
 and
 rich
 people
 and
 they


can
 bear
 the
 losses.


>> Yes.
 I
 I've
 um
 you
 know,
 actually
 some


of
 those
 BDCs
 I
 think
 the
 the
 sell-off


might
 be
 overblown.
 You
 know,
 what
 do
 I


know?
 But
 in
 particular,
 it's
 these
 uh


so
 non-publicly
 traded
 uh
 BDC's
 like


private
 credit
 funds
 that
 I
 I
 don't
 want


to
 say
 I
 have
 concerns
 over.
 I
 just
 have


questions
 over
 them.
 Like
 you
 know
 some


of
 these
 yields
 I've
 seen
 actually
 this


is
 in
 BDC's
 are
 15%
 14%.
 Like
 if
 you
 you


don't
 get
 that
 risk
 that
 money
 uh


risk-free
 and
 I
 think
 these
 are
 kind
 of


being
 marketed
 to
 investors
 a
 broader


swath
 of
 investors
 who
 are
 maybe
 less


sophisticated.
 You
 know
 Yale
 and
 Harvard


used
 to
 be
 allocating
 to
 them.
 Now
 they


may
 be
 tapped
 out.
 Now
 they're
 going
 to


wealth
 managers
 and
 all
 the
 types
 of


people
 and
 you
 know
 maybe
 it
 is
 going
 to


be
 impacting
 people.
 Also
 Joseph
 a


selling
 point
 of
 these
 things
 were
 that


they're
 unlevered
 or
 it
 used
 to
 be
 we


use
 almost
 no
 leverage.
 The
 BDC's
 are


levered
 but
 the
 the
 private
 credit
 funds


were
 not
 levered
 anymore.
 Now
 they
 are


being
 levered
 like
 banks
 are
 lending
 to


private
 credit
 funds.
 So
 the
 leverage
 is


increasing.
 The
 equity
 is
 coming
 less


from
 institutional
 investors
 more
 from


retail
 or
 you
 know
 retailish
 people


investors.
 It
 is
 becoming
 more
 levered.


I
 think
 the
 cycle
 is
 aging.
 Again,
 I


don't
 want
 to,
 you
 know,
 say
 say
 portray


just
 a
 doom
 and
 gloom
 narrative,
 but


just,
 you
 know,
 just
 want
 to
 give
 the


the
 full
 perspective.


>> Yeah.
 Good
 perspective.


>> Yeah.
 Um,
 all
 right,
 Joseph,
 can
 you


just
 give
 us
 just
 a
 a
 brief
 overview
 of


where
 do
 you
 think
 the
 the
 what
 do
 you


what
 what
 are
 you
 going
 to
 be
 tracking


for
 the
 Federal
 Reserve
 over
 the
 coming


weeks
 and
 months?


>> I
 think
 the
 trend
 this
 year
 is
 less


about
 the
 Fed,
 more
 about
 what
 happens


with
 the
 White
 House
 and
 the
 AI


companies.
 So,
 unfortunately,
 as
 a
 Fed


watcher,
 it's
 just
 not
 that
 important.


But
 if
 you
 were
 to
 focus
 on
 the
 Fed,
 it


will
 be
 about
 the
 ultimate
 composition


of
 the
 Fed's
 balance
 sheet.
 Whether
 or


not
 they
 really
 will
 significantly


shorten
 their
 duration
 and
 how
 quickly


will
 they
 get
 there.
 Will
 they
 actually


sell
 securities
 to
 get
 to
 their
 final


composition?
 Uh
 that's
 what
 I
 would
 be


looking
 for
 in
 the
 next
 few
 months.


>> Oh,
 that
 makes
 sense.
 And
 Jose,
 just


just
 a
 final
 question.
 How
 tightly


correlated
 are
 the
 level
 of
 bank


reserves
 but
 in
 particular
 the
 minute


stresses
 of
 a
 few
 basis
 points
 here
 a


few
 basis
 points
 there
 in
 terms
 of
 sofur


spreads
 going
 up
 in
 terms
 of
 swap


spreads
 going
 whatever
 uh
 how
 correlated


is
 that
 with
 true
 financial
 stress
 of


credit
 spreads
 going
 up
 and
 the
 stock


market
 going
 down
 like


>> I
 don't
 believe
 it's
 correlated
 at
 all


it's
 just
 tiny
 tiny
 it's
 a
 huge
 market


very
 important
 but
 also
 very
 obscure


>> uh
 so
 I
 don't
 really
 I think
 it
 I
 mean


if
 you
 look
 at
 what
 happened
 in


September
 2019,
 it
 didn't
 really
 affect


the
 broader
 market
 at
 all.
 So
 it's
 just


kind
 of
 too
 niche,
 too
 in
 the
 weeds,
 but


at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day,
 it's
 essential


from
 the
 Fed's
 perspective.
 And
 so
 the


Fed
 will
 also
 always
 step
 in
 and
 build


that
 market
 out.
 So
 I
 don't
 think
 it's


anything
 to
 worry
 about.
 All right,


Joseph.
 Well,
 we'll
 leave
 it
 there.
 Um,


people

 that
 next

 very
 early
 November,
 I
 will

 a
 very
 high-profile
 guest.


Uh,

 I
 by
 very
 high

very,
 very
 important.

Matters,
 on
 my
 previous

 forward


guidance,
 in

 don't


want
 to
 miss.
