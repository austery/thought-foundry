ever
 wonder
 why
 a
 financial
 crisis
 in


one
 country
 can
 threaten
 the
 entire


global
 economy
 that's
 where


International
 organizations
 step
 in


acting
 as
 the
 world's
 Financial


firefighters
 though
 sometimes
 they
 show


up
 with
 a
 garden
 hose
 when
 you

 Tru
 these
 multilateral


institutions
 established
 through


treaties
 between
 member
 nations
 serve
 as


the
 backbone
 of
 global
 economic


governance
 they
 work
 tirelessly
 to


maintain
 Financial
 stability
 facilitate


international
 trade
 and
 promote

Economic

 worldwide
 often


preventing
 economic
 dominoes
 from


falling
 these
 institutions
 operate


through
 a
 weighted
 voting
 system
 where


larger
 economies
 typically
 have
 more


influence
 imagine
 a
 high
 school
 student


council
 where
 the
 seniors
 get
 more
 votes


than
 freshmen
 except
 with
 billions
 of


dollars
 at
 stake
 funding
 comes
 from


Member
 contributions
 Bond
 issuance
 and


interest
 from

 the
 major
 players


include
 the
 international
 monetary
 fund


handling
 Financial
 stability


and

 cooperation
 the
 World
 Bank


tackling
 poverty
 reduction
 the
 World


Trade
 Organization
 managing

 the


bank
 for

facilitating
 Central

 cooperation


and
 the
 organization
 for
 economic


cooperation
 and
 development
 providing


economic
 research
 if
 these
 names
 sound


familiar
 it's
 because
 they
 often
 work


hand
 inand
 with
 the
 central
 banks
 we'll


discuss
 next
 the
 Greek
 financial
 crisis


perfectly
 illustrates
 these


organizations
 in
 action
 when
 Greece


faced
 severe
 debt
 problems
 in
 2008
 the


IMF
 and
 European
 Partners
 stepped
 in


with
 a
 110
 billion
 Euro
 emergency
 loan


package
 but
 here's
 where
 it
 gets


interesting
 Greece
 had
 to
 implement


strict
 austerity
 measures
 including


pension
 cuts
 and
 tax
 increases
 sound


harsh
 well
 that's
 where
 the
 controversy


begins
 while
 designed
 to
 be
 neutral


Arbiters
 of
 global
 economic
 stability


these
 institutions
 often
 face
 criticism


for
 favoring
 developed
 nation's


interests
 they've
 been
 accused
 of
 moving


too
 slowly
 during
 crisis
 creating


dependency
 through
 repeated
 lending


cycles
 and
 implementing
 one
 siiz


fits-all
 Solutions
 but
 before
 you
 judge


too
 harshly
 consider
 this
 what
 if
 these


organizations
 didn't
 exist
 as
 we'll
 see


when
 we
 examine
 central
 banks
 next


sometimes
 the
 medicine
 might
 seem
 bitter


but
 the
 alternative
 could
 be
 much


worse
 imagine
 a
 mysterious
 group
 of


financial
 Wizards
 who
 can
 print
 money


control
 interest
 rates
 and
 potenti
 make


or
 break
 entire
 economies
 with
 the


stroke
 of
 a

 welcome
 to
 the
 world
 of

 the

 lurking
 behind

 scenes
 of

 central

 are
 the


primary
 monetary

 institutions
 of

 responsible
 for
 managing
 a

 they

 as

 conducting

 supervising

 and
 serving
 as

 of

 during

 major

 European
 Central

 bank
 of


Japan
 Bank
 of
 England
 and
 People's
 Bank


of
 China
 each
 wielding
 enormous
 economic


influence
 a
 classic
 example
 of
 Central


Bank
 power
 emerged
 during
 the
 2008


financial
 crisis
 when
 Leman
 Brothers


collapsed
 the
 Federal
 Reserve
 led
 by
 Ben


Bernan
 implemented
 unprecedented


quantitative
 easing
 they
 essentially


created
 trillions
 of
 dollars
 out
 of
 thin


air
 purchasing
 government
 bonds
 and


mortgage-backed
 securities
 to
 prevent


total
 economic
 meltdown
 this


intervention
 saved
 the
 US
 from
 potential


economic
 collapse
 but
 also
 raised


critical
 questions
 about
 the
 long-term


consequences
 of
 such
 massive
 monetary


interventions
 while
 designed
 to
 maintain


economic
 stability
 central
 banks
 often


face
 criticism
 for
 policies
 that


seemingly
 benefit
 Financial
 Elites
 more


than
 average
 citizens
 they've
 been


accused
 of
 creating
 asset
 bubbles


enabling
 excessive
 Bank
 speculation
 and


widening
 economic
 inequality
 through


policies
 like
 low
 interest
 rates
 and


quantitative
 easing
 but
 here's
 the


kicker
 compared
 to
 the
 international


organizations
 we
 just
 discussed
 central


banks
 operate
 with
 even
 more
 direct
 and


immediate
 power
 just
 wait
 until
 you
 see


how
 these
 monetary
 magicians
 connect


with
 government
 institutions
 and
 the


shocking
 ways
 they
 can
 manipulate
 entire


economic

 ever

 how

 functioning
 as
 both
