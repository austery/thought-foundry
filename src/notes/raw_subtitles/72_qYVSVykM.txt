Hello
 everybody.


Welcome
 back
 to
 another
 episode
 of
 the


Market
 Future
 Show.
 We
 are
 live
 and
 boy


oh
 boy,
 what
 a
 Friday.
 This
 is
 about
 to


become
 or
 actually
 it's
 not
 Friday.
 I've


missed
 my
 uh
 I
 missed
 my
 job
 on
 Friday.


It's
 about
 to
 become
 a
 pretty
 exciting


Monday
 morning
 as
 we
 transition


from
 Sunday
 night
 into
 into
 the
 market


open.
 You
 know,
 obviously
 I
 can't
 wear
 a


hat
 because,
 you
 know,
 there's
 no
 cap


about
 the
 fact
 that
 we
 are
 going
 higher,


folks.
 We
 are
 going
 higher,
 ladies
 and


gentlemen.
 The
 futures,
 for
 those
 that


haven't
 seen
 it,
 are
 green,


green,
 green,
 green
 across
 the
 board.


S&P
 500
 up
 1%,
 the
 NASDAQ
 up
 1%.
 Small


caps
 up
 1.13.
 The
 VIX
 down
 7.8,
 which
 is


great
 to
 see.
 The
 VIX
 was
 at
 25
 last


week,
 now
 potentially
 going
 to
 open
 up


uh
 below
 18,
 potentially
 even
 below
 17


where
 it
 was
 two
 weeks
 ago.
 And
 then
 you


got
 the
 Dow
 Jones
 basically
 hitting
 a


all-time
 high
 at
 47,530,
 up
 almost
 a


percent.
 This
 is
 because
 it
 likely
 is


signaling
 that
 we
 have
 a
 trade
 deal
 with


China.
 We
 got
 a
 lot
 to
 talk
 about
 when


it
 comes
 to
 China.
 So,
 we'll
 talk
 about


that.
 Um,
 but
 it's
 about
 to
 be
 an


exciting
 exciting
 exciting
 uh
 overnight


markets.
 That's
 to
 say
 the
 least.
 Dude,


I
 just
 didn't
 feel
 like
 wearing
 a
 hat


today.
 That's
 all.
 I
 didn't
 feel
 like


wearing
 a
 hat.
 This
 is
 the
 first
 time
 I


actually
 took
 my
 hat
 off
 in
 a
 while.
 So,


it's
 not
 like
 the
 official
 hairstyle
 or


anything.
 I
 just
 said,
 "You
 know what?


Screw
 it.
 I
 don't
 care."
 So,
 we
 took
 the


hat
 off
 and
 uh
 the
 hair
 is
 going
 all


crazy,
 but
 there
 you
 go.
 I'm
 sorry
 I


couldn't
 make
 it
 on
 Friday,
 guys.
 I
 just


I
 don't
 know
 what
 happened
 on
 Friday,


but
 after
 the
 close
 or
 after
 the
 open,
 I


just
 didn't
 feel
 good,
 bro.
 Like,
 I


didn't
 feel
 My
 voice
 was
 being
 weird.
 My


like
 legs
 were
 shivering.
 Like,
 I
 I


think
 it
 it's
 the
 the
 hot
 to
 cold


weather.
 Something
 happened
 on
 Friday.
 I


even
 called
 Steve.
 There
 he
 is
 right


there
 in
 the
 chat.
 We'll
 uh
 we'll
 we'll


be
 going
 over
 to
 his
 alternative
 assets


weekly
 once
 we're
 done
 with
 the
 future


show.
 But
 I
 even
 called
 him.
 I
 was
 like,


"Bro,
 I
 don't
 think
 I
 can
 do
 the
 show."


He
 was
 like, "What?
 You're
 going
 to
 miss


the
 show?"
 I'm
 like, "You
 know,
 I
 I


really
 don't
 like
 missing
 my
 show.
 You


guys
 know
 me.
 I've
 I've
 only
 missed
 the


show
 because
 of
 the
 dentist,
 which
 is
 a,


you
 know,
 good
 reason
 to
 miss
 the
 show


if
 if
 you
 have
 a
 dentist
 that
 looks
 as


nice
 as
 mine."
 Um,
 and
 then
 and
 then
 I'm


traveling.
 Otherwise,
 I
 don't
 miss
 the


show.
 So,
 I
 don't
 know
 what
 happened
 on


Friday.
 I
 just
 didn't
 feel
 good.
 But
 I'm


back
 and
 uh
 and
 very
 excited
 to
 be
 here.


Now,
 a
 couple
 things
 before
 we
 get
 into


everything
 we
 got
 going
 on.
 We
 got
 12


minutes
 until
 the
 overnight
 markets
 open


and
 then
 after
 those
 overnight
 markets


where
 these
 prices
 are
 about
 to
 be


crazy.
 Bitcoin,
 Ethereum,
 everything's


mooning.
 Then
 we'll
 get
 into
 the
 reasons


for
 why
 all
 of
 this
 is
 happening
 along


with
 obviously
 what's
 going
 on
 with


China
 which
 is
 kind
 of
 creating
 this


impact.
 Bitcoin
 got
 to
 115.5.
 We're
 at


114
 right
 now.
 And
 then
 Ethereum
 finally


breaking
 over
 4,4100


which
 is
 very
 nice
 to
 see
 from
 Ethereum.


Um
 over
 the
 weekend


over
 the
 weekend


I
 read
 a
 book
 I
 and
 when
 I
 mean
 I


actually
 read
 the
 book
 I
 mean
 I
 was
 up


last
 night.
 I
 didn't
 read
 the
 entire


thing.
 I'm
 still
 have
 a
 couple
 chapters


left
 but
 I
 legit
 read
 a
 book.
 So
 there


is
 a
 book
 coming
 out
 called
 the


philosopher
 in
 the
 valley
 by
 Michael


Steinberger.
 He
 is
 someone
 who
 basically


this
 is
 basically
 an
 autobiography
 on


Karp
 and
 before
 the
 market
 futures


stream
 right
 now
 I
 um
 I
 interviewed
 him


for
 the
 past
 two
 hours
 and
 it
 was


fascinating
 to
 interview
 a
 guy
 who
 Karp


had
 given
 a
 lot
 of
 access
 to
 over
 the


past
 five
 years
 and
 that's
 why
 I
 think
 I


read
 the
 book.
 You
 know
 there
 there's


two
 takeaways
 from
 this.
 Number
 one
 I


realized
 if
 I
 actually
 care
 about
 the


subject
 I'm
 willing
 to
 read.
 Like
 I
 was


up
 last
 night.
 I
 can
 barely
 watch
 a


movie
 for
 five
 minutes
 before
 checking


Twitter.
 I
 was
 reading
 through
 the
 book.


I
 was
 like
 I
 was
 licking
 my
 finger
 to


come
 to
 get
 to
 the
 next
 page.
 Like
 I


just
 it's
 like
 if
 I'm
 interested
 in
 it,


I'll
 read
 it.
 Number
 two,
 it
 taught
 me


or
 it
 reminded
 me
 how
 much
 I
 love
 to


read.
 And
 I
 think
 it's
 maybe
 because


I've
 been
 writing
 more
 on
 the
 Substack


and
 so
 obviously
 and
 I
 read
 every
 day.
 I


read
 a
 lot
 of
 research
 and
 articles
 and


stuff,
 but
 I
 don't
 read
 books
 anymore.
 I


kind
 of
 want
 to
 get
 back
 to
 reading


books.
 I
 mean,
 if
 it's
 a
 something
 that


I
 actually
 care
 about,
 I
 feel
 like
 I
 can


get
 through
 the
 book.
 And
 you
 know,
 it


really
 felt
 good
 to
 not
 get
 distracted


by
 notifications
 or
 YouTube
 or
 and
 just


sit
 down
 and
 read.
 Like
 it
 just
 felt


like
 peaceful.
 I
 don't
 know if
 it's


because
 if
 I'm
 getting
 older
 or


something,
 but
 as
 I'm
 I
 don't
 know,
 I


want
 to
 get
 back
 to
 reading.
 So,
 the


point
 is
 uh
 this
 is
 an
 amazing
 book.
 I


think
 the
 interview
 will
 be
 really
 nice.


A
 lot
 of
 you
 guys
 will
 get
 to
 hear
 parts


about
 Karp
 that
 you've
 never
 heard
 about


before.
 Um
 I
 got
 to
 the
 epilogue
 and
 I'm


in
 the
 book.
 I'm
 in
 the
 book.
 My
 mom


freaked
 out
 last
 night
 when
 she
 saw


this,
 but
 I'm
 in
 the
 book
 and
 it's
 kind


of
 crazy.
 It's
 it's
 a
 it's
 a
 it's
 a


small
 mention,
 but
 I'll
 show
 you
 guys


right
 here.


I'll
 read
 it.
 In
 early
 December
 2024,
 a


few
 weeks
 after
 the
 presidential


election,
 Pounder
 hosted
 an
 AIP
 event
 in


the
 New
 York
 office.
 When
 I
 arrived
 that


morning,
 Karp
 was
 deep
 in
 conversation


with
 a
 Cookian,
 amateur
 stock


commentator
 who
 was
 possibly
 Palanteers


and
 Karp's
 biggest
 fan
 in
 the
 retail


investor
 community.
 He
 was
 now
 regularly


invited
 to
 the
 company's
 events
 and
 had


become
 its
 deacto
 human
 mascot.
 As
 Karp


chatted
 with
 Mr.
 Kraja,
 he
 noticed
 a


woman
 approaching
 from
 across
 the
 room


and
 exclaimed,
 "Oh,
 to
 what
 do
 we
 have


this
 honor?"
 And
 then
 he
 he
 talks
 about


who
 the
 woman
 was
 and
 why
 she
 was
 even


meeting
 Karp.
 But
 that
 all
 happened.


That
 all
 happened
 like
 Karp
 and
 I
 were


speaking.
 We
 were
 having
 a
 conversation


December
 of
 2024.
 In
 fact,
 the


conversation
 was
 about
 how
 much
 the


institutional
 investors
 missed
 Palunteer


and
 just
 like
 how
 excited
 he
 was.
 was


right
 after
 they
 got
 into
 the
 NASDAQ
 and


the
 S&P.
 So,
 this
 was
 two
 months
 after


they
 got
 into
 those
 indices
 and
 Michael


Steinberger
 was
 there.
 He
 was
 he
 was
 I


guess
 he
 was
 observing
 everything
 that


was
 happening
 and
 then
 he
 ended
 up


putting
 it
 into
 the
 epilog.


So,
 that
 was
 kind
 of
 crazy
 seeing
 this


last
 night.
 I
 did
 not
 think
 I
 would
 get


a
 spot
 in
 the
 book,
 but
 yeah,
 I'm
 in
 the


book
 and
 so
 it's
 pretty
 cool
 stuff.


Pretty
 I'm
 not
 I'm
 not
 getting
 paid.
 I
 I


mean
 there's
 no
 copyright
 or
 use
 of
 my


name
 or
 anything
 like
 I
 just
 I
 got
 to


the
 epilog
 last
 and
 I
 was
 like,
 "Holy


crap,
 I'm
 in
 the
 freaking
 book."
 So,


it's
 pretty
 cool
 stuff.
 I
 think
 you
 guys


will
 enjoy
 the
 book
 and
 uh
 yeah,
 I
 think


you
 guys
 will
 enjoy
 the
 interview
 as


well
 because
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 parts


about
 Karp
 that
 no
 one
 knows
 about,


including
 the
 fact
 that
 Karp
 is
 half


black.
 A
 lot
 of
 people
 don't
 know
 that


he's
 biracial,
 you
 know,
 and
 so
 there's


a
 lot
 of
 different
 elements
 of
 his


identity,
 how
 he
 thinks
 about
 politics,


the
 world,
 like
 why
 he
 never
 got


married.
 It's
 it's
 a
 really
 good
 book
 on


a
 lot
 of
 those
 subjects
 and
 um
 his


dyslexia,
 you
 know,
 all
 that
 stuff.
 So,


so
 I
 think
 when
 the
 interview
 comes
 out,


you
 guys
 will
 like
 it
 and
 it
 should
 be


pretty
 fun.
 Yeah,
 I
 got
 called
 the
 human


mascot,
 dude.
 That
 was
 crazy.
 I'm
 not


getting
 any
 royalties
 on
 this.
 I
 didn't


I
 just
 I
 I
 I
 I
 got
 to
 the
 epilogue
 last


night.
 I
 was
 like,
 "Holy
 crap,
 my
 name's


there."
 I
 told
 my
 mom.
 She
 was
 like,


"Why
 is
 your
 name
 there?"
 I
 was like,
 "I


don't know,
 but
 my
 name's
 there.
 I'm


there."
 And
 obviously,
 it
 was
 a
 metaphor


for
 like
 the
 retail
 investor.
 So,
 pretty


cool
 stuff.
 Yeah.
 Black
 and
 Jewish
 as


well.
 Yeah.
 A
 lot
 of
 people
 still
 don't


know
 that.
 There's
 a
 lot
 of
 parts
 of
 his


to
 his
 identity
 that
 people
 don't
 know.


But
 there
 you
 go.
 All
 right.
 So,
 we
 got


eight
 minutes
 until
 the
 overnight


markets
 open.
 Uh
 I
 am
 very
 excited.
 Why


am
 I
 excited?
 Because
 we're
 going


higher.
 It's
 that
 simple.
 We
 are
 going


higher.
 And
 the
 reason
 we're
 going


higher
 is
 because
 it
 looks
 like
 from


everything
 I've
 seen
 in
 the
 past
 24


hours,
 we
 are
 getting
 a
 deal
 with
 China.


Now,
 I
 know
 that
 this
 entire
 year
 has


basically
 been
 a
 metaphor


uh
 uh
 embodied
 through
 this
 picture


right
 here.
 As
 everyone
 can
 see
 right


here
 on
 the
 screen,
 this
 picture
 is


literally
 the
 basis
 for
 how
 this
 year


has
 gone.
 But
 as
 Mr.
 Steven
 Fiorillo


would
 said,
 higher.
 We
 are
 going
 higher.


And
 we're
 going
 to
 get
 into
 the
 earnings


conversation
 this
 week,
 guys.
 This
 week


is
 going
 to
 be
 crazy.
 We're
 going
 to


talk
 about
 the
 Fed
 because
 we
 got
 a
 Fed


cut
 coming
 up
 this
 week.
 Not
 to
 mention


we
 got
 forget
 SoFi
 earnings
 by
 which
 by


the
 way
 I
 did
 buy
 another
 500
 shares
 of


SoFi
 on
 Friday.
 So
 your
 boy's
 loaded
 up


thousand
 shares.
 I
 didn't
 get
 to
 tell


you
 guys
 because
 I
 didn't
 go
 live
 but
 uh


my
 average
 is
 now
 like
 $295.


Thousand
 shares
 I'm
 loaded
 up
 and


hopefully
 not
 can
 take
 us
 to
 the


promised
 land.
 But
 uh
 we
 got
 SoFi
 on
 f


on
 Tuesday
 we
 have
 Meta,
 Google
 and


Microsoft
 on
 Wednesday
 all
 at
 the
 same


time.
 And
 then
 on
 top
 of
 that,
 you
 have


the
 FOMC
 meeting
 right
 before
 all
 those


companies
 report.
 I
 mean,
 this
 is
 going


to
 be
 one
 of
 the
 most
 crazy
 weeks
 I


think
 we've
 ever
 had
 in
 stock
 market


history.
 I
 don't
 remember
 the
 last
 time


we
 had
 Meta,
 Microsoft,
 and
 Alphabet


happen
 at
 the
 same
 time.
 I
 I've
 seen


Microsoft
 and
 Alphabet
 happen
 together.


I've
 seen
 Meta
 and
 Apple
 happen


together.
 But
 all
 three
 of
 them,
 I
 mean,


that
 day
 Wednesday
 after
 close
 is
 going


to
 be
 madness
 trying
 to
 cover


everything.
 But
 it's
 going to
 be
 wild.


And
 then
 you
 have
 SoFi
 and
 PayPal
 on


Tuesday.
 You
 have
 Amazon
 and
 Apple
 on


Thursday.
 we
 just
 have
 a
 lot
 of


companies
 and
 then
 you
 have
 that
 Fed


rate
 cut
 on
 Wednesday
 morning.
 So,
 this


is
 going
 to
 be
 a
 wild
 week
 and
 the
 way


to
 make
 this
 week
 even
 more
 special
 is


if
 we
 can
 get
 some
 real
 negotiations


done
 with
 China.
 We've
 been
 talking


about
 this
 China
 story
 for
 the
 past


basically
 call
 it
 nine
 days
 now.
 Ever


since
 the
 whole
 kind
 of
 Trump
 is
 mad
 at


China
 thing
 broke
 out
 which
 caused
 the


S&P
 500
 to
 fall
 3%
 for
 the
 first
 time
 in


five
 months.
 And
 I
 think
 the
 kind
 of


theme
 of
 this
 entire
 show
 has
 been


they're
 negotiating.
 It's
 leverage.
 And


at
 the
 end
 of the
 day,
 we've
 been


through
 this
 playbook
 a
 billion
 times.
 I


think
 a
 lot
 of
 us
 bought
 the
 dip
 back
 on


October
 10th.
 I
 mean,
 we
 know


historically
 the
 stock
 market
 had
 the


largest
 inflows
 it's
 seen
 in
 the
 past
 uh


15
 years
 on
 that
 Friday.
 And
 I
 think
 a


lot
 of
 us
 bought
 the
 dip
 last
 Friday,


not
 this
 Friday
 because
 this
 Friday
 we


closed
 at
 all
 time
 highs,
 but
 la
 or
 no


it
 wasn't
 last
 Friday,
 it
 was
 last


Wednesday
 when
 things
 got
 really
 rocky


and
 um
 you
 had
 like
 poundry
 go
 to
 169,


Nvidia
 go
 to
 177
 like
 like
 people
 ended


up
 buying
 the
 dip
 and
 I
 think
 those
 dip


buyers
 are
 going
 to
 be
 rewarded
 because


essentially
 based
 on
 what
 we've
 heard


today,
 it
 looks
 like
 we
 got
 a
 deal.


We'll
 talk
 more
 about
 the
 deal,
 but


here's
 one
 video
 from
 Bent
 this
 morning


highlighting
 that
 this
 deal
 uh
 might


actually
 be
 happening.
 This
 was
 the


fifth
 meeting
 that
 I've
 had
 with
 my


Chinese
 counterpart,
 the
 vice
 premier


Julie
 Fun,
 and
 we
 covered
 a
 wide
 range


of
 issues
 and
 I
 think
 we've
 reached
 a


substantial
 framework
 for
 the
 two


leaders
 who
 will
 meet
 in
 Korea
 next


Thursday.
 So,
 uh,
 you
 know,
 on
 the
 on


the
 table,
 uh,
 the
 president
 had
 given


me
 maximum
 leverage
 when
 he
 threatened


100%
 tariffs
 if
 the
 Chinese
 impose
 their


rare
 earth
 uh,
 global
 export
 controls.


So
 I
 think
 we
 have
 averted
 that.
 So
 the


the
 tariffs
 will
 be
 averted
 and
 we
 have


a
 regular
 meeting
 regular
 quarterly


meeting
 uh
 with
 the
 Chinese.
 Uh
 it
 was


scheduled
 for
 November
 10th
 or
 before


November
 10th.
 I
 don't
 think
 we
 will


have
 to
 have
 that.
 So
 uh
 we
 have
 been


rolling
 the
 tariffs
 quarterly.
 So
 we


agreed
 on
 that.
 We
 also
 agreed
 on


substantial
 agriculture
 purchases
 for
 US


farmers.
 We
 agreed
 that
 the
 Chinese


would
 begin
 to
 help
 us
 uh
 with
 the


precursor
 chemicals
 for
 this
 terrible


fentanyl
 epidemic
 that's
 ravaging
 our


country.
 So
 I
 would
 say
 that
 it
 was
 a


very
 good
 meeting
 overall.


Okay.
 So
 you
 got
 Bent
 saying
 it
 was
 a


very
 good
 meeting
 overall.
 There's
 a


bunch
 more
 clips
 and
 we'll
 talk
 about
 uh


some
 of
 those
 clips
 from
 Bent
 and
 Greer


and
 all
 those
 guys.
 But
 dude,
 even
 the


Chinese
 and
 again
 we're
 going
 to
 go
 real


deep
 into
 this
 story.
 We
 got
 three


minutes
 until
 the
 overnight
 markets


open.
 But
 the
 Chinese
 embassy
 tweeted


that
 uh
 these
 three
 bullet
 points
 that


they
 have
 agreed
 to
 make
 full
 use
 of
 the


China
 US
 economic
 and
 trade
 consultation


mechanism,
 maintain
 close
 communication


on
 respective
 concerns
 in
 the
 economic


and
 trade
 fields
 and
 promote
 the


healthy,
 stable,
 sustainable
 uh
 healthy


and
 stable
 development
 of
 economic
 and


trade
 relations
 to
 benefit
 both


countries
 and
 contribute
 to
 global


prosperity.
 I
 mean
 that
 does
 not
 sound


like
 a
 trade
 war.
 those
 three
 bullet


points
 right
 there
 which
 is
 word
 for


word
 what
 the
 Chinese
 embassy
 tweeted


today
 uh
 does
 not
 feel
 like
 a
 trade
 war


it
 does
 not
 feel
 like
 China
 hates
 the
 US


or
 the
 US
 hates
 China
 it
 looks
 like
 and


again
 we
 don't
 have
 a
 deal
 but
 Bent
 and


Lee
 set
 up
 the
 negotiations
 for
 what
 a


framework
 for
 a
 deal
 would
 look
 like
 and


that
 framework
 for
 a
 deal
 is
 going
 to
 be


established
 uh
 hopefully
 on
 November
 1st


when
 Trump
 meets
 with
 Xi
 or
 I
 think
 it's


it's
 October
 30th
 it's
 it's
 in
 that
 in


that
 time
 frame
 October
 30th
 to
 November


1st
 that
 they're
 meeting
 and
 look
 if
 we


come
 to
 any
 reasonable
 conclusion


and
 you've
 got
 the
 Fed
 rate
 cut
 and


you've
 got
 earnings
 coming
 in
 in
 a
 you


know
 a
 much
 better
 way
 than
 people
 have


expected.
 I
 mean
 so
 far
 80%
 of
 the


companies
 that
 have
 reported
 in
 the
 S&P


500
 have
 beat
 on
 earnings.
 We
 looked
 at


on
 Thursday
 whether
 it
 was
 Intel
 or


Deckers
 and
 maybe
 their
 stocks
 didn't


cooperate
 because
 a
 lot
 of
 those
 stocks


were
 already
 up
 a
 lot
 year
 to
 date
 but


the
 companies
 beat
 by
 an
 average
 of
 like


15
 to
 25%
 on
 EPS
 on
 earnings
 which
 means


margins
 are
 going
 up.


I
 mean
 I
 think
 we're
 going
 higher.
 I


think
 we
 are
 going
 higher
 and
 it
 is


exciting
 to
 see.
 Now,
 here's
 the
 poll


I'll
 put
 real
 quick
 in
 the
 chat.
 Higher


or
 sell
 the
 news.
 Higher
 or
 sell
 the


news.
 I
 mean,
 there's
 a
 world
 where
 it


could
 be
 a
 sell
 the
 news.
 That
 could


definitely
 happen.
 We
 did
 close
 at
 an


all-time
 high
 uh
 on
 Friday.
 Uh
 S&P


likely
 opens
 up,
 I
 think,
 closer
 to
 that


680
 level
 in
 the
 next
 two
 minutes.
 But


if
 it
 is
 a
 sell
 the
 news,
 dude,
 it's


also
 going
 to
 be
 a
 buy
 the
 dip.
 like


every
 single
 thing
 this
 year,
 every


single
 opportunity
 that
 we've
 had
 has


been
 a
 buy
 the
 dip.
 And
 I
 don't
 think


that
 necessarily
 changes.
 Now,
 the
 the


question
 around
 a
 lot
 of
 those
 momentum


stocks
 that
 took
 a
 meaningful
 draw
 down


over
 the
 past
 couple
 weeks,
 uh
 I
 don't


know
 if
 they're
 going
 back
 to
 all-time


highs.
 Maybe
 that's
 possible.
 But
 even


if
 they
 don't,
 again,
 it's
 not
 the


craziest
 idea,
 right?
 Because
 some
 of


those
 stocks
 that
 did
 take
 a
 draw
 down,


maybe
 that
 draw
 down
 is
 enough.
 And
 a


lot
 of
 those
 stocks,
 you
 know,
 got
 hit


30,
 40%.
 and
 now
 they
 can
 go
 higher
 even


if
 they
 don't
 get
 back
 to
 all-time
 highs


or
 they
 can
 stabilize
 in
 a
 range
 which


is
 one
 of
 the
 best
 things
 you
 could
 ask


for
 for
 stocks
 that
 are
 up
 five
 to
 7x


for
 the
 year
 even
 after
 that
 40%


decline.
 So
 I
 think there's
 a
 lot
 of


healthy
 components
 to
 what
 has
 happened


over
 the
 past
 couple
 weeks
 even
 though


it
 was
 painful
 for
 all
 of
 us
 to
 deal


with.
 But
 again,
 every
 time
 there's
 been


any
 level
 of
 pain,
 what
 do
 we
 do?
 We


bought
 the
 dip
 or
 at least
 the
 majority


of
 retail
 bought
 the
 dip.
 And
 I
 think


that
 has
 continued
 to
 play
 out.
 And


again,
 it's
 not
 just
 buying
 the
 dip
 for


the
 hell
 of
 buying
 the
 dip.
 It's
 because


the
 earnings
 momentum
 that
 is
 out
 there


continues
 to
 prove
 that
 buying
 the
 dip


makes
 sense.
 And
 it
 feels
 like
 7,000
 S&P


500
 might
 be
 in
 play
 because
 of
 that


ability
 to
 buy
 the
 dip.
 Here
 we
 go.


Overnight
 markets
 are
 open.
 Let's
 see


what
 we've
 got.
 Hoodie
 142.
 That's
 up


1.5%
 as
 we
 open
 the
 markets.
 Palenteer


186.
 That
 is
 green
 as
 we
 open
 the


overnight
 markets.
 Tesla
 438.
 That's
 up


1%.
 Nvidia
 188
 trying
 to
 get
 back
 to


that
 195
 level
 that
 Nvidia
 was
 at
 a


couple
 weeks
 ago.
 Uh
 AMD,
 wow,
 257.
 AMD,


oh
 my.
 AMD
 closed
 at
 253
 last
 week.
 25.


Google
 right
 there,
 261.
 We
 saw
 Google


get
 to
 260
 a
 while
 ago.
 So,
 I'm
 happy
 I


bought
 another
 500
 shares
 on
 Friday.


Let's
 see
 if
 we
 can
 get
 to
 35
 um
 on


these
 earnings
 on
 Tuesday.
 SoFi
 right


there
 2963.
 Amazon
 up
 1%
 226.
 Meta
 744.


Haven't
 seen
 Meta
 at
 740
 since


September.
 Reddit,
 that's
 up
 1.4%.


PayPal's
 up
 1%.
 ELF
 is
 up
 1%.
 Apple's
 up


1%.
 Where
 is
 BMR?
 I'm
 going
 to
 guess
 54.


I'm
 going
 to
 guess
 54
 if
 it
 loads
 up.


Legends
 being
 slow.
 There
 it
 is.
 54.
 53.


Okay,
 cool.
 53.
 Still
 a
 5%
 move.
 Not
 too


bad.
 You
 got
 Bitcoin
 right
 there
 at
 114.


SMCI
 4910.
 If
 you
 bought
 the
 dip
 at


4750,
 not
 too
 bad
 for
 SMCI.
 Nphase
 is


up.
 Microsoft
 is
 up.
 PaloAlto
 is
 up.


Nebia
 should
 be
 higher.
 Nebius
 is
 indeed


higher.
 94
 to
 120
 on
 Nebus.
 Uh
 Irene,
 I


imagine,
 is
 pushing
 65.
 I
 ren
 6675.


Where
 is
 spy?
 Oh,
 we
 didn't
 even
 check


spy.
 Where's
 spy?
 Where's
 spy?
 Oh
 my


goodness.
 680.
 Holy
 guacamole.


680.


I
 mean,
 I
 think
 we
 all
 had
 a
 feeling
 it


would
 open
 close
 to
 that
 there.
 It


closed
 at
 what?
 678
 on
 Friday.
 Boom.


SoFi
 30.
 SoFi.
 There
 it
 is.
 SoFi
 30.


SoFi
 297097.


You
 got
 SoFi
 30
 right
 there.
 Palanteer


187.
 Boom.
 Bought
 the
 dip
 at
 172
 on


Palanteer
 last
 week.
 Also
 bought
 the
 dip


at
 177
 on
 Nvidia.
 I
 mean,
 if
 you
 bought


the
 dip
 on
 pretty
 much
 everything,


you're
 probably
 doing
 well.
 How
 about


Dolingo?
 Dolingo
 up
 1.6%.


Uh
 TFC,
 that's
 up
 a
 little
 bit.
 I
 ran
 up


6.5.
 I
 think
 all
 the
 Bitcoin
 miners


should
 be
 moving
 heavy.


Look
 at
 that
 legend
 slowing
 down.
 That's


how
 you
 know
 a
 bunch
 of
 people
 are


checking.
 We're
 robbing
 it
 right
 now.


Um,


let's
 pull
 this
 up
 right
 here.
 SoFi


right
 there.
 29.97.
 There
 you
 go.
 Let's


go
 back
 to
 these
 Bitcoin
 miners.
 I
 Ren's


up.
 Cipher's
 up.
 Clean.
 Some
 of
 these


don't
 trade
 overnight,
 but
 some
 of
 them


do.
 Hive
 is
 up.
 Bit
 farms
 486.
 Marathon


3.6.
 Riot's
 up
 3.4.
 G
 is
 up
 4.2.
 Does


Oakllo
 trade
 overnight?
 I
 don't
 know.


Legends
 down
 for
 you
 guys,
 too,
 right?


Yeah,
 Oakllo
 is
 up
 another
 4%
 overnight.


So
 again,
 Oaklow
 was
 at
 150
 when
 it


started
 the
 decline
 last
 week
 from
 190.


Fell
 all
 the
 way
 to
 117.
 Now
 it's
 back


to
 140.
 Does
 it
 go
 back
 to
 190?
 I
 don't


know.
 But
 the
 fact
 that
 it
 had
 that
 kind


of
 shakeout
 and
 it
 wasn't
 just
 Oakland,


it
 was
 a
 lot
 of
 different
 companies.
 I


think
 that
 just
 set
 up
 the
 move
 for
 the


next
 leg
 higher.
 And
 whatever,
 you
 know,


company
 you
 wanted
 to
 buy
 the
 dip
 on
 is


the
 company
 that
 you
 got
 a
 choice
 to
 buy


the
 dip
 on.
 But
 pretty
 much
 everything


gave
 you
 an
 opportunity.
 Some
 of
 them


better
 than
 others.
 Rocket
 Lab,
 how's


that
 doing?
 Does
 that
 trade
 overnight?


Rocket
 Lab,
 that
 doesn't
 trade
 on
 Legend


overnight.
 It
 might
 trade
 on
 Weeble.


Nebas
 123.
 Rocket
 Lab
 on
 Weeble
 is
 at


65.96.
 No,
 never
 mind.
 That
 does
 trade


overnight.
 Okay,
 so
 that's
 green.
 Roblox


that's
 up
 1%.
 Uber,
 that's
 up
 1%.


Coinbase
 4%.
 That's
 a
 $15
 move.
 Hoodie


got
 to
 120
 last
 week.
 Anyone
 who
 bought


that
 dip
 on
 Hoodie,
 you
 got
 some
 green.


Uh,
 Nebius,
 again,
 that
 continues
 to
 go


green
 as
 well.
 Open
 Door.
 Where's
 Open


Door?
 I
 don't
 think
 they
 trade


overnight.


It's
 up
 a
 little
 bit.
 Did
 it
 close
 at


these
 levels?


Open
 Door.
 I
 don't know
 why
 that
 doesn't


trade
 overnight.
 That
 should
 trade


overnight.
 You
 know,
 it
 closed
 at
 802.


It's
 at
 8:30.
 Whenever
 it
 trades
 on


Legend,
 that's
 very
 low
 liquidity.
 It


should
 be
 on
 the
 mobile
 app
 for
 it
 to


have
 like
 a
 lot
 more
 buyers
 coming
 in.


But
 you
 do
 have
 some
 people
 putting
 up


uh
 orders
 and
 that's
 why
 the
 stock
 goes


higher.
 Coreweave
 135,
 that's
 up
 2.3.


Micro
 Strategy.
 What
 do
 we
 have
 there?


Wow.
 The
 NIKK.
 The
 Nikkay
 is
 moving.


MSTR,
 that's
 up
 3.7%.
 Nikk
 right
 now.
 Oh


my.


Yeah,
 NK25
 just
 crossed
 50,000.
 Goodness


gracious,
 bro.


Guys,
 this
 might
 be
 a
 meltup.
 This
 might


be
 a
 real
 serious
 meltup.
 Amcor,
 that


stock.
 Wow.
 3520.
 Shout
 out
 to
 Amcore.


Look
 at
 that.
 Look
 at
 that.
 Again,
 this


thing
 fell
 to
 28
 on
 uh
 on
 the
 Trump


tweet
 back
 on
 October
 10th.
 Nice
 move


for
 Amcore.
 There
 you
 go.
 Nvidia
 pushing


190
 18942.


ASST,
 this
 one's
 going
 to
 get
 a
 lot
 of


buzz.
 Uh
 154
 right
 here.
 Mike
 Alfred


took
 a
 position
 in
 this
 of
 a
 million


dollars
 and
 as
 a
 result
 of
 him
 taking


that
 position.
 I
 I
 don't
 know
 enough


about
 ASST
 to
 be honest.
 I
 It's
 like
 a


Bitcoin
 treasury
 and
 there's
 maybe
 some


other
 components
 to
 it.
 Um,
 but
 yeah,
 I


mean,
 he
 bought
 it
 at
 95
 cents.
 It's
 at


a$154.
 I
 mean,
 he
 has
 a
 pretty
 big


retail
 audience,
 so
 you
 might
 get
 a
 lot


of
 people
 that
 pile
 into
 this
 one.
 154


in
 the
 overnight
 markets
 for
 ASST.
 S&P


still
 at
 681
 and
 then
 AMD
 260.


AMD


is
 at
 260.
 Becker
 says,
 "Agreed.
 This


feels
 like
 the
 start
 of
 another
 meltup."


Yeah,
 and
 maybe
 it's
 a
 healthier
 start


to
 another
 meltup
 because
 we
 already
 had


a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 draw
 down
 across
 the


entire
 market,
 right?
 It's
 it's
 not
 like


we're
 going
 from
 673
 to
 680.
 We
 went


from
 673
 to
 647
 and
 some
 names
 got
 hit


worse
 than
 others,
 but
 pretty
 much


everything
 took
 at least
 like
 minimum
 5%


hit.
 A
 lot
 of
 things
 took
 way
 worse
 than


5%
 of
 a
 hit.
 The
 market
 took
 a
 3%
 hit


and
 now
 it
 feels
 like
 a
 more
 healthier


way
 to
 get
 to
 these
 levels.
 It
 really


does,


which
 is
 which
 is
 nice
 to
 see.
 BMR
 right


there,
 5321.
 How
 about
 Chinese
 stocks?


BABA,
 that's
 up
 2.9.
 That
 should
 be
 up.


JD,
 I
 know
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 are
 in
 JD.


That's
 up
 2.74.
 K
 Webb
 in
 general,
 the


Chinese
 internet
 tech
 ETF.
 Wow,
 that's


up
 2%.
 It's
 a
 big
 move
 for
 KB
 and
 that


continues
 to
 go
 green.
 Yes,
 Amcor
 does


have
 earnings
 tomorrow.
 So,
 that's
 going


to
 be
 something
 that
 we
 look
 for
 or
 at


least
 for
 anyone
 who
 cares
 about
 that


stock.
 Um,
 but
 you
 know,
 this
 is
 a
 good


backdrop
 to
 have
 a
 stronger
 earnings.


ESTs,
 that's
 up
 1.42%.
 Hims
 trying
 to


get
 back
 into
 the
 50s.
 How
 about
 Oscar?


Oscar
 is
 up
 2.64
 64
 by
 due
 is
 up
 3.21.


Let's
 check
 on
 quantum.io
 and NQ
 that's


up
 4
 and
 a
 half%.
 Uber
 is
 up
 1%.
 Micro


strategies
 up
 4%.
 I
 mean
 I
 don't
 see


anything
 that's
 red.
 Does
 anyone
 see


anything
 that's
 red?
 Like
 actually
 red
 I


think
 everything.
 Oh,
 Beyond
 Meat.
 Does


that
 trade
 overnight?
 Beyond
 Meat,
 I


don't
 think
 it
 trades
 overnight,
 but


it's
 down
 3.89%.
 I
 mean,
 Beyond
 Meat


took
 a
 pretty
 nasty
 dip
 from
 850
 down
 to


two
 bucks.
 I
 saw
 a
 lot
 of
 Twitter
 screen


posts
 of
 people
 that
 have
 like
 500,000


shares,
 800,000
 shares.
 I
 mean,
 there
 is


definitely
 an
 army
 that
 is
 forming
 for


Beyond
 Meat.
 Uh
 I
 I
 don't
 know
 how
 many


people
 are
 in
 that
 army,
 but
 there
 are


people
 that
 have
 loaded
 up
 and
 they


really
 do
 think
 it's
 coming
 back
 and


they
 think,
 you
 know,
 this
 is
 GameStop


2.0.
 And
 the
 reason
 for
 that,
 by
 the


way,
 is
 not
 just
 because
 of
 whatever
 uh


fundamental
 thesis
 they
 have
 on
 Beyond


Meat,
 but
 it's
 that
 the
 short
 float
 on


Beyond
 Meat
 is
 161%.


And
 because
 of
 that
 short
 flow
 being


literally,
 you
 know,
 the
 shorts
 are


borrowing
 shares
 that
 don't
 exist.
 This


is
 exactly
 what
 happened
 with
 GameStop.


That's
 why
 you
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 people


thinking
 beyond
 me
 can
 get
 squeezed.
 The


rare
 earth
 stocks
 are
 red.
 That
 is
 fair.


US
 AR,
 my
 goodness,
 down
 13%.


MP's
 down
 5%.
 Okay,
 I
 guess.
 Oh,
 well


obviously
 I
 mean
 if
 you
 have
 a
 trade


deal
 with
 China
 for
 rare
 earth
 metals


and
 minerals,
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 domestic


manufacturers
 and
 miners
 for
 those


stocks,
 they're
 not
 going to
 have
 that


much
 demand,
 right?
 Or
 at least
 the


perception
 is
 their
 demand
 is
 going
 to


go
 down
 a
 little
 bit.
 So
 that's
 fair.


Gold
 is
 also
 down
 1.32.


Gold
 is
 also
 down
 1.32.
 Silver's
 down


1.29.
 I
 mean,
 if
 we
 have
 a
 meltup
 in


assets,
 we
 might
 have
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a


meltdown.
 And
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 really
 say


meltdown,
 but
 like
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a


stalling
 potentially.
 I
 don't
 think


these
 things
 actually
 sell
 off
 to
 to
 the


point
 where
 you
 could
 call
 it
 a
 meltdown


in
 commodities
 because
 risk
 on
 might
 not


mean
 gold
 and
 silver.
 I
 mean,


objectively,
 risk
 on
 has
 always
 meant


something
 besides
 gold
 for
 Google
 right


there.
 262.
 Maybe
 that's
 when
 we
 see


that
 play
 out.


Maybe
 when
 we
 see
 that
 play
 out.
 Sofax,


uh,
 that
 is
 up
 6%
 right
 here.
 I
 actually


had
 dinner
 with
 Adam
 the
 other
 day.
 Uh


Adam
 had
 a
 pretty
 big
 position
 on
 Sofax


and
 uh
 in
 terms
 of
 selling
 puts,
 not


actually
 buying
 the
 stock.
 So Sofi
 fell


to
 25,
 he
 just
 felt
 that
 it
 was
 stupid


and
 so
 he
 used
 the
 2x
 lever
 version
 of


it
 to
 sell
 puts
 and
 um
 yeah,
 so
 I
 mean


you
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 that
 took


advantage
 either
 through
 the
 leverage


ETFs,
 through
 buying
 options,
 buying


shares
 and
 on
 Tuesday
 we're
 going
 to


hopefully
 get
 a
 report


that
 is
 pretty
 bullish
 for
 SoFi.
 Bitcoin


11477
 trying
 to
 get
 back
 to
 115.


Reddit's
 pumping
 up.
 I'm
 a
 decent
 chunk


of
 momentum
 across
 the
 market.


Is
 AMD
 price
 justified?
 I
 think
 AMD
 is


going to
 have
 to
 put
 up
 an
 earnings
 that


continues
 to
 justify
 the
 rerating,
 but


overall,
 I
 mean,
 yeah,
 that
 OpenAI
 deal


is
 $80
 billion
 of
 revenue
 over
 the
 next


five
 years.
 And
 again,
 next
 quarter,


you're
 not
 going to
 see
 that
 revenue.


You're
 probably
 not
 going
 to
 see
 it


until
 closer
 to
 the
 second
 half
 of
 2026.


But
 if
 they
 can
 just
 give
 a
 good
 guide


that,
 hey,
 like
 this
 revenue
 is
 baked


in,
 you
 can
 definitely
 expect
 it.
 It's


going to
 happen.
 And
 they
 can
 increase


that
 fiscal
 year
 2026
 target
 and
 not


grow
 14%.
 I
 think
 the
 street's
 going
 to


be
 really
 happy
 about
 it.
 I
 mean
 AMD
 is


now
 a
 $400
 billion
 company,
 folks.
 418


billion.
 This
 was
 one
 of
 the
 most
 hated


semiconductor
 stocks.
 Retail
 really
 did


believe
 in
 it.
 Cory
 right
 there
 135.88.


So
 I
 mean,
 look,
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 these


names
 run
 like
 crazy
 and
 they're
 going


to
 need
 a
 phenomenal
 earnings
 to
 justify


their
 multiple
 expansion.
 Yes,
 but
 that


should
 be
 the
 burden.
 The
 burden
 should


be
 for
 Hood
 and
 Palanteer
 and
 Nvidia
 and


AMD
 to
 prove
 and
 SoFi
 that
 they
 deserve


a
 multiple.
 And
 I
 have
 some
 confidence


that
 some
 of
 these
 companies
 will
 be


able
 to
 do
 it.
 Look
 at
 Amazon
 pushing


227.


If
 anyone
 bought
 the
 dip
 at
 214,
 215,


that
 was
 hopefully
 a
 nice
 time
 to
 get


rewarded
 uh
 if
 Amazon
 doesn't
 revisit


those
 lows.
 And
 then
 Circle,
 look
 at


that,
 4%.
 Circle
 was
 up
 9%
 on
 Friday.


Stable
 coin
 company
 Tether
 just
 raised


at
 500
 billion.
 So,
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 are


wondering
 what
 the
 valuation
 for
 a


company
 like
 Circle
 should
 be
 given
 it's


in
 the
 same
 niche
 of
 stable
 coins.
 One


of,
 you
 know,
 the
 only
 publicly
 traded


companies
 you
 can
 get
 exposure
 to
 for


stable
 coins.
 That's
 up
 another
 4%
 as


well.
 The
 Q's
 all-time
 highs
 on
 the


NASDAQ.
 There
 you
 go.
 622.


622.


What
 did
 you
 guys
 say
 in
 the
 chat?
 85%


say
 higher,
 16%
 say
 sell
 the
 news.
 Okay.


So,
 the
 majority
 of
 people
 here,


majority
 of
 people
 here
 think
 we
 are


going
 higher.
 I
 mean,
 look,
 I
 I'm


looking
 for
 the
 bare
 case.
 I
 don't
 know


if
 there's
 an
 easy
 bare
 case,
 and


realistically,
 there
 hasn't
 been
 a
 bare


case
 for
 the
 past
 five
 months,
 ever


since
 the
 tariff
 stuff.
 There
 are


bearish
 things
 to
 be
 concerned
 about
 and


to
 not
 worry
 about.
 And
 I
 think
 the


biggest
 bearish
 case
 was
 just
 like
 there


was
 a
 lot
 of
 stocks
 running
 for
 like


probably
 not
 the
 most
 fundamental


reason,
 but
 all
 those
 took
 a
 draw
 down.


And
 they
 all
 are
 probably
 not
 going
 to


zero.
 Like
 they
 don't
 need
 to
 go
 to


zero,
 and
 they
 have
 enough
 potential
 to


justify
 why
 people
 would
 be
 excited
 to


buy
 the
 dip
 on
 them.
 It's
 just
 they're


also
 not
 going
 to
 the
 moon
 while
 the


market
 was
 being
 flat,
 which
 was


happening
 a
 month
 ago.
 And
 that
 as
 all
 I


think
 pretty
 much
 all
 of
 it
 has
 been


flushed
 out.
 There's
 probably
 still
 some


pockets
 of
 it
 that
 feel
 toppy.
 But
 it's


it's
 not
 as
 crazy
 as
 it
 was
 SoFi
 back


above
 30
 when
 the
 meme
 stock
 ETF
 came


out.
 When
 that
 ETF
 came
 out,
 I
 mean,
 a


lot
 of
 people
 I
 remember
 the
 sentiment


that
 they
 just
 felt
 like
 this
 was


getting
 a
 bit
 ridiculous.
 I
 think
 a
 lot


of
 that
 a
 lot
 of
 that
 has
 been
 flushed


out
 and
 and
 given
 a
 lot
 of
 that
 flush


out
 has
 happened
 and
 the
 market's
 been


able
 to
 make
 a
 higher
 move
 and
 those


stocks
 are
 now
 able
 to
 go
 higher
 in
 a


more
 healthy
 way.
 I
 don't
 know
 what
 what


has
 to
 be
 the
 what
 the
 Fed's
 going
 to


hike.
 The
 Fed's
 not
 hiking.
 That's
 not


happening.
 So,
 is
 Google
 going
 to
 mess


up
 earnings?
 I
 mean,
 if
 Google,
 Meta,


Microsoft,
 Amazon
 don't
 mess
 up


earnings.
 I
 don't
 even
 think
 Apple
 look


at
 Broadcom
 right.
 They're
 up
 almost
 2%.


I
 don't
 even
 think
 Apple's
 going
 to
 mess


up
 earnings
 because
 Apple
 iPhone
 17


demand
 has
 been
 incredible.
 Apple


basically
 at
 all
 time
 highs
 right
 here


at
 265.


I
 think
 we
 got
 a
 good
 shot.
 I
 think
 we


got
 a
 good
 and
 then
 if
 we
 got
 the
 China


deal
 and
 the
 Nvidia
 deal
 and
 all
 this


other
 stuff
 or
 not
 the
 Nvidia
 deal,
 the


the
 the
 well
 technically
 the
 Nvidia
 deal


of
 Nvidia
 being
 able
 to
 sell
 chips
 to


China,
 but
 the
 India
 deal
 which
 Trump


said
 over
 the
 weekend
 they're
 closer
 to


potentially
 getting
 into
 a
 conversation


with
 that.
 I
 mean
 you
 just
 have
 a
 lot
 of


stuff
 that
 can
 be
 baked.
 Also,
 we're


near
 the
 end
 of
 the
 year.
 end
 of
 the


year,
 markets
 are
 up
 on
 average
 4.7%.


And
 by
 the
 way,
 the
 reason
 the
 market


tends
 to
 be
 good
 towards
 the
 end
 of the


year
 is
 because
 September
 and
 August


tend
 to
 suck.
 So
 the
 market
 kind
 of


rallies
 towards
 the
 end
 of
 the
 year.


September
 and
 August
 were
 really
 good.


Guess
 what
 sucked?
 October
 to
 an
 extent,


right?
 Now
 that
 we're
 recovering,
 but
 uh


given
 October
 had
 that
 draw
 down
 that
 we


were
 all
 anticipating
 where
 it
 was
 going


to
 happen
 September,
 August,
 now
 that


that's
 happened,
 you
 know,
 if
 the
 market


needed
 some
 level
 of
 volatility,
 we
 got


it
 over
 the
 past
 couple
 weeks.
 And
 maybe


maybe
 that
 allows
 us
 to
 make
 that
 next


leg
 up.
 I
 think
 earnings
 are going
 to


hopefully
 justify
 that
 going
 into
 the


end
 of
 the
 uh
 the
 end
 of
 the
 year.
 Yeah,


maybe
 Santa
 Claus
 is
 coming
 to
 town.


Maybe
 Santa
 Claus
 is
 coming
 to
 town.
 And


70%
 of
 fund
 managers
 are


underperforming.
 That
 is
 correct.


That
 is
 also
 correct.


All
 right,
 cool.
 So,
 um
 let's
 talk
 about


some
 headlines.
 Let's
 get
 into
 it.
 Let's


talk
 about
 what
 we've
 got
 going
 on.


October
 may
 be
 fully
 intact.
 Uh,


tomorrow
 is
 my
 birthday,
 so
 it
 would
 be


very
 nice
 to
 have
 a
 official
 all-time


high
 across
 the
 board.
 I
 mean,
 dude,
 if


Ballinger
 could
 give
 me
 alltime
 highs
 on


my
 birthday,
 that
 would
 be
 pretty
 nice.


But
 it
 looks
 like
 unless
 anything


changes.
 Look
 at
 SoFi
 316.
 Unless


anything
 changes,


maybe
 we
 stay
 with
 this
 alltime
 high


going
 into
 Monday.


I
 just
 looked
 at
 my
 portfolio,
 dude.


This
 is
 what
 I'm
 saying.
 This
 is
 why
 you


just
 buy
 the
 dip
 and
 you
 shut
 the
 hell


up
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 buying
 the
 dip.


I'm
 up
 144.
 Last
 week,
 I
 think
 at
 the


worst
 of
 it,
 it
 was
 down
 170
 and
 then
 by


the
 market
 close,
 it
 was
 down
 like
 118.


So,
 we
 recovered
 like
 a
 little
 bit
 of


that
 draw
 down
 and
 now
 it's
 just
 all


back.
 I
 mean,
 this
 is
 why
 this
 is
 why


sometimes
 you
 just
 got
 to
 buy,


especially
 if
 it's
 companies
 that
 you


know,
 you
 know,
 there's
 opportunities
 in


Vine
 and
 you
 just
 keep
 going.


I
 would
 imagine
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 are


seeing
 that
 happen
 to
 their
 portfolios


right
 now.
 We
 just
 got
 to
 see
 Trump


doing
 the
 deal
 for
 a
 minute.
 100%.
 Trump


doing
 the
 deal
 for
 me.
 And
 now
 we
 just


got
 to
 see
 if
 this
 continues.
 All right,


let's
 get
 into
 it.
 Let's
 get
 into
 it
 and


let's
 talk
 about
 what's
 going
 on.
 We'll


keep
 an
 eye
 on
 the
 overnight
 markets.
 If


there's
 any
 crazy
 price
 action,
 let
 me


know.
 But
 overall,
 UNH,
 look
 at
 that,
 up


1%.
 You're
 already
 seeing
 a
 decent


decent
 chunk
 of
 uh
 of
 excitement
 across


the
 board.


which
 is
 not
 too
 bad.
 Quarantine
 quartet


said,
 "Dude,
 I
 lost
 like
 70,000
 like
 20


times
 this
 month."
 Yeah,
 I
 mean
 the


volatility
 of
 October
 has
 been
 gigantic.


And
 I
 mean
 I
 we
 all
 knew
 October
 was
 one


of
 the
 most
 volatile
 months
 of
 the
 year.


I
 don't
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 us
 expected
 it


just
 because
 of
 how
 good
 September


October
 were.
 September
 and
 August
 were


and
 you
 know
 it's
 a
 little
 bit
 of


recency
 bias
 and
 not
 knowing
 how
 to


expect
 a
 downturn.
 But
 it
 looks
 like
 uh


it
 looks
 like
 as
 we've
 dealt
 with
 it,
 we


have
 some
 fundamental
 catalyst
 to
 get


this
 moving.


And
 that's
 what
 we
 got.
 All right,
 so


let's
 keep
 going
 and
 let's
 talk
 about


what
 happened.
 Let's
 start
 off
 with
 uh


let's
 start
 off
 with
 with
 China.
 Let's


start
 off
 with
 China.
 Thank
 you
 to


everyone
 saying
 happy
 birthday
 from


across
 the
 pond
 because
 it
 is
 October


27th.
 What
 time
 is
 it
 in
 the
 UK?
 Time
 in


the
 UK.
 Oh,
 it's
 12
 a.m.
 in
 the
 UK.


Okay,
 cool.
 So,
 we
 turned
 28
 in
 the
 uh


in
 the
 United
 Kingdom.
 deeply
 deeply


appreciate
 you
 guys.
 Again,
 tomorrow
 on


the
 close,
 we'll
 do
 a
 fun
 like
 birthday


stream
 after
 the
 market
 close.


Hopefully,
 we
 get
 an
 alltime
 high
 on
 the


close
 and
 uh
 we're
 going to
 go
 through


some
 pictures
 from
 like
 me
 when
 I
 was
 a


kid,
 when
 I
 was
 in
 high
 school,
 all
 that


stuff.
 So,
 we
 have
 some
 fun
 pictures


that
 I'll
 show
 everybody
 to
 kind
 of


celebrate
 uh
 turning
 a
 year
 older,
 but


we'll
 do
 that
 on
 close
 tomorrow.
 All


right,
 so
 China,
 let's
 get
 into
 it.
 What


happened
 in
 China?
 It
 looks
 like
 we
 have


a
 deal,
 and
 it
 looks
 like
 that
 deal


might
 manifest
 itself
 in
 a
 pretty


exciting
 way.
 So,
 I
 played
 the
 first


clip
 of
 Bent
 talking
 about
 what's
 going


on
 with
 China.
 Here's
 a
 couple
 more


clips
 that
 are
 pretty
 important
 to
 take


a
 look
 at
 and
 um
 this
 is
 ultimately
 what


what
 he
 said.
 Well,
 first
 let's
 start


off
 with
 Trump
 who
 is
 in
 Malaysia


meeting
 with
 a
 bunch
 of
 different
 heads


of
 state
 and
 then
 we'll
 get
 into
 some
 of


the
 descent
 comments.


>> We're
 going
 to
 do
 well
 with
 China.


>> Let
 me
 share
 this
 real
 quick.


Okay,
 here
 we
 go.


>> I
 think
 we're
 gonna
 have
 a
 deal
 with


China.
 We


meet
 as
 you
 know
 in
 South
 Korea


with
 President
 Xi.
 I
 think
 we're
 going


to
 have
 a
 a
 good
 deal
 with
 China
 and


they
 want
 to
 make
 a
 deal
 and
 we
 want
 to


make
 a
 deal.
 We've
 agreed
 to
 meet.
 We're


going
 to
 meet
 then
 later
 in
 China
 and


we're
 going
 to
 meet
 in
 uh
 in
 the
 US
 in


either
 Washington
 or
 or
 at
 Mara
 Lago


Palm
 Beach.
 So
 uh
 you
 know
 I
 think
 uh


you
 know
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 talks
 when
 we


meet
 we've
 done
 a
 lot
 of
 discussions


before
 we
 meet
 we've
 done
 discussions


with
 Brazil.
 So
 I
 think
 we're
 going
 to


end
 up
 having
 a
 good
 deal
 for
 both


countries.
 I
 think
 with
 China
 that's


going
 to
 happen
 and
 we
 have
 other
 deal


you
 know
 we
 have
 Japan
 we
 have
 South


Korea
 we
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 lot
 of
 meetings


but
 people
 seem
 to
 be
 very
 interested
 in


China.
 I
 think
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 a
 a


very
 fair
 meeting
 with
 China.
 You
 know


we're
 going
 to
 do
 what


>> Okay.
 So
 you
 got
 Trump
 saying,
 "I
 think


we're
 going
 to
 have
 a
 very
 fair
 meeting


with
 China,
 which
 is
 important
 for
 Trump


to
 say
 because
 it
 means
 that
 he's
 more


likely
 to
 negotiate
 that
 we
 will
 indeed


get
 a
 deal."
 And
 then
 this
 is
 what
 Bent


had
 to
 say
 about
 the
 meetings
 that
 he


had,
 which
 is
 the
 reason
 Trump
 is
 even


confident
 about
 getting
 a
 deal
 done
 with


China
 because
 Bent
 seemed
 to
 have
 some


good
 negotiations
 over
 the
 weekend.


>> Framework
 that
 will
 avoid
 that
 and
 allow


us
 to
 discuss
 many
 other
 things
 with
 the


Chinese.
 I
 think
 we
 will
 be
 able
 to


discuss
 uh
 them
 helping
 us
 get
 this


terrible
 fentanyl
 crisis
 under
 control.


I
 think
 we
 are
 going
 to
 be
 able
 to


discuss
 substantial
 uh
 soybean
 and
 egg


purchases
 for
 our
 American
 farmers.
 I


think
 we
 are
 going
 to
 be
 able
 to
 discuss


more
 balanced
 trade
 and
 and
 I'm
 not


going
 to
 get
 ahead
 of
 the
 two
 leaders,


but
 I
 think
 that
 they
 will
 also
 be


discussing
 President
 Trump's
 uh
 global


peace
 plan
 that
 he's
 been
 so
 success


successful
 at
 both
 here
 in
 Asia,
 the


Middle
 East,
 and
 now
 he's
 looking
 to


Ukraine,
 Russia.


>> Mr.
 Secretary,
 you
 said
 a
 couple
 of


significant
 things.
 It
 sounds
 like


you're
 saying
 you
 are
 not
 anticipating
 a


100%
 tariff
 against
 China
 on
 November


1st
 and
 seems
 like
 you're
 saying
 that


China
 is
 poised
 to
 purchase
 soybeans
 to


open
 up
 those
 markets
 again.


I
 I
 I
 believe
 that
 we
 have
 the
 framework


for
 the
 two
 leaders
 to
 have
 a
 very


productive
 meeting
 uh
 for
 both
 sides
 and


I
 think
 it
 will
 be
 fantastic
 uh
 for
 US


citizens,
 for
 US
 farmers
 and
 for
 our


country
 in
 general.


>> Okay.
 But
 you're
 not
 anticipating
 the


100%
 tariffs?


>> Uh
 no,
 I'm
 not.
 And
 I'm
 also


anticipating
 that
 we
 will
 get
 some
 kind


of
 a
 deferral
 on
 on
 the
 rare
 earth
 uh


export
 controls
 that
 the
 Chinese
 had


discussed.
 Okay.
 But
 again,
 this
 will


all
 be
 you
 know
 we
 the
 the
 my


counterpart
 the
 vice
 premier
 and
 I
 have


set
 the
 framework
 and
 it
 will
 be
 up
 to


the
 two
 leaders
 uh
 to
 discuss
 the
 the


final
 terms.


>> Okay.
 Okay.
 Well,


>> so
 Bent
 right
 there
 is
 not
 promising


that
 a
 deal
 is
 officially
 done.
 He
 is


saying
 though
 he
 has
 a
 lot
 of
 confidence


that
 there's
 not
 going
 to
 be
 uh
 100%


tariffs,
 which
 is
 something
 that
 the


market
 really
 cared
 about,
 right?


Because
 that's
 why
 we
 had
 that
 draw
 down


in
 the
 first
 place.
 And
 he's
 also
 saying


the
 rare
 earth
 export
 controls,
 which


kind
 of
 caused
 all
 this
 controversy
 in


the
 first
 place,
 likely
 are
 not
 going
 to


be
 as
 bad
 as
 what
 he
 said
 before,
 which


again
 is
 why
 the
 rare
 earth
 stocks
 are


getting
 hit
 right
 here
 because
 if


there's
 a
 ton
 of
 Chinese
 rare
 earths


coming
 in,
 then
 you
 don't
 need
 as
 much


demand
 for
 some
 of the
 other
 names.
 Uh,


but
 it
 also
 means
 that
 US
 manufacturing


and
 supply
 chains
 might
 not
 be
 in
 that


much
 trouble,
 which
 was
 the
 reason
 why


the
 S&P
 took
 that
 hit
 on
 October
 10th.


S&P
 right
 there,
 very
 close
 to
 682.
 We


touched
 it
 for
 a
 little
 bit.
 Right
 now,


it's
 68194.


Uh,
 and
 as
 a
 result,
 it's
 bullish.
 I


mean,
 it's
 hard
 to
 say
 that
 it's


completely
 bearish.
 So,
 I'm
 going
 to
 put


a
 poll
 right
 here
 in
 the
 chat
 and
 ask


here,
 do
 we
 finally
 get
 a
 China
 deal


done?
 Let's
 call
 it
 by
 end
 of
 year.


Remember
 back
 in
 July
 Trump
 tweeted
 or


June
 that
 they
 had
 a
 deal
 done
 with


China
 and
 he
 was
 talking
 about
 how


they're
 going
 to
 let
 Chinese
 immigrants


go
 to
 Harvard
 and
 stuff
 like
 it
 didn't


really
 feel
 like
 a
 deal.
 It
 was
 just


something
 they
 said.
 I
 think
 there
 is
 a


question
 on
 hey
 will
 this
 actually


result
 in
 something
 meaningful.
 But
 if


it
 does
 I
 think
 we're
 going
 higher.
 And


if
 we
 are
 going
 higher
 based
 on
 that


then
 that
 is
 not
 going
 to
 be
 the
 worst


thing
 in
 the
 world.
 Here's
 another
 part


of
 Bent's
 interview
 where
 he
 talked


about
 uh
 the
 pain
 that
 he
 understands


the
 farmers
 feel
 like
 because
 he's
 also


a
 soybean
 farmer.


>> I
 I
 did
 mean
 the
 second
 term.
 I
 know


they
 have
 met
 before.
 The
 president
 has


also
 said
 he
 does
 want
 our
 farmers
 to
 be


taken
 care
 of.
 You
 did
 mention
 that


China
 has
 been
 boycotting
 American


soybeans
 and
 American
 farmers
 have


really
 suffered.
 Do
 you
 see
 a
 real
 light


at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 tunnel
 there?
 they


make
 allow
 soybeans
 again.


>> Uh
 well
 Martha,
 in
 case
 you
 don't
 know


it,
 I'm
 actually
 a
 soybean
 farmer.
 So
 uh


I
 have
 I
 have
 felt
 this
 pain
 too.
 And


there
 are
 a
 couple
 of
 things
 happening


here.
 One,
 uh
 the
 Chinese
 have


substantially
 dropped
 their
 purchases
 to


almost
 zero.
 So
 they
 unfortunately
 have


been
 using
 American
 farmers
 who
 are


amongst
 President
 Trump's
 biggest


supporters.
 I
 think
 he
 had
 more
 than
 90%


support
 and
 then
 this
 was
 one
 of
 the


biggest
 crops
 in
 20
 or
 30
 years.
 So
 it


was
 a
 perfect
 storm.
 But
 I
 think
 we
 have


addressed
 the
 farmer's
 concerns.
 And
 I'm


not
 going
 to
 get
 ahead
 of
 the
 president,


but
 I
 I
 believe
 when
 the
 announcement
 of


the
 deal
 with
 China
 I
 is
 made
 public


that
 our
 soybean
 farmers
 will
 feel
 very


good
 about
 what's
 going
 on
 both
 for
 this


season
 and
 the
 coming
 seasons
 for


several.


>> Okay.
 So,
 I
 don't
 know
 why
 Bass
 said


he's
 a
 soybean
 farmer
 cuz
 I
 don't
 think


the
 guy
 has
 ever
 farmed
 a
 day
 in
 his


life.
 I
 don't
 know if
 that
 was
 meant
 to


be
 a
 joke.
 If
 it
 was,
 it
 didn't
 really


hit.
 But
 nonetheless,
 the
 the
 the


takeaway
 from
 that
 clip
 is
 that
 he


thinks
 there
 will
 be
 a
 conclusion
 to
 get


the
 Chinese
 to
 buy
 our
 soybeans.
 I
 mean,


I
 would
 imagine
 Trump's
 going
 to
 be


using
 Nvidia
 chips
 as
 leverage
 or,
 you


know,
 any
 level
 of
 uh
 cooperation
 with


with
 continuing
 to
 be,
 you
 know,
 the


largest
 consumer
 of
 Chinese
 goods
 to
 get


them
 to
 just
 buy
 more
 soybeans,


including
 us
 buying
 their
 cooking
 oil,


which
 was
 one
 of
 the
 things
 that
 Trump


threatened
 as
 well.
 And
 so,
 we're
 going


to
 have
 to
 see.
 He
 owns
 farmland.
 Yeah,


there
 you
 go.
 Maybe
 he
 owns
 a
 lot
 of


farmland,
 but
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 he's


necessarily
 a
 farmer.
 Now,
 here's


another
 clip
 over
 the
 weekend.
 I
 mean,


take
 a
 look
 at
 Trump
 dancing
 in


Malaysia.


I
 mean,
 he
 was
 greeted
 in
 a
 very
 nice


way
 by
 the
 Malaysian
 people
 as
 he
 ended


up
 having
 talks
 with
 a
 lot
 of
 their


leaders
 uh
 in
 the
 region
 in
 Southeast


Asia.
 And


you
 got
 Trump
 dancing
 here.
 I
 mean
 like


and
 the
 takeaway
 from
 him
 dancing
 is
 I


think
 there's
 a
 bit
 more
 peace
 that
 is


happening
 in
 other
 parts
 of
 the
 world


which
 are
 really
 important
 because
 we


kind
 of
 need
 that
 piece
 in
 order
 to


continue
 this
 bull
 market.
 It's
 positive


energy.
 You
 need
 a
 lot
 of
 that
 positive


energy
 and
 if
 you
 know
 if
 we
 weren't


having
 that
 stuff
 happen
 I
 think
 it


would
 obviously
 be
 a
 bit
 net
 worse.
 And


so
 as
 a
 result
 I
 think
 we're
 having
 some


momentum
 there.
 You
 know
 we
 have
 those


Brazilian
 tariffs
 not
 necessarily
 the


best
 in
 the
 world.
 Here's
 what
 Trump
 has


had
 to
 say
 after
 meeting
 with
 the


Brazilian
 president
 over
 the
 weekend
 as


well.


>> Well,
 first
 of
 all,
 let
 me
 just
 say
 it's


a
 great
 honor
 to
 be
 with
 the
 president


of
 Brazil.
 It's
 a
 great
 country.
 It's
 a


big,
 beautiful
 country
 and
 I
 think


they're
 doing
 well.
 I
 think
 they're


doing
 very
 well
 from
 what
 I
 understand.


And
 uh
 I
 think
 we
 should
 be
 able
 to
 make


some
 pretty
 good
 deals
 for
 both


countries.
 And
 I'm
 going
 to
 leave
 that
 a


little
 bit
 to
 Jameson
 and
 Scott
 and


Marco
 and
 different
 ways.
 Marco
 less
 on


the
 economic
 side.
 You
 could
 you
 could


do
 it
 very
 well,
 but
 I
 don't
 think


you'll
 have
 to.
 But
 I
 think
 we'll
 have


uh
 I
 think
 we'll
 be
 able
 to
 do
 some


pretty
 good
 deals.
 We've
 been
 speaking


>> now.
 Again,
 that's
 really
 important


because
 Trump
 just
 threatened
 50%


tariffs
 on
 Brazil.
 So,
 when
 he's
 saying,


"I
 think
 we'll
 be
 able
 to
 make
 some


deals
 with
 Brazil,"
 that's
 the
 market


kind
 of
 saying,
 "Okay,
 so
 you're
 not


going
 to
 probably
 have
 this
 crazy
 Canada


tariff.
 You're
 not
 going
 to
 have
 this


crazy
 China
 tariff.
 you
 get
 rid
 of
 the


Brazil
 tariffs
 or
 get
 to
 a
 deal,
 then
 if


we
 can
 get
 more
 and
 more
 and
 more
 deals,


you
 know,
 the
 market
 shouldn't
 be
 that


upset.
 Here's
 Trump
 talking
 about
 the


completion
 of
 a
 ton
 of
 other
 trade
 deals


with
 Indopacific
 partners
 over
 the


weekend
 as
 well.


>> Ties
 of
 commerce
 to
 strengthen
 our


common
 security
 and
 to
 really
 promote


strongly
 stability,
 prosperity,
 and


peace
 for
 all
 of
 the
 countries
 in
 this


room
 and
 long
 beyond
 this
 room.
 That's


why
 I'm
 delighted
 that
 in
 addition
 to


the
 agreement
 with
 Malaysia
 this
 week,


we're
 also
 signing
 or
 nearing
 completion


on
 trade
 deals
 with
 many
 other


Indo-Pacific
 partners
 from
 Cambodia
 to


Japan
 to
 South
 Korea.
 We're
 delighted
 to


forge
 richer
 partnerships
 on
 energy,


technology,
 artificial
 intelligence,


critical
 minerals,
 and
 other
 industries.


The
 United
 States
 is
 having
 its
 golden


age
 last.


>> So,
 you
 kind
 of
 get
 the
 point.
 The
 point


is
 a
 lot
 of
 deals
 are
 being
 signed
 and


hopefully
 these
 deals
 manifest
 in
 like


actual
 frameworks
 that
 are
 tangible.
 But


as
 a
 market
 participant,
 whether
 you


hate
 the
 deals,
 love
 the
 deals,
 you


think
 Trump's
 a
 great
 dealmaker,
 you


think
 he's
 a
 horrible
 dealmaker,
 the


market,
 as
 we
 can
 see
 right
 now,
 is


reacting
 in
 a
 positive
 way
 to
 these


deals.
 And
 if
 this
 deal
 flow
 doesn't


necessarily
 stop
 and
 you
 actually
 get


some
 legitimacy
 behind
 the
 deals,
 like


some
 real
 details
 on
 how
 the
 deals
 will


be
 executed,
 I
 think
 we
 might
 get
 some


great.
 I
 think
 we
 might
 end
 up
 getting


some
 green.
 So
 it's
 not
 wearing
 the


Knicks
 hat
 because
 they're
 losing
 to
 the


Heat
 right
 now.
 Exactly.
 That's
 why.


Dude,
 Curry
 over
 the
 weekend.
 This
 guy


is
 crazy,
 bro.
 It
 both
 of
 those
 threes


overtime.
 Absolutely
 incredible.
 So


right
 there,
 that's
 at
 30.
 There
 you
 go.


309.
 IN
 are
 we
 at
 67?
 We
 are
 at
 6680
 on


IEN.
 Continuing
 to
 get
 some
 of
 that


momentum.
 AMD
 at
 260.
 It
 was
 at
 263
 for


a
 second.
 Nebas
 right
 there.
 Look
 at


that.
 123.
 This
 thing
 fell
 all
 the
 way


to
 94.
 Nvidia
 trying
 to
 push
 190
 again.


I
 mean,
 again,
 it's
 hard
 as
 a
 market


participant
 to
 look
 at
 what's
 happening


and
 think,
 "Oh
 my
 goodness,
 I
 should
 be


scared
 of
 everything
 that's
 taking
 place


because
 again,
 we
 just
 had
 that
 draw


down
 over
 the
 past
 couple
 weeks."
 And,


you
 know,
 that
 was
 the
 quote
 unquote


scary
 part,
 but
 it
 just
 seems
 like
 more


and
 more
 people
 bought
 the
 dip.
 Here's


the
 last
 clip
 on
 talking
 about
 what


happened
 with
 Canada.
 So
 remember
 the


Canada
 situation,
 which
 by
 the
 way
 on


Saturday,
 and
 I
 don't
 even
 know
 if
 this


is
 going to
 be
 fully
 true,
 but
 Canada


ran
 that
 Reagan
 ad.
 Trump
 got
 pissed
 off


about
 it.
 Trump
 tweeted
 yesterday
 that


he
 is
 going
 to
 be
 increasing
 all
 the


tariffs
 on
 Canada
 by
 10%
 based
 on
 how


mad
 he
 was
 about
 that
 Reagan
 ad.
 I
 mean,


we'll
 see
 if
 that
 ends
 up
 playing
 out.


Canada
 actually
 pulled
 down
 the
 ad.
 So


they
 they
 stopped
 playing
 the
 ad
 on


Friday.
 Uh
 here's
 what
 Bent
 had
 to
 say


about
 it.


>> Major
 trade
 issue,
 which
 is
 Canada,
 of


course.
 This
 week,
 President
 Trump


abruptly
 broke
 off
 trade
 talks
 with
 uh


Canada
 and
 put
 another
 10%
 tariff
 on


Canada
 in
 response
 to
 an
 ad
 that
 the


government
 of
 Ontario
 ran.
 It
 features


former
 President
 Ronald
 Reagan.
 Why
 is


the
 president
 setting
 trade
 policy
 based


on
 a
 television
 ad
 he
 doesn't
 like?


>> Uh
 well,
 Kristen,
 let's
 let's
 think


about
 this.
 This
 this
 is
 a
 kind
 of


propaganda
 against
 US
 citizens.
 You


know,
 it
 it's
 it's
 scops.
 Why
 why
 would


the
 government
 of
 Ontario
 I'm
 told
 that


they've
 spent
 they
 have
 spent
 or
 were


planning
 to
 spend
 up
 to
 $75
 million
 on


these
 ads
 to
 come
 across
 the
 US
 border.


So
 what
 what
 was
 the
 purpose
 of
 that


other
 other
 than
 to
 sway
 public
 opinion


and
 you
 know
 it's
 some
 kind
 of


propaganda
 that
 the
 premier
 of
 Ontario


unilaterally
 launched.


>> Will
 will
 the
 10%
 tariffs
 apply
 to
 all


Canadian
 goods?
 Mr.
 Secretary,


>> uh
 Kristen,
 I
 I've
 been
 traveling
 since


this
 unfortunate
 event
 happened.
 I
 know


that
 the
 ad's
 been
 taken
 down.
 So,
 you


know,
 we
 we'll
 have
 to
 see,
 but
 I
 I
 just


think
 it
 was
 ter
 terrible
 terrible


judgment
 by
 by
 this
 premier,
 you
 know,


who
 has
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 reputation
 for
 being


a
 hothead.


>> Does
 the
 president
 know
 if
 the
 tariffs


will
 apply
 to
 10%
 tariffs
 will
 apply
 to


all
 Canadian
 goods?
 Has
 he
 made
 a


determination
 about
 that?


Well,


uh,
 well,
 I
 I'm
 sure
 he
 I'm
 sure
 he


knows
 and
 I'm
 sure
 the
 ambassador
 Greer


uh,
 knows,
 but
 again,
 you
 know,
 we're


we're
 here
 out
 in
 Asia
 and
 we're
 doing


these
 big
 trade
 deals
 out
 in
 Asia
 that


we
 just
 signed
 the
 Malaysian
 deal
 today,


which
 was
 fantastic.
 And,
 you
 know,
 I've


been
 spending
 the
 past
 two
 days


negotiating
 with
 the
 Chinese.
 So,
 you


know,
 what's
 whatever
 is
 going
 on
 back


in
 North
 America,
 I
 think
 is
 the
 taking


second
 fiddle
 to
 President
 Trump's


leadership
 out
 here
 in
 the
 Pacific.


>> Okay.


>> So,
 you
 got
 this
 Canada
 thing
 that
 might


turn
 into
 something,
 might
 not
 turn
 into


something.
 You've
 got
 the
 China
 stuff


that's
 hopefully
 going
 to
 turn
 into


something
 more
 positive.
 Um,
 and
 then


you've
 got
 this
 India
 deal
 along
 with


other
 Indopacific


uh
 partners
 that
 Trump
 might
 be
 able
 to


meaningfully
 get
 some
 cooperation
 on.
 I


mean,
 again,
 from
 from
 from
 a
 trade
 deal


perspective,
 it
 looks
 like
 things
 are


headed
 in
 the
 right
 direction.
 By
 the


way,
 just
 to
 just
 to
 put
 some
 context
 to


this,
 the
 reason
 why
 we
 took
 a
 breather


over
 the
 past
 two
 weeks
 is
 because
 of


trade.
 It's
 because
 of
 Trump
 and
 and


China
 beefing.
 Now,
 granted,
 one
 could


argue
 that
 we
 were
 bound
 for
 a
 breather


because
 things
 were
 just
 running
 too


hot.
 And
 I
 think
 all
 of
 us
 kind
 of
 felt


it
 to
 an
 extent,
 right?
 things
 were
 just


getting
 a
 bit
 too
 uh
 excited
 and
 and


it's
 healthy
 to
 take
 a
 breather,
 but
 you


needed
 a
 catalyst
 and
 that
 you
 know
 it


was
 a
 $20
 billion
 crypto
 liquidation
 on


October
 10th
 because
 of
 that
 Trump
 Truth


Social
 China
 thing.
 So,
 the
 reason
 the


market
 tanked
 over
 the
 past
 two
 weeks
 is


because
 of
 China.
 And
 so,
 it
 makes
 sense


that
 the
 market's
 hitting
 new
 alltime


highs
 as
 we've
 absorbed
 all
 of
 that


selling
 pressure
 and
 the
 China
 stuff


might
 be
 resolved,


which
 is
 why
 it
 seems
 like
 we
 might
 be


in
 a
 much
 better
 spot.


So
 there
 you
 go.
 How
 are
 we
 feeling?
 Are


we
 feeling
 that
 this
 continues?
 That
 is


my
 question.
 We
 got
 a
 couple
 other


headlines
 that
 we'll
 talk
 about,
 but
 in


general,
 I
 mean,
 once
 this
 China
 stuff


came
 out,
 particularly
 over
 uh
 the
 the


the
 the
 night
 in
 Malaysia
 morning
 in
 at


least
 the
 United
 States,
 I
 mean,
 I
 I
 at


that
 moment
 it
 kind
 of
 felt
 like
 we
 were


off
 to
 the
 races.
 Look
 at
 Google
 right


there.
 26355.


Google
 did
 hit
 267
 at
 one
 point.


Uh
 AMD
 again
 still
 holding
 260.
 Pounder


at
 190
 was
 that
 alltime
 high.
 Maybe
 it


cracks
 that.
 Do
 we
 think
 it
 continues
 or


do
 we
 think
 there's
 still
 a
 little
 bit


of
 selling
 pressure
 that
 needs
 to
 get


worked
 out
 of
 the
 system
 before
 we
 can


make
 that
 alltime
 high?


I
 don't
 know.
 I
 think
 there's
 a
 shot.
 I


think
 there's
 a
 shot.
 We
 we
 continue
 to


keep
 this
 going.
 Tom
 Lee,
 he
 continues


to
 be
 pretty
 excited
 uh
 about
 this


market.
 in
 his
 Sunday
 note.
 Uh
 I'll
 read


right
 here
 the
 specific
 quote
 that
 he


said.
 Mark
 Newton,
 by
 the
 way,
 still


think
 this
 technical
 analyst
 still


thinks
 that
 there
 could
 be
 some
 November


choppiness,
 which
 is
 fair,
 but
 overall


they're
 pretty
 uh
 bullish
 on
 7,000
 by


end
 of
 the
 year.
 Um


you
 got
 Tom
 Lee
 basically
 saying,
 uh
 it


could
 be
 argued
 that
 Friday's
 morning


release
 of
 September
 CPI
 data
 removed


much
 of
 that
 uncertainty,
 though
 it


might
 must
 have
 helped
 that
 the
 numbers


came
 in
 doubbish.
 I
 forgot
 to
 mention


that.
 I
 mean
 Friday
 we
 had
 a
 really
 good


CPI
 in
 the
 morning,
 which
 is
 important.


lower
 than
 consensus
 expectations
 that


bolstered
 expectations
 of
 another
 rate


cut
 when
 the
 results
 could
 be
 seen
 in
 a


range
 of
 indices,
 the
 S&P,
 the
 small


caps,
 etc.
 All
 four
 posted
 positive


weeks
 with
 the
 Russell
 200
 leading
 the


way
 with
 a
 2.5%
 weekly
 gain.


Um,
 and
 then
 Mark
 Newton
 says,
 "I
 don't


care
 if
 the
 market's
 been
 sort
 of
 choppy


and
 rangebound.
 In
 my
 view,
 despite
 the


choppy
 short-term
 trends,
 longerterm


trends
 are
 intact.
 And
 with
 sentiment


remaining
 subdued,
 it
 seems
 to
 be
 that


the
 path
 of
 least
 resistance
 remains
 to


the
 upside
 over
 the
 next
 couple
 of


weeks.


and
 earnings
 are
 going
 to
 really
 help


paint
 that
 story
 if
 we
 end
 up
 getting


some
 good
 earnings
 starting
 this
 week.


Bit
 mine
 right
 there
 5317


that
 is
 green
 as
 well.
 Are
 we
 pricing
 in


the
 rate
 cuts?
 I
 definitely
 think
 the


rate
 cuts
 are
 priced
 in.
 However,
 I


don't
 think
 that
 means
 the
 market
 can't


go
 higher
 simply
 put
 because
 you
 know


when
 when
 rates
 come
 down
 the
 cost
 of


capital
 becomes
 cheaper.
 people
 have
 to


allocate
 money
 if
 they
 want
 to
 take,
 you


know,
 some
 level
 of
 risk
 outside
 of
 the


the
 safness
 of
 how
 they've
 been


allocating
 capital
 and
 they
 want
 to
 put


it
 somewhere.
 So,
 are
 the
 rate
 cuts


priced
 in?
 Yeah,
 for
 sure.
 I
 mean,
 like,


we're
 trading
 at
 a
 pretty
 uh


historically
 expensive
 valuation
 for
 a


lot
 of
 reasons.
 Part
 of
 the
 reason
 is


because
 we're
 in
 an
 easing
 cycle,
 but


that
 doesn't
 mean
 rate
 cuts
 can't
 get


the
 market
 to
 continue
 to
 go
 higher
 when


it's
 finally
 announced,
 which
 is
 really


important.
 There's
 a
 96.7%
 chance
 in


October
 that
 we
 get
 that
 rate
 cut.
 And


that
 meeting
 is
 going
 to
 be
 happening


on
 Wednesday.


This
 guy
 This
 guy's
 got
 a
 big
 week.
 This


guy's
 got
 a
 big
 week.
 Shout
 out
 to
 Mr.


Tanner.


SoFi
 is
 going
 to
 be
 a
 big
 one.


SoFi
 is
 going
 to
 be
 a
 big
 one.
 So,
 what


do
 we
 have
 this
 week?
 Let's
 transition


into
 some
 of
 the
 earnings
 we
 have.
 By


the
 way,
 I
 want
 to
 show
 you
 guys
 this


real
 quick.
 The
 Warren
 Buffett
 indicator


is
 now
 at
 200


um
 23%.
 Which
 means
 if
 you
 use
 the


Buffett
 indicator,


um


this
 is
 the
 most
 expensive
 stock
 market


in
 history
 theoretically.
 And
 again,
 the


Buffett
 indicator
 is
 basically
 something


that
 looks
 at
 the
 total
 market


capitalization
 of
 all
 traded
 publicly


stocks
 relative
 to
 the
 nation's
 gross


domestic
 product,
 aka
 GDP.
 Now,
 again,


the
 Buffet
 indicator
 has
 been
 pretty


much
 this
 high
 over
 the
 past
 couple


years.
 uh
 not
 literally
 at
 this
 level


but
 it's
 been
 you
 know
 getting
 to
 those


all-time
 highs
 or
 close
 to
 those


all-time
 highs
 and
 the
 reason
 for
 that


is
 because
 our
 GDP
 as
 a
 our
 GDP
 relative


to
 our
 stock
 market
 is
 is
 is
 in
 contrast


right
 we
 are
 growing
 but
 we
 are
 not


growing
 as
 fast
 as
 the
 stock
 market
 is


growing
 but
 the
 reason
 the
 stock
 market


is
 growing
 that
 much
 I
 mean
 there's
 a


lot
 of
 reasons
 but
 one
 could
 definitely


argue
 that
 AI
 and
 the
 margin
 expansion


something
 that
 Birkshshire
 has
 not


really
 been
 you
 know
 that
 fully
 invested


in
 I
 think
 Bergkshire
 still
 has
 about


350
 billion
 in
 cash
 so
 they
 are
 still


waiting
 for
 an
 opportunity
 you
 know,
 UNH


was
 like
 the
 the
 last
 big
 opportunity
 I


think
 they
 took
 a
 lot
 of
 advantage
 of.


Um,
 that
 is
 how
 you
 explain
 this
 market


from
 a
 multiple
 perspective,
 even
 if
 on


other
 indicators


it
 could
 be
 a
 bit
 expensive.
 Goldman


Sachs
 right
 here,
 what
 do
 we
 got?


Goldman
 Sachs
 is
 green
 overnight
 as


well.
 All
 the
 banks
 should
 be
 pumping,


which
 is
 really
 good
 for
 SoFi.
 Bank
 of


America,
 yep,
 that's
 up
 1%.
 You
 got
 all


the
 banks
 making
 a
 move.
 So,
 here
 is
 the


earnings
 that
 we
 have
 going
 into
 next


week.
 tomorrow.
 We
 have
 a
 bunch
 of


companies.
 I
 mean,
 they're
 important.


Amcor
 is
 one
 that
 I
 have
 a
 position
 in,


but
 there's,
 you
 know,
 a
 bunch
 of
 names


that
 are
 out
 there.
 Not
 the
 the
 biggest


names
 in
 the
 world,
 but
 important
 names.


You
 got
 Cadence,
 that's
 important
 for


semiconductors.
 Whirlpool,
 important
 for


the
 consumer.
 Then
 on
 Tuesday,
 you
 have


SoFi,
 PayPal,
 those
 are
 big
 in
 the


morning.
 You
 have
 Royal
 Caribbean


consumer
 play,
 UPS
 consumer
 play.


Nphase,
 solar
 energy,
 Visa,
 important


for
 the
 street
 in
 terms
 of
 uh
 financial


systems
 and
 those
 sort
 of
 financial


metrics
 continuing
 to
 be
 good
 for
 the


consumer.
 You
 got
 the
 Cheesecake
 Factory


consumer
 Mandles,
 which
 by
 the
 way,


Mandles,
 they're
 the
 parent
 company
 of


Oreo.
 We
 had
 a
 headline
 this
 weekend,


and
 I
 think
 this
 is
 just
 going
 to


continue
 to
 take
 place.


The
 makers
 of
 Oreo
 have
 trained
 their


own
 video
 model
 for
 television


advertising.
 They
 have
 invested
 40


million
 in
 the
 models
 in
 AI
 and
 say
 it's


cut
 production
 costs
 by
 30
 to
 50%.
 Video


models
 are
 continuing
 to
 advance
 at
 a


rapid
 pace.
 By
 next
 year,
 it'll
 be


difficult
 to
 tell
 if
 an
 ad
 is
 AI


generated.
 This
 might
 actually
 be
 an


interesting
 earning
 play
 for
 a
 lot
 of


people
 to
 look
 at.
 Um,
 just
 based
 on
 the


fact
 that
 this
 stock
 hasn't
 really
 moved


that
 much
 this
 year,
 but
 they
 are,
 you


know,
 40
 million
 investment
 cut
 ad
 uh


production
 cost
 by
 30
 to
 50%.
 Earnings


is
 on
 Monday
 and
 then
 the
 stock
 is
 down


14%
 over
 the
 past
 three
 months.
 I
 mean,


if
 they
 end
 up
 reporting
 some
 massive


earnings
 beat
 or
 some
 guidance
 because


their
 advertising
 costs,
 which
 are
 some


of
 the
 biggest
 costs
 for
 a
 lot
 of
 these


companies,
 go
 down,


I
 mean,
 I
 think
 there's
 going
 to
 be
 a


lot
 of
 other
 companies
 that
 replicate


that.
 But
 that
 could
 also
 be
 another


consistent
 trend
 we're
 seeing
 in
 some
 of


these
 companies.
 They're
 using
 AI.
 That


AI
 is
 reducing
 their
 cost.
 As
 a
 result


of
 reducing
 that
 cost,
 they're
 able
 to


put
 up
 more
 EPS.
 As
 a
 result
 of
 putting


up
 more
 EPS,
 the
 stock
 market
 continues


to
 expand
 its
 overall
 multiple
 because


these
 companies
 are
 showing
 that
 they


can
 deliver
 more
 value
 for
 shareholders.


And
 you
 know,
 they
 probably
 also
 have


Steve
 that
 is
 helping
 their
 earnings


very
 very
 much
 as
 he
 is
 a
 avid


enthusiast
 of
 Oreos.


But
 look,
 it's
 just
 one
 of
 those
 things


in
 terms
 of
 the
 trend
 that
 is
 not


slowing
 down
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 earnings.


So
 that's
 what
 we
 have
 on
 Tuesday.
 And


then
 Wednesday
 is
 going
 to
 be
 crazy.
 So


here's
 my
 question.
 Let's
 uh
 let's
 put


this
 in
 the
 chat.
 Wednesday,
 we
 have


Meta,
 Microsoft,
 and
 Amazon.
 Meta,


Microsoft,
 and
 Amazon.
 By
 the
 way,
 75%


of
 you
 think
 that
 we're
 going
 to
 get


that
 China
 deal
 done
 by
 end
 of
 year,


which
 I
 would
 tend
 to
 agree
 with.
 I


think
 we're
 in
 the
 closest
 level
 that
 we


could
 possibly
 get
 that
 deal.
 Which
 one


outperforms
 from
 these
 prices
 today,


Meta,
 Google,
 or
 Microsoft
 on
 Wednesday?


I
 don't
 even
 know
 how
 we're
 going
 to


listen
 to
 the
 earnings
 calls
 that
 day.


It's
 going
 to
 just
 be
 a
 wild
 day
 trying


to
 get
 through
 all
 these
 stocks,


but


it's
 going
 to
 be
 exciting
 to
 see.
 Does


Bitmine
 I
 don't
 even
 know
 when
 Bitmine


has
 earnings
 to
 be
 honest.
 I
 don't
 is
 is


like
 Tom
 Lee
 going
 to
 get
 up
 there
 and


talk
 to
 analysts?
 Like
 do
 they
 even
 do


something
 like
 that?
 I
 feel
 like
 they


have
 to
 because
 they're
 a
 public


company,


but
 I
 mean
 we'll
 we'll
 listen
 to
 it
 if


if
 it
 is
 happening.
 I
 think
 it
 happens.


But
 also,
 he's
 not
 the
 CEO,
 so


technically
 he
 doesn't
 need
 to.
 He's
 the


chairman.
 Remember,
 it's
 different.


So,
 Evan,
 do
 you
 know
 if
 if if
 BitMine's


going to
 actually
 do
 an
 actual
 like


earnings
 call?
 Sometimes
 these
 companies


just
 don't
 do
 it.


And
 again,
 like
 what
 are
 they
 going
 to


say,
 right?
 There's
 I
 mean,
 it's
 a
 ETH


treasury,
 so
 it's
 like
 is
 there
 that


much
 to
 to
 say?
 Yeah,
 Wednesday
 is
 also


FOMC.


Wednesday
 is
 also
 FOMC.


So,
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 as
 well.
 Okay,


what
 did
 you
 guys
 say
 in
 the
 chat?
 Um,


wow.
 52%
 of
 people
 say
 the
 googs


52%
 of
 people
 think
 the
 googly
 googs


is
 going
 to
 figure
 this
 out.
 You
 guys


saying
 earnings
 are
 October
 29th
 for


BMR.
 All right.
 So
 that'll
 be
 a
 crazy


day
 on
 Wednesday
 then.
 That'll
 be
 a


crazy
 freaking
 day.
 Uh
 open
 door
 as
 well


up
 in
 the
 overnight
 markets.
 Bitcoin


right?
 Wow.
 115.
 There
 you
 go.
 Back
 to


115.
 We
 got
 it
 like
 two
 hours
 ago
 then


it
 went
 away.
 Let's
 see
 if
 we
 can
 hold


on
 to
 it.


Let's
 see
 if
 we
 can
 hold
 on.
 Um,
 yeah,


you
 know,
 honestly,
 I
 think
 I
 would
 I


would
 I
 would
 agree
 with
 you
 guys.
 I


think
 it's
 I
 think
 it's
 Google.
 I
 think


Microsoft's
 going
 to
 be
 great.
 Uh,
 I
 do


think
 Microsoft
 in
 their
 cloud
 revenue,


you
 know,
 they
 really
 blew
 away


expectations
 last
 quarter.
 I
 don't
 know


if
 they
 can
 do
 that
 twice.
 Google
 has
 a


lot
 of
 different
 elements
 working
 for
 it


that
 I
 could
 see
 that
 EPS
 beat
 being


higher
 than
 expected.
 And
 then
 Meta,
 I


think,
 is
 going
 to
 be
 fine.
 I
 just
 think


there's
 been
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 internal


chaos
 in
 meta
 from
 all
 the
 stuff
 we've


been
 seeing.
 And
 I
 think
 Z
 is
 just
 going


to
 have
 to,
 you
 know,
 clean
 all
 that
 up


and
 he's
 going
 to
 have
 to
 show
 that
 they


might
 be
 spending
 like
 crazy,
 but
 it's


justified.
 I
 think
 Google
 is
 the


clearest
 though
 to
 to
 not
 be
 too
 bad.


So,
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 exciting.
 It's


going
 to
 be
 exciting
 to
 see.
 And
 then


you
 got
 Amazon
 and
 Apple
 that
 then


report
 on
 Friday
 or
 on
 Thursday.
 And
 I


mean,
 look,
 I
 I
 don't
 think
 they


necessarily
 have
 to
 do
 bad
 either.
 The


takeaway
 from
 all
 these
 earnings
 right


here
 is
 as
 long
 as
 we
 get
 some


meaningful
 numbers,
 and
 all
 of
 them
 are


going
 to
 have
 their
 quirks,
 right?


Amazon
 might
 have
 some
 AWS
 issues.


Google
 might
 have
 some
 search
 issues.
 I


mean,
 all
 these
 companies
 are
 not
 going


to
 be
 perfect,
 but
 if
 they're
 close
 to


perfect
 or
 if
 some
 of
 them
 actually
 do


have
 perfect
 like
 Meta
 and
 and
 Microsoft


had
 perfect
 earnings
 in
 Q2
 for
 those


that
 Meta
 got
 to
 800,
 Microsoft
 got
 to


560
 and
 then
 they
 they
 pull
 it
 back.


But,
 um,
 if
 we
 can
 get
 those
 blockbuster


quarters,
 first
 of
 all,
 it's
 going
 to
 be


really
 good
 for
 Nvidia
 because
 we
 know


what's
 going
 to
 happen
 with
 Nvidia
 if


the
 hyperscalers
 are
 doing
 well.
 Also,


it's
 going
 to
 be
 good
 for
 the
 Nebuses,


the
 Iran.
 the
 hyperscalers
 can
 put
 up


those
 big
 daddy
 numbers.
 You
 would


imagine
 Iran,
 Bitfarm,
 CleanSpark.
 I


mean,
 all
 those
 companies
 should
 be


getting
 some
 of
 that
 residual
 demand
 as


well.
 That's
 really
 good
 for
 them.
 And


it's
 really
 good
 again
 for
 the
 AMDs,


Nvidas
 and
 Broadcoms
 of
 the
 world
 that


are
 facilitating
 all
 the
 chip
 and


infrastructure
 to
 make
 this
 stuff


happen.
 Or
 Oracle
 right
 there
 is
 also
 up


1%


after
 hours
 or
 in
 the
 overnight.


Yeah,
 maybe
 Grab
 I
 mean
 Grab
 has
 its


earnings
 next
 week
 or
 in
 two
 weeks
 on


November
 3rd.
 Uh
 I
 mean
 again
 for
 Grab


I've
 been
 pretty
 clear
 about
 it.
 I
 I


think
 you're
 buying
 a
 company
 with
 seven


billion
 in
 cash.
 At
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day
 I


do
 think
 the
 shorts
 are
 a
 bit
 in
 control


but
 that's
 why
 Grab
 has
 put
 up
 some
 good


earnings.
 I
 mean
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 and
 and


they
 you
 know
 they
 they
 should
 force
 the


market
 to
 give
 them
 a
 premium
 if
 they


continue
 to
 put
 up
 good
 earnings.
 Same


thing
 with
 your
 like
 big
 bear
 AIs
 of
 the


world
 right?
 Uh
 this
 stock
 I
 was
 looking


at
 some
 of
 their
 numbers
 today
 just
 to


give
 you
 guys
 some
 context
 on
 Big
 Bear


AI.
 Uh
 they
 grew
 negative
 32%
 last


quarter.
 Their
 revenue
 guidance
 for


fiscal
 year
 2025
 at
 the
 end
 of
 2024
 was


180
 million.
 They
 took
 that
 down
 to
 140


million
 and
 they
 had
 negative
 gross


margins.


So
 we're
 we're
 talking
 about
 a
 stock


that
 again
 is
 up
 a
 lot
 year
 to
 date.
 Uh


it
 was
 up
 more,
 but
 it's
 up
 71%
 year-to


date.
 And
 when
 you
 look
 at
 their


earnings,
 and
 I
 was
 just
 curious
 today,


so
 I
 went
 back
 into
 the
 earnings,
 I'm


like,
 "Oh
 wow."
 Like
 in
 the
 age
 of
 AI,


the
 company
 that
 has
 AI
 in
 their
 ticker


is
 growing
 negative
 32%.
 My
 question
 is


on
 earnings,
 what
 do
 they
 say
 to
 kind
 of


continue
 this
 run
 of
 being
 up
 70%


year-to-
 date.
 I
 mean,
 a
 company
 that's


not
 growing
 at
 all
 30,
 you
 know,


negative.
 This
 is
 not
 Tesla,
 you
 know,


Tesla's
 not
 growing,
 people
 can
 handle


that.
 This
 is
 a
 random
 AI
 company
 that


probably
 will
 be
 important
 in
 the
 long


term
 if
 you
 believe
 in
 their
 fundamental


thesis,
 but
 right
 now
 the
 numbers
 aren't


there.
 What
 do
 they
 say
 to
 get
 the
 stock


to
 go
 higher?
 And
 I
 think
 I'm
 going
 to


be
 curious
 this
 earning
 cycle.
 A
 lot
 of


these
 other
 names,
 what
 can
 they
 say
 to


keep
 their
 momentum
 alive,
 to
 keep
 their


narrative
 alive?
 Like
 Open
 Door,
 quite


frankly,
 I
 don't
 think
 Open
 Door
 is


gonna
 have
 a
 massive
 earnings
 because
 I


think
 Cass
 just
 got
 in
 and
 he
 hasn't


been
 able
 to
 implement
 all
 the
 stuff
 he


wants.
 But,
 you
 know,
 Cass
 is
 going
 to


talk
 like
 a
 rockstar
 CEO
 because
 I
 mean,


in
 the
 interviews
 I've
 seen
 already,
 I


mean,
 this
 guy
 really
 does
 know
 how
 to


talk
 and
 he
 is
 going
 to
 convince
 the


street
 that
 they
 are
 going
 to
 turn
 this


thing
 around
 even
 if
 the
 numbers
 on
 this


quarter
 might
 not
 show
 up.


And
 so,
 I
 I
 think
 that's
 what
 this


earning
 cycle
 is
 going
 to
 be
 about.
 Can


grab
 prove
 to
 the
 street
 they
 deserve
 to


get
 a
 premium?
 Can
 Dolingo
 prove
 to
 the


street
 that
 Apple
 eating
 their
 lunch
 is


stupid?
 You
 know,
 can
 Rocket
 Lab
 that


trades
 at
 over
 55
 times
 price
 to
 sales


prove
 to
 the
 street
 that
 hey,
 Neutron's


the
 real
 deal?
 You
 you
 guys
 have
 treated


us
 really
 well
 in
 terms
 of
 the
 stock


price.
 Don't
 forget
 that
 when
 Neutron


comes,
 that's
 when
 the
 real
 magic


starts.
 And
 so,
 even
 if
 the
 numbers


aren't
 amazing
 this
 quarter,
 keep
 in


mind
 what's
 going
 into
 the
 future.
 I


mean,
 this
 is
 going
 to
 be
 the
 story
 of


earnings
 as
 we
 really
 get
 into
 it
 over


the
 next
 two
 weeks
 and
 which
 companies


can
 can
 uphold
 their
 narrative
 or
 change


their
 narrative.
 I
 mean,
 PayPal,
 right?


Can
 PayPal
 tell
 the
 street,
 guys?
 We're


basically
 going
 to
 go
 private
 in
 five


years
 if
 you
 don't
 buy
 the
 stock
 because


we're
 going
 to
 buy
 back
 all
 the
 shares.


Like,
 is
 there
 enough
 juice
 in
 a
 lot
 of


these
 names?
 Same
 things
 with


Salesforce.
 Same
 thing
 with
 Amazon
 in


terms
 of
 AWS
 acceleration
 to
 get
 the


market
 to
 recognize
 what's
 going
 on.


Yes,
 Big
 Bear
 AI
 does
 have
 a
 lot
 in
 the


pipeline.
 They
 have
 380
 million
 in
 the


pipeline,
 which
 is
 why
 I'm
 confused
 why


the
 revenue
 growth
 is
 negative
 32%.
 But


again,
 these
 are
 things
 that
 they're


going to
 have
 to
 highlight
 on
 their


earnings
 call.
 And
 if
 most
 companies
 can


do
 a
 good
 job
 of
 this
 S&P
 682,
 look
 at


that.
 Breaking
 through
 682,


then
 hopefully
 we
 have
 a
 uh
 hopefully
 we


have
 a
 good
 earning
 cycle.


All right,
 it
 seems
 most
 people
 are


excited.


Seems
 most
 people


most
 most
 people
 are
 excited


with
 what
 we've
 got
 going
 on.


The
 comments
 on
 the
 hair
 are
 great.


They're
 really
 This
 is
 not
 the
 final


hairstyle.
 I
 just
 said,
 "You
 know what?


Screw
 it.
 I
 don't
 feel
 like
 wearing
 a


hat
 today.
 I
 don't
 feel
 like
 wearing
 a


hat."
 So,
 I
 haven't
 even
 got
 a
 haircut


in
 like
 two
 weeks.
 This
 is
 just
 like


whatever.
 But
 it's
 proving
 to
 you
 guys
 I


do
 have
 hair.
 A
 lot of
 people
 didn't


think
 I
 had
 hair.
 I
 think
 I'm
 bald.
 It's


like
 no,
 I
 have
 hair.


I
 just
 uh
 usually
 never
 show
 it.
 S&P7000


by
 turkey
 day.


Dude,
 if
 we
 get
 S&P7000
 by
 the
 end
 of


the
 year
 or
 even
 by
 Thanksgiving,


this
 would
 be
 fun.
 This
 would
 be
 very,


very,
 very,
 very,
 very
 fun
 to
 end
 out


the
 year
 in
 this
 manner.
 Again,
 I
 think


it's
 very
 possible
 now.
 I
 mean,
 look,


we're
 less
 than
 2%
 away
 from
 7,000.
 So


all
 those
 7,000
 targets,
 which
 shout
 out


to
 Steve,
 even
 when
 the
 S&P
 fell
 to


4,800,
 he
 was
 pretty
 adamant
 that
 we
 are


going
 to
 see
 that
 7,000
 range,
 if
 that


can
 continue,
 then
 uh
 this
 would
 be


pretty
 exciting.
 This
 was
 Tom
 Lee
 on


Friday
 on
 his
 thoughts
 for
 why
 crypto


probably
 is
 going
 to
 rally
 towards
 the


end
 of the
 year.


>> Uh
 still
 expecting
 explosive
 recovery
 in


markets.
 Um,
 but
 we
 are
 above
 that
 level


and
 you
 know,
 we're
 10
 weeks
 before
 the


end
 of
 the
 year
 and
 the
 S&P
 is
 at
 6,800.


I
 think
 it's
 still
 a
 base
 case
 then
 for


people
 to
 say
 that
 in
 just
 a
 typical


year
 the
 S&P
 should
 gain
 another
 4%.


That
 would
 put
 us
 over
 7,000
 into
 the


end
 of
 the
 year.
 And
 I
 think
 that
 that's


sort
 of
 the
 minimum.
 But
 because
 we've


got
 the
 Fed
 cutting
 um
 and
 and
 they


started
 in
 September,
 they've
 been
 on


pause
 all
 year.
 that
 only
 happened
 twice


in
 the
 last
 50
 years,
 which
 is
 1998
 and


2024.
 I
 actually
 think
 the
 S&P,
 given


the
 skepticism
 that's
 been
 plaguing
 this


market
 all
 year,
 we
 could
 do
 far
 better


than
 4%.
 You
 know,
 maybe
 even
 10%
 into


year
 end.


>> Wow.
 Okay.
 So,
 where
 does
 crypto
 fit
 in?


Especially
 when
 you're
 looking
 at
 how


those
 currencies
 are
 moving
 uh
 versus


what's
 happening
 with
 tariff
 concerns,


global
 trade
 concerns,
 etc.


Uh
 yeah,
 cry
 I
 mean
 crypto
 uh
 had
 a
 huge


deleveraging
 event
 on
 October
 10th
 and


and
 part
 of
 that
 was
 triggered
 by
 the


the
 escalating
 tensions
 with
 US
 and


China
 on
 tariffs
 and
 trade.
 Um
 and
 that


was
 the
 biggest
 liquidation
 event
 in
 in


five
 years
 for
 crypto.
 So
 there
 is
 still


and
 it
 looks
 like
 that
 got
 resolved
 over


the
 weekend
 to
 an
 extent
 with
 these


productive
 talks
 with
 Vent.
 So
 that's


why
 you're
 probably
 seeing
 crypto
 get
 a


rebound.
 Bitcoin
 just
 needs
 to
 stay


above
 115
 by
 the
 end
 of
 October
 to
 have


its
 like
 10th
 green
 October
 in
 a
 row.
 If


it's
 below
 115,
 then
 we
 would
 have
 a
 uh


downtober,
 not
 an
 October.
 But
 if
 China


was
 the
 reason
 for
 the
 crypto


liquidation,
 maybe
 China's
 the
 reason


why
 crypto
 comes
 back
 to
 the
 moon.


>> Those
 ripple
 effects,
 you
 know,
 two


weeks
 later
 that
 are
 plaguing
 the
 crypto


market.
 But
 I
 think
 we're
 almost
 through


that
 because
 a
 measure
 like
 something


called
 open
 interest
 for
 both
 Ethereum


and
 Bitcoin
 are
 at
 record
 lows
 at
 a
 time


when
 the
 technicals
 for
 both
 Bitcoin
 and


Ethereum
 are
 are
 flipping
 positive.
 So
 I


think
 you're
 going
 to
 see
 a
 crypto
 rally


into
 the
 end
 of the
 year.
 And
 it's
 it


really
 does
 help
 to
 see
 JP
 Morgan
 say


they're
 open
 to
 the
 idea
 of
 using
 crypto


as
 collateral.


>> Yeah,
 I
 was
 actually
 going
 to
 get
 your


thoughts
 on
 that,
 Tom,
 but
 in
 light
 of


that
 and
 you
 and
 I
 have
 had
 these


conversations
 uh
 over
 the
 months,
 over


the
 years.
 I
 can
 think
 about
 the


conversation
 we
 had
 in
 early
 early


August
 uh
 where
 you
 talked
 about
 on
 the


exchange
 where
 you
 talked
 about
 the
 fact


that
 cryptocurrencies
 tend
 to
 be
 early


indicators
 of
 where
 stocks
 are


directionally
 headed
 as
 well
 as
 uh


indicators
 of
 liquidity
 in
 the
 broader


market.
 So
 given
 what
 we
 are
 seeing
 in


Bitcoin
 and
 as
 that
 relates
 to
 the
 S&P


500
 and
 arguably
 what
 we're
 seeing
 in


Ethereum
 and
 what
 that
 says
 about
 the


Russell
 2000,
 want
 to
 get
 your
 thoughts.


>> Um
 yeah,
 I
 mean
 I
 think
 it's
 sending
 a


pretty
 bullish
 signal.
 Um
 part
 of
 it
 is


uh
 it's
 a
 counterfactual
 statement
 but


crypto
 had
 the
 biggest
 liquidation
 event


deleveraging
 event
 in
 in
 history.
 You


know
 I
 mean
 the
 the
 number
 is
 is


probably
 multiples
 of
 what
 happened


during
 FTX
 and
 Bitcoin
 ends
 up
 down
 3
 or


4%.
 So
 I
 I
 think
 it
 shows
 you
 that
 it's


Bitcoin
 itself
 is
 proving
 to
 be
 a
 pretty


good
 store
 of
 value
 because
 if
 we
 had


seen
 this
 happen
 with
 gold
 in
 the
 gold


market
 if
 there
 was
 a
 huge
 leverage


event
 and
 gold
 was
 only
 down
 a
 few


percentage
 points
 we'd
 of
 course


consider
 that
 a
 real
 validation
 and
 it's


also
 true
 of
 Ethereum
 because
 Ethereum


uh
 is
 is
 seeing
 so
 much
 activity
 growth


I
 mean
 on
 the
 L1
 and
 the
 L2
 because
 of


stable
 coins
 and
 it's
 not
 reflected
 in


price.
 It
 does
 take
 time.
 So
 to
 me,


>> it's
 not
 reflected
 in
 the
 price.
 And


going
 to
 Tom
 Lee's
 point,
 Zel,
 which
 a


lot
 of
 us,
 at least
 in
 the
 United


States,
 know
 about,
 uh,
 they
 said
 today


they're
 planning
 to
 allow
 their
 users
 to


start
 making
 international
 payments
 via


stable
 coins.
 I
 mean,
 this
 is,
 bro,
 I


mean,
 this
 I
 know
 Ethereum
 is
 not


reflecting
 all
 the
 momentum
 we've
 seen


in
 stable
 coins
 and
 tokenization,
 but


you've
 got
 people
 like
 Vlad
 that
 think


tokenization
 is
 literally
 going
 to
 eat


the
 financial
 system.
 You
 got
 Larry
 Fink


that
 thinks
 it's
 going to
 be
 a
 four
 and


a
 half
 trillion
 dollar
 market.
 You
 got


Bent
 who
 thinks
 stable
 coins
 is
 going
 to


get
 up
 to
 the
 two
 to
 four
 trillion


dollar
 range
 simply
 because
 of
 the


demand
 for
 treasuries
 which
 the
 federal


government
 really
 likes
 because
 there's


a
 buyer
 for
 US
 debt.
 Um
 and
 then
 you've


got
 the
 overall
 retail
 excitement


because
 of
 people
 like
 Tom
 Lee.
 By
 the


way,
 the
 Nikk,
 look
 at
 that.
 50,000.


That
 is
 an
 all-time
 high
 for
 Japan.
 That


is
 an
 all-time
 high
 for
 Japan.
 Wow,


dude.
 In
 1991,


it
 was
 at
 40,000.


Bottomed
 basically
 in
 2008
 at
 8,000
 and


now
 we're
 at
 50.


Got
 a
 lot
 more
 people.
 They're
 getting


excited
 about
 these
 different
 asset


classes
 and
 obviously
 that's
 going to
 be


really
 bullish
 for
 for
 uh
 for
 Bit
 Mine


as
 well.
 So,
 I
 mean
 again
 the
 theme
 of


the
 day
 and
 hopefully
 the
 theme
 of


tonight's
 future
 show
 continues
 into


tomorrow.
 Look
 at
 Robin
 Hood
 14338
 is


bullish.
 And
 the
 reason
 I
 really
 think


this
 is
 more
 bullish
 is
 because
 we
 went


through
 a
 healthy
 two
 week
 draw
 down


across
 the
 entire
 board
 and
 all
 of
 us


probably
 needed
 to
 see
 a
 little
 bit
 of


more
 pain
 before
 we
 get
 those
 gains.


It's
 just
 natural.
 We
 were
 going
 on
 a


hot
 streak.
 Literally
 from
 April
 till


the
 end
 of
 September,
 we're
 on
 a
 hot


streak.
 And
 granted,
 we
 had
 a
 30%


decline,
 but
 the
 point
 is
 it
 was
 just
 up


and
 up
 and
 up
 and
 up.
 And
 I
 ran
 Israel


didn't
 take
 us
 down.
 Moody's
 didn't
 take


us
 down.
 Trump
 announced
 50%
 tariffs
 on


the
 EU
 that
 didn't
 do
 anything.
 And
 then


a
 3%
 down
 day
 because
 Trump
 says,
 "Oh,


I'm
 tired
 of
 China's
 uh
 export


controls."
 And
 then
 boom,
 everything


goes
 to
 It's
 almost
 like
 the
 market
 just


needed
 a
 catalyst.
 And
 most
 people
 just


said,
 "Okay,
 if
 that's
 the
 catalyst
 for


me
 to
 get
 SoFi
 at
 $25,
 then
 that's
 what


I'm
 going
 to
 do
 or
 pick
 whatever
 stock


at
 whatever
 level."


And
 that's
 why
 this
 is
 also
 pretty


exciting.


So
 there
 you
 go.
 Hey,
 put
 in
 the
 chat


what
 stock
 you
 really
 bought
 the
 dip
 on


over
 the
 past
 two
 weeks.
 I
 think
 we're


going
 to
 get
 some
 of
 the
 the
 main


targets
 like
 the
 Bitmines,
 the
 Amazons


of
 the
 world,
 but
 put
 in
 the
 chat.
 I


mean,
 which
 one
 you
 really
 took


advantage
 of?


I
 think
 for
 me
 it
 would
 be
 a
 little
 bit


of
 Bitmine,
 more
 Grab,
 bit
 of
 Palanteer,


a
 bit
 of
 Nvidia,
 SoFi,


usual
 Amazon
 for
 sure,
 usual
 candidates,


but


it
 ended
 up
 so
 far
 not
 being
 the
 worst.


Yeah,
 I
 see
 a
 lot
 of
 Bitmine,
 a
 lot
 of


Amazon,
 a
 lot
 of
 I
 mean,
 dude,
 Nabius,


great
 buys
 for
 those
 who
 got
 the
 if


you're
 super
 bullish
 on
 IEN,
 you
 got
 a


chance
 to
 buy
 the
 dip,
 even
 if
 you
 know


it
 was
 still
 elevated
 from
 where
 you


bought
 it
 at.


Cipher,
 pounder,
 Weeble,
 where's
 Weeble


overnight?
 This
 thing
 got
 to
 freaking


almost
 below
 $10.
 Weeble
 right
 here.


There
 you
 go.
 11.82.
 Dude,
 someone


bought
 like
 a
 couple
 million
 bucks
 worth


of
 freaking
 Weeble
 uh
 $35
 November


calls.


I
 don't
 know
 what
 they
 think
 is
 going
 to


happen
 to
 Weeble
 in
 November
 to
 get
 to


35,
 but
 doesn't
 literally
 have
 to
 get
 to


35
 for
 them
 to
 sell,
 but
 like
 I
 mean,


you
 got
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 that
 are
 bullish


on
 this
 one
 going
 into
 the
 end
 of
 the


end
 of
 the
 year.
 Richtech
 Robotics


Assist
 again,
 Mike
 Alfred,
 he
 is
 a


bigger
 figure
 in
 the
 Bitcoin
 community.


He
 uh
 he
 he
 bought
 this
 on
 Friday.


And
 look,
 I
 I
 don't
 know
 that
 much
 about


Mike
 Alfred.
 We
 we've
 had
 a
 couple


conversations
 here
 and
 there.
 We've


we've
 talked
 I
 mean,
 I've
 know
 the
 guy


for
 about
 two
 or
 three
 years
 now,
 and


you
 know,
 we've
 DM'd
 back
 and
 forth,
 and


he's
 a
 friendly
 guy,
 but
 this
 thing


completely
 pumped
 the
 stock.
 I
 mean,


this
 thing
 was
 trading
 at
 95
 cents,
 and


he
 bought
 a
 million
 dollars
 worth
 of
 it.


I
 did
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 digging
 into
 ASST.


the
 I
 I
 did
 find
 some
 stuff
 that
 I
 think


people
 just
 might
 have
 to
 watch
 out
 for.


There
 is
 it's
 trading
 at
 2.2x
 MNAV.


There's
 a
 pipe
 coming
 up.
 There's
 uh


warrants
 that
 are
 unlocking
 to
 the
 tune


of
 450
 million.
 Company's
 only
 worth
 800


million,
 so
 it
 might
 be
 diluted
 by
 50%.


I
 mean,
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 different
 like


internal
 dynamics
 of
 ASST
 that
 people


have
 to
 watch
 out
 for,
 but
 it
 also
 might


not
 matter
 because
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the


day,
 rates
 are
 coming
 down.
 this
 is
 a


Bitcoin
 associated
 asset
 class.
 And
 then


you
 might
 just
 have
 retail
 wanting,
 you


know,
 if
 they
 miss
 the
 open
 door
 run,


they
 might
 say,
 "All
 right,
 this
 is
 my


next
 thing
 to
 to
 ape
 into


even
 if
 it's
 just
 for
 a
 flip.


So
 I
 mean
 you
 might
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 things


that
 could
 create
 that
 as
 well.
 Pipe
 is


private
 investment
 and
 public
 equity.
 So


you
 have
 more
 money
 potentially
 coming


in
 and
 then
 some
 money
 actually
 leaving


based
 on
 what
 price
 the
 warrants
 are


exercised
 that."
 I
 don't
 know
 about
 the


internal
 nuances
 to
 to
 like
 actually


tell
 you
 a
 fundamental
 thesis
 around


ASST.
 I
 would
 say
 if
 you're
 buying
 it


and
 it
 goes
 higher,
 it
 is
 likely
 because


of
 a
 lot
 of
 momentum.
 I
 don't
 I
 mean
 I


don't
 think
 Mike
 highlighted
 in
 a


fundamental
 thesis.
 He
 just
 said
 he


really
 loves
 the
 team.
 And
 so
 I
 don't


know
 if
 there
 is
 a
 fundamental
 thesis.


All
 I
 know
 is
 that
 it
 could
 be
 a
 super


big
 momentum
 play.
 I
 mean
 it
 would
 not


surprise
 me
 if
 this
 this
 thing
 was
 at


$10
 a
 couple
 months
 ago.
 It
 would
 not


surprise
 me
 if
 it
 gets
 back
 there
 just


based
 on
 momentum.


It's
 just
 a
 question
 of,
 you
 know,
 do


you
 want
 to
 take
 the
 risk
 on
 if
 it
 does


get
 there
 or
 if
 it
 doesn't?
 Kratos,
 EOS,


Grab,
 VG,
 Next.
 I
 mean,
 yeah,
 pretty


much
 all
 of
 us,
 dude,
 bought
 something.


Pretty
 much
 all
 of
 us
 bought
 something,


which
 is
 the
 exciting
 part
 over
 the
 past


couple
 of
 weeks.


Yeah,
 AS
 got
 hit
 as
 well,
 but
 you
 know,


that
 one
 is
 something
 that
 people
 were


able
 to
 buy
 the
 dip
 on.
 Joerger
 shots


for
 the
 birthday.
 I
 I
 don't
 know,
 dude.


It's
 Monday.
 Do
 we
 drink
 on
 a
 Monday?


Feel
 like
 we
 can't
 drink
 on
 a
 Monday,


dude.


Feel
 like
 drinking
 on
 a
 Monday
 is
 too


aggressive.
 But
 it'll
 be
 it'll
 be
 a
 fun


market
 close.
 We'll
 uh
 we
 get
 to
 just


chill
 and
 then
 talk
 and
 hopefully
 we
 end


at
 all
 time
 highs
 and
 it'll
 be,
 you


know,
 a
 fun
 way
 to
 end
 out
 Monday


and
 nothing
 too
 crazy
 plays
 out.


Jagger,
 when
 you
 ring
 the
 bell,
 where's


VG
 overnight?
 Does
 that
 trade
 overnight?


EG


949
 and
 then
 next


there
 you
 go
 582.
 Oh
 wow.
 Next
 got
 below


six.
 I
 have
 to
 buy
 next
 eventually.
 I


believe
 in
 Matt's
 DD.
 I
 just
 haven't


taken
 the
 position
 yet.
 But
 eventually


I'm
 going
 to
 buy
 it
 and
 just
 hold
 it
 for


the
 long
 term.


Um


do
 you
 think
 Okay,
 so
 this
 is
 this
 is


interesting.
 Do
 you
 think
 All right.
 Do


you
 think
 that
 the
 S&P
 could
 have
 a


blowoff
 top
 tomorrow?
 I
 think
 there
 is


enough
 good
 news
 baked
 in
 right
 now


based
 on
 what
 we're
 seeing
 in
 the


futures
 with,
 you
 know,
 681
 on
 the
 S&P


where
 the
 blowoff
 top
 would
 happen
 if


there's
 not
 another
 catalyst
 to
 kind
 of


keep
 the
 market
 excited
 about
 what's


going
 on.
 And
 all
 I
 see
 over
 the
 next


couple
 of
 months
 are
 catalysts.
 You've


got
 earnings
 this
 week,
 that's
 a


catalyst.
 You've
 got
 rate
 cuts
 on


Wednesday,
 that's
 a
 catalyst.
 And
 then


you
 still
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 that
 are


pretty
 bearish
 on
 the
 overall
 market.


They
 still
 think
 there's
 way
 too
 much


froth,
 yada
 yada.
 like
 that's
 a
 catalyst


because
 there's
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 wall
 of
 worry


there.
 You've
 got
 Nvidia
 potentially


signing
 a
 deal
 to
 finally
 sell
 their


chips
 into
 China,
 which
 may
 be
 a


culmination
 of
 the
 trade
 agreement
 with


with
 the
 US
 and
 China.
 I
 mean,
 if
 we
 get


their
 rare
 earths,
 maybe
 they
 get
 our


chips.
 Trump's
 been
 on
 board
 to
 do
 that.


Even
 Lisa
 Sue
 has
 offered
 15%
 of


revenues
 for
 AMD.
 That
 would
 be
 bullish


for
 everyone.
 And
 then
 you've
 got
 the


general
 AI
 tailwind
 that
 it
 doesn't
 seem


like
 it's
 slowing
 down
 either.
 Oh,
 yeah.


Possible
 government
 reopening.
 I
 mean,
 I


don't
 know if
 that's
 ever
 going
 to


happen
 at
 this
 point,
 but
 like
 I
 don't


know,
 dude.
 I
 feel
 like
 it's
 it's
 a
 it's


it's
 a
 little
 too
 like
 it's
 a
 little
 too


easy
 to
 be
 like,
 well,
 it's
 topping
 out


now
 because
 we
 just
 had
 a
 draw
 down
 and


that
 draw
 down


made
 sense
 for
 a
 lot
 of
 reasons
 and
 now


you
 have
 healthy
 catalyst
 to
 get
 that


draw
 down
 to
 not
 be
 as
 bad.
 Now,
 you
 do


have
 this
 macro
 news
 that
 no
 one
 can


ignore,
 right?
 auto
 loans
 and
 their


delinquencies
 um
 60
 days
 or
 more
 past


due
 have
 surged
 51%


over
 the
 past
 15
 years
 specifically
 on


auto.
 And
 we
 we we
 looked
 at
 a
 chart


similar
 to
 this
 last
 week.
 So
 like
 yeah,


there's
 parts
 of
 the
 market
 that
 are
 not


healthy
 because
 we
 have
 these,
 you
 know,


credit
 delinquencies
 that
 are
 not
 doing


the
 best.
 But
 then
 again,
 you
 look
 at


every
 bank's
 earnings
 and
 SoFi
 will
 let


us
 continue
 that
 trend
 hopefully
 on


Tuesday.
 That
 said,
 delinquencies
 are


fine.
 City
 Bank
 and
 JP
 Morgan
 literally


said
 they're
 lower
 than
 expected.
 You


know,
 this
 is
 not
 some
 random
 bank.
 This


City
 Bank
 and
 JP
 Morgan
 saying
 the


delinquency
 rates
 that
 we
 thought
 we


were
 going
 to
 get
 were
 lower
 than


expected.
 The
 credit
 provision
 losses


for
 TFC
 and
 a
 bunch
 of
 the
 other


regional
 banks
 on
 uh
 Monday
 came
 in
 way


better
 than
 expected.
 And
 then
 at
 the


same
 time,
 you
 still
 have
 7.4
 trillion


on
 the
 sidelines
 with
 30
 billion
 that


were
 added
 to
 money
 market
 funds
 last


week.


I
 mean,
 again,
 I'm
 trying
 to
 find
 the


bare
 case.
 The
 only
 bare
 case
 I
 had
 over


the
 past
 couple
 weeks
 was
 that,
 hey,


maybe
 we're
 a
 little
 too
 frothy.
 We
 need


a
 little
 bit
 of
 shakeddown.
 Well,
 we
 got


that.
 We
 got
 the
 shakedown.
 It
 happened.


So,
 it's
 like,
 you
 know,
 that
 shortterm,


okay,
 this
 is
 going
 to
 be
 a
 little


choppy
 ended
 up
 being
 a
 buy
 the
 dip,


which
 I
 think,
 you
 know,
 most
 people


agreed
 was
 a
 good
 buy
 the
 dip.
 And
 now


potentially,
 we
 are
 back
 for
 this
 next


leg
 higher.
 And
 this
 is
 a
 chart
 on


November.
 That's
 also
 really
 important.


Again,
 take
 a
 look
 at
 November
 right


here.
 Over
 the
 past
 10
 years,
 S&P
 500


average
 monthly
 return
 in
 November
 has


been
 above
 4.2%.


Maybe
 that
 continues.
 the
 government
 is


closed.
 Who
 even
 noticed?
 Yeah,
 I
 mean,


look,
 but
 the
 people,
 by
 the
 way,
 the


people
 not
 getting
 paid
 by
 the


government
 obviously
 are
 noticing,
 but


uh
 the
 market
 is
 not
 acting
 like
 they


care
 that
 the
 government's
 closed.
 We


found
 out
 the
 person,
 or
 at least
 I


should
 say
 the
 New
 York
 Times
 found
 out


the
 person
 who
 gave
 the
 $130
 million
 uh


soldier


payment
 payroll.
 It's
 Timothy
 Melon.


Timothy
 Melon.
 this
 guy


uh
 he's
 he's
 uh
 he's
 part
 of
 a
 American


banking
 family.
 I
 had
 no
 idea
 who
 this


guy
 is,
 but
 he's
 the
 grandson
 of
 Andrew


Melon,
 and
 that
 name
 should
 be,
 you


know,
 similar
 to
 a
 lot
 of
 people.
 He
 was


once
 the
 US
 Treasury
 Secretary.
 Um
 and


Forbes
 puts
 the
 Melon
 family
 net
 worth


at
 14
 billion.
 They
 put
 his
 net
 worth
 at


four
 billion.


Yeah.
 BNY
 Melon.
 Exact.
 Exactly.
 Now,
 I


said
 last
 week,
 I
 think
 you
 need
 to
 be


worth
 a
 lot
 more
 than
 four
 billion.
 I


would
 say
 minimum
 10
 billion
 to
 give


away
 130
 million.
 So
 maybe
 maybe
 Forbes


has
 his
 net
 worth
 wrong,
 but
 if
 he
 if


he's
 only
 I
 use
 quotes
 on
 only
 worth


four
 billion
 and
 he
 gave
 away
 130


million
 to
 pay
 for
 the
 troops,
 that's


quite
 incredible.


That's
 quite
 incredible.
 I
 feel
 like


he's
 worth
 more
 than
 that.
 But


like
 even
 the
 fact
 that
 you
 have
 this


stuff
 happening
 kind
 of
 subdues
 some
 of


the
 impact
 from
 the
 shutdown,
 at least


in
 the
 eyes
 of
 the
 market,
 which
 again


is
 bullish
 for
 for
 equities.
 Uh
 take
 a


look
 at
 this.
 We
 got
 a
 couple
 more


charts
 right
 here.
 Here
 is
 the
 NASDAQ's


performance


720
 days
 after
 Chat
 GBT's
 release
 on


November
 30th,
 2022.
 compared
 to
 its


performance
 720
 days
 after
 Netscape,


which
 was
 one
 of
 the
 world's
 first


browsers
 on
 the
 internet,
 released
 on


December
 19th,
 1994.
 I
 mean,
 this
 chart


is
 phenomenal.


Chat
 GBT
 has
 grown
 111%
 through
 the
 past


720
 days.
 Netscape
 123%
 through
 720


days.
 So
 you're
 you're
 you're
 having
 the


start
 of
 the
 literal
 internet
 be
 just


slightly
 above
 the
 NASDAQ
 composite


percentage
 change
 of
 chat
 GBT
 which


might
 be
 the
 entire
 start
 to
 a
 to
 an


industry
 that's
 much
 bigger
 than
 the


internet


and
 that
 doesn't
 look
 yeah
 some
 of
 you


guys
 remember
 Netscape
 I
 mean
 that's


Mark
 Andre
 so
 it
 doesn't
 look
 like


that's
 slowing
 down
 anytime
 soon
 here's


another
 chart
 on
 what's
 happening
 with


ChatBT
 this
 is
 the
 projection
 from


Adreen
 Horowitz
 which
 is
 one
 of
 the


biggest
 investors
 in
 chat


They're
 expecting
 in
 the
 next
 two
 years


for
 OpenAI
 to
 make
 hundred
 billion


dollars
 of
 revenue.


For
 context,
 it
 took
 all
 the
 other
 tech


companies
 a
 minimum
 of
 six
 years,
 most


of
 them
 10
 years
 to
 get
 to
 hundred


billion
 dollars
 of
 revenue.


Now
 again,
 uh,
 OpenAI
 really
 has
 to
 do


this
 because
 they're
 involved
 in
 every


single
 freaking
 deal
 that's
 in
 that's
 on


the
 planet
 in
 regards
 to
 AI.
 But
 like
 if


they
 do,
 you've
 got
 that
 broader
 macro


tailwind
 that
 is
 very
 important.
 And
 and


and
 and
 to
 help
 them
 do
 this,
 SoftBank


from
 Japan
 officially
 has
 initiated
 the


remaining
 22.5
 billion
 of
 its
 $30


billion
 investment
 in
 OpenAI.
 There
 was


a
 couple
 of
 disagreements
 between
 Soft


Bank
 and
 OpenAI
 over
 the
 past
 couple


months.
 This
 was
 supposed
 to
 happen
 back


in
 July,
 and
 it
 took
 them
 a
 few
 months


to
 figure
 out
 exactly
 how
 they
 were


going
 to
 do
 it,
 how
 they're
 going
 to


deal
 with
 the
 nonprofit
 stuff,
 the


board,
 voting
 rights,
 all
 that
 stuff.


They
 ended
 up
 investing
 40
 billion
 or


sorry
 30
 billion
 in
 total.
 They
 did
 8


billion
 last
 uh
 July
 and
 the
 other
 22


billion
 over
 the
 weekend.


I
 mean
 imagine
 the
 guy
 who's
 sending
 in


the
 wire
 for
 that
 $22
 billion


investment.


Got
 to
 make
 sure
 you
 don't
 mess
 up
 the


uh
 mess
 up
 the
 name
 of
 the
 freaking
 of


the
 bank.
 But
 like
 I
 think
 anytime
 we


have
 a
 broader
 bearish
 argument
 for
 this


stock
 market,
 which
 is,
 you
 know,
 we


should
 all
 pay
 attention
 to
 and
 care


about
 and
 understand
 and
 like
 deeply
 try


to
 analyze
 because
 at
 the
 end of
 the


day,
 this
 stuff
 does
 does
 matter
 for
 the


day-to-day.
 The
 broader
 macro
 theme


around
 AI
 is
 intact.
 At least
 I
 haven't


seen
 a
 meaningful
 degragation
 of
 that


theme.
 And
 if
 that
 theme
 continues
 to


stay
 intact,
 I
 mean,
 you're
 going
 to


continue
 to
 see
 earnings
 growth.
 You're


going
 to
 continue
 to
 see
 margin


expansion.
 You're
 going
 to
 continue
 to


see
 capex.
 And
 as
 a
 result,
 you
 should


continue
 to
 see
 potentially
 three
 and
 a


half%
 to
 4%
 GDP
 growth
 over
 the
 next


over
 the
 next
 four
 or
 five
 years,
 which


is
 the
 plan
 of
 this
 administration.


And
 if
 that
 happens,
 that
 would
 not
 be


the
 worst
 in
 the
 world.
 Uh
 Gotam,
 thank


you
 for
 the
 $10
 super
 shout
 admit


thoughts
 on
 UiPath.
 Uh
 also,
 I've
 been


watching
 since
 2021.
 Appreciate
 it.


Gotham.
 I
 have
 not
 really
 dug
 deep
 into


UiPath.
 I
 do
 know
 it's
 I
 mean
 I
 I'm


seeing
 through
 the
 stock
 it
 is
 breaking


out.
 Uh
 robot
 robotic
 processing


automation
 RPA
 is
 something
 I
 think
 AI


should
 be
 a
 tailwind
 for.
 I
 just
 don't


fully
 know
 if
 it's
 the
 most
 exciting
 AI


story.
 Even
 though
 the
 valuation
 is
 a


lot
 more
 compelling
 than
 some
 of the


other
 AI
 names.
 So
 I
 have
 to
 look
 into


it.
 I
 I
 will
 actually
 hit
 up
 Suchin.


Suchin
 I
 think
 was
 in
 the
 stock
 a
 year


ago.
 I
 don't know
 if
 he's
 still
 in
 it,


but
 I'll
 ask
 him
 and
 I'll
 try
 to
 get
 you


some
 thoughts
 from
 him
 and
 see
 if
 it's


worth
 uh
 worth
 looking
 into
 the
 stock


year
 to
 date
 on
 path.
 Yeah,
 it's
 up
 27%.


So,
 it
 has
 performed.
 QXO,
 Steve
 is


getting
 pretty
 bullish
 on
 QXO.
 I
 was


talking
 with
 him
 this
 morning
 and
 um
 you


know,
 ironically,
 I
 did
 a
 deep
 not
 a


deep
 dive,
 but
 we
 did
 a
 30-minute
 audio


show
 on
 uh
 on
 spaces
 of
 GXO,
 which
 was
 a


subsidiary
 and
 a
 spin-off
 of
 the
 other


company
 that
 Brad
 Jacob
 started.
 But


both
 of
 them
 in
 the
 log
 logistics


warehousing
 space.
 And
 so
 Steve
 is


getting
 a
 lot
 more
 excited
 about
 QXO.


So,
 I'll
 get
 him
 on
 the
 channel
 this


week
 and
 he
 can
 kind
 of
 lay
 out
 his


thesis
 for


why
 he's
 excited
 about
 this
 one
 as
 well.


Uh,
 Chris,
 thank
 you
 for
 the
 $10
 super


chat.
 Happy
 birthday,
 man.
 Thanks
 for


all
 that
 you
 do.
 You've
 given
 me
 faith


in
 investing
 into
 poundhood
 through
 your


DD
 on
 them
 and
 helping
 me
 understand


these
 companies
 more
 in
 depth.
 Chris,


appreciate
 you.
 It
 has
 been
 a
 wild,
 wild


journey
 with
 those
 two
 names
 and
 I
 think


a
 lot
 of
 people
 have
 found
 their
 own


journey
 on
 multiple
 names
 outside
 of


pounder
 and
 hood.
 Um,
 but
 it's
 been


incredible
 because
 those
 were
 the
 two
 OG


names
 that
 kind
 of
 started
 everything


for
 for
 this
 channel
 and
 for
 this


community.
 So,
 super
 super
 exciting
 as


we
 get
 into
 their
 earnings
 as
 well.
 K


Roger,
 thanks
 for
 the
 super
 chat.
 Okay,


this
 is
 important.
 I
 need
 to
 share
 this.


Thank
 you
 for
 reminding
 me
 about
 this.


So,
 your
 boy
 Jensen,
 look,
 Jensen
 has
 a


lot
 more
 money
 than
 me.
 Jensen
 is


obviously
 a
 lot
 more
 successful
 than
 me.


That
 doesn't
 mean
 that
 Jensen
 doesn't


jack
 my
 lines.
 Okay?
 That
 doesn't
 mean


that
 Jensen
 doesn't
 jack
 my
 freaking


line.
 So
 Jensen
 said
 in
 a
 interview
 over


the
 weekend,
 "Very
 few
 people
 know
 this,


but
 I
 don't
 wear
 a
 watch.
 And
 the
 reason


I
 don't
 wear
 a
 watch
 is
 because
 now
 is


the
 most
 important
 time.
 Just
 dedicate


yourself
 to
 now."


All
 I'm
 saying
 is
 if
 you
 go
 back
 to
 June


28th,


I
 don't
 know if
 Jensen
 follows
 me
 on
 X.


I
 don't
 know if
 he
 watches
 the
 streams.


I
 don't
 I
 don't
 know.
 But
 I
 said,
 I


don't
 wear
 a
 watch
 because
 the
 time
 is


always
 now.


So,
 you
 know,
 your
 boy
 might
 be
 getting


some
 inspiration
 from
 retail
 investors,


even
 if
 he's,
 you
 know,
 a
 big
 fancy
 CEO.


Nebas
 right
 there
 up
 5%
 in
 the
 overnight


markets.


But
 I
 think
 he
 stole
 my
 line.


I
 think
 he
 stole
 my
 line.


Okay,
 to
 be
 fully
 truthful,
 I
 kind
 of


stole
 Jensen's
 line
 because
 Jensen
 has


said
 this
 multiple
 times
 in
 the
 past.
 I


don't
 even
 know
 if
 I
 stole
 it
 from
 him


or
 if
 I
 heard
 from
 somewhere
 else,
 but


yeah,
 he
 he
 he
 this
 is
 not
 the
 first


time
 he
 said
 this,
 even
 though
 he
 said,


"Most
 people
 have
 never
 heard
 me
 say


this."
 He
 said
 this
 multiple
 times.
 So,


yeah,
 I
 think
 I
 probably
 stole
 it
 from


Jensen
 first.
 But


it's
 nice
 to
 to
 think
 that
 he
 stole
 from


you.
 He
 needs
 to
 steal
 his
 payroll.
 I


would
 love
 to
 steal
 Jensen
 Hang's


payroll.
 That
 would
 be
 nice.
 Mugabby,


thanks
 for
 the
 super
 chat.
 IN
 moved


their
 earnings
 closer
 about
 two
 weeks
 to


116.
 Uh
 that
 is
 usually
 great
 news.
 I'm


anxious,
 excited
 along
 with
 what
 is


currently
 happening.
 Yeah,
 I
 mean
 look,


IN
 is
 one
 of
 the
 the
 stocks
 in
 this


whole
 Bitcoin
 miner
 to
 GPU
 AI
 HPC


revolution
 that
 has
 like
 really
 shown


meaningful
 growth
 and
 obviously
 has
 the


GPUs
 and
 the
 the
 licensing
 facilities


based
 on
 the
 the
 amount
 of
 land
 that


they
 have
 or
 the
 land
 that
 they're


acquiring
 to
 execute.
 So
 I
 think
 for
 a


lot
 of
 these
 names,
 it's
 also
 just
 a


question
 of
 like
 look,
 if
 you're
 an
 Iran


from
 $10
 and
 it's
 at
 70,
 do
 you
 expect


it
 to
 go
 to
 100?
 Maybe
 if
 it
 doesn't
 go


to
 100
 and
 it
 stays
 stuck
 at
 like
 50
 to


70,
 are
 you
 that
 upset?
 Probably
 not.


But
 it's
 also
 like,
 do
 you
 think
 the


earnings
 are
 going
 to
 be
 that
 good?


Because
 I
 mean,
 remember
 I
 ran
 was
 15


last
 time
 on
 their
 earnings,
 got
 up
 to


28,
 sold
 off
 a
 bit,
 and
 then
 then
 it
 had


this
 run
 to
 67.
 You
 know,
 can
 that


continue?
 I
 don't
 know.
 But,
 uh,
 if
 you


are
 bullish
 on
 these
 names,
 whether
 it's


an
 Iran,
 a
 cipher,
 a
 bit
 farms,
 a
 big


bear
 AI,
 whatever
 it
 may
 be,
 you
 just


have
 to
 be
 confident
 that
 the
 company


can
 execute
 and
 that
 they
 deserve
 to


hold
 their
 prem.
 Same
 thing
 with
 Hood,


right?
 Hood's
 trading
 at
 a
 good
 premium.


Am
 I
 confident
 they're
 going
 to
 exit
 in


Q3?
 I
 believe
 so.
 And
 do
 I
 think
 that


premium
 needs
 to
 expand?
 I
 think
 it
 can.


If
 it
 doesn't,
 am
 I
 the
 angriest?
 Not


really,
 but
 I
 would
 hope
 it
 does.
 And
 if


you're
 in
 a
 bull
 market,
 you
 should


imagine
 those
 things
 do
 expand
 because


money's
 got
 to
 go
 somewhere


and
 it
 might
 end
 up
 going
 into
 those.


Yeah,
 Galaxy,
 I
 mean,
 they
 had
 a


phenomenal
 earnings
 as
 well.
 Now,
 they


sold
 off
 a
 bit
 from
 their
 earnings


because
 again,
 the
 stock
 is
 still
 up


more
 than
 150%
 this
 year,
 but
 they
 had
 a


great
 earnings.
 They
 crushed
 EPS
 by


200%.
 If
 an
 Iran
 or
 a
 cipher
 can
 do


something
 like
 that,
 you're
 probably


going
 to
 see
 additional
 premium
 getting


onto
 those
 names,


which
 is
 uh
 which
 is
 going
 to
 be
 fun
 for


a
 lot
 of
 those
 as
 well.
 Uh
 online


fitness
 coast,
 thank
 you
 for
 the
 super


chat.
 Appreciate
 it.
 Happy
 early


birthday,
 man.
 Thank
 you
 for
 all
 you
 do.


The
 hair
 looks
 amazing.
 Thank
 you.
 I


know
 the
 hair
 is
 very
 controversial.


This
 is
 not
 my
 uh
 official
 haircut
 or


hairstyle.
 I
 know
 this
 like
 looks
 like
 a


mustache
 on
 my
 forehead.
 I
 get
 it.
 But


it's
 just,
 you
 know,
 I
 said,
 "You
 know


what?
 We're
 gonna
 take
 the
 hat
 off


today.
 We're
 gonna
 take
 it
 off.


So,
 appreciate
 you.
 Thank
 you
 for
 being


here.
 Thank
 you for
 being
 part
 of
 the


channel.
 TJ
 Hawkins,
 thank
 you
 for


becoming
 a
 channel
 member
 as
 well.
 Uh,


Terren,
 thank
 you
 for
 the
 $100
 super


chat.
 You
 did
 not
 need
 to
 do
 that,
 but


deeply,
 deeply,
 deeply
 appreciate
 it.


Thank
 you
 for
 the
 $100
 super
 chat.


Again,
 guys,
 I
 said
 this
 a
 couple
 of


days
 ago,
 but
 can
 we
 just
 please
 not


send
 a
 ton
 of
 super
 chats
 tomorrow


saying
 happy
 birthday?
 Like,
 the
 fact


that
 you
 guys
 are
 even
 here,
 it
 it


really
 really
 means
 a
 lot.
 And
 I
 don't


want
 people
 to
 spend
 their
 money
 just
 to


say
 happy
 birthday.
 Like
 I
 appreciate
 so


deeply
 that
 people
 care,
 they
 consume,


they
 they
 watch
 the
 content.
 Uh
 we
 are


going
 to
 do
 a
 giveaway
 on
 Market
 Close.


We're
 going
 to
 give
 away
 some
 money.
 In


Indian
 culture,
 it's
 always
 nice
 to
 to


give
 when
 it's
 your
 birthday.
 So
 I
 do


want
 to
 to
 do
 a
 giveaway.
 But
 please,


please,
 please
 do
 not
 send
 money.
 Just


say
 happy
 birthday.
 I
 just
 care
 that


people
 are
 even
 here
 in
 the
 first
 place.


Dude,
 on
 that
 post
 I
 made
 on
 on
 Friday


that
 I
 couldn't
 make
 the
 show,
 I
 was


reading
 the
 comments
 yesterday.
 First
 of


all,
 the
 amount
 of
 comments
 that
 thought


that
 my
 throat
 was
 not
 working
 correctly


because
 of
 uh
 something
 else
 that
 had
 to


do
 with
 the
 company
 that
 potentially


went
 private
 or
 got
 an
 offer
 to
 go


private
 last
 week.
 That
 was
 hilarious.


Okay,
 number
 one,
 that
 was
 hilarious.


But
 number
 two,


the
 amount
 of
 love
 on
 that
 post
 of
 just


like,
 "Hey,
 like,


buddy,
 you're
 part
 of
 our
 routine.
 You


can't
 just
 uh
 you
 know,
 Friday
 alltime


highs.
 You
 can't
 just
 you
 can't
 just
 do


that.
 You
 can't
 just
 like
 I
 felt
 legit


bad,
 but
 I
 also
 slept
 through
 the
 market


close
 because
 after
 I
 pressed
 post
 on


that
 community
 post,
 I
 knocked
 out.
 I


woke
 up
 at
 like
 six
 o'clock
 and
 that's


when
 freaking
 I
 saw
 Steve
 and
 Matt
 and


all
 these
 guys
 were
 live
 and
 I
 was
 like,


"Oh,
 this
 is
 I
 was
 so
 happy
 they
 went


live."
 So
 that
 there
 was
 some
 market


close,
 but
 I
 woke
 up
 in
 the
 middle
 of


them
 going
 live
 and
 I
 didn't
 even
 know


what
 time
 it
 was.
 I
 was
 just
 so
 freaking


tired.
 Um,
 but
 it
 was
 it
 dude,
 it's
 it's


very
 very very
 very
 humbling.
 Uh,
 I
 was


talking
 to
 someone
 else
 this
 weekend


about
 it,
 but
 it
 really
 means
 a
 lot.
 um


the
 fact
 that
 people,
 you
 know,
 feel
 so


deeply
 about
 the
 content
 and
 um
 I
 am
 not


perfect.
 I
 don't
 tr
 try
 to
 be
 perfect,


but
 I
 try
 to
 give
 as
 many
 perspectives


as
 I
 can
 to
 the
 show
 to
 make
 it
 engaging


and
 entertaining
 and
 informative
 and


obviously
 funny
 every
 single
 day.
 You


know,
 that's
 that's
 that's
 that's
 that


goes
 without
 saying
 anything.
 But
 yeah,


I
 I
 I
 deeply
 appreciate
 how
 much
 people


care
 about
 the
 content.
 And
 you
 know,
 as


I'm
 getting
 older,
 as
 I
 as
 I
 as
 I
 turn


into
 an
 uncle,
 an
 enk,
 as
 the
 kids
 say,


uh,
 entering
 the
 28th
 year,
 you
 start
 to


sort
 of
 reflect
 on
 your
 life,
 right?
 And


what
 you've
 done?
 And
 I
 honestly,
 dude,


I
 don't
 think
 over
 the
 past
 three
 years,


I've
 had
 a
 moment
 to
 just
 sit
 and


reflect.
 A
 lot of
 people
 have
 asked


these
 questions
 like,
 "Have
 you


reflected
 on
 what's
 happened?"
 I
 mean,


my
 mom
 asked
 that
 over
 the
 weekend.
 Have


you
 just
 like
 sat
 down
 and
 thought
 about


what's
 happened
 over
 the
 past
 three


years?
 And
 uh
 honestly
 reading
 this


book,
 reading
 this
 book,
 uh
 it
 really


made
 me
 sit
 down
 and
 reflect
 because


it's
 I
 really
 do
 think
 people
 will
 enjoy


this
 book.
 It
 is
 a
 biography
 on
 Karp
 and


his
 life
 and
 what
 he
 stands
 for
 and
 how


he
 got
 to
 the
 point
 where
 he's
 at.
 And


it
 kind
 of
 made
 me
 reflect
 on
 my
 own


life,
 right?
 And
 uh
 you
 know,
 one
 of the


things
 I
 reflected
 on
 was
 that
 I've
 been


able
 to
 create
 this
 community
 via
 this


show
 and
 it
 means
 a
 lot
 to
 people
 every


single
 day.
 And
 I
 just
 want
 to
 be
 as


consistent
 as
 possible
 and
 make
 sure


that
 we
 take
 it
 to
 the
 next
 level,


whatever
 that
 may
 mean,
 and
 we
 keep
 it


going.


That's
 really
 important.
 Aid
 says
 6
 28


is
 the
 new
 68.
 Exactly.
 28
 is
 the
 new


68.


But
 I'm
 very,
 very,
 very,
 very
 grateful


every
 day
 for
 people
 that
 consume
 the


content.
 I
 want
 to
 continue
 to
 get


better,
 want
 to
 continue
 to
 get
 more


guests,
 want
 to
 continue
 to
 just
 make


the
 content
 more
 data
 driven.
 I
 think


one
 of the
 reasons
 the
 show
 works
 is


because
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 charts,
 a
 lot


of
 analysis.
 Shout
 out
 to
 our
 boy
 Cactus


Jack.
 He
 is
 making
 it
 a
 lot
 more
 easier


for
 me
 to
 do
 my
 job
 even
 though
 I
 just


made
 a
 grammatical
 mistake
 because
 you


can't
 say
 more
 and
 easier
 because
 more


already
 represents
 the
 eer
 on
 the
 easy


part.
 But
 nonetheless,
 I
 don't
 know
 how


to
 talk
 in
 the
 first
 place
 anyway.
 But


uh
 he's
 made
 it


uh


basically
 more
 productive
 for
 me
 to


actually
 get
 the
 job
 done
 every
 day.
 And


you
 know,
 I
 think
 we
 can
 do
 a
 lot
 more


stuff
 over
 the
 coming
 years
 to
 keep


making
 it
 good.


So
 there
 we
 go.
 I'm
 excited.
 I
 am


excited.
 Thank
 you
 everybody
 for
 being


here.
 Means
 a
 lot.
 I
 did
 not
 add
 to


Amcore.
 Last
 time
 I
 added
 to
 it
 was
 at


30.5.


So
 I
 think
 my
 average
 on
 it
 is
 30.7


something
 like
 that
 on
 Amcore.
 So
 we'll


see
 what
 they
 show
 up
 for
 earnings


tomorrow.
 But
 we
 got
 a
 lot
 of
 companies


that
 are
 putting
 up
 earnings
 and


it's
 gonna
 be
 a
 big
 week.


It's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 big
 big
 big
 week.
 We


all
 thought
 you
 were
 on
 a
 grinder
 day.


Yeah,
 I
 just
 went
 with
 it.
 I
 just


commented.
 I
 was
 like, "Yeah,
 the
 date


was
 great."
 I
 just
 like
 There
 was
 like


15.
 There
 was
 like
 80
 comments
 and
 then


15
 of
 them
 were
 like,
 "Oh,
 he
 was


obviously
 on
 a
 grinder
 date."
 I
 was


like, "You
 know what?
 Sure.
 Sure.
 That's


what
 everyone
 thinks."
 I
 was
 sleeping,


but
 everyone
 thinks
 I
 was
 on
 a
 grinder


date.
 Then
 that's
 what
 it
 was.
 Let's


wake
 up.


Calling
 out
 his
 mistake
 before
 we
 do.


He's
 evolving.
 Yes.
 Exactly.
 Exactly.


Siege,
 thank
 you,
 man,
 for
 the
 super


chat.
 I
 appreciate
 you,
 brother.
 You


don't
 have
 to
 send
 this,
 but
 thank
 you.


Thank
 you
 for
 the
 super
 chat.
 Means
 a


lot.
 Um,


and
 yeah,
 again,
 I
 I
 I
 just
 appreciate


everyone
 being
 here.
 I
 appreciate


everyone
 being
 here.
 So,
 uh,
 we'll
 be


back
 tomorrow
 on
 the
 market
 open.
 We'll


see
 what
 we
 can
 do.
 And
 I
 think
 it's


going
 to
 be
 a
 fun
 market
 open.
 If
 this


withstands,
 I
 don't
 think
 Trump
 says


anything
 that
 derails
 it.
 Trump
 is
 going


to
 be
 in
 South
 Korea,
 I
 think,
 in
 the


next
 couple
 days
 anyway.
 So,
 hopefully


we
 get
 some
 good
 negotiations
 with
 these


trade
 talks.
 Maybe
 we
 get a
 bit
 of
 a


sell-off
 tomorrow
 just
 because
 there's
 a


lot
 of
 price
 action
 baked
 in.
 I
 think


that's
 probably
 just
 eventually
 going
 to


be
 interpreted
 as
 a
 buy
 the
 dip
 if
 the


catalysts
 continue
 to
 remain
 how
 they


remain.
 And
 then
 this
 week's
 going
 to
 be


crazy,
 folks.
 We
 got
 a
 big
 show
 tomorrow


to
 preview
 everything
 we
 got
 going
 on.


Then
 Tuesday,
 we
 got
 SoFi.
 I
 think
 Steve


will
 be
 live
 with
 me
 Tuesday.
 Oh,
 we


have
 UNH
 on
 Tuesday
 as
 well.
 So
 SoFi,


UNH,
 PayPal
 in
 the
 morning.
 Those
 are


gonna
 be
 massive.
 And
 then
 Wednesday,
 I


don't
 even
 know
 how
 Wednesday
 is
 going


to
 play
 out,
 but
 you
 have
 the
 FOMC
 and


you
 have
 Meta,
 Microsoft
 Alphabet.
 I


think
 I
 might
 do
 a
 full
 day
 stream
 on


Wednesday.
 I
 think
 we
 might
 go
 a
 full
 10


hours
 on
 Wednesday.
 We
 haven't
 done
 that


since
 May.
 I
 think
 we
 might
 do
 that


and
 uh
 we'll
 keep
 going
 from
 there.
 So,


very
 excited.
 Very,
 very,
 very
 excited.


Are
 you
 going to
 cut
 a
 cake
 on
 live?
 I'm


not
 getting
 a
 cake.
 I
 went
 home
 for
 the


weekend,
 so
 I'm
 not
 even
 going
 to
 see
 my


parents
 tomorrow.
 I
 saw
 them
 over
 the


weekend.
 We
 had
 a
 dinner,
 so
 we
 uh
 we


celebrated
 the
 birthday
 a
 day
 early
 and


Yeah.
 Again,
 like
 I'm
 just
 not


interested
 in
 doing
 anything
 crazy
 for


my
 birthday,
 like
 going
 to
 Vegas.
 I


thought
 I
 went,
 but
 like
 there
 was
 so


much
 traveling
 for
 the
 first
 nine
 months


of
 the
 year.
 I
 am
 just
 happy
 to
 be
 at


home
 and
 chill.
 So
 yeah,
 I'm
 really


happy
 to
 just
 spend
 the
 birthday
 at


home,
 working,
 spending
 with
 you
 guys
 on


the
 clothes
 and


keep
 going
 from
 there.
 Keep
 going
 from


there.
 Another
 year.
 Another
 year
 on


planet
 Earth.
 Uh
 Nuta,
 thank
 you
 for
 the


super
 chat.
 Watch
 your
 channel
 every


day.
 Thank
 you,
 Mitt.
 Thank
 you
 for


being
 here.
 Thank
 you
 all
 for
 being
 here


again
 every
 single
 day.
 It
 truly
 truly


means
 the
 world.
 It
 is
 the
 most
 blessed


position
 I
 could
 ever
 imagine
 myself


being
 in.
 Part
 of
 this
 book
 uh
 about


Karp
 is
 just
 the
 the
 crazy
 parts
 of
 his


life
 that
 got
 him
 to
 he
 joined
 Pounder


at
 34
 years
 old.
 He
 had
 already
 lived
 34


years
 doing
 tons
 and
 tons
 of
 crazy


stuff.
 He
 you
 know
 there's
 a
 part
 of
 the


book
 where
 it
 says
 he
 wanted
 to
 make


$250,000


and
 then
 go
 to
 Germany


and
 basically
 just
 live
 the
 rest
 of
 his


life.
 thought
 he
 only
 needed
 250,000


saved
 in
 a
 nest
 egg
 that
 and
 then
 he


could
 just
 go
 off
 and
 you
 know
 go
 do


whatever
 the
 hell
 he
 wanted
 and
 live
 his


life
 and
 he
 ended
 up
 being
 the
 CEO
 of
 a


company
 worth
 400
 billion.
 I
 mean
 it's


just
 crazy
 where
 life
 goes
 sometimes
 but


um
 just
 unbelievably
 grateful
 for
 the


people
 that
 have
 chosen
 to
 be
 part
 of


this
 journey
 and
 have
 been
 here
 for
 the


past
 couple
 years.
 All
 right,
 that's
 it.


Thank
 everybody.
 I
 will
 send
 you
 all
 if


you
 would
 like
 to
 go
 to
 Steve's
 stream.


He
 is
 live
 right
 now.
 Uh
 talking


alternative
 assets.


We
 already
 know
 what
 to
 do.
 CRN
 spam

the
 chat
 for
 those
 that
 want
 to
 be


there.
 I'll
 be

 Monday
 morning.


Got
 a
 lot
 to
 talk
 about
 tomorrow.
 A
 lot


to
 get
 into.
 Hopefully
 we
 get
 some
 more


updates
 on
 China.
 We
 got
 earnings
 this


week.
 And
 let's
 see
 if
 we
 can
 keep
 going


for
 these
 alltime
 highs
 and
 keep
 this


going
 from
 here.


Thank
 you
 everybody.
 Deeply
 appreciate


you
 all.
 I
 will
 see
 you
 guys

morning,
 Monday,

 then
 on
 the

 little
 bit
 of
 a
 fun
 birthday

 So,
 thank

 Good
