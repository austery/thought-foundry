So
 ultimately,
 fundamentally,
 I
 am
 a


hardware
 person.
 There's
 like
 screws


flowing
 through
 my
 blood
 or
 something
 in


there
 somewhere.
 My
 parents
 would


occasionally
 complain
 when
 I
 would
 take


stuff
 apart
 in
 the
 house,
 but
 usually
 I


was
 able
 to
 successfully
 put
 it
 back


together,
 so
 it
 ended
 up
 being
 okay.
 I


want
 to
 build
 the
 best
 laptop.
 I
 want
 to


build
 a
 laptop
 company.
 framework
 is
 a


company
 that
 builds
 longerlasting


consumer
 electronics
 products
 so
 that
 if


anything
 ever
 happens
 to
 the
 product,


something
 breaks
 or
 you
 just
 need
 more


out
 of
 it,
 more
 performance
 or
 more


capability,
 you
 can
 actually
 just
 open


it
 up
 very
 easily
 using
 the
 screwdriver


that
 we
 include
 in
 the


box,
 swap
 out
 a
 part
 and
 keep
 using
 it


for
 longer.
 growing
 more
 than
 double


revenue
 year-over-year
 for
 the
 last


couple
 of
 years,
 which
 is
 pretty
 unusual


for
 a
 consumer
 electronics
 startup,


especially
 in
 a
 pretty
 tough


environment.
 Fundamentally,
 the
 mission


is
 about
 empowering
 the
 enduser
 of
 the


product,
 making
 it
 clear
 that
 this
 is


their
 product,
 not
 our
 product.
 One
 of


the
 problems
 that
 I
 thought
 was
 most


important
 to
 solve
 was
 just
 how
 hard
 it


was
 for
 consumer
 electronics
 startups
 to


be
 successful.
 But
 looking
 across


consumer
 electronics
 across
 the
 entire


startup
 space,
 it
 was
 clear
 that
 there


were
 a
 number
 of
 companies
 that
 had


really
 interesting
 and
 really
 excellent


products
 but
 failed.
 Anyway,
 the
 thing
 I


needed
 to
 do
 is
 prove
 that
 there's
 a


better
 business
 model
 for
 consumer


electronics.
 One
 of
 the
 secrets
 to


building
 a
 successful
 startup
 is
 that


the
 CEO
 needs
 to


be
 in
 school
 and
 actually
 I
 graduated


from
 university
 in
 2009.
 That
 was
 a


period
 of
 great
 economic
 uncertainty.
 it


was
 uh
 the
 start
 of
 a
 pretty
 heavy


recession
 and
 so
 actually
 there
 weren't


a
 lot
 of
 jobs
 available
 and
 there
 was


not
 a
 single
 hardware
 company
 hiring.
 Um


but
 it
 turned
 out
 that
 Apple
 in
 one
 of


their
 software
 organizations
 did
 have


this
 role
 open
 that
 I
 was
 able
 to
 jump


into
 right
 out
 of
 school.
 And
 so
 I
 ended


up
 at
 Apple
 for
 a
 little
 over
 3
 years


working
 on
 software
 of
 all
 things.
 Apple


had
 just
 released
 the
 iPhone
 3GS.
 This


was
 like
 right
 still
 at
 the
 dawn
 of


smartphones
 becoming
 the
 default
 mode
 of


interaction
 and
 actually
 kind
 of
 the


default
 mode
 of
 computing.
 So
 I
 was


working
 on
 FaceTime
 and
 uh
 Game
 Kit
 and


Game
 Center
 which
 was
 this
 kind
 of


multiplayer
 games
 framework
 that
 Apple


was
 developing
 from
 a
 software


perspective.
 And
 mostly
 what
 that


experience
 taught
 me
 was
 that
 I
 didn't


really
 want
 to
 work
 in
 a
 company
 like


Apple.
 Um
 one
 of
 the
 challenges
 at
 Apple


is
 that
 it
 is
 a
 very
 very
 siloed


company.
 as
 an
 engineer
 there,
 it
 was


actually
 quite
 frustrating
 that
 I
 would


see
 all
 this
 cool
 hardware
 or
 see
 all


this
 cool
 software
 but
 have
 no
 real


ability
 to
 either
 influence
 or
 even


understand
 or
 speak
 to
 the
 people
 who


were
 building
 it.
 So
 I
 was
 working
 a


relatively
 normal
 number
 of
 hours
 a


week.
 So
 like
 say
 like
 40
 to
 50
 hours
 a


week,
 a
 normal
 number
 of
 hours.
 And
 I


would
 spend
 another
 40
 to
 50
 hours
 a


week
 actually
 tinkering
 on
 mostly
 VR


stuff.
 And
 this
 was
 before
 VR
 was
 like


actually
 really
 a
 thing.
 building
 these


little
 gadgets
 and
 tools
 and
 toys
 to


basically
 just
 see
 what
 was
 even


possible
 and
 doing
 it
 within
 a
 community


of
 other
 people
 who
 were
 like-minded.


And
 so
 one
 of
 the
 other
 people
 in
 that


community
 was
 probably
 the
 farthest


along
 in
 that
 community
 was
 someone


named
 Palmer
 Lucky
 who
 of
 course
 ended


up
 founding
 Oculus.
 My
 name
 is
 Palmer


Lucky
 and
 I'm
 a
 virtual
 reality


enthusiast
 and
 the
 designer
 of
 the
 Rift.


Where
 this
 all
 started
 was
 in
 my


parents'
 garage
 in
 Long
 Beach,


California.
 And
 I
 was
 interested
 in


stereoscopic
 displays.
 I
 was
 interested


in
 headmounts.
 And
 the
 problem
 was
 there


was
 nothing
 that
 gave
 me
 the
 experience


that
 I
 wanted,
 the
 Matrix,
 where
 I
 can


plug
 in
 and
 actually
 be
 in
 the
 game.
 And


I
 was
 sure
 that
 somewhere
 out
 there


there
 was
 something
 that
 I
 could
 buy.


And
 the
 reality
 is
 there's
 nothing.
 I


set
 out
 to
 change
 that
 with
 the
 Oculus


Rift.


And
 at
 the
 time
 that
 he
 founded
 Oculus


back
 in
 2012,
 there
 was
 just
 one
 piece


of
 the
 headset
 that
 was
 missing,
 which


was
 motion
 tracking.
 And
 motion
 tracking


happened
 to
 be
 the
 one
 gadget
 that
 I
 was


personally
 the
 furthest
 along
 on.
 And
 I


had
 sent
 one
 of
 two
 prototypes
 of
 motion


track
 that
 I'd
 built
 to
 Palmer
 a
 few


months
 earlier
 just
 to
 get
 his
 thoughts


on
 it
 and
 see
 see
 if
 it
 would
 be
 useful


to
 him.
 And
 so
 in
 mid
 2012,
 Palmer


reached
 out
 to
 me
 and
 asked
 if
 I
 wanted


a
 demo
 of
 this
 VR
 headset
 that
 he'd
 been


building
 up
 and
 said,
 "Of
 course,
 of


course
 I
 want
 a
 demo
 of
 it."
 And
 I
 ended


up
 meeting
 with
 him
 and
 the
 rest
 of
 the


early
 team,
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 founding


team
 there.
 And
 what
 I
 thought
 was
 going


to
 be
 a
 demo
 turned
 into
 a
 job
 offer.


And
 they
 said,
 "Uh,
 you
 have
 to
 leave


Apple
 and
 join
 us
 within
 a
 week
 cuz
 we


really
 need
 your
 motion
 tracker."
 And


that
 was
 just
 an
 very
 obvious
 choice
 for


me
 of
 like,
 yeah,
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 be
 at


Apple.
 I
 want
 to
 be
 working
 on
 this
 cool


stuff
 here.
 VR,
 let's
 do
 it.
 But


actually,
 the
 move
 from
 Apple
 to
 Oculus


was
 a
 bit
 more
 a
 bit
 more
 of
 a
 jump


because
 at
 that
 point,
 of
 course,
 Apple


was
 on
 its
 very
 rapid
 growth
 trajectory


and
 to
 leave
 that
 very
 rapidly
 growing


company
 and
 join
 this
 scrappy
 startup
 of


people
 trying
 to
 build
 VR
 on
 on
 its


surface
 seemed
 crazy.
 And
 I
 think
 my


parents
 at
 first
 were
 like,
 "Oh,
 are
 you


sure?
 This
 doesn't
 seem
 like
 a
 good


idea."
 Um,
 but
 I
 was
 convinced.
 I
 I
 knew


that
 that
 it
 was
 the
 right
 team
 of


people.
 I
 knew
 it
 was
 the
 right


technology
 space
 to
 explore
 at
 that
 time


and
 of
 course
 ended
 up
 being
 a
 good
 bet


to
 have


taken.

The
 first
 two
 years
 of
 Oculus.
 So
 from


2012
 until
 we
 got
 acquired
 in
 2014,


literally
 every
 month
 was
 some
 new


insane
 occurrence
 and
 insane
 change,


insane
 learning.
 Like
 the
 pace
 of


iteration
 that
 we
 had
 across
 those
 two


years,
 I
 look
 back
 on
 and
 think
 like
 how


did
 we
 even
 do
 that?
 A
 normal
 hardware


product,
 a
 consumer
 hardware
 product,
 it


takes
 somewhere
 between
 12
 to
 24
 months


to
 go
 from
 initial
 idea
 of
 like,
 oh,


this
 is
 a
 product
 I
 think
 I
 want
 to


build
 to
 being
 able
 to
 do
 development


cycles
 on
 it,
 ramp
 up
 production,
 and


getting
 it
 into
 a
 customer's
 hands.
 the


Oculus
 Rift
 dev
 kit,
 the
 first
 dev
 kit,


we
 went
 from
 the
 company
 forming
 to


getting
 it
 into
 customers
 hands
 I
 think


in
 six
 months,
 which
 is
 not
 not
 normal.


That's
 not
 how
 you
 build
 build
 hardware


normally.
 Working
 with
 devs
 to
 get
 all


this
 going.
 There's
 some
 really


incredible
 and
 interesting
 stories


around
 that.
 But
 that's
 not
 what
 this


talk
 is
 about.
 This
 talk
 is
 only
 about


the
 hardware
 side
 of
 the
 story.
 We


decided
 to
 take
 a
 different
 optimization


and
 optimize
 for
 getting
 the
 virtual


reality
 ecosystem
 seated
 as
 quickly
 as


possible
 for
 the
 sake
 of
 figuring
 out


what
 is
 VR,
 what
 works
 and
 what
 doesn't


work
 in
 VR.
 And
 for
 that
 we
 needed
 help


from
 all
 of
 you
 which
 required
 us
 to


take
 the
 risk
 and
 build
 a
 product
 really


really


quickly.
 And
 one
 of
 the
 challenging


things
 here,
 one
 of
 the
 the
 biggest
 like


mistakes
 maybe
 that
 we
 made
 is
 that


obviously
 we
 were
 a
 startup.
 We're
 on
 a


shoestring
 budget.
 We
 were
 being


incredibly
 efficient.
 We're
 going
 as


fast
 as
 we
 can
 because
 we
 knew
 we
 needed


to
 make
 progress
 before
 running
 out
 of


money
 basically.
 And
 as
 soon
 as
 we
 got


acquired
 by
 Facebook
 2
 years
 in,
 we
 had


effectively
 unlimited
 money
 and


unlimited
 resource
 and
 we
 could
 hire


literally
 as
 many
 people
 as
 we
 wanted


to.
 There
 were
 actually
 no
 limits
 aside


from
 how
 quickly
 we
 could
 physically


onboard
 people
 to
 how
 quickly
 we
 could


hire.
 It
 actually
 slowed
 us
 down.
 It


slowed
 us
 to
 a
 total
 halt.
 basically


went
 from
 iterating
 on
 a
 new
 version
 of


VR
 headsets
 essentially
 every
 few
 months


to
 not
 being
 able
 to
 ship
 another


product
 for
 about
 3
 years.
 And
 so
 we


lost
 the
 massive
 iteration
 velocity
 that


we
 had.
 And
 it
 meant
 that
 that


three-year
 bet
 instead
 of
 the
 six-month


bet
 had
 to
 be
 so
 perfectly
 right


otherwise
 the
 opportunity
 cost
 of


missing
 those
 three
 years
 would
 end
 up


destroying
 us.
 And
 we
 kind
 of
 got
 it
 a


little
 bit
 right,
 maybe
 not
 as
 right
 as


we
 needed
 to,
 but
 looking
 back
 on
 it


now,
 those
 early
 years
 in
 Facebook,
 what


we
 really
 needed
 to
 be
 focused
 on
 was


iteration
 speed,
 not
 trying
 to
 build
 a


big
 team
 and
 build
 a
 big
 consumer


polished
 product.
 And
 so
 that's
 what


brought
 me
 to
 then
 start
 up
 framework


and
 then
 build
 an
 even
 more
 incredible


team,
 but
 a
 very
 small
 focused
 team


where
 we
 have
 this
 clear
 mission,
 clear


vision,
 clear
 roadmap
 that
 we're
 able
 to


execute
 on.


One
 of the
 things
 that
 works
 really
 well


for
 us
 is
 that
 the
 market
 that
 we're


entering,
 the
 categories
 that
 we're


entering
 in
 each
 of
 our
 products,


they're
 just
 colossal.
 So
 for
 us,
 we


look
 at
 $200
 billion
 notebook
 market
 and


we
 see
 massive,
 massive
 headroom
 to


continue
 to
 grow
 and
 succeed
 in
 this


business
 model
 that's
 focused
 on


longevity.
 It
 actually
 means
 that
 the


more
 we
 grow
 as
 a
 company,
 the
 more


market
 share
 we
 capture,
 we're
 actually


shrinking
 the
 size
 of
 the
 notebook


industry
 because
 we're
 going
 from
 a
 mode


where
 consumers
 and
 businesses
 are


defaulting
 to
 replacing
 a
 product,
 let's


say,
 every
 3
 to
 5
 years
 to
 a
 mode
 where


they're
 using
 the
 products
 for
 longer.


And
 so
 that's
 actually
 a
 win
 condition


for
 us
 that
 we're
 converting
 an
 industry


from
 one
 that
 is
 shorter
 lived
 to
 one


that's
 more
 efficient
 and
 longer
 lived.


And
 as
 a
 startup,
 of
 course,
 we
 have
 an


immense
 amount
 of
 headroom
 and
 a
 ceiling


that's
 very
 very
 far
 away
 that
 we
 can


continue
 to
 grow
 within.
 But
 even
 as
 we


capture
 more
 and
 more
 of
 that
 pie,
 that


doesn't
 mean
 that
 we
 would
 need
 to
 then


change
 our
 business
 model
 to
 go
 back


into
 that
 transactional
 model
 that
 other


companies
 are
 taking
 today.
 It
 means


that
 we've
 grown
 in
 an
 install
 base


that's
 large
 enough
 that
 this
 network


effects
 based
 re-engagementbased


business
 is
 a
 massive
 business
 in


itself.
 And
 of
 course,
 as
 a
 company,


we're
 not
 only
 limiting
 ourselves
 to


notebooks.
 It's
 that
 we're
 taking
 the


success
 that
 we've
 had
 with
 notebooks


and
 bringing
 that
 category
 by
 category


across
 this
 just
 huge
 consumer


electronics


industry.
 You're
 really
 thinking
 about


the
 audiences
 that
 you're
 going
 after.


We
 actually
 have
 this
 concept
 that
 we


call
 terminal
 audiences.
 this
 idea
 that


we
 enter
 a
 new
 product
 category
 and
 we


lock
 in
 an
 industrial
 design
 and
 a
 form


factor
 and
 set
 of
 features
 that
 we're


defining
 both
 the
 initial
 set
 of


audiences
 that
 we
 can
 win
 with
 most


efficiently
 but
 then
 also
 the
 terminal


audience
 basically
 the
 broadest
 furthest


away
 audience
 we
 think
 we
 could
 still


win
 with
 this
 product
 and
 we
 make
 sure


that
 we
 know
 what
 those
 bounds
 are
 when


we
 reach
 and
 build
 new
 products
 for


example
 a
 framework
 laptop
 12
 that
 gives


us
 a
 moment
 of
 reset
 of
 this
 is
 is
 a
 new


category.
 We're
 renting
 a
 new
 segment.


We
 have
 to
 figure
 out
 now
 who
 are
 our


initial
 audiences
 for
 this
 product
 which


actually
 start
 from
 the
 same
 core


audiences
 as
 our
 other
 products.
 But


then
 who
 are
 the
 terminal
 audiences?
 And


one
 thing
 we
 were
 deliberate
 on
 with


this
 new
 product
 is
 we
 made
 it
 simpler.


We
 made
 it
 much
 much
 lower
 cost
 and
 we


made
 it
 more
 generally
 appealing
 to


people
 who
 are
 not
 necessarily
 tech


enthusiasts.
 And
 so
 as
 we
 think
 about


this
 product,
 the
 core
 tech
 enthusiast


is
 still
 there
 as
 an
 initial
 audience,


but
 our
 terminal
 audience
 is
 a
 lot


bigger
 and
 a
 lot
 further


away.
 Audience
 expansion
 is
 definitely


the
 key
 to
 success
 in
 consumer
 startups


in
 general.
 We
 have
 a
 set
 of
 core


audiences
 that
 we
 kind
 of
 layer
 outwards


on
 top
 of
 one
 by
 one
 as
 we
 go.
 And
 of


course
 like
 it's
 easy
 to
 come
 up
 with


personas
 like
 define
 these
 discrete


personas
 of
 like
 DIYer
 and
 we
 have
 Linux


user
 and
 we
 have
 like
 IT
 manager
 and
 we


have
 environmentally
 conscious
 consumer.


We
 have
 these
 very
 clear
 personas.
 But


obviously
 in
 real
 life
 people
 are
 more


complex
 than
 that.
 Like
 everyone
 is
 some


combination
 of
 a
 million
 different


things.
 And
 so
 it's
 not
 that
 we


necessarily
 have
 this
 like
 clear
 set
 of


like
 layers
 where
 it's
 like
 a
 discrete


layer,
 discreet
 layer,
 discreet
 layer.


It's
 that
 we're
 slowly
 growing
 the
 reach


and
 awareness
 and
 credibility
 of
 what


we're
 doing
 as
 we
 go
 and
 then
 pulling
 in


those
 people
 whose
 personas
 match
 to
 the


things
 that
 we're
 delivering
 value
 or


interest
 around.
 So
 we
 took
 that
 tech


enthusiast
 gamer
 persona
 and
 the
 various


subpersonas
 within
 it
 and
 thought
 like,


okay,
 how
 do
 we
 win
 that
 audience?
 And


we
 thought
 they
 want
 latest
 and
 greatest


graphics.
 Like
 graphics
 upgradability
 is


huge
 for
 the
 audience
 and
 they
 just


can't
 get
 it
 out
 of
 a
 laptop.
 And
 so
 we


thought,
 okay,
 when
 we
 build
 our
 next


laptop
 form
 factor,
 the
 thing
 we
 should


prioritize
 is
 graphics
 upgradability
 so


we
 can
 go
 win
 that
 audience.
 And
 so
 this


goes
 back
 to
 fulfilling
 our
 mission.
 We


have
 this
 long
 lasting
 repairable


upgradeable
 product
 but
 doing
 it
 in
 a


way
 that
 also
 expands
 our
 audience
 reach


by
 being
 not
 just
 a
 new
 version
 of
 our


laptop
 in
 a
 different
 form
 factor
 but


enables
 this
 functionality
 that
 is


actually
 the
 key
 thing
 that
 was
 holding


back
 a
 specific
 set
 of
 consumers
 out


there
 in
 the
 world.


One
 of
 the
 biggest
 things
 that
 I've


learned
 actually
 and
 I've
 actually
 tried


to
 share
 with
 other
 people
 starting


consumer
 hardware
 startups
 is
 that


critical
 fundraising
 roadmap.
 And
 of


course,
 if
 you're
 building
 hardware,


there's
 typically
 a
 2-year
 ramp
 from


coming
 up
 with
 the
 product
 you
 want
 to


build
 to
 being
 able
 to
 ship
 the
 first


version
 of
 it
 and
 collect
 revenue
 for


the
 first
 time.
 If
 you
 can't
 fund
 your


way
 to
 escape
 velocity,
 you're
 going
 to


fail
 anyway.
 So,
 what
 you
 need
 to
 do
 is


think
 through
 what
 is
 that
 path?
 What's


the
 high
 assurance
 path
 that
 you
 have
 as


a
 company
 with
 the
 product
 and
 business


model
 you're
 building
 and
 the
 audiences


that
 you're
 going
 after
 to
 reach
 escape


velocity?
 Meaning
 the
 point
 in
 time


where
 you're
 able
 to
 self-fund
 your
 own


product
 roadmap
 and
 your
 own
 growth.
 And


so
 one
 of the
 most
 important
 things
 for


consumer
 hardware
 especially
 because


those
 development
 timelines
 are
 so
 long


is
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 you
 have
 funding
 in


the
 loop
 almost
 this
 idea
 that
 you're


talking
 to
 investors
 very
 early
 and
 very


regularly
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 at
 the
 right


points
 in
 time
 when
 you're
 going
 to
 need


funding
 that
 you're
 going
 to
 be
 able
 to


show
 the
 right
 kinds
 of
 traction
 and
 the


right
 kinds
 of
 metrics
 for
 those


investors
 to
 see
 the
 signals
 that


they'll
 need
 to
 see
 to
 be
 able
 to
 put


funding
 into
 you.
 that
 even
 though
 we


have
 a
 product
 time
 horizon
 that's
 two


years
 away,
 we
 have
 a
 vision
 time


horizon
 that's
 20
 years
 away,
 that
 we
 we


look
 out
 20
 years
 and
 we
 see
 a
 world
 and


a
 consumer
 electronics
 industry
 that's


fundamentally
 different.
 That
 this


business
 model
 that
 we've
 adopted
 at


scale
 is
 just
 so
 fundamentally
 more


efficient
 than
 the
 traditional
 business


model
 and
 so
 much
 better
 as
 a
 model
 for


both
 us
 as
 a
 company
 and
 for
 the


customers
 buying
 the
 product
 that
 we


know
 it's
 a
 winning
 model.
 And
 so
 we
 see


that
 as
 this
 north
 star
 for
 us
 that
 we


continuously
 move
 ourselves
 towards
 as


we
 go
 down
 this
 road


map.
 The
 key
 lesson
 is
 don't
 give
 up.


That
 resiliency
 is
 the
 single
 most


important
 trait
 and
 you're
 going
 to
 have


to
 pull
 rabbits
 out
 of
 hats
 over
 and


over
 again
 in
 a
 startup.
 And
 as
 long
 as


you
 are
 still
 willing
 to
 reach
 your
 hand


into
 the
 hat
 and
 find
 another
 rabbit,


you
 should
 keep
 going.
