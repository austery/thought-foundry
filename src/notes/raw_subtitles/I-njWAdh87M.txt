Hi,
 great
 to
 have
 you
 here
 today,
 Aduna.


As
 the
 CEO
 of
 NASDAQ,
 you
 must
 have
 some


really,
 really
 unique
 insights
 into


companies.
 No
 pressure.
 No,
 it's
 great


to
 be
 here.
 So,
 we've
 just
 heard
 about


what
 makes
 the
 best
 companies.
 So,
 do


you
 want
 to
 start
 by
 telling
 us
 what


makes
 NASDAQ
 great
 company?
 Well,
 thank


you
 for
 that.
 Um,
 so,
 well,
 I
 always


think
 about
 it
 from
 the
 eyes
 of
 the


investor
 and
 of
 course
 that
 ultimately


res,
 you
 know,
 results
 in
 the
 financial


performance
 of
 the
 company.
 So
 just
 a


quick
 recap
 of
 our
 finances
 over
 the


last
 year.
 So
 we've
 grown
 about
 10%
 in


the
 last
 year.
 We
 have
 a
 57%
 IBIDA


margin.
 So
 that
 if
 we
 were
 a
 SAS


company,
 we'd
 be
 a
 rule
 of
 67,
 which
 is


pretty
 good.
 And
 102%
 cash
 flow


conversion
 in
 our
 business.
 So
 it's
 a


very
 cash
 flow
 generative
 business.
 And


all
 of
 that,
 I
 think,
 allows
 um
 us
 to


have
 the
 latitude
 to
 continue
 to
 grow


and
 expand
 the
 business
 because
 we're


delivering
 great
 performance.
 But
 when


we
 say,
 well,
 what
 really
 underpins


that?
 like
 what
 results
 what
 how
 do
 we


drive
 those
 kind
 of
 results?
 The
 first


thing
 is
 that
 we
 really
 focus
 on
 having


a
 very
 very
 strong
 northstar
 that
 really


guides
 all
 of
 our
 strategic
 decision-m


and
 our
 northstar
 is
 our
 purpose
 really


which
 is
 quite
 big
 and
 broad
 is
 to


empower
 economic
 progress
 around
 the


world
 which
 is
 a
 very
 big
 and
 broad
 a


broad
 purpose
 but
 our
 northstar
 is
 our


vision
 and
 our
 vision
 is
 to
 be
 the


trusted
 fabric
 to
 the
 world's
 financial


system
 and
 when
 we
 talk
 about
 that
 we


look
 at
 that
 really
 through
 the
 lens
 of


technology
 how
 do
 we
 make
 sure
 that
 our


markets
 are
 as
 technologically
 advanced


as
 possible.
 How
 do
 we
 provide
 leading


software
 that
 really
 allows
 for
 us
 to


help
 the
 the
 industry
 manage
 risk
 and


really
 maximize
 our
 opportunity
 in
 the


markets
 along
 three
 key
 vectors
 of


liquidity,
 transparency,
 and
 integrity?


And
 then
 how
 do
 we
 also
 make
 sure
 that


inside
 the
 company
 um
 we're
 we're


staying
 humble
 and
 confident
 at
 the
 same


time.
 So
 we
 talk
 a
 lot
 about
 that
 kind


of
 what
 we
 call
 humble
 confidence
 or
 I


think
 it's
 it's
 important
 to
 recognize


that
 there's
 so
 much
 to
 learn
 all
 the


time.
 The
 minute
 a
 company
 becomes


complacent
 is
 the
 minute
 they
 begin
 to


decline.
 And
 it's
 particularly
 in
 this


world
 of
 technological
 transformation


that
 is
 changing
 really
 every
 industry


every
 part
 of
 what
 we
 can
 be.
 We
 can
 use


technology
 differently
 to
 drive
 our


business
 forward.
 You
 have
 to
 be
 a


constant
 learner.
 You
 have
 to
 make
 sure


that
 you're
 always
 bringing
 new


capabilities
 into
 your
 organization
 and


you're
 pushing
 to
 be
 better
 all
 the


time.
 And
 I
 think
 that
 with
 that


northstar
 and
 that
 humble
 confidence,
 I


think
 that's
 really
 what
 we
 see
 as
 being


the
 underpinnings
 of
 what
 what
 we're


trying
 to
 achieve
 as
 a
 great
 company.


Yeah.
 And
 the
 point
 about
 learning
 is


really
 important.
 And
 you've
 learned
 a


lot.
 You've
 been
 in
 NASDAQ
 for
 a
 long


time.
 You
 started
 as
 an
 intern
 back
 in


the
 days
 and
 you've
 had
 a
 quite
 a


remarkable
 journey
 to
 CEO.
 So
 can
 you


tell
 us
 what
 learnings
 have
 you
 made


along
 the
 way
 and
 uh
 how
 has
 NASDAQ


transformed
 under
 your
 leadership?
 Well,


NASDAQ
 really
 was
 quite
 different
 when
 I


started
 32
 years
 ago.
 So
 um
 and
 you
 were


kind
 not
 to
 tell
 people
 how
 long
 that


would
 been.
 Uh
 um
 but
 yeah,
 I
 I
 did


start
 in
 the
 trading
 division
 at
 NASDAQ


and
 at
 the
 time,
 you
 know,
 we
 were
 of


course
 then
 a
 a
 great
 market,
 but
 we


were
 still
 really
 a
 very
 young
 company


trying
 to
 figure
 out
 how
 to
 be
 a


commercial
 enterprise,
 how
 to
 drive


markets
 forward
 in
 a
 different
 way.
 And


we've
 been
 on
 a
 journey
 now
 for
 for
 that


entire
 period
 of
 time
 to
 really
 try
 to


transform
 our
 business
 and
 to
 have
 a


bigger
 impact
 in
 the
 industry.
 So
 we've


gone
 from
 being
 a
 really
 transformative


market
 operator
 within
 the
 United
 States


um
 to
 growing
 and
 expanding
 into


multiple
 asset
 classes
 with
 equities
 and


options
 in
 the
 US
 expanding
 into
 Europe


and
 we'll
 talk
 about
 that.
 We
 own
 and


operate
 most
 of
 the
 exchanges
 in
 the


Nordics
 with
 the
 exception
 of
 Ozor.
 Um


so
 we
 we
 are
 um
 a
 very
 scale
 player
 here


in
 Europe
 and
 then
 we've
 really
 expanded


to
 um
 go
 into
 the
 software
 business
 and


it
 started
 actually
 with
 the
 acquisition


of
 OMX
 which
 was
 the
 Nordic
 operator


where
 they
 had
 um
 a
 market
 technology


business
 within
 their
 organization
 and


it
 was
 kind
 of
 this
 hidden
 gem
 but
 it


really
 what
 it
 did
 was
 it
 globalized
 the


business
 and
 the
 impact
 that
 the
 company


had
 on
 markets
 around
 the
 world.
 So


today
 we
 provide
 technology
 to
 135


markets
 around
 the
 world.
 We
 provide


technology
 to
 3,600
 banks
 and
 brokerage


firms
 around
 the
 world
 in
 all
 of
 their


key
 vectors
 of
 of
 risk
 management
 and


trade
 operations.
 And
 so
 with
 that,
 I


think
 we've
 become
 a
 much
 more
 scaled


business,
 a
 bigger
 partner
 to
 the


clients.
 And
 it's
 interesting
 because
 by


helping
 them
 maximize
 liquidity,
 helping


them
 maximize
 the
 transparency
 within


the
 system
 and
 the
 integrity
 of
 the


system,
 that
 really
 occurs
 to
 the


benefit
 of
 markets.
 And
 so
 it
 kind
 of


comes
 full
 circle
 back
 into
 us
 being
 um


even
 more
 equipped
 to
 be
 a
 great
 market


operator.
 I
 think
 you're
 touching
 a
 bit


on
 that,
 but
 NASDAQ,
 well,
 I
 think
 most


most
 people
 still
 think
 of
 NASDAQ
 as


mostly
 an
 exchange,
 but
 you
 do
 much
 more


than
 that.
 and
 uh
 you're
 for
 example


very
 involved
 in
 in
 complexity
 of
 the


financial
 system
 and
 uh
 prevention
 of


financial
 crime.
 So
 what
 why
 is
 that


important?
 Well
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day
 if


if
 we
 have
 uh
 integrity
 in
 the
 system


people
 will
 trust
 the
 system
 and
 we
 want


ultimately
 for
 investors
 to
 feel
 a
 great


deal
 of
 trust
 when
 they're
 putting
 their


money
 putting
 money
 at
 risk
 um
 to
 to


drive
 savings
 and
 and
 wealth
 creation


for
 themselves.
 So
 we
 want
 to
 make
 sure


that
 the
 system
 itself
 works
 for
 them


and
 we
 focus
 a
 lot
 on
 those
 three
 key


pillars
 of
 liquidity,
 transparency,


integrity.
 Those
 are
 the
 underpinnings


of
 a
 great
 market
 but
 they're
 also
 the


underpinnings
 of
 a
 great
 financial


system.
 And
 uh
 our
 view
 is
 that
 that
 as


a
 market
 we
 can
 do
 so
 much
 to
 kind
 of


drive
 that.
 But
 as
 a
 technology
 provider


to
 markets,
 as
 a
 technology
 provider
 to


the
 financial
 the
 financial
 players,
 it


it
 kind
 of
 it
 allows
 us
 to
 spread
 those


three
 key
 pillars
 across
 the
 system
 more


effectively.
 And
 and
 frankly
 if
 we
 are


looking
 at
 some
 of
 the
 emerging
 markets


where
 we
 operate
 our
 solutions
 both
 our


market
 our
 market
 technology
 and
 our


broker
 dealer
 and
 uh
 financial
 uh
 the


banking
 technology
 it
 allows
 that
 whole


economy
 to
 lift
 itself
 up
 to
 be
 to
 be


able
 to
 um
 be
 more
 innovative
 themselves


drive
 innovation
 in
 their
 country
 drive


foreign
 investment
 into
 their
 country


because
 people
 trust
 the
 system
 more


which
 then
 of
 course
 creates
 that


positive
 flywheel
 of
 economic
 growth
 so


it's
 very
 important
 but
 I
 think
 that
 at


the
 end
 of
 the
 day,
 we'll
 talk
 more


about
 financial
 crime,
 but
 it
 is
 such
 a


big
 problem
 within
 the
 industry
 that
 it


requires
 great
 technology
 to
 be
 able
 to


help
 solve
 that
 problem
 and
 and
 we're


really
 proud
 to
 be
 one
 of
 the
 technology


providers
 to
 to
 work
 on
 that.


So,
 thinking
 a
 little
 bit
 about
 the


theme
 of
 the
 conference
 and
 what
 makes


great
 companies.
 So,
 NASDAQ
 lists
 some


of
 the
 most
 innovative
 companies
 in
 the


world
 and
 uh
 many
 of
 the
 biggest
 tech


companies.
 So
 what
 would
 you
 say
 what


separates
 a
 good
 company
 from
 a
 truly


great
 one?
 Yeah.
 Well,
 first
 I
 I
 would


point
 to
 technology
 um
 companies
 that


lean
 in
 to
 technology
 to
 help
 drive
 and


disrupt
 themselves
 to
 really
 think


differently
 about
 how
 to
 solve
 a
 problem


with
 the
 technology
 that
 exists
 today.


And
 then
 really
 as
 I
 said
 before
 is


constantly
 learning
 and
 striving
 to
 be


better
 at
 deploying
 technology
 to
 solve


problems.
 we
 see
 as
 in
 in
 any
 sector


that's
 not
 just
 as
 a
 technology
 company


but
 leveraging
 technology
 to
 solve
 a


problem
 differently
 and
 to
 drive
 to


drive
 the
 business
 forward
 we
 see
 as


definitely
 one
 of
 the
 ingredients.
 The


second
 is
 making
 sure
 that
 you
 operate
 a


resilient
 you
 in
 a
 in
 resilient
 manner.


Um,
 and
 it's
 interesting,
 you
 know,
 when


you
 meet
 some
 young
 entrepreneurs,
 they


they
 get
 very
 excited
 about
 what
 they're


doing,
 but
 they
 you
 also
 have
 to
 think


about
 what
 are
 you
 doing
 to
 create
 a


resilient
 business.
 And
 to
 me,
 uh,
 as
 I


mentioned,
 our
 cash
 flow
 conversion,
 you


know,
 cash
 is
 king.
 So,
 getting
 to
 a


state
 of
 profitability
 and
 cash
 flow,
 a


positive
 cash
 flow
 state
 is,
 I
 think,


should
 be
 the
 goal
 of
 every
 company


while
 they're
 still
 driving
 growth
 and


innovating
 in
 technology
 and
 technology


now
 can
 actually
 be
 an
 enabler
 of
 that.


You
 can
 leverage
 technology
 now
 to


become
 to
 drive
 growth
 more
 efficiently


to
 become
 more
 resilient
 and
 then
 to


make
 sure
 that
 you
 have
 a
 very
 strong


mission
 and
 a
 north
 star
 that
 you
 can


communicate
 to
 investors
 that
 you
 can


then
 talk
 about
 the
 milestones
 that


you're
 going
 to
 take
 to
 achieve
 those


great
 ambitions
 and
 that
 you
 al


obviously
 have
 to
 execute
 against
 those.


So
 so
 that
 investors
 feel
 trust
 that


you're
 taking
 them
 on
 a
 journey
 that


they
 that
 they
 can
 understand
 and
 they


can
 see
 in
 front
 of
 them.
 but
 always


always
 striving
 to
 be
 better
 um
 in
 terms


of
 how
 you're
 solving
 the
 problems
 that


you've
 decided
 to
 solve
 with
 your


business.
 So
 you
 you're
 meeting
 with


companies
 be
 way
 before
 they
 choose
 to


go
 public
 and
 way
 before
 they
 list
 and


as
 they're
 working
 their
 way
 towards
 the


public
 markets.
 uh
 what
 are
 there
 any


lessons
 to
 be
 learned
 and
 can
 you
 can


you
 see
 who
 will
 uh
 going
 to
 be
 who
 is


going
 to
 be
 great
 and
 who
 will


ultimately
 well
 a
 lot
 of
 it
 comes
 back


to
 what
 I
 just
 said
 in
 terms
 of
 making


sure
 that
 you're
 driving
 towards
 a


really
 important
 goal
 making
 sure
 you're


building
 a
 truly
 resilient
 company
 and


that
 you're
 leveraging
 technology
 in


every
 possible
 way
 to
 be
 able
 to
 achieve


your
 vision
 and
 your
 mission
 um
 and
 but


even
 then
 you
 know
 not
 every
 company
 is


going
 to
 be
 able
 to
 um
 uh
 you
 have
 to


recognize
 the
 fact
 that
 you
 also
 have
 to


look
 at
 what's
 the
 total
 market


opportunity
 in
 front
 of
 them
 and
 there


are
 other
 ingredients
 that
 also
 go
 into


an
 investment
 thesis
 like
 what
 is
 a


total
 market
 opportunity
 how
 fast
 is


that
 growing
 how
 well
 positioned
 are


they
 how
 quickly
 can
 they
 open
 the
 doors


but
 then
 lastly
 I
 would
 say
 making
 sure


from
 a
 resiliency
 perspective
 that


they're
 also
 thinking
 about
 that


integrity
 you
 know
 sometimes
 you
 want
 to


break
 something
 you
 want
 to
 break
 a


system
 to
 make
 it
 better
 uh
 and
 I
 think


that's
 actually
 frankly
 been
 the


quintessential
 element
 of
 of
 a
 lot
 of


technological
 advancements
 and
 and
 the


innovation
 ecosystem
 that
 exists
 in
 the


US,
 but
 you
 also
 have
 to
 reflect
 on
 are


you
 ultimately
 providing
 a
 lasting


benefit
 to
 the
 end
 client
 or
 end


consumer
 and
 are
 they
 um
 you
 know
 and


are
 you
 breaking
 things
 that
 matter
 and


making
 sure
 that
 you're
 working
 within


the
 system
 when
 you
 need
 to
 and
 you're


trying
 to
 kind
 of
 create
 a
 new
 system


where
 you
 have
 the
 opportunity
 to
 but


ultimately
 for
 the
 end
 benefit
 of
 the


consumer.
 Yeah.
 So
 you
 often
 talk
 about


the
 Nordic
 stock
 markets
 and
 uh
 you


operate
 many
 of
 them,
 not
 the
 Norwegian


as
 we
 heard,
 but
 um
 the
 fact
 that
 the


Nordic
 stock
 market
 stand
 out
 compared


to
 many
 other
 European
 markets
 and
 we're


here
 in
 Norway
 now.
 So
 I'm
 curious
 what


makes
 the
 Nordic
 capital
 market
 so


dynamic
 compared
 to
 some
 of
 some
 other


markets.
 Well,
 right
 now
 in
 Europe,


there's
 a
 big
 debate
 and
 discussion


about
 how
 do
 we
 improve
 and
 make
 the


capital
 markets
 in
 Europe
 more
 vibrant.


Um,
 and
 and
 also
 really
 to
 drive


economic
 growth
 and
 innovation
 within


within
 the
 economies
 here
 in
 Europe.
 And


I've
 I've
 been
 saying
 very
 consistently,


you
 do
 not
 need
 to
 look
 to
 the
 United


States
 to
 answer
 that
 question.
 You
 need


to
 look
 to
 Sweden
 and
 to
 the
 the
 broader


Nordic
 markets.
 And
 I
 use
 Sweden
 because


we
 have
 we
 own
 and
 operate
 the
 Swedish


stock
 exchange
 and
 we're
 very
 engaged


there.
 But
 we
 can
 also
 look
 to
 Denmark,


Finland,
 and
 Norway
 as
 being
 exemplars


of
 this.
 So
 if
 I
 uh
 but
 I've
 studied


Sweden
 the
 most,
 so
 I'm
 going to
 start


there.
 Um
 so
 with
 Sweden,
 it's
 we
 love


to
 think
 that
 having
 NASDAQ
 as
 a
 market


operator
 there
 helps.
 Um
 and
 I
 do
 think


that
 the
 technological
 advancements
 and


things
 that
 we've
 done
 to
 really
 promote


the
 market
 ecosystem
 there
 have
 been
 an


ingredient
 to
 success.
 But
 it
 starts


much
 it's
 much
 bigger
 than
 that.
 Um,


first
 I
 think
 that
 the
 the
 countries


here
 in
 the
 Nordics
 have
 recognized
 that


they're
 small
 countries
 but
 they
 want
 to


have
 an
 outsized
 impact
 on
 the
 world.


They've
 decided,
 you
 know,
 very
 early
 on


um
 in
 the
 modern
 economy
 to
 be
 global


businesses
 to
 really
 promote
 global


trade
 and
 to
 go
 beyond
 their
 borders.
 So


that
 that
 notion
 of
 constantly
 looking


outside
 the
 system
 you're
 in
 to
 say
 what


impact
 can
 we
 have
 on
 the
 broader


economy
 around
 the
 world
 and
 to
 really


promote
 global
 businesses,
 number
 one.


Number
 two,
 to
 have
 a
 great
 university


system
 that
 really
 um
 kind
 of
 drives


towards
 the
 modern
 skills
 that
 are


needed
 to
 succeed
 in
 a
 modern
 economy.
 I


think
 that's
 one
 of the
 quintessential


elements
 of
 the
 Nordic
 system.
 The
 third


is
 the
 ability
 for
 ris
 like
 this


risk-taking
 culture
 and
 we
 talked
 about


in
 the
 United
 States.
 I
 think
 here
 in


the
 Nordics,
 the
 Nordic
 countries
 have


created
 this
 great
 social
 safety
 net.


And
 that
 as
 a
 result,
 if
 you're
 a
 cons
 a


citizen
 of
 the
 country
 and
 you
 have
 this


safe
 social
 safety
 net,
 you
 should
 be


you
 taking
 more
 risk
 with
 your


discretionary
 capital.
 You
 should
 be
 re


realizing
 that
 as
 a
 result
 of
 having


that
 great
 system
 around
 you.
 You
 can


take
 your
 capital
 and
 and
 invest
 it
 as


opposed
 to
 just
 putting
 into
 a
 savings


account
 and
 drive
 wealth
 creation
 and


give
 yourself
 even
 more
 opportunity
 in


life.
 And
 I
 think
 that
 as
 a
 result


they've
 done
 these
 very
 specific
 tax
 um


oriented
 um
 uh
 programs.
 So
 the
 most
 uh


influential
 has
 been
 the
 ISK
 program
 in


Sweden.
 It's
 a
 tax
 advantaged
 savings


account.
 Um
 you
 can
 invest
 in
 any
 as


long
 as
 you
 put
 your
 money
 into
 public


equities.
 That's
 that's
 your
 only


obligation.
 You
 you
 get
 you
 pay
 about
 1%


tax
 on
 your
 total
 holdings
 every
 year


and
 there's
 no
 cap
 gains
 tax.
 And
 the


result
 of
 that
 has
 been
 the
 ownership
 of


equities
 within
 the
 citizens
 of
 Sweden


has
 been
 straight
 up
 and
 to
 the
 right


since
 2012
 since
 that
 program
 was


implemented.
 So
 it's
 really
 kind
 of


given
 it's
 actually
 encouraging
 citizens


to
 invest
 in
 equities
 to
 to
 take
 that


risk
 to
 own
 their
 own
 financials
 to
 be


financially
 literate
 to
 help
 them
 kind


of
 drive
 their
 future.
 And
 that
 then


creates
 a
 retail
 ecosystem
 inside
 the


country
 with
 a
 great
 pension
 system


inside
 our
 countries.
 Um
 that
 really


drives
 for
 that
 flywheel
 of
 economic


activity,
 growth,
 expansion.
 We
 have


1,200
 companies
 listed
 in
 the
 Nordics.


Um
 we've
 had
 450
 companies
 go
 public


just
 in
 Sweden
 alone.
 Oh,
 I'm
 sorry,


across
 the
 Nordics
 in
 the
 last
 five


years.
 So
 it's
 really
 an
 it's
 an
 amazing


system
 on
 the
 back
 of
 a
 lot
 of


intentional
 action.
 Long
 answer,
 but


really
 important.
 No,
 but
 I
 I
 think


that's
 a
 really
 important
 point
 and


probably
 of
 interest
 to
 to
 the
 people
 in


this
 uh
 audience.
 So,
 um
 well
 worth


spending
 time
 on.
 Um
 so,
 going
 back
 a


little
 bit
 to
 technology
 and
 and
 some
 of


the
 technology
 advances
 that's
 happening


now.
 So,
 how
 are
 you
 using
 technologies


like
 AI
 and
 cloud
 to
 power
 and
 shape
 the


future
 of
 the
 financial
 markets?
 Yeah.


Well,
 I
 think
 we
 we
 are
 using
 in
 two


different
 ways.
 I
 would
 actually
 point


to
 the
 markets
 and
 then
 I'll
 talk
 about


our
 anti-financial
 crime
 business
 where


we
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 advanced
 AI
 that
 we're


using
 there.
 So
 in
 the
 markets
 um
 we
 use


we
 use
 AI
 to
 actually
 make
 sure
 that


we're
 managing
 our
 capacity
 planning
 uh


in
 a
 very
 dynamic
 way.
 We
 managed
 an


enormous
 amount
 of
 message
 traffic


through
 our
 systems.
 For
 example,
 in
 the


first
 two
 weeks
 of
 April,
 we
 had
 our


peak
 day
 ever
 of
 550
 billion
 messages


that
 flowed
 through
 our
 markets
 in
 in
 a


day.
 Um
 and
 so
 we
 have
 to
 make
 sure


we're
 managing
 our
 capacity
 on
 a
 very


dynamic
 level.
 So
 we
 use
 AI
 algorithms


to
 help
 predict
 capacity
 needs.
 The


second
 is
 we
 have
 AIdriven
 um
 order


types
 in
 our
 markets
 um
 to
 really
 kind


of
 enhance
 the
 investor
 experience
 in


our
 markets.
 And
 then
 I
 think
 that
 the


the
 third
 is
 to
 use
 the
 best
 of
 cloud


capabilities.
 So
 we
 have
 AWS
 as
 a


partner.
 They've
 come
 into
 our
 data


center.
 We've
 we've
 been
 moving
 our


markets
 to
 cloud
 technology
 now
 for
 a


couple
 of
 years
 and
 it's
 been
 a
 great


experience
 in
 terms
 of
 improving
 even


the
 scalability,
 the
 latency
 and
 all
 the


key
 characteristics
 of
 great
 markets


with
 in
 our
 partnership
 with
 AWS.
 So
 we


know
 that
 that's
 really
 the
 future
 of


markets
 and
 we're
 excited
 to
 partner


with
 them
 now
 to
 bring
 all
 of
 that
 into


our
 Nordic
 markets
 and
 then
 to
 bring


that
 across
 the
 world
 to
 our
 market


techch
 clients.
 But
 AI
 I
 think
 is


actually
 the
 most
 effective
 use
 of
 AI


within
 NASDAQ
 has
 been
 in
 anti-financial


crime.
 So
 we
 have
 a
 company
 called


Verafin
 that
 we
 acquired
 um
 four
 and
 a


half
 years
 ago
 and
 they
 uh
 that
 that


business
 and
 our
 team
 really
 uses
 AI


algorithms
 to
 root
 out
 criminal
 actors.


We
 bring
 all
 of
 the
 data
 together.
 So
 we


are
 allowed
 to
 share
 data
 in
 the
 United


States.
 So
 we
 share
 I
 have
 a
 data


consorcia
 across
 the
 banks.
 fit
 2600


banks
 in
 that
 consortia
 and
 it
 allows
 us


to
 look
 for
 patterns
 and
 practices
 of


criminal
 behaviors
 and
 be
 very
 specific


in
 the
 topologies
 that
 we
 write
 to
 to


make
 it
 so
 we
 can
 be
 more
 effective
 in


rooting
 out
 criminals.
 And
 then
 we
 use


Gen
 AI
 um
 on
 automating
 workflows.
 So
 as


you're
 researching
 a
 potentially
 bad


actor,
 which
 by
 the
 way
 there
 are


thousands
 and
 thousands
 of
 alerts
 that


come
 out
 of
 your
 systems
 every
 day.
 Um


how
 do
 you
 make
 that
 as
 efficient
 and


automated
 as
 possible?
 So
 we
 have
 this


entity
 research
 co-pilot
 that
 automates


the
 process
 of
 researching
 entities
 to


look
 for
 criminals
 um
 and
 then
 writes


the
 report
 um
 and
 so
 that
 all
 you
 have


to
 do
 is
 review
 review
 the
 report
 and


submit.
 So
 very
 cool.
 Yeah.
 So
 your


NASDAQ
 you
 mainly
 operate
 in
 public


markets.
 So
 for
 a
 while
 now
 there's
 been


a
 global
 trend
 that
 fewer
 and
 fewer


companies
 are
 going
 public.
 They're


staying
 private
 for
 longer
 or
 forever.


So
 what's
 driving
 this
 trend?
 And
 uh
 in


your
 view,
 why
 should
 companies
 work


toward
 public
 markets?
 Well,
 I
 I
 do


think
 that
 there's
 a
 cyclical
 element
 to


that
 and
 then
 and
 then
 a
 structural


element
 to
 that.
 So,
 you
 know,


cycllically
 speaking,
 you
 have
 a
 world


where
 we
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 company
 a
 lot
 of


private
 capital
 that's
 growing.
 It's


growing
 at
 about
 it's
 about
 15
 about
 in


2023,
 there's
 about
 15
 trillion
 of


private
 capital
 growing
 15%
 a
 year


versus
 $115
 trillion
 of
 public
 equity


capital,
 but
 only
 growing
 3%
 a
 year.
 So


you've
 got
 kind
 of
 a
 shift
 towards
 some


private
 private
 capital
 and
 that
 I
 think


goes
 towards
 um
 just
 the
 the
 trends


within
 within
 the
 the
 investment


ecosystem.
 But
 to
 fight
 that
 trend,
 you


have
 to
 therefore
 realize
 that
 there's


more
 competition.
 You
 know,
 you
 want
 the


public
 markets
 to
 be
 where
 everyone
 is


excited
 and
 strives
 to
 come
 into
 the


public
 markets
 to
 make
 their
 companies


accessible
 to
 everyday
 citizens,


everyday
 retail
 investors.
 and
 that
 the


only
 way
 to
 really
 do
 that
 at
 scale
 is


to
 go
 public
 and
 to
 to
 make
 it
 so
 that


the
 citizens
 of
 your
 country
 are
 engaged


in
 the
 growth
 of
 your
 country
 and
 you


create
 that
 virtuous
 flywheel
 of
 that


engagement
 through
 investment.
 So
 um
 we


have
 focused
 on
 a
 lot
 of
 policy
 issues


that
 exist
 in
 the
 United
 States.
 Um
 so


everyone
 talks
 about
 the
 US
 as
 being


great
 markets
 and
 they
 are
 but
 we
 still


have
 had
 a
 decline
 of
 public
 companies


as
 well
 and
 so
 we
 talk
 about
 um


disclosure
 obligations.
 Let's
 streamline


those.
 let's
 take
 some
 of
 the
 burden
 off


the
 companies
 there.
 Proxy
 reform,
 which


is
 the
 the
 process
 of
 voting
 for
 its


different
 proposals
 and
 really
 really


frankly
 rethinking
 the
 entire
 proxy


process.
 Um
 and
 then
 thirdly
 on


litigation
 reform
 and
 other
 things
 that


really
 keep
 companies
 from
 actually


maximizing
 returns
 for
 their


shareholders.
 So
 what
 our
 view
 is
 that


if
 we
 can
 make
 progress
 on
 those
 three


things,
 it
 will
 change
 the
 u
 what
 being


public
 means
 and
 it
 gives
 us
 an


opportunity
 to
 get
 more
 companies
 into


public
 markets
 because
 as
 you
 say
 that


gives
 uh
 access
 for
 the
 retail
 investors


for
 the
 average
 investor
 to
 to
 actually


take
 part
 in
 that
 value
 creation.
 So


with
 with
 companies
 staying
 private
 for


longer,
 uh
 are
 you
 concerned
 about
 the


um
 abilities
 for
 the
 general
 public
 to


take
 part
 in
 that
 value
 creation?
 And
 um


it's
 a
 it's
 a
 major
 issue.
 I
 I
 think
 we


have
 to
 recognize
 that
 um
 really
 56%
 of


American
 adults
 own
 equities
 in
 the


United
 States.
 Um
 but
 but
 only,
 you


know,
 a
 very
 small
 fraction
 of
 them
 have


access
 to
 private
 private
 investments.


And
 you
 could
 say,
 well,
 should
 you
 make


private
 investments
 more
 accessible?
 I


think
 there
 are
 ways
 to
 do
 that.
 But
 the


the
 real
 strength
 of
 the
 economy
 is
 in


those
 public
 markets
 where
 you
 get
 the


the
 broad
 base
 of
 citizen
 involved
 in


driving
 the
 growth
 of
 the
 economy
 and


and
 frankly
 they
 benefit
 when
 the


economy
 benefits.
 That's
 what
 really


creates
 a
 virtuous
 cycle
 and
 we're
 we


want
 to
 be
 stewards
 of
 that.
 Um
 and
 so


we're
 hoping
 to
 get
 some
 reform
 done


there.
 I
 think
 that's
 a
 great
 point
 to


end
 them.
 So,
 thank
 you
 so
 much
 for
 all


your
 insights
 and
 um
 thank
 you.
 Thank


you
 very
 much,
 Min.
