Canada
 was
 once
 known
 as
 a
 peacekeeping


nation,
 but
 that
 reputation
 has
 faded.


In
 the
 age
 of
 Trump's
 America,
 what
 part


should
 we
 play?
 I
 asked
 former
 Canadian


ambassador
 to
 the
 UN,
 Luis
 Blle,
 and


journalist
 Steven
 Marsh,
 host
 of
 the


podcast
 Gloves
 Off.


Madame
 Vle,
 Stephen,
 thank
 you
 so
 much


for
 joining
 us
 on
 the
 program.
 Madam,


I'm
 going
 to
 come
 to
 you
 first.
 How
 is


Canada
 perceived
 by
 other
 nations
 right


now?


>> Well,
 I
 mean,
 it's
 it's
 it's
 not


universal,
 right?
 Obviously,
 there
 are


some
 countries,
 but
 that
 will
 have


different
 opinions,
 but
 I
 think
 I
 travel


quite
 a
 bit
 internationally
 and
 at
 the


moment
 there's
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a


question
 mark
 that's
 being
 raised.
 Um,


you
 know,
 when
 I'm
 in
 Mexico,
 for


example,
 I
 hear,
 well,
 uh,
 how
 are


things
 going
 over
 there?
 I
 mean
 so
 I


think
 around
 the
 world
 at
 the
 moment
 it


has
 been
 noticed
 that
 uh
 this


relationship
 that
 we
 used
 to
 uh
 benefit


from
 with
 our
 our
 closest
 ally
 and
 and


neighbor
 the
 United
 States
 of
 America


has
 really
 uh
 fallen
 off
 a
 cliff.
 I
 mean


I
 think
 the
 level
 of
 which
 we
 are
 now
 in


an
 uncomfortable
 position
 in
 our


relationship
 I
 think
 is
 something
 that


is
 definitely
 uh
 seen
 and
 it's
 not
 brand


new.
 I
 think
 you
 know
 we
 have
 disagreed


in
 the
 past
 on
 a
 lot
 of
 international


issues
 but
 this
 kind
 of
 level
 I
 think


and
 and
 the
 nature
 of
 it
 like
 the
 ad
 for


example
 that
 is
 really
 um
 that
 is
 really


making
 the
 rounds
 around
 the
 world.
 So


we
 have
 to
 wait
 and
 see
 what
 that
 means.


Canada
 benefited
 internationally
 from


our
 closeness
 to
 the
 Americans.
 Can
 we


stand
 on
 our
 own?
 Uh
 are
 we
 an


alternative
 to
 the
 Americans
 for
 the


world?
 I
 I'm
 unconvinced
 of
 that.
 But


Stephen
 might
 have
 a
 different
 different


opinion.
 Well,
 Stephen,
 um,
 Canada
 has


long
 been
 considered
 a
 middle
 power
 even


with
 our
 elbows
 up
 sort
 of
 mantra.
 Uh,
 I


am
 curious,
 is
 that
 still
 the
 case?
 Are


we
 still
 a
 a
 middle
 power
 in
 this?


>> Well,
 I
 think
 we're
 sort
 of
 exiting
 the


world
 where
 there
 are
 such
 things
 as


middle
 powers.
 I
 mean,
 even
 even
 the


concept
 of
 a
 middle
 power
 impo
 implies
 a


multilateral
 world
 order
 that
 simply
 has


stopped
 existing.
 um
 you
 know
 as
 to
 the


question
 of
 whether
 Canada
 has
 to
 can


stand
 by
 itself.
 I
 mean
 simple
 answer
 is


it's
 going
 to
 have
 to
 um
 because
 you


know
 whatever
 our
 actions
 um
 the
 actions


of
 America
 are
 the
 the
 actions
 of
 a


power
 hostile
 to
 us
 and
 a
 power
 that
 is


certainly
 no
 longer
 reliable
 either
 as


an
 ally
 or
 a
 trading
 partner.
 So
 you


know
 I
 don't
 think
 we're
 in
 a
 situation


that
 we
 have
 control
 over
 and
 I
 don't


think
 we're
 in
 a
 situation
 where
 we


should
 judge
 our
 politicians
 as
 if
 they


had
 control
 over
 it.
 We're
 just
 reacting


to
 the
 breakdown
 of
 the
 United
 States
 as


a
 world
 as
 a
 world
 power
 and
 ultimately


as
 a
 nation
 and
 and
 and
 surviving
 that


collapse,
 that
 American
 collapse
 is
 the


task
 of
 the
 next
 generation
 of


Canadians.


>> All
 right.
 Madame
 Bl
 had
 mentioned
 the


ad.
 I
 think
 it's
 important
 that
 we
 uh


show
 that
 ad.
 This
 is
 an
 ad
 that
 was


pulled.
 President
 Trump
 had
 called
 off


all
 trade
 talks
 because
 of
 this
 ad
 that


was
 placed
 by
 the
 Ontario
 government.


Let's
 have
 a
 watch
 of
 the
 clip
 here.


When
 someone
 [music]
 says,
 "Let's
 impose


tariffs
 on
 foreign
 imports,"
 it
 looks


like
 they're
 doing
 the
 patriotic
 thing


[music]
 by
 protecting
 American
 products


and
 jobs.
 Throughout
 the
 world,
 there's


a
 growing
 realization
 that
 the
 way
 to


[music]
 prosperity
 for
 all
 nations
 is


rejecting
 protectionist
 legislation
 and


promoting
 fair
 and
 free
 competition.


America's
 jobs
 [music]


and
 growth
 are
 at
 stake.
 I
 am
 sure
 both


of
 you
 have
 probably
 watched
 that
 ad
 a


few
 times.
 So,
 I'm
 going
 to
 ask
 madam,


was
 that
 the
 right
 play?


>> No,
 I
 I
 don't
 think
 it
 was
 at
 all.
 And


for
 a
 couple
 of
 reasons.
 Uh,
 first
 of


all,
 I
 I
 mean,
 using
 a
 a
 previous


president's
 words
 against
 a
 current


president
 and
 a
 kind
 of
 relationship


that
 we're
 in
 right
 now,
 I
 think
 is
 was


extremely
 dangerous.
 It
 was
 very


imprudent
 and
 I
 don't
 think
 we'd
 like
 it


if
 it
 was
 done
 to
 us.
 Uh
 and
 so
 I
 think


that
 was
 uh
 point
 number
 one.
 Point


number
 two
 is
 one
 ad
 is
 not
 going
 to


change
 even
 if
 it
 is
 being
 played
 in
 red


states
 is
 not
 going
 to
 change
 the


reality.
 Uh
 there's
 been
 a
 debate
 going


on
 about
 trade
 and
 tariffs.
 United


States
 has
 been
 raging.
 It
 does
 not
 need


this
 ad.
 And
 this
 ad
 is
 not
 going
 to


change
 hearts
 and
 minds
 to
 the
 degree


that
 it
 would
 need
 to
 in
 order
 to
 really


uh
 outweigh
 the
 risk.
 and
 the
 risk
 have


been
 clear
 and
 uh
 and
 I
 think
 I
 I
 we


feel
 comfortable
 as
 Canadians
 to
 do


that.
 Uh
 and
 we
 go
 on
 their
 airwaves
 and


we
 take
 every
 opportunity
 we
 have
 to
 try


to
 uh
 give
 them
 our
 opinion
 and
 I
 think


that's
 fine
 to
 give
 them
 our
 opinion.


But
 I
 think
 we
 should
 be
 very
 careful
 to


step
 into
 the
 political
 fray
 in
 the


United
 States
 at
 a
 time
 where
 there
 is


quite
 a
 bit
 of
 of
 uh
 of
 division
 and
 not


be
 caught
 because
 we're
 going
 to
 get


caught
 in
 the
 middle.
 And
 that's
 exactly


what
 happened.


>> All
 right,
 Stephen,
 uh,
 your
 thoughts
 on


the
 ad
 and
 a
 response
 to
 Madame
 BlÃ©?


>> Well,
 there's
 no
 real
 way
 to
 tell
 if
 it


was
 a
 good
 play
 or
 a
 right
 play
 because


you're
 dealing
 with
 a
 psychopath.
 Like


how
 you
 deal
 with
 a,
 you
 know,
 a


methhead
 on
 the
 subway,
 like
 there's
 no


rational
 pro
 or
 counter
 move.
 That
 makes


sense,
 right?
 Um,
 as
 for
 like
 whether


Canada
 should
 be
 interfering
 in
 American


politics,
 we
 need
 to
 get
 very
 we
 need
 to


start
 interfering
 in
 American
 politics


very
 very
 aggressively.
 I
 mean
 they
 are


open
 for
 business.
 They're
 very
 clear


that
 the
 Chinese
 and
 the
 Russians
 are


buying
 their
 politicians
 uh
 I
 mean
 left,


right
 and
 center.
 They
 themselves
 I
 mean


look
 what
 they
 just
 did
 in
 Argentina.


like
 they
 interfere
 with
 sovereign


states
 politics
 all
 the
 time
 and
 our


national
 interest
 is
 absolutely


intimately
 bound
 up
 in
 interfering
 in


American
 politics.
 So
 we
 are
 going
 to
 be


interfering
 in
 American
 politics
 if
 we


want
 to
 survive.
 You
 know
 that's
 not


something
 we
 have
 a
 choice
 about.
 That


is
 something
 that
 is
 simply
 uh
 part
 of


the
 world
 that
 we're
 entering
 now.


>> Madame
 BL
 with
 that
 do
 we
 need
 to
 try
 to


build
 this
 relationship?
 That's
 what
 I


what
 I'm
 gathering
 from
 you.
 or
 do
 we


need
 to
 work
 on
 other
 relationships?


>> Well,
 this
 is
 where,
 you
 know,
 I
 I
 kind


of
 disagree
 a
 little
 bit
 with
 with with


Stephen.
 With
 all
 due
 respect,
 I
 I
 don't


think
 the
 United
 States
 is
 collapsing.
 I


I
 really
 don't.
 And
 if
 they
 are,
 then,


you
 know,
 God
 help
 us
 as
 well.
 Uh,
 no,
 I


think
 I
 think
 there
 are
 issues
 going
 on


down
 south
 of
 the
 border,
 but
 at
 the


same
 time,
 nothing's
 going
 to
 change
 the


fact
 that
 our
 prosperity
 will
 be
 tied
 to


that
 of
 the
 Americans
 for
 the


foreseeable
 future,
 no
 matter
 what
 we


do.
 And
 so
 we
 need
 to
 fix
 the


relationship
 there.
 And
 we've
 gone
 about


it,
 I
 think,
 the
 wrong
 way.
 Uh
 we
 say


one
 thing
 to
 the
 president,
 we
 play
 nice


when
 we're
 in
 the
 Oval
 Office,
 but
 then


we
 come
 home
 or
 we
 go
 around
 the
 world


and
 we
 say,
 "Well,
 you
 know,
 we
 don't


want
 to
 deal
 with
 anyone
 that's
 not


reliable
 and
 we're
 looking
 for
 other


partners."
 You
 can't
 do
 that.
 You
 have


to
 be
 consistent
 and
 you
 have
 to
 not
 be


seen
 to
 be
 two-faced.
 That
 is
 what
 the


president
 uh
 I
 think
 accused
 uh
 uh
 Prime


Minister
 Trudeau
 of
 doing.
 You
 got
 to


build
 a
 relationship.
 Look,
 the


presidents
 all
 over
 Asia
 signing
 deals


and
 they're
 and
 the
 Japanese
 of
 all


countries
 who
 are
 set
 in
 their
 ways
 uh


are
 actually
 finding
 a
 way
 to
 work
 with


this
 president,
 turning
 the
 page,
 live


in
 the
 real
 world,
 live
 in
 the
 world


that
 we
 are
 in
 now
 and
 actually
 getting


something
 out
 of
 it.
 We
 cannot
 continue


to
 have
 this
 uncertainty.
 we're
 paying


the
 price
 now.
 Time
 is
 money.
 Um,
 and
 I


think
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 find
 a
 way


back
 to
 the
 negotiation
 table
 and
 I
 have


to
 be
 realistic
 and
 and
 then
 we'll
 move


on
 from
 there.
 But
 I
 do
 agree
 that


things
 have
 changed
 and
 we
 do
 need
 to
 uh


look
 to
 other
 markets
 in
 addition
 to


that
 United
 States.
 But
 we
 first
 have
 to


fix
 uh
 the
 relationship
 there
 and
 that


will
 actually
 help
 us
 internationally


because
 if
 we
 ask
 countries
 around
 the


world
 to
 make
 a
 choice
 between
 us
 and


can
 and
 the
 United
 States,
 well
 the
 size


of
 the
 US
 market
 is
 simply
 too
 big.


>> Stephen,
 I'll
 get
 your
 take.
 Obviously,


one
 thing
 is
 clear.
 Things
 are
 not
 the


same.
 But
 the
 way
 that
 we
 go
 about
 it,
 I


I
 gather,
 is
 a
 little
 different.


>> What's
 the
 point
 in
 negotiating
 with
 a


pirate?
 I
 mean,
 anytime
 that
 we
 come
 to


an
 agreement,
 they'll
 just
 rip
 it
 up
 in


the
 next
 five
 minutes.
 We're
 dealing


with
 we're
 not
 dealing
 with
 the
 America


that
 we
 knew.
 We
 are
 dealing
 with
 an


authoritarian
 state
 that
 is
 explicitly


talked
 about
 annexing
 us
 which
 I
 I
 mean


her
 excellency
 really
 does
 not
 seem
 to


have
 processed
 like
 we
 are
 we
 are


dealing
 with
 a
 threat
 to
 our
 security


and
 to
 our
 sovereignty
 from
 the
 south


and
 the
 idea
 that
 we
 should
 just
 roll


over
 and
 take
 it
 and
 suddenly
 they'll


come
 to
 their
 senses
 and
 treat
 us
 like


the
 good
 little
 boys
 and
 girls
 that
 we


are
 if
 we
 just
 behave
 is
 laughable.
 like


they
 they
 will
 take
 exa
 they
 will
 take


every
 advantage
 they
 can.
 That's
 exactly


what
 they've
 done.
 The
 more
 vulnerable


that
 we
 are,
 the
 more
 they
 will
 take.
 We


are
 not
 dealing
 with
 people
 who
 can
 be


treated
 as
 reasonable
 human
 beings
 with


uh
 with
 reasonable
 goals.
 We
 are
 dealing


with
 people
 who
 are
 annexationists
 are


in
 the
 middle
 of
 a
 a
 breakdown.
 So
 like


that
 we
 do
 not
 have
 good
 choices.
 Like
 I


I
 totally
 agree
 with
 that.
 But
 the
 idea


that
 we're
 going
 to
 go
 back
 and
 we're


going
 to
 somehow
 come
 to
 some
 kind
 of


arrangement
 if
 we
 just
 behave.
 This
 is


the
 Canadian
 spirit
 that
 has
 actually


got
 us
 into
 this
 mess.
 We
 need
 to


understand
 that
 the
 only
 response
 that


will
 get
 any
 respect
 from
 authoritarians


like
 Trump
 is
 one
 of
 great
 great


aggression.
 And
 that
 is
 that
 is
 that
 is


that
 is
 clear
 from
 every
 country
 that


has
 ever
 lived
 beside
 an
 authoritarian


society.
 Finland
 doesn't
 try
 to
 make


peace
 and
 make
 good
 with
 Russia.
 They


they
 come
 to
 their
 own
 arrangements
 and


they
 make
 deals
 with
 other
 people.
 And


that
 is
 the
 world
 that
 we're
 in.
 I
 wish


we
 weren't.
 I
 wish
 we
 were
 in
 the
 world


where
 Americans
 were
 reasonable
 human


beings
 we
 could
 talk
 to,
 but
 we're
 not.


And
 I
 would
 point
 out
 that
 like
 the
 fact


that
 almost
 50%
 of
 Canadians
 understand


that
 America
 is
 our
 enemy
 according
 to


polls.
 enemy
 um
 means
 that
 the
 Canadian


people
 have
 registered
 this
 and
 they


know
 that
 suffering
 is
 coming.
 Like
 we


we
 we
 know
 that
 the
 winter
 is
 coming
 for


us.
 So
 I
 I
 I
 mean
 I
 I
 just
 think


pretending
 that
 America
 is
 the
 country


that
 it
 was
 is
 just
 not
 helpful.
 It's


just
 not
 it's
 just
 not
 useful
 at
 this


point.


>> Stephen,
 I
 think
 you're
 referencing
 the


Pew
 Research
 Center
 that
 said,
 you
 know,


59%
 were
 allies,
 but
 there
 was
 also


another
 percentage
 that
 said
 that
 it
 was


our
 enemy
 as
 well.
 I


>> No,
 it
 was
 the
 Angus
 Reed
 poll.
 It
 was


the
 Angus
 Reed
 poll.
 Correct.
 Okay.


>> The
 the
 Pew
 Research
 had
 the
 Pew


[clears throat]
 Research
 actually
 was


more
 interesting
 because
 it
 said
 our


number
 one
 enemy
 is
 America
 and
 and
 our


number
 one
 ally
 is
 America.
 That
 is


actually
 the
 position
 in
 which
 we


unfortunately
 find
 ourselves.


>> But
 but
 both
 of
 them
 point
 out
 I
 mean


both
 of
 them
 demonstrate
 pretty
 clearly


that
 the
 American
 that
 the
 Canadian


people
 understand
 that
 we're
 not
 dealing


with
 uh
 you
 know
 the
 America
 of
 2023.
 We


we
 we're
 not.


>> Very
 good.
 Madame
 Blair,
 let's
 get
 you


in
 here.
 If
 that
 is
 the
 case
 that


Stephen
 is
 paint
 painting
 right
 there,


how
 does
 Canada
 maintain
 its
 middle


power
 if
 we
 have
 a
 tenuous
 relationship


with
 the
 US
 as
 it
 is?


>> Well,
 I
 I
 I
 don't
 know
 that
 the
 goal
 is


to
 maintain
 our
 or
 our
 middle
 power.


>> What
 is
 what
 is
 the
 goal?


>> Well,
 the
 goal
 is
 to
 actually,
 you
 know,


and
 that
 I
 totally
 agree.
 I
 mean,


Canada's
 uh
 global
 interests
 are
 really


twofold.
 one
 is
 is
 our
 economic
 security


and
 the
 other
 one
 is
 security
 security.


So
 both
 of
 them
 are
 fundamental.
 We
 need


to
 bring
 back
 our
 foreign
 policy
 on
 on


those.
 We
 have
 an
 you
 know
 borders
 to


defend
 and
 we
 have
 an
 economy
 to
 build.


So
 I
 think
 we
 should
 be
 focusing
 on
 that


going
 around
 the
 world
 and
 saying
 we're


a
 middle
 power.
 I
 I
 just
 don't
 see
 the


point
 of
 that.
 I
 think
 at
 the
 moment
 we


have
 to
 be
 I
 agree
 with
 Stephen.
 We
 have


to
 be
 realistic.
 This
 is
 a
 difficult


tough
 tough
 world.
 Uh,
 and
 uh,
 Canada


benefited
 from
 the
 gentiel
 universe
 that


we
 used
 to
 live
 in.
 It's
 not
 like
 that


anymore.
 Uh,
 I
 think
 I'm
 a
 lot
 more


worried
 about
 what
 could
 happen
 in
 the


Arctic
 than
 I
 am
 on
 the
 southern
 border.


Quite
 frankly,
 we
 we
 do
 have
 a
 uh,
 we're


very
 close
 to
 to
 Russia,
 just
 like


Finland.
 And
 uh,
 and
 China
 has
 already


expressed
 their
 uh,
 their
 uh,
 interests


in
 the
 Arctic.
 They've
 already
 mapped


the
 seafloor.
 So
 I
 think
 we
 have
 to
 be


very
 very
 clear
 that
 we
 need
 to
 focus
 on


us
 need
 to
 focus
 on
 our
 own
 well-being


and
 that
 doesn't
 mean
 we
 completely


abandon
 uh
 human
 rights
 uh
 but
 I
 don't


think
 we
 need
 to
 be
 the
 savior
 of
 the


world.
 I
 think
 at
 the
 moment
 we
 should


focus
 our
 energy
 on
 us
 and
 so
 uh
 I
 I
 I


don't
 think
 we
 should
 chase
 any
 label


but
 we
 should
 be
 realistic.
 We
 live
 in


this
 continent.
 We
 live
 with
 our


geography.
 We
 have
 our
 strengths.
 We


have
 our
 weaknesses.
 We
 should
 be


focusing
 on
 those.


>> All
 right,
 very
 quickly,
 one
 last


question
 to
 both
 of
 you
 with
 that.
 Uh,


if
 we
 are
 not
 the
 savior
 then,
 Stephen,


what
 should
 Canada's
 role
 in
 the
 world


be
 right
 now?


>> Oh,
 I
 I
 don't
 think
 we
 should
 have
 a


role
 in
 the
 world.
 I
 think
 we
 should


concentrate
 entirely
 on
 our
 own


survival.
 I
 think
 that
 is
 our
 own


priority.
 the
 idea
 that
 we're
 going
 to


be
 global
 citizens
 and
 like
 uh
 you
 know


sort
 of
 the
 virtuous
 you
 you
 know
 the


virtuous
 child
 at
 the
 at
 the
 uh
 adult


table
 of
 of
 uh
 global
 politics
 that
 that


should
 end
 like
 what
 we
 need
 to


concentrate
 right
 now
 is
 on
 our
 material


security
 surv
 survival
 I
 mean
 we
 have


massive
 gaps
 in
 our
 national


infrastructure
 I
 mean
 madamel
 brought
 up


the
 Arctic
 I
 mean
 I
 could
 not
 agree
 more


like
 priority
 one
 all
 other
 priorities


rescinded
 um
 but
 you
 know
 we
 don't
 have


an
 effective
 u
 security
 service
 security


apparatus
 for
 our
 national
 interest
 and


we
 don't
 have
 an
 effective
 military
 that


can
 protect
 us
 from
 from
 actual
 you
 know


annexation
 as
 forces.
 These
 are
 the


priorities
 that
 we
 need
 to
 focus
 on.
 Not


you
 know
 the
 multilateral
 uh
 world
 that


we
 came
 from
 and
 that
 of
 course
 we
 feel


most
 comfortable
 in
 and
 that
 god
 knows
 I


wish
 we
 were
 back
 in.
 Um
 but
 you
 know
 I


think
 in
 the
 at
 least
 in
 the
 short
 to


medium
 term
 but
 probably
 for
 the
 next


couple
 of
 decades
 uh
 our
 own
 survival
 as


a
 democracy
 as
 a
 multicultural
 democracy


um
 and
 and
 as
 a
 society
 in
 which
 um


education
 and
 and
 the
 values
 that
 we


have
 aspired
 to
 can
 be
 maintained.
 That


needs
 to
 be
 our
 priority.


>> All right,
 Madame
 Blair,
 you
 get
 the


last
 30
 seconds.
 What
 does
 that
 role


look
 like
 for
 Canada
 right
 now?


>> Well,
 I
 do
 agree.
 I
 think
 I
 think
 in
 a


sense
 we
 have
 to
 be
 careful
 not
 to
 I
 I


hear
 a
 lot
 of
 issues
 about
 a
 coalition


of
 the
 willing
 and
 all
 of
 this.
 I
 I
 I


just
 don't
 see
 it.
 And
 we've
 heard


things
 like
 Canada
 should
 join
 the
 EU.


Look,
 we're
 not
 European.
 Uh
 and
 and
 I
 I


>> most
 Europeans
 I
 speak
 to
 don't
 think


this
 is
 even
 feasible.
 So,
 no,
 I
 don't


think
 we
 should
 look
 to
 join
 another


club
 or
 create
 another
 club.
 I
 think
 we


should
 really
 focus
 on
 where
 we
 are.
 I


think
 there
 are
 alliances
 that
 we
 can


build.
 There's
 no
 doubt
 about
 that
 and


we
 can
 continue
 to
 be
 reliable
 partners


around
 the
 world.
 We
 need
 to
 look
 to


markets.
 Uh
 but
 I
 don't
 think
 we
 need
 to


look
 for
 a
 a
 policing
 role
 or
 or
 trying


to
 replace
 the
 United
 States
 um
 as
 as


the
 beacon
 of
 democratic
 values.
 I
 think


that
 that
 would
 be
 very
 difficult
 to


achieve
 and
 also
 very
 dangerous.
 Um
 so
 I


think
 instead
 of
 of
 virtue
 signaling,


let's
 focusing
 on
 our
 interest.


>> Well,
 we
 are
 going
 to
 leave
 it
 there.


Madame
 BL
 Steven,
 thank
 you
 very
 much


for
 your
 time
 and
 your
 insights.


>> Pleasure.
