If
 you've
 been
 laid
 off
 from
 a
 tech
 job


and
 you're
 sick
 of
 taxes
 and
 now
 you're


eyeing
 Dubai
 thinking
 tax-free
 salaries


in
 sunshine,
 how
 bad
 can
 it
 possibly
 be?


Hold
 up.
 I've
 spent
 several
 months


interviewing
 in
 the
 UAE
 and
 Saudi


Arabia,
 and
 I
 got
 to
 learn
 a
 lot
 about


this
 market.
 So,
 let's
 look
 at
 what
 it's


really
 like
 to
 live
 and
 work
 there
 and


whether
 it's
 worth
 considering
 it
 in


2025.
 If
 you're
 considering
 a
 move
 to


the
 Middle
 East
 for
 work,
 there
 are
 a


few
 things
 most
 people
 don't
 realize


about
 the
 job
 market
 there.
 Stick
 around


till
 the
 end
 of
 the
 video.
 This
 could


save
 you
 months
 of
 wasted
 effort.
 The


United
 Arab
 Emirates
 and
 Dubai
 in


particular
 has
 invested
 heavily
 in
 tech


branding
 and
 marketing,
 and
 they've


earned
 their
 right
 to
 brag.
 You've


probably
 seen
 those
 famous
 photos
 of


Dubai
 in
 the
 ' 70s
 versus
 today.
 Now,
 if


building
 skyscrapers
 in
 the
 middle
 of
 a


desert
 does
 not
 impress
 you
 as
 much,
 get


this.
 They
 have
 learned
 to
 change
 the


climate
 of
 their
 country.
 While
 American


and
 Canadian
 health
 care
 systems
 still


use


facts,
 the
 UAE
 changes
 the
 climate
 above


their
 heads.
 Let's
 start
 with
 the
 tech


ecosystem.
 It
 is
 dominated
 by
 service


tech.
 It
 is
 huge
 on
 fintech
 and
 crypto


and
 all
 kinds
 of
 software
 that
 optimize


services,
 food
 delivery,
 transportation,


payments.
 It's
 common
 for
 people
 who


work
 in
 tech
 and
 live
 in
 Dubai
 to
 not


cook,
 to
 not
 clean,
 to
 not
 park
 their


cars
 because
 it's
 very
 common
 to


delegate
 chores
 to
 service
 workers.
 And


tech
 is
 often
 built
 around
 those
 needs.


But
 this
 is
 not
 North
 America.
 It
 is
 not


top
 tech
 countries
 of
 Europe.
 It
 is
 not


a
 productled
 culture
 at
 all.
 It
 is


heavily
 serviceled,
 consultantheavy


scene.
 think
 digital
 transformation


projects
 for
 government
 agencies
 or
 big


corpse
 and
 not
 shipping
 globally


disruptive
 consumer
 tech.
 They're
 trying


to
 get
 there
 which
 is
 one
 of
 the
 reasons


they
 highly
 favor
 expats
 from
 the
 US,


Canada
 and
 Europe.
 Dubai
 is
 very
 polar


in
 that
 regard
 in
 my
 humble
 opinion


because
 there
 are
 things
 that
 are
 so


advanced
 your
 jaw
 drops.
 And
 it's
 not


just
 tech.
 Like
 when
 I
 was
 considering


moving
 there,
 I
 saw
 this
 ski
 machine
 in


a
 mall.
 And
 let
 me
 tell
 you,
 I
 live
 in


Canada
 and
 I
 probably
 ski
 less
 than


people
 in
 Dubai.
 Clinics,
 health


centers,
 open
 24/7,
 service
 of
 any
 kind


delivered
 to
 you
 within
 minutes.


Glamorous
 cars,
 apartments,
 weddings,


all
 those
 beautiful
 things.
 But
 that


doesn't
 belittle
 the
 fact
 that
 B2B
 scene


is
 very
 much
 behind.
 On
 the
 positive


side,
 the
 country
 has
 world-class


infrastructure,
 uninterrupted


connectivity,
 and
 pro
 business


environment
 that
 attracts
 both
 global


tech
 giants
 and
 ambitious
 founders.
 On


the
 negative
 side,
 many
 companies,


especially
 traditional
 B2B,
 still


struggle
 with
 legacy
 systems,
 outdated


business
 models,
 or
 complete
 absence
 of


digitalization.
 I
 have
 personally


interviewed
 at
 companies
 that
 would
 flat


out
 tell
 me
 that
 what
 they
 were
 building


is
 not
 innovative
 at
 all
 and
 the
 kind
 of


technology
 that
 they
 want
 has
 already


been
 the
 standard
 in
 the
 west
 for
 years,


but
 it
 hasn't
 been
 adapted
 to
 the
 Middle


Eastern
 market,
 which
 is
 why
 they're


building
 it.
 So,
 if
 you
 interview
 at
 B2B


firms,
 just
 know
 that
 it
 is
 not
 uncommon


to
 be
 asked
 to
 spend
 the
 first
 several


years
 dragging
 them
 to
 the
 baseline


standards.
 And
 yes,
 this
 pattern
 exists


in
 many
 parts
 of
 the
 world,
 but
 in
 the


Middle
 East
 specifically,
 it
 is
 often


explained
 by
 the
 regional
 nuances
 of
 the


market.
 This
 is
 what
 I
 mean
 when
 I
 say


that
 it
 feels
 polar.
 For
 example,
 here's


a
 piece
 of
 very
 recent
 news.
 The
 United


Arab
 Emirates
 and
 the
 United
 States
 have


signed
 an
 agreement
 for
 the
 Gulf
 country


to
 build
 the
 largest
 artificial


intelligence
 campus
 outside
 of
 the


United
 States.
 At
 the
 same
 time,
 B2B
 is


full
 of
 eyeopening
 examples
 of
 deeply


entrenched
 legacy
 systems.
 Outdated


point
 of
 sale,
 inventory,
 and
 supply


chain
 tools
 are
 still
 common,
 which


leads
 to
 limited
 data
 visibility,
 slower


fulfillment,
 and
 friction
 when


integrating
 with
 modern
 e-commerce


platforms.
 There
 is
 lots
 of
 noise
 about


VC
 growth,
 and
 the
 region's
 total
 VC


funding
 in
 2024
 was
 under
 $4
 billion.


For
 context,
 that's
 what
 New
 York
 pulls


in
 in
 a
 single
 quarter.
 Quality
 of


talent.
 Now,
 this
 part
 is
 tricky.
 The


engineering
 and
 product
 talent
 pool
 is


extremely
 global.
 You
 will
 work
 with


folks
 from
 Eastern
 Europe,
 the
 European


Union,
 Canada,
 and
 some
 parts
 of
 Asia.


But
 senior
 leadership
 talent
 with
 global


experience
 is
 scarce.
 It
 exists,
 but


it's
 not
 common.
 I've
 had
 tens
 of


interviews
 in
 Dubai,
 and
 I
 did
 heavy


research
 on
 every
 single
 person
 who
 was


interviewing
 me.
 And
 no,
 it
 is
 almost


impossible
 to
 find
 people
 with
 résumés


that
 you
 would
 typically
 see
 in
 New


York,
 London,
 Toronto,
 or
 Seattle.
 And


it
 makes
 sense
 because
 if
 you're
 high
 up


in
 your
 career,
 which
 means
 we're


probably
 talking
 40
 years
 of
 age
 and


older,
 and
 you
 work
 in
 a
 tier
 one


market,
 the
 salary
 that
 you're
 making


most
 likely
 beats
 the
 salary
 that
 you


will
 be
 offered
 in
 Dubai.
 Plus,
 your


career
 already
 heavily
 depends
 on
 the


network
 around
 you.
 If
 you're
 surprised


about
 the
 salaries,
 I
 recommend
 that
 you


check
 out
 this
 video
 that
 I
 made
 about


the
 UAE
 compensation.
 Spoiler,
 it's
 less


than
 you
 think.
 So,
 back
 to
 the


leadership
 talent
 that
 I
 was
 talking


about.
 People
 who
 reach
 senior


leadership
 levels
 in
 tier
 one
 markets


tend
 to
 stay
 in
 tier
 one
 markets
 and
 not


move
 to
 the
 UAE.
 The
 UAE
 is
 a
 common


choice
 for
 people
 who
 worked
 in
 tier
 one


economies,
 got
 up
 to
 midlevel,
 got
 tired


of
 taxes,
 and
 started
 looking
 for


alternatives.
 So,
 they
 become
 senior
 in


the
 UAE
 ecosystem.
 So,
 don't
 expect


challenging
 peer
 feedback
 loops
 or


strong
 product
 market
 fit
 intuition


unless
 you
 bring
 those
 skills
 yourself.


If
 you're
 a
 PM
 or
 a
 designer,
 expect
 to


spend
 a
 lot
 of
 time
 educating
 upward.


Stakeholders
 often
 come
 from
 non-
 tech


backgrounds,
 especially
 in
 conglomerates


and
 government
 orgs.
 The
 vibe.
 The
 UAE


sells
 a
 dream.
 Tax-free
 income,
 luxury


lifestyle,
 and
 safety.
 And
 for
 some,
 it


works.
 But
 I
 read
 an
 observation
 by
 a


founder
 that
 I'm
 following
 in
 LinkedIn.


He
 is
 an
 active
 digital
 nomad,
 and
 he


spent
 several
 years
 working
 in
 the
 UAE.


And
 one
 interesting
 observation
 that


caught
 my
 attention
 was
 that
 he
 noticed


that
 Dubai
 is
 rarely
 liked
 by
 people
 who


grew
 up
 in
 highly
 aesthetic
 countries.


So
 he
 said
 that
 you
 will
 not
 find
 a
 lot


of
 people
 who
 are
 Parisorn
 or
 Vienna


born
 or
 Budapest
 born
 staying
 there
 for


a
 long
 time
 and
 saying
 yes
 Dubai
 is
 my


jam.
 as
 lavish
 and
 as
 glamorous
 as
 it


can
 be,
 it
 can
 also
 be
 very
 fake,
 very


plastic,
 and
 very
 artificial.
 And
 I


think
 one's
 perception
 of
 the
 UAE
 and


Dubai
 specifically
 really
 depends
 on
 the


place
 that
 you're
 coming
 from.
 Now,
 the


universal
 qualities
 that
 are
 liked
 by


most
 people
 is
 that
 it's
 very
 clean,


it's
 warm,
 and
 logistics
 are
 world


class.
 Security,
 unless
 you
 work
 in


shady
 industries,
 is
 topnotch.
 But


behind
 the
 influencer
 reels,
 here
 is


what
 doesn't
 get
 said
 very
 often.
 It's
 a


fast-moving
 society.
 People
 cycle
 in
 and


out
 every
 few
 years.
 You
 will
 rarely


feel
 settled
 unless
 you're
 in
 a


tight-knit
 exp.
 The
 pace
 is
 fast,
 but


not
 innovative.
 It's
 hustle
 culture


without
 the
 upside
 equity.
 And


everything
 from
 visas
 to
 jobs
 is


employer
 tied.
 You
 don't
 own
 your
 life


there.
 One
 more
 thing
 on
 the
 common
 perk


of
 the
 UEE,
 which
 is
 taxation.
 Everybody


knows
 that
 the
 UAE
 as
 well
 as
 Saudi


Arabia,
 for
 example,
 does
 not
 impose


personal
 income
 tax
 on
 individuals.


However,
 Americans
 working
 in
 the
 UAE


face
 different
 tax
 and
 compliance


obligations
 compared
 to
 Europeans
 or


Canadians.
 The
 US
 citizens
 are
 required


by
 their
 government
 to
 file
 annual


federal
 tax
 returns
 and
 report
 their


worldwide
 income
 to
 the
 US
 regardless
 of


where
 they
 live.
 Yeah,
 the
 double


taxation
 is
 the
 price
 of
 the
 American


citizenship.
 Now,
 Americans
 can
 use


provisions
 like
 the
 foreign
 earned


income
 exclusion
 and
 foreign
 tax
 credit


to
 reduce
 or
 eliminate
 double
 taxation,


but
 they
 still
 face
 ongoing,
 often


complex
 US
 tax
 filing
 requirements,
 and


they
 face
 them
 for
 life
 unless
 they


renounce
 the
 citizenship.
 In
 contrast,


Europeans
 and
 Canadians
 generally
 do
 not


have
 to
 file
 or
 pay
 taxes
 to
 their
 home


countries
 once
 they
 become


non-residents,
 meaning
 they
 lose
 their


tax
 residency
 in
 their
 home
 country
 and


sever
 significant
 residential
 ties,


allowing
 them
 to
 fully
 benefit
 from
 the


UAE's
 tax-free
 environment.
 So,
 while


all
 Western
 expats
 can
 enjoy
 the
 UAE's


lack
 of
 personal
 income
 tax,
 American


citizens
 face
 the
 unique
 burden
 of


continuous
 tax
 reporting
 and
 potential


liability
 to
 their
 home
 country.
 As
 for


the
 Europeans
 and
 Canadians,
 the
 loss
 of


tax
 residency
 means
 different
 things
 in


different
 countries.
 So
 do
 your
 due


diligence
 to
 understand
 all
 the
 nuances


of
 the
 taxation
 in
 your
 particular


country.
 But
 in
 Canada,
 for
 example,


those
 who
 choose
 to
 live
 and
 work
 abroad


must
 ensure
 that
 they
 have
 broken


residential
 ties
 with
 Canada.
 Otherwise,


they
 may
 remain
 subject
 to
 Canadian
 tax


on
 their
 global
 income
 even
 while
 living


in
 the
 UAE.
 Canadians
 also
 lose


government
 health
 insurance
 plan
 when
 we


sever
 our
 tax
 residency
 because
 our


provincial
 health
 coverage
 is
 tied
 to


our
 residency
 status
 and
 most
 provinces


require
 individuals
 to
 be
 physically


present
 for
 a
 certain
 number
 of
 months


each
 year
 in
 the
 country
 to
 maintain


that
 coverage.
 So
 if
 your
 country's


health
 care
 services
 are
 important
 to


you
 and
 you're
 exploring
 the
 move
 to
 the


Middle
 East,
 just
 keep
 that
 in
 mind.


Cost
 of
 living.
 No
 tax
 advantage
 is


real,
 but
 Dubai
 is
 not
 cheap.
 Rent
 has


skyrocketed
 postcoid
 with
 expat
 heavy


areas
 like
 Marina
 and
 downtown
 seeing
 up


to
 40%
 increase
 in
 the
 past
 two
 years.


School
 fees
 are
 outrageous
 if
 you
 have


kids.
 15
 to
 $30,000
 per
 child
 annually.


Car
 culture
 is
 real.
 Public


transportation
 is
 very
 limited
 and
 Dubai


is
 not
 a
 very
 walkable
 city
 which
 is


painful
 for
 many
 Europeans.
 When
 is


Dubai
 a
 good
 idea?
 Dubai
 and
 the
 UAE
 in


general
 make
 sense
 if
 you
 can
 close
 your


eyes
 on
 the
 luxury
 lifestyle
 and
 save


50%
 of
 your
 budget.
 Another
 thing
 that


is
 rarely
 mentioned
 is
 that
 you
 should


always
 negotiate
 housing
 allowances
 as
 a


separate
 line
 item
 in
 your
 contract.


Many
 companies
 in
 the
 UAE
 will
 lowball


your
 package
 unless
 you
 ask.
 Lastly,
 it


is
 a
 lot
 less
 common
 to
 get
 your
 housing


reimbured
 these
 days.
 This
 used
 to
 be
 a


thing
 that
 the
 UAE
 offered
 back
 in
 mid


2010s
 to
 attract
 more
 talent,
 but
 it
 is


a
 lot
 less
 common
 to
 have
 that
 kind
 of


perk
 now.
 So,
 if
 you
 heard
 stories
 from


people
 who
 moved
 there
 10
 years
 ago,
 I


would
 say
 do
 not
 count
 on
 your


accommodation
 being
 reimbured.
 It
 is
 a


good
 idea
 if
 you're
 a
 mid
 to
 senior


professional
 from
 Canada,
 the
 EU,
 or
 the


US
 looking
 to
 stack
 cash
 tax-free
 and


then
 invest
 in
 a
 property,
 for example,


and
 you
 want
 to
 do
 it
 faster
 than
 you'd


be
 able
 to
 do
 it
 in
 your
 home
 country.


But
 once
 again,
 this
 only
 works
 if


you're
 able
 to
 close
 your
 eyes
 on
 the


luxury
 lifestyle
 that
 Dubai
 pushes
 you


to
 have.
 It's
 harder
 than
 most
 people


think.
 It
 is
 a
 good
 choice
 if
 you


believe
 in
 getting
 in
 early
 into


emerging
 markets.
 And
 lastly,
 if
 you're


fine
 with
 playing
 a
 leadership
 or
 a


mentorship
 role,
 not
 necessarily


building
 nextgen
 tech,
 it
 also
 it
 is
 a


much
 better
 choice
 for
 people
 who
 want


to
 end
 up
 in
 entrepreneurship,
 not


employment.
 Because
 the
 real
 perks
 of


the
 UEE
 come
 into
 play
 when
 you
 are
 an


entrepreneur,
 not
 an
 employee.
 Now,
 when


is
 it
 not
 a
 good
 idea?
 It
 is
 not
 a
 good


idea
 if
 you
 want
 to
 build
 deep
 tech
 or


grow
 your
 product
 intuition
 in
 a


fastmoving
 user
 centric
 environment.


You're
 optimizing
 for
 a
 long-term
 equity


startup
 culture
 or
 meaningful
 career


mentorship.
 It
 may
 not
 be
 the
 best


choice
 for
 people
 who
 consider


themselves
 socially
 progressive
 and
 very


democratic
 if
 you
 know
 what
 I
 mean.


Conclusion.
 So
 all
 in
 all,
 Dubai
 is
 not


the
 next
 Silicon
 Valley,
 but
 it
 is
 a


global
 sandbox
 where
 experienced


professionals
 can
 make
 more
 money
 than


back
 in
 their
 home
 countries,
 live


comfortably,
 and
 try
 things
 that
 might


not
 fly
 in
 more
 regulated
 systems.
 Just


not
 what
 you're
 training
 and
 what
 you're


not
 getting.
 Moving
 on
 to
 Saudi
 Arabia


tech
 scene
 and


culture.
 Saudi
 Arabia
 is
 not
 quietly


trying
 to
 build
 a
 tech
 ecosystem.
 It's


throwing
 hundreds
 of
 billions
 of
 dollars


at
 it.
 Their
 strategy
 is
 to
 buy
 talent,


fund
 labs,
 and
 attract
 founders.
 Saudi


Arabia
 is
 making
 massive
 investments
 in


technology
 with
 figures
 around
 100


billion
 dollars
 being
 cited
 for
 AI
 and


tech
 initiatives,
 including
 projects


like
 NEOM
 and
 various
 AI
 hubs.
 These


investments
 are
 part
 of
 the
 vision
 2030


strategy
 to
 diversify
 the
 economy
 away


from
 oil
 dependents
 and
 build
 a
 global


tech
 hub.
 Most

 are
 tied
 to


infrastructure,
 consulting
 or
 government


mandates,
 not
 productled
 companies.
 Neon


is
 still
 more
 of
 a
 construction
 zone


than
 a
 functioning
 tech
 city.
 The


ecosystem
 does
 not
 yet
 have
 enough


technical
 founders,
 PMs
 or
 designers
 to


be
 self-
 sustaining.
 Here
 are
 some


examples
 of
 notable
 Saudi

and
 companies.

 You'll
 see


some
 American

 the
 actual

is
 very
 thin.
 Quality
 of
 talent.
 The


technical
 talent
 pool
 is
 mostly
 local.


The
 western
 talent
 is
 not
 as
 common
 due


to
 how
 conservative
 the
 country
 is.
 But


those
 who
 get
 tired
 of
 taxation
 and


realize
 that
 the
 UAE
 is
 not
 going
 to
 cut


it
 are
 actively
 exploring
 Saudi
 Arabia.


It
 is
 not
 nearly
 as
 saturated
 as
 the


UAE.
 However,
 there
 is
 a
 trend
 among


Western
 tech
 workers,
 especially
 those


seeking
 lower
 taxation
 or
 opportunities


in
 the
 emerging
 markets.
 And
 the
 trend


is
 that
 a
 lot
 of
 tech
 workers
 are


actively
 exploring
 Saudi
 Arabia
 roles
 as


the
 UEE
 becomes
 more
 saturated
 and
 less


attractive
 for
 certain
 profiles.
 Saudi


nationals
 in
 tech
 exist,
 but
 there
 are


minority
 and
 execution
 focused
 roles,


often
 fast-tracked
 into
 management
 due


to
 localization
 policies,
 which
 on
 one


hand
 I
 completely
 understand.
 On
 the


other
 hand,
 if
 you're
 going
 there
 as
 an


outsider,
 you're
 going
 to
 have
 a
 very


hard
 time
 climbing
 the
 corporate
 ladder.


Product
 managers
 and
 designers
 from


global
 top
 tier
 environments
 are


extremely
 rare.
 You
 won't
 find
 a
 lot
 of


people
 who
 have
 scaled
 things,
 run


experiments,
 or
 built
 user-
 centric


platforms
 that
 really
 succeeded.
 While


your
 title
 might
 sound
 senior,
 the


actual
 leverage
 will
 likely
 be
 low.
 The


ORC
 chart
 often
 defers
 to
 local


ownership
 even
 when
 experience
 skews
 the


other
 way.
 The
 vibe
 Saudi
 Arabia
 is
 very


different
 from
 the
 UAE.
 It
 is
 much
 more


conservative,
 more
 hierarchical
 and
 more


build
 the
 future
 by
 2030
 whether
 it's


ready
 or
 not.
 But
 on
 the
 upside,
 you


will
 have
 access
 to
 insane
 budgets
 and


ambitions
 you
 have
 never
 seen
 anywhere


else.
 Things
 that
 Saudi
 Arabia
 claims
 to


want
 to
 build
 is
 unlike
 anything
 else


anywhere
 in
 the
 world.
 Projects
 move


fast
 because
 they
 are
 top
 down.
 But


social
 freedoms
 are
 limited.
 It
 is
 not


very
 walkable.
 It
 is
 not
 very
 diverse.


And
 it's
 not
 a
 tech
 community
 in
 the


real
 sense
 of
 the
 word.
 You
 will
 be


isolated
 if
 you're
 not
 a
 part
 of
 a


corporate
 expat
 compound.
 Unlike
 the
 UAE


where
 you
 can
 function
 just
 fine
 in


English,
 in
 Saudi
 you
 will
 be
 working


with
 locals
 much
 more
 directly.
 If
 you


don't
 speak
 any
 Arabic
 and
 not
 planning


on
 learning
 it,
 you'll
 hit
 friction
 very


fast.
 It's
 not
 just
 nice
 to
 have.
 It's


table
 stakes.
 Many
 job
 postings
 are


written
 in
 Arabic
 or
 list
 Arabic
 as
 a


requirement.
 There
 are
 some
 exceptions.


For
 example,
 highly
 specialized
 or


senior
 experts.
 Those
 in
 highly


technical,
 niche
 or
 senior
 roles
 may
 be


able
 to
 function
 without
 Arabic.
 But


these
 positions
 are
 usually
 the


exception
 rather
 than
 the
 rule.
 Remote


roles
 or
 those
 in
 companies
 with
 an


international
 focus
 may
 be
 more


flexible.
 But
 even
 here,
 Arabic
 is
 a


strong
 asset.
 Few
 words
 on
 the
 Saudi


Arabia's
 vision
 2030
 strategy.
 Saudi


Arabia's
 vision
 2030
 is
 a
 sweeping


national
 strategy
 launched
 in
 2016
 by


Crown
 Prince
 Muhammad
 bin
 Salman
 to


transform
 the
 kingdom's
 economy,


society,
 and
 global
 standing.
 The
 core


aim
 is
 to
 reduce
 Saudi
 Arabia's
 historic


dependence
 on
 oil
 by
 diversifying
 into


sectors
 such
 as
 technology,
 tourism,


entertainment,
 health,
 and
 renewable


energy.
 Now,
 why
 is
 this
 a
 big
 deal?
 And


how
 come
 such
 a
 conservative
 place
 like


Saudi
 Arabia
 is
 becoming
 a
 new
 hot
 trend


among
 tech
 experts?
 Saudi
 Arabia's


vision
 2030
 is
 a
 big
 deal
 for
 tech


workers
 because
 the
 kingdom
 announced


its
 plans
 to
 transform
 into
 one
 of
 the


world's
 most
 dynamic
 tech
 markets,


opening
 up
 unprecedented
 opportunities


and
 reshaping
 the
 regional
 job


landscape.
 The
 government
 aims
 to
 grow


the
 tech
 sector's
 share
 of
 the
 GDP
 from


1
 to
 5%
 by
 2030.
 Investing
 billions
 in


digital
 infrastructure,
 artificial


intelligence,
 cloud
 computing,
 and
 smart


cities
 like
 NAM
 and
 Riyaz's
 digital


corridor.
 They're
 doing
 everything
 to


create
 a
 tech
 talent
 pipeline
 while
 new


policies
 are
 also
 supporting
 partnership


with
 global
 tech
 giants
 and
 a
 focus
 on


STEM
 education
 even
 for
 women.
 But
 to


keep
 things
 fair
 and
 realistic,
 as


always,
 I'd
 like
 to
 point
 out,
 take


these
 facts
 with
 a
 grain
 of
 salt,
 do


your
 research
 and
 visit
 the
 country
 at


least
 once
 before
 moving
 there.
 The


operative
 word
 here
 is
 vision
 2030,
 not


reality
 2030.
 All
 these
 plans
 sound
 fine


and
 dandy,
 but
 again,
 Saudi
 is
 an


emerging
 market,
 not
 an
 established
 one.


Things
 may
 or
 may
 not
 unfold
 as


expected,
 or
 they
 may
 happen
 in
 a


completely
 different
 way.
 If
 you
 plan
 on


exploring
 Saudi
 Arabia,
 just
 keep
 in


mind
 and
 be
 comfortable
 with
 the
 fact


that
 you're
 betting
 on
 an
 emerging


market.
 That's
 all
 I'm
 saying.
 Cost
 of


living.
 Several
 cities
 in
 Saudi
 Arabia


are
 emerging
 as
 tech
 hubs,
 each
 playing


a
 distinct
 role
 in
 the
 kingdom's
 digital


transformation.
 Riyad
 the
 capital
 is


recognized
 as
 the
 highest
 ranked
 startup


ecosystem
 in
 the
 country
 and
 among
 the


top
 100
 globally.
 Fueled
 by
 heavy


investment,
 venture
 capital
 activity
 and


a
 thriving
 fintech
 and
 e-commerce
 scene.


The
 city
 hosts
 flagship
 events
 like
 the


LEAB
 conference,
 NEOM,
 the
 ambitious


smart
 city
 project
 designed
 as
 a


futuristic
 smart
 city
 with
 integrated


AI,
 robotics,
 and
 renewable
 energy.


Jedha,
 another
 key
 city,
 is
 fostering
 a


growing
 digital
 ecosystem
 supported
 by


government
 initiatives
 and
 startup


programs.
 Together,
 these
 cities
 are


central
 to
 Saudi
 Arabia's
 vision
 2030,


positioning
 the
 kingdom
 as
 the
 regional


leader
 in
 technology,
 innovation,
 and


entrepreneurship.
 There
 is
 no
 income
 tax


and
 Saudi
 is
 more
 affordable
 than
 the


UAE.
 And
 there
 are
 a
 few
 reasons
 for


that.
 Saudi
 population
 is
 much
 higher


than
 the
 Amiradis,
 and
 they
 do
 not


depend
 on
 expats
 as
 much
 as
 the
 UAE


does.
 They've
 got
 plenty
 of
 locals,
 but


if
 you
 receive
 a
 senior
 level
 package,


they
 usually
 come
 fully
 loaded,
 housing


paid,
 driver
 transport
 covered,
 flights


home,
 frequent
 bonuses.
 It's
 the
 kind
 of


package
 that
 the
 UAE
 used
 to
 offer
 10
 or


15
 years
 back.
 Many
 people
 who
 know
 a


lot
 about
 the
 UAE
 and
 who
 work
 there
 say


that
 Saudi
 reminds
 them
 of
 the
 UAE
 10
 to


15
 years
 ago.
 Now,
 a
 hot
 tip.
 Never


accept
 an
 offer
 without
 verifying
 the


benefits
 in
 writing.
 Many
 recruiters


oversell,
 especially
 for
 expats.
 So,


when
 is
 Saudi
 Arabia
 a
 good
 idea?
 It
 is


a
 good
 idea
 if
 you
 are
 trying
 to
 stack


tax-free
 cash
 for
 2
 to
 three
 years
 and


can
 tolerate
 friction.
 If
 you're
 a


builder
 who
 doesn't
 mind
 chaos
 and


thrives
 in
 top-down
 execution.
 If
 you're


an
 infrastructure,
 data,
 cloud,
 or


consulting,
 not
 consumer
 tech.
 When
 is


Saudi
 Arabia
 not
 a
 good
 idea?
 If
 you


care
 about
 product
 autonomy,
 user


obsession
 or
 startup
 culture,
 if
 you're


looking
 to
 grow
 within
 a
 strong
 peer


community
 of
 builders,
 if
 you
 value


progressive
 social
 norms
 or
 work
 life


balance.
 Conclusion.
 So
 all
 in
 all,


Saudi
 Arabia
 isn't
 trying
 to
 be
 the
 next


Dubai.
 Also,
 they're
 not
 trying
 to
 be


the
 next
 Silicon
 Valley.
 So
 don't
 go


there
 thinking
 you'll
 build
 the
 next
 big


thing.
 You
 will
 be
 building
 someone


else's
 vision
 and
 cashing
 their
 checks.


So
 if
 Dubai
 is
 the
 sandbox
 where
 you
 get


speed
 and
 glamour,
 Saudi
 is
 the
 blank


slate
 with
 money
 and
 mandates.
 Neither


is
 the
 startup
 ecosystem,
 but
 both
 let


you
 play
 roles
 you
 might
 not
 land
 back


home.
 One
 last
 thing,
 if
 there
 is
 one


scenario
 where
 I
 truly
 believe
 that


career
 consultants
 are
 worth
 every


dollar,
 it's
 when
 you're
 planning
 a
 move


to
 the
 Middle
 East,
 especially
 if
 you're


coming
 from
 a
 country
 with
 a
 very


different
 culture
 and
 tech
 scene.
 In
 the


UAE
 and
 Saudi
 Arabia,
 there
 are
 multiple


companies
 that
 either
 hire
 exclusively


through
 networks
 or
 through


recommendations
 from
 career
 consultants,


period.
 They
 do
 not
 consider
 outsiders.


And
 there
 is
 no
 way
 to
 tell
 just
 by


looking
 at
 job
 postings
 whether
 a


company
 hires
 through
 networks
 or
 not.


They
 all
 look
 the
 same.
 But
 when
 you


talk
 to
 someone
 on
 the
 inside,
 someone


who
 understands
 the
 nuances
 and
 has
 a


network
 among
 recruiters,
 HR,
 and
 hiring


managers,
 they
 can
 tell
 you
 exactly


which
 postings
 are
 worth
 your
 time
 and


which
 ones
 aren't.
 They
 can
 also


advocate
 for
 you
 and
 help
 with


referrals.
 When
 I
 worked
 with
 a


consultant,
 I'd
 send
 them
 a
 list
 of


companies
 I
 was
 applying
 to,
 and
 they'd


send
 it
 back
 with
 insights
 on
 which
 ones


actually
 hire
 through
 job
 postings
 and


which
 ones
 don't.
 Also,
 do
 not
 assume


that
 a
 company's
 reputation
 globally


reflects
 the
 nature
 of
 the
 roles


locally.
 Take
 Amazon
 in
 the
 UE
 as
 an


example.
 You
 might
 think,
 "Okay,
 great,


fang."
 But
 if
 you
 dig
 into
 the
 openings,


you
 will
 see
 that
 most
 roles
 are
 in


sales,
 not
 R&D
 or
 product
 development.


If
 you
 decide
 to
 go
 the
 cheaper
 route


and
 skip
 hiring
 a
 consultant,
 you
 will


still
 end
 up
 paying
 a
 price.
 Except
 in


this
 case,
 it's
 your
 time.
 So,
 I


personally
 highly
 recommend
 hiring
 a


local
 recruitment
 or
 career
 consultant.


And
 that's
 a
 wrap
 for
 the
 UAE
 and
 Saudi


Arabia.
 Let
 me
 know
 what
 you
 guys
 think.


Next
 up,
 the
 United
 Kingdom,
 France,
 and


Germany.
 As
 always,
 I
 hope
 this
 was


helpful.
 Till
 next
 time.
 Bye.
