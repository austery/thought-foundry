In
 the
 jungles
 of
 northern
 Myanmar,


close
 to
 the
 border
 with
 China,
 a
 town


called
 Pangwa
 sits
 in
 a
 small
 valley.


It's
 surrounded
 by
 forested
 peaks
 that


are
 sometimes
 dusted
 with
 snow.
 But


against
 this
 scenic
 backdrop,
 a


sprawling
 industrial
 operation
 is


transforming
 the
 hilltops.
 So
 you
 have


these
 hills,
 these
 very,
 you
 know,


dramatic
 hill
 slopes
 with
 these
 pools


kind
 of
 midway
 up
 the
 hill.
 So
 there's


like
 kind
 of
 a
 lattice
 work
 of
 pipes


that's
 laid
 over
 bore
 holes.
 So
 yeah,
 it


is
 sort
 of
 industrial
 and
 dystopian,
 but


also
 set
 in
 a
 very
 remarkable,
 very


beautiful
 part
 of
 the
 world.


>> Timothy
 Mclofflin
 is
 a
 journalist
 and
 a


freelance
 contributor
 for
 Bloomberg


based
 in
 Singapore.
 He
 says
 Pangwa
 and


the
 surrounding
 region
 of
 Kachin
 state


have
 come
 into
 the
 spotlight
 lately


because
 the
 ground
 there
 is
 rich
 with


precious
 metals,
 rare
 earths
 that
 are
 in


high
 demand
 right
 now.


>> Myanmar
 is
 hugely
 significant
 in
 the


rare
 earths
 industry.
 It
 is
 the
 third


largest
 producer
 of
 rare
 earths
 globally


behind
 the
 US
 and
 China.


>> These
 rare
 earth
 elements
 are
 worth


billions
 of
 dollars.
 They're
 key


components
 in
 your
 iPhone,
 your
 electric


vehicles,
 and
 even
 missiles
 used
 by
 the


US
 military.
 And
 Myanmar
 isn't
 just
 any


producer
 of
 rare
 earths.
 It's
 a
 crucial


supplier
 to
 China,
 accounting
 for
 more


than
 half
 of
 the
 country's
 total
 imports


last
 year.
 But
 the
 region
 around
 Pangwa


has
 been
 disrupted
 by
 a
 long-running


conflict
 between
 Myanmar's
 military


honta
 and
 a
 rebel
 group,
 the
 Kachin


Independence
 Army,
 or
 KIA.


The
 current
 Hunter
 took
 power
 in
 2021


and
 it
 has
 been
 a
 very
 tumultuous
 bloody


period
 for
 the
 country
 for
 the
 past


couple
 years.
 It's
 important
 to
 to


understand
 that
 Myammar
 already
 had
 a


large
 number
 of
 armed
 groups
 who
 were


fighting
 the
 central
 military
 primarily


for
 greater
 autonomy
 for
 their
 ethnic


groups.
 And
 so
 the
 past
 4
 years
 has
 seen


a
 massive
 surge
 in
 fighting.
 You
 know,


the
 military
 has
 been
 able
 to
 hang
 on
 to


most
 of
 the
 middle
 of
 the
 country,
 but


their
 control
 over
 the
 periphery
 of
 the


country
 and
 the
 borderlands
 has
 suffered


quite
 a
 bit.


>> Pongwa
 is
 part
 of
 that
 embattled
 region.


The
 KIA
 took
 control
 of
 the
 area
 late


last
 year
 and
 that's
 created
 a
 headache


for
 China.
 So
 the
 takeover
 of
 these


mines
 by
 the
 KIA,
 a
 huge
 complicating


factor
 for
 Beijing
 and
 came
 at
 a
 really


inopportune
 time
 because
 rare
 earths


became
 this
 big
 global
 trade
 issue
 kind


of
 right
 as
 the
 KIA
 took
 over
 these


mines.
 And
 so
 Beijing
 and
 Chinese


companies
 are
 now
 buying
 rare
 earths


from
 them.
 So
 funding
 them,
 but
 then


they
 are
 also
 supporting
 the
 Myanmar


military
 dha.
 So
 they
 are
 on
 both
 sides


of
 this
 fight.

This
 is
 the
 Big
 Tech
 Asia
 from
 Bloomberg


News.
 I'm
 Juan
 Ha.
 Every
 week,
 we
 take


you
 inside
 some
 of
 the
 world's
 biggest


and
 most
 powerful
 economies
 and
 the


markets,
 tycoons,
 and
 businesses
 that


drive
 this
 evershifting
 region.
 Today
 on


the
 show,
 how
 a
 rebel
 army
 in
 Myanmar


became
 a
 major
 player
 in
 the
 rare


earth's
 industry
 and
 what
 its
 new


dominance
 means
 for
 China
 next
 door
 and


for
 global
 supply
 chains.


[Music]


Despite
 the
 name,
 rare
 earths
 are
 really


not
 that
 rare.
 They
 can
 be
 found
 all


over
 the
 world,
 but
 they're
 almost
 never


found
 on
 their
 own
 in
 nature.


The
 minerals
 are
 mixed
 in
 with
 other


elements
 in
 the
 ground
 and
 often
 at
 low


concentrations
 and
 that
 makes
 mining


them
 a
 complex
 process.
 In
 Myanmar,
 rare


earths
 are
 usually
 extracted
 from
 the


soil
 on
 hillsides.


>> So
 you
 have
 these
 very
 dramatic
 hill


slopes
 with
 these
 collection
 pools
 that


are
 sort
 of
 at
 the
 bottom
 midway
 up
 the


hill.
 The
 collection
 pools,
 they're


lined
 with
 tarps,
 so
 the
 water
 tends
 to


have
 this
 kind
 of
 turquoisey
 color
 to


it.
 And
 to
 get
 these
 rare
 earth
 elements


into
 these
 vast
 collection
 pools,
 a


process
 called
 INC2
 leeching
 comes
 in.


>> It's
 sort
 of
 like
 an
 IV
 drip
 for
 a


hillside.
 You're
 dripping
 this
 leeching


agent
 into
 the
 hillside.
 So
 there's
 like


kind
 of a
 lattice
 work
 of
 pipes
 that's


laid
 over
 bore
 holes
 and
 then
 there's


little
 taps.
 And
 so
 this
 is
 just
 going


down
 into
 the
 ground
 and
 then
 later


towards
 the
 bottom
 of
 the
 hill
 washed


out.
 And
 what
 comes
 out
 at
 the
 bottom
 is


this
 mixture
 of
 rare
 earth
 water


leeching
 agent
 that
 is
 collected
 in


large
 pools
 sort
 of
 like
 concrete


industrial
 swimming
 pools.
 And
 the
 rare


earth
 sludge
 settles
 at
 the
 bottom.
 The


water
 is
 drained
 off
 and
 that
 sludge
 is


then
 baked
 in
 these
 big
 furnaces
 that


look
 like
 massive
 pizza
 ovens
 and
 the


resulting
 product
 is
 a
 rare
 earth


oxides.


When
 demand
 for
 these
 metals
 began
 to


take
 off
 in
 the
 mid-200s,
 China
 was
 by


far
 the
 biggest
 miner
 of
 rare
 earths.
 It


accounted
 for
 nearly
 all
 of
 the
 world's


mined
 rare
 earth
 supply
 and
 was
 also
 the


biggest
 refiner.
 But
 around
 2010,
 China


began
 shutting
 down
 many
 of
 its
 small


scale
 mines.


>> China
 started
 to
 see
 the
 environmental


impact
 it
 was
 having.
 pumping
 millions


of
 liters
 of
 this
 fluid
 into
 the
 ground


had
 enormous
 ecological
 impact,


especially
 in
 waterheds
 and
 riverways.


>> The
 waste
 water
 that's
 full
 of
 chemicals


and
 toxins
 is
 typically
 directed
 right


back
 into
 the
 nearest
 river.
 It
 can


contaminate
 the
 soil
 and
 the
 waterways


downstream
 and
 cause
 landslides.
 A
 lot


of
 the
 mines
 that
 China
 shut
 down
 were


located
 in
 the
 country's
 southwest
 along


the
 frontier
 with
 Myanmar.
 And
 as
 the


industry
 shut
 down
 in
 China,
 the
 mine


operators
 looked
 just
 across
 the
 border


to
 get
 back
 to
 business.


>> You
 can
 see
 that
 on
 the
 ground
 level


when,
 you
 know,
 Chinese
 miners
 arriving,


but
 eventually
 you
 can
 start
 to
 see
 it


from
 space
 because
 the
 mines
 start
 to


get
 dug.
 The
 pools
 start
 to
 fill
 up.
 You


can
 also
 see
 the
 road
 network
 getting


built.
 And
 the
 road
 network
 kind
 of
 goes


not
 that
 far.
 It
 goes
 from
 China
 into


these
 mines
 and
 then
 and
 then
 the
 trucks


kind
 of
 go
 back
 out.
 A
 geospatial


analysis
 found
 that
 in
 just
 about
 7


years,
 hundreds
 of
 new
 mining
 sites
 have


sprung
 up
 in
 the
 area
 where
 Pangwa
 is


located.
 China
 became
 the
 biggest
 buyer


of
 Myanmar's
 rare
 earth.
 It
 imported


more
 than
 $800
 million
 by
 2021.
 That's


800
 times
 what
 it
 bought
 just
 a
 decade


ago.
 They
 have
 large
 deposits
 of
 two


specific
 elements
 uh
 which
 are
 turbium


and
 disprosium
 and
 they
 are
 important
 to


making
 rare
 earth
 magnets
 and
 these


magnets
 are
 now
 found
 in
 a
 lot
 of


electric
 vehicle
 drivetrains,
 wind


turbines,
 guided
 missile
 systems
 and


these
 two
 elements
 are
 added
 to
 magnets


to
 enhance
 their
 capabilities
 to
 make


them
 able
 to
 work
 at
 higher
 temperatures


without
 losing
 the
 magnetism
 that
 they


have.
 And
 so
 right
 now
 these
 magnets
 are


a
 huge
 point
 of
 contention
 between
 the


US
 and
 China.
 While
 these
 magnets
 are


coming
 from
 China
 because
 that's
 where


they
 are
 made,
 the
 elements
 that
 are


going
 into
 them
 are
 coming
 from
 Myanmar


in
 many
 cases.


>> And
 what
 kind
 of
 impact
 then
 are
 we


seeing
 of
 this
 mining
 boom
 on
 the


environment
 and
 on
 local
 communities?


You're
 seeing
 people
 and
 other
 groups


realize
 that
 there
 is
 a
 huge
 amount
 of


money,
 huge
 amount
 of
 demand.
 We're


going
 to
 see
 these
 mines
 expand
 probably


outside
 of
 Kachin
 State
 to
 places
 that


are
 controlled
 by
 other
 groups
 who
 think


that
 they
 have
 similar
 geology
 and
 they


can
 also
 kind
 of
 cash
 in
 on
 this,
 you


know,
 rare
 earth
 gold
 rush
 at
 the


moment.
 But
 they
 think
 the
 environmental


impact
 is
 probably
 the
 most
 pronounced


right
 now.
 You're
 seeing
 the
 rivers
 and


streams
 that
 are
 very
 important
 to
 the


way
 of
 life
 for
 small
 villages
 and


cities
 and
 towns
 in
 this
 part
 of
 the


world
 getting
 totally
 ruined.
 And
 it
 is


also
 becoming
 a
 crossber
 issue
 because


these
 watersheds
 run
 through
 Southeast


Asia
 and
 so
 some
 of
 this
 stuff
 is
 now


flowing
 into
 Thailand.
 And
 so
 you
 see


the
 Thai
 government,
 Thai
 civil
 society


becoming
 concerned
 about
 this.
 There's


also
 concerns
 about
 the
 structure
 of
 the


mines,
 the
 safety.
 You
 could
 imagine


pumping
 millions
 of
 gallons
 of
 liquid


into
 the
 side
 of
 a
 hill
 makes
 it


inherently
 unstable.
 Often
 people
 are


getting
 trapped
 in
 tunnels
 or
 killed
 by


landslides.
 So
 yes,
 overall


environmentally
 and
 labor
 regulations


wise
 very
 much
 sort
 of
 the
 wild
 west
 at


the
 moment.
 And
 while
 mining
 companies


have
 been
 tearing
 up
 the
 ground
 in


search
 of
 rare
 earth
 minerals,
 the


region
 around
 the
 mines
 is
 being
 torn
 by


a
 bloody
 conflict
 between
 the
 government


and
 rebel
 groups.
 After
 the
 break,
 the


crucial
 supply
 of
 rare
 earths
 in
 the


hands
 of
 a
 rebel
 army.
 The
 risks
 for


China
 and
 the
 world.


[Music]


For
 years,
 the
 town
 of
 Pangwa
 in


northern
 Myanmar
 was
 under
 the
 control


of
 a
 warlord
 allied
 with
 the
 country's


military
 honta.
 The
 rare
 earth's
 mines


in
 the
 region
 were
 operated
 by
 Chinese


companies
 and
 the
 shipments
 of
 the


precious
 metals
 ran
 like
 clockwork.


Reporter
 Tim
 Mclofflin
 says
 the
 Chinese


government
 generally
 sees
 Myanmar's


military
 regime
 as
 a
 stabilizing
 force


along
 its
 border.


>> Beijing's
 greatest
 fear
 is
 that
 the


country
 would
 splinter
 apart
 and
 there


would
 be
 some
 sort
 of
 Syria
 type


situation
 right
 on
 a
 huge
 border
 that


they
 have.
 And
 so
 they
 sat
 on
 the
 fence


for
 a
 while
 and
 then
 when
 they
 saw
 the


Myammar
 military
 started
 to
 struggle


last
 year
 and
 maybe
 losing
 some
 key


strategic
 outposts,
 they
 really
 kind
 of


came
 off
 the
 fence
 and
 threw
 their


support
 behind
 the
 Myanmar
 military.
 Not


because
 I
 think
 there's
 any
 deep
 love


there.
 I
 think
 it's
 because
 they
 really


fear
 the
 country
 just
 crumbling
 and
 they


think
 much
 like
 the
 Myanmar
 military


does
 that
 they
 are
 kind
 of
 the
 glue


holding
 this
 all
 together.


But
 that
 changed
 late
 last
 year
 when
 the


KIA,
 the
 armed
 ethnic
 group
 battling
 the


military
 honta
 advanced
 on
 Pangwa.


>> The
 Kachin
 Independence
 Army
 is
 fighting


a
 larger
 decadesl
 long
 struggle
 against


the
 Myanmar
 military
 for
 greater


autonomy
 for
 the
 Kachchin
 ethic
 people.


Late
 last
 year,
 the
 KIA
 started
 fighting


their
 way
 towards
 this
 point,
 looking
 to


capture
 not
 just
 Pangwa,
 but
 capture
 all


of
 Kachin
 Special
 Region
 One
 and
 kind
 of


take
 it
 as
 their
 own.


>> The
 KIA
 took
 control
 of
 Pangwa
 along


with
 hundreds
 of
 valuable
 rare
 earth


mines.
 Overnight,
 that
 made
 the
 rebel


army
 one
 of
 the
 largest
 players
 in
 the


rare
 earth
 industry.
 But
 Tim
 says
 this


change
 of
 control
 in
 Pangua
 has
 put


China
 in
 a
 difficult
 position.
 Its


border
 with
 Myanmar
 is
 long.
 So
 it
 needs


to
 secure
 the
 cooperation
 of
 the


military
 honta.
 But
 it
 also
 needs
 the


rare
 earths
 that
 are
 now
 controlled
 by


the
 rebels.


The
 KIA
 is
 complicated
 because
 they
 are


fighting
 the
 Myanmar
 Huna
 and
 so
 Beijing


and
 Chinese
 companies
 are
 now
 buying


rare
 earths
 from
 them.
 so
 funding
 them


but
 then
 they
 are
 also
 supporting
 the


Myanmar
 military
 the
 hunda
 so
 they
 are


on
 both
 sides
 of
 this
 fight
 and
 they


have
 voiced
 their
 displeasure
 to
 the
 KIA


they've
 also
 closed
 the
 border
 on


occasion
 to
 try
 to
 sort
 of
 force
 their


hand
 so
 we
 did
 see
 the
 mining
 shut
 down


and
 saw
 the
 border
 closed
 for
 a
 long


time
 it
 is
 since
 reopened
 because
 we


could
 see
 the
 exports
 going
 out
 of
 China


now
 so
 you
 know
 an
 agreement
 of
 some


sort
 between
 these
 companies
 between
 the


KIA
 between
 China
 has
 been
 reached
 for


now
 But
 like
 many
 things
 in
 Myanmar
 at


the
 moment,
 how
 long
 it
 will
 last,
 how


steady
 it
 is
 is
 an
 open
 question.


>> By
 purchasing
 the
 rare
 earth's
 mind
 in


Myanmar,
 China
 is
 effectively
 funding


the
 KIA,
 perhaps
 a
 military
 hint's


greatest
 and
 most
 long-standing
 enemy.


This
 puts
 China
 in
 a
 pickle
 and
 that's


why
 it's
 now
 looking
 for
 other
 suppliers


of
 these
 in
 demand
 elements.


>> You'll
 see
 much
 more
 coming
 from
 Laos.


You'll
 see
 mining
 start
 up
 in
 parts
 of


Myanmar
 where
 Beijing
 has
 better


relations
 with
 the
 armed
 groups
 that


have
 closer
 relations
 to
 Beijing.
 And
 so


the
 big
 official
 Chinese
 companies
 could


go
 in
 and
 operate.
 You're
 not
 relying
 on


this
 kind
 of
 rag
 tag
 middlemen
 to
 kind


of
 do
 this
 stuff.


>> As
 China
 tries
 to
 find
 other
 places


beyond
 Myanmar
 for
 rare
 earths,
 the
 US


is
 also
 scrambling
 to
 find
 its
 own


alternative
 to
 China.
 In
 July,
 a
 rare


earth
 mine
 opened
 in
 Wyoming,
 the
 first


in
 the
 US
 in
 more
 than
 70
 years.
 At
 the


same
 time,
 the
 US
 is
 also
 tentatively


eyeing
 Myanmar
 for
 rare
 earths.


>> There's
 been
 some
 interest
 from
 State


Department
 and
 other
 groups
 about
 kind


of
 sussing
 out
 and
 getting
 a
 feel
 for


the
 current
 situation
 and
 what
 it's
 like


on
 the
 ground.
 Right
 now,
 the
 US
 has


very
 limited
 engagement
 with
 Myanmar.


Myanmar
 is
 massively
 unstable
 at
 the


moment.
 You
 know,
 you
 have
 the
 Huna


fighting
 armed
 ethnic
 groups.
 You
 have


them
 fighting
 smaller
 prodemocracy


groups
 that
 popped
 up
 after
 the
 coup.


The
 Huna
 is
 starting
 plans
 for
 an


election,
 which
 I
 think
 could
 be
 very


destabilizing.
 And
 then,
 of
 course,
 you


see
 the
 military
 running
 a
 really


horrific
 campaign
 against
 its
 own


citizens.
 And
 Tim
 says
 there
 are
 more


than
 just
 political
 and
 humanitarian


considerations
 for
 the
 US
 to
 factor.


>> There's
 just
 really,
 really,
 really
 huge


logistical
 issues.
 I
 mean,
 it
 would
 take


moving
 tons
 of
 rare
 earth
 material
 from


a
 sort
 of
 undeveloped
 far
 remote
 corner


of
 the
 country
 and
 then
 you'd
 have
 to


move
 it
 across
 a
 country
 that's
 covered


with
 hundreds
 of
 waring
 ethnic
 groups


and
 armed
 groups
 u
 to
 a
 point
 of
 exit.


Then
 the
 question
 is,
 well,
 where
 do
 you


bring
 it
 to
 refine
 it?
 And
 the
 answer
 to


that
 question
 is
 you
 bring
 it
 to
 China


because
 China
 is
 the
 only
 place
 that
 has


the
 capability
 to
 refine
 this
 stuff.
 So


now
 we're
 back
 where
 we
 started,
 right?


And
 that
 is
 assuming
 that
 Beijing
 would


allow
 this.
 Why
 would
 China
 allow
 any
 US


firms
 or
 companies
 or
 linked
 people
 come


into
 their
 own
 backyard
 and
 take
 what


they
 have
 obviously
 deemed
 a
 national


security
 asset
 from
 them.
 So
 there's
 a


myriad
 of
 issues.
 There's
 obviously
 been


the
 sort
 of
 moral
 issues
 of
 of
 the


country
 and
 and
 dealing
 with
 various


militaries,
 but
 just
 the
 logistics,
 the


geopolitics
 of
 it
 alone
 make
 it
 sound


almost
 inconceivable.


>> And
 now
 you've
 got
 this
 rebel
 army
 added


to
 the
 geopolitical
 mix.
 It's
 such
 a


wild
 card.


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean
 I
 I
 don't
 think
 there's


another
 situation
 that
 ever
 reached
 the


geopolitical
 tension
 that
 we're
 seeing


now
 between
 the
 US
 and
 China
 with
 rarest


in
 the
 middle.
 And
 so
 you
 have
 these
 big


superpowers
 and
 these
 big
 tech
 companies


and
 huge
 investments
 and
 then
 when
 you


drill
 down
 one
 of
 the
 key
 players
 here


is
 this
 group
 that
 really
 was
 born
 out


of
 a
 anti-colonial
 struggle
 against
 the


Myammar
 government.


And
 then
 I
 think
 the
 other
 thing
 kind
 of


wild
 card
 here
 is
 technology
 and
 the


advancements.
 Maybe
 rare
 earth
 magnets


will
 be
 innovated
 out
 of
 existence.
 You


already
 see
 some
 companies
 touting
 that


they're
 running
 their
 EV
 motors
 with


batteries
 that
 don't
 have
 rare
 earths
 in


them.
 Maybe
 we're
 not
 talking
 about
 them


in
 the
 same
 way
 whether
 it's
 in
 10
 years


or
 15
 or
 20
 years.
 So
 there's
 also
 this


other
 kind
 of
 unknown
