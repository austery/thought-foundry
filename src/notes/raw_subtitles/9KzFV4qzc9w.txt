Senator, it's good to see you.
Welcome back to Bloomberg TV and Radio.
You sure seem to be top of mind, if not
top of word every time the president
speaks lately.
And I want to ask you about your effort
to quash this bailout, as many are
calling it, for Argentina.
President said today this is a direct
quote, just helping a great philosophy
take over a great country.
We don't have to do it, he said.
It's not going to make a big difference
for our country.
How many Republicans, how many America
first Republicans, did you get to sign
on?
You know, you're asking exactly the
right question.
Donald Trump ran for office proclaiming
he would do America first.
Instead, he is sending 20 billion
American taxpayer dollars to bail out
his buddy in Argentina.
And he's doing this after Argentina has
just cozied up to China and cut a deal
with China that takes the legs out from
underneath American soybean farmers.
So let me get this straight.
Argentina hurts American farmers.
And the president of the United States
responds by giving $20 billion to
Argentina.
Plus, Secretary Bessant saying and a
blank check if they need more.
That's pretty appalling.
Will Congress not have a chance to weigh
in outside of your legislation?
Is this money as good as Argentina's?
Well, that's what I want to do.
I just went to the floor of the Senate
and introduced the bill and asked for
unanimous consent that we move it
forward.
And there was an objection.
So now I'm just saying to the
Republicans, look, you guys have
criticized this.
I've heard Chuck Grassley speak out
against it.
Other senators who represent farmers in
their home state saying this is a
terrible idea.
Well, you know, this is your chance, not
just talk.
You can actually take action here.
The United States Senate has the power
to say, no, we're not going to do this,
so let's just bring it to the floor and
vote, because I feel pretty sure that if
everybody had a chance in the Senate to
vote on this, that the answer would be
no money to Argentina.
Thank you very much.
We'd rather support our farmers and
families here in America.
So do you know if you're going to get a
vote?
Will this go to the floor?
You know, the person who determines that
is the Republican leader, not the
Democrats.
So all I can do is keep raising the
alarm about this and asking people all
over this country to let the Republicans
know that we want a vote on this.
We want to put a stop to this.
You know, the American soybean farmers
have really been hurt.
And American farmers who are growing
other crops have been hurt as well,
because when Donald Trump has done this,
tariffs on tariffs off 100%, tariffs,
50% tariffs, 20% tariffs, many, many
buyers of those agriculture products who
our farmers spent, some of them have
spent decades developing those markets
and those relationships.
They said, look, if your president is
going to impose tariffs on my home
country, I can't buy your product.
And that's putting our American farmers
under a lot of pressure.
The soybean farmers in particular got
targeted by China and Argentina,
Argentina doing a deal with China to cut
out American soybean farmers.
That's just not right.
And we should not be rewarding a country
that acts against the interests of the
American people and the American farmer.
And that is exactly what Senator Trump
is doing.
Senator, I want to turn from Argentina
now to Capitol Hill.
I'm curious if you have spoken to the
minority leader, Chuck Schumer, about
his plans next and what's going on with
the shutdown and when people can expect
to feel some relief.
So I don't talk about private
conversations, but let me put it this
way.
Democrats are really clear about what
we're asking for.
We want the Republicans just to roll
back those cuts that are going to knock
15 million Americans off their health
care coverage and drive up insurance
costs for tens of millions more
Americans.
We're just that's all we're asking for
here.
And the Republicans right now literally
will not even sit down and negotiate.
The House is out for its fourth week of
vacation, so they can't even be here to
vote.
And the Senate just says no talking.
You know, that's not how it works in a
democracy.
We're fighting to try to help Americans
be able to afford their health care.
And I want to be.
I'm not defending the American health
care system.
I think it's badly broken.
But what Trump is doing to that system,
along with the Republicans, is they're
going to take a creaky, barely
functioning system and just smash it
apart.
And that ultimately is going to hurt
everybody in this country.
And we're just we're just trying to push
back, say just give people back the
coverage they had back in June.
We're not we're not trying to rewrite
the whole system.
We're not spending any additional money.
Just give people what they had a few
months ago before Donald Trump and the
Republicans passed that one big,
beautiful bill.
Senator, I do want to turn to your home
state of Massachusetts right now in the
short time that we do have left.
President Trump saying today he was very
critical of the Boston mayor, in fact,
saying at one point that he would
consider pulling the World Cup games
from Boston.
Of course, that is something that is up
to the head of FIFA.
However, are you concerned that Boston
could be the next target for National
Guard troops?
You know, let me just start by saying
what a terrific job Michelle Wu, who is
mayor of Boston, is doing.
In fact, she just won in the primary for
her reelection, which comes up in
November by 49 points, So much so that
her opponent dropped out.
So the people of Boston really seem to
think that she's doing a pretty terrific
job.
And given that Boston has the lowest
crime rate of any major city in America,
that Michelle Wu has done more on
affordable housing and to put more
create more child care slots really
tells you why she is much respected and
often much loved in the city of Boston.
For Donald Trump to attack her, it seems
to me, is just a way to say he doesn't
like people who are not bowing the need
to Donald Trump because that's the one
thing she has pushed back and said to
the president of the United States, if
you want to help make Boston safer, then
send us some better gun safety laws
nationally.
We're doing a good job here in
Massachusetts, but help us out
nationally so guns don't get imported
from elsewhere.
Help us with health care.
Help us with housing.
Those are the things that will help make
Boston an even better city.
Donald Trump doesn't like anyone who
doesn't bend the knee.
So, frankly, I'm not surprised that he's
trying to pick some kind of fight with
Michelle Wu, but I don't think it's
going to work.
You know, he did say, Senator, that he
thought that the mayor was, in fact,
intelligent and smarter than some of the
other mayors.
For what it's worth, I put that out
there.
He was being asked about these street
takeovers that have taken place, the
pro-Palestinian protests that have in
some cases been pretty large scale in
Boston.
I'm just wondering what would be your
response and what would be what should
be Governor Healey, his response If
Donald Trump decides that your home town
is next for National Guard troops?
Well, so I just want to be clear on what
you're talking about.
Mayor would put out a very strong
statement about this and said, we're not
going to do this.
She's also put out a strong statement
when a police officer got hurt when
there had been a protest.
Look, everybody has problems.
Things happen.
But that's why we have our local police.
That's why we have our state police.
And they are doing an excellent job.
We don't need any national troops to
come in to somehow flatter Donald
Trump's ego.
He certainly wouldn't be the first time
when you pursue legal action if he did,
Senator.
Oh, yes.
Look what Donald Trump is trying to do
right now in California, in Illinois is
pretty clearly illegal.
And the courts have already said so
across the board that he does not have
the authority to engage in this kind of
takeover of American cities.
Same thing for Portland.
But this is about more than just what is
legal.
This is about Donald Trump trying to
find as many ways as possible to
suppress, to shut up, to hush.
Anyone who disagrees with Donald Trump.
And that's true, whether we're talking
about mayors of big cities or we're
talking about late night comedians or
we're talking about elected officials.
Donald Trump cares most about using the
federal government and its power to
silence dissent rather than to advance
the interests of the American people.
That is the central problem we have, and
it just keeps cropping up over and over
because Donald Trump wants to.
Government to serve him personally, not
the American people.
