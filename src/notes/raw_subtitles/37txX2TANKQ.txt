hi
 everybody
 today
 we
 are
 in
 really
 good


company
 because
 I'm
 here
 with
 Anthony


Bolton
 and
 Anthony
 Bolton
 he
 is
 in
 a
 way


in
 my
 mind
 the
 father
 of
 contrarian


investing
 you
 know
 the
 best
 person
 I


know
 to
 do
 the
 opposite
 of
 everybody


else
 and
 my
 have
 you
 made
 a
 lot
 of
 money


for
 Fidelity
 over
 the
 years
 doing
 that


so
 warm
 welcome
 anony
 thank
 you
 Nikolai


it's
 lovely
 to
 be
 here
 with
 you
 why
 can


one
 make
 so
 much
 money
 by
 doing
 the


opposite
 of
 other
 people
 I
 think
 because


very
 few
 people
 are
 doing
 it
 by
 so
 it's


almost
 by
 definition
 and
 the
 trouble
 in


the
 stock
 market
 if
 you
 do
 what
 everyone


else
 is
 doing
 it
 will
 work
 for
 a
 while


but
 the
 more
 people
 who
 get
 on
 the


bandwagon
 eventually
 it


bursts
 and
 I
 think
 that's
 why
 it's
 it


it's
 important
 I
 always
 my
 view
 of


investing
 that
 popularity
 is
 risk
 and


conversely
 unpopularity
 is
 opportunity


I'm
 not
 saying
 everything
 that's


unpopular
 therefore
 is
 is
 an
 opportunity


but
 I
 I
 just
 early
 on
 I
 wanted
 to
 look


where
 other
 people
 weren't
 looking
 and
 I


always
 felt
 uncomfortable
 if
 I
 own


something
 that
 everyone
 else
 owned
 not


many
 people
 feel
 that
 way
 and
 that


that's
 the
 point
 that's
 why
 I
 think
 it


works
 but
 so
 when
 so
 so
 when
 you
 you


when
 you
 think
 about
 being
 contrarian
 I


mean
 what
 what
 what
 is
 it
 what
 does
 it


entail
 I
 think
 it
 it
 entails
 I
 think


it's
 something
 in
 the
 personality
 that


you
 feel
 comfortable
 about
 being


different
 I
 think
 most
 people
 are
 are


they
 like
 the
 comfort
 of
 the
 crowd
 they


they
 like
 to
 be
 reinforced
 they
 like
 the


people
 around
 them
 to
 be
 telling
 them


you
 know
 what
 you're
 doing
 is
 is
 good


it's
 what
 I'm
 doing
 and
 what
 everyone's


doing
 so
 I
 think
 there's
 something
 in


the
 makeup
 of
 a
 contrarian
 that
 that
 is


really
 important
 and
 it
 it's
 very


difficult
 to
 put
 my
 fingers
 on
 it


because
 often
 my
 colleagues
 Fidelity
 say


you
 know
 how
 can
 I
 become
 a
 contrarian


and
 I
 think
 you
 need
 to
 start
 I'm
 not


sure
 I
 don't
 think
 everyone
 can
 do
 it


put
 it
 that
 way
 so
 there
 has
 to
 be


something
 inside
 you
 and
 what
 and
 what


is
 that
 what
 is
 that
 it's
 so
 difficult


to
 put
 one's
 finger
 on
 it
 but
 it
 it's


it's
 it's
 it's
 the
 ability
 to
 to
 back


your
 own
 convictions
 to
 be


unemotional
 and
 to
 be
 patient
 I
 think
 is


is
 is
 part
 of
 it
 because
 often
 you're


you're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 wait
 a
 bit
 do


you
 have
 any
 friends


I
 do
 have
 some
 friends
 like
 goodness


what
 I
 mean
 is
 it
 if
 you
 if
 you
 crave


for
 uh
 people
 to
 like
 you
 uh
 you
 are


probably
 not
 a
 good
 contrarian
 right
 yes


I
 don't
 know
 I
 don't
 think
 likeness
 and


dislikeness
 comes
 into
 I
 mean
 that's


more
 to
 do
 with
 people's
 characteristics


but
 it's
 you
 know
 what
 people
 say
 it's


lonely
 being
 a
 cont
 which
 is
 slightly


different
 I
 doesn't
 doesn't
 mean
 that


you
 don't
 have
 friends
 but
 you're
 you're


sort
 of
 out
 on
 a
 limb
 and
 you
 know
 how


it
 is
 investment
 I
 often
 found
 the
 best


opportunities
 were
 were
 the


uncomfortable
 ones
 by
 the
 time
 it
 was


comfortable
 it
 was
 late
 and
 it
 would


still
 might
 be
 all
 right
 for
 a
 while
 but


you
 have
 to
 be
 prepared
 to
 be
 in


uncomfortable
 situation
 what
 does
 that


what
 does
 uncomfortable
 mean


uncomfortable
 means
 that
 other
 people


are
 you
 you're
 you're
 doing
 something


that
 other
 people
 and
 several
 people


people
 will
 probably
 tell
 you
 it's
 wrong


um
 I
 think
 funny
 funny
 enough
 I
 think


one
 of
 your
 one
 of
 your
 recent
 people


you
 were
 talking
 to
 said
 he
 gave
 a


medical
 example
 of
 you
 know
 somebody
 who


who
 made
 a
 big
 stride
 in
 cancer
 research


and
 they
 said
 at
 the
 time
 the
 guy
 was


terribly
 unpopular
 because
 he
 was
 going


against
 conventional
 wisdom
 so
 you
 have


to
 be
 somebody
 who's
 happy
 I
 think
 to
 go


against
 the
 conventional
 wisdom
 at
 times


not
 all
 the
 time
 but
 time
 now


unemotional
 what
 are
 you
 unemotional
 I


am
 un
 unemotional
 I
 I
 think
 like
 are
 you


on
 the
 Spectrum
 you
 think
 I
 don't
 think


I'm
 extremely
 unemotional
 but
 I


am
 I
 can
 take
 success
 and
 failure
 pretty


much
 the
 same
 that
 now
 that's
 really


important
 for
 investors
 don't
 let
 the


successes
 get
 to
 your
 head
 because


everyone
 has
 successes
 but
 conversely


everyone
 will
 go
 through
 a
 bad
 phase
 and


don't
 let
 the
 the
 bad
 time
 get
 get
 to


you
 that's
 the
 bit
 that
 gets
 to
 most


people


so


um
 H
 how
 would
 I
 describe
 it


um
 I
 think
 if
 you
 get
 very
 worked
 up


about
 Investments
 I
 think
 in
 general


that
 is
 bad
 in
 this
 business
 you
 know


you
 have
 to
 stand
 you
 have
 to
 take


yourself
 sort
 of
 somewhat
 out
 of
 the


situation
 and
 look
 down
 from
 above


impassionately
 but
 do
 you
 spend
 all
 your


life
 looking
 at
 your
 portfolio
 or


meeting
 companies
 thinking
 about
 these


things
 how
 can
 you
 be
 unemotional
 about


what
 is
 your
 life
 I
 think
 unemotional


committed
 you
 know
 involved
 ex
 you
 know


it
 as
 you
 know
 is
 the
 most
 fascinating


business
 to
 be
 in
 to
 meet
 all
 these


companies
 to
 be
 in
 touch
 with
 all
 the


great
 Trends
 in
 the
 world


but
 it's
 it's
 at


times
 don't
 underestimate
 the
 Market's


ability
 to
 Discount
 I
 think
 the
 mistakes


so
 many
 people
 do


they
 often
 talk
 about
 what's
 the
 Outlook


you
 know
 is
 it
 is
 the
 Outlook
 bright
 is


the
 Outlook


poor
 but
 the
 key
 thing
 is
 what
 Outlook


is
 discounted
 in
 the
 stock
 market
 at
 the


moment
 it's
 not
 the
 Outlook
 it's
 it's


how
 your
 view
 of
 the
 future
 Compares


with
 what's
 discounted
 in
 the
 stock


market
 when
 you
 look
 at
 the
 stock
 market


what
 are
 the
 type
 of
 things
 you
 look
 at


how
 do
 you
 gauge
 the
 stock
 market's
 mood


for
 instance
 what
 are
 the
 indicators


okay
 I
 was
 someone
 who
 would
 like
 to


look
 at
 a
 whole
 amalgam
 of
 things
 and
 I


always
 say
 look
 what
 I
 looked
 at
 wasn't


necessarily
 different
 from
 what
 most


people
 perhaps
 how
 I
 mixed
 it
 together


um
 it's
 interesting
 when
 I
 look
 at
 a


stock
 often
 the
 first
 thing
 I
 look
 at
 is


the
 chart
 I
 want
 to
 know
 you
 know
 the


chart
 immediately
 tells
 so
 the
 charge


being
 the
 stock
 price
 right
 stock
 price


so
 so
 I'm
 putting
 a
 charge
 in
 front
 of


you
 what
 are
 you
 what
 are
 the
 things
 you


looking
 so
 the
 F
 I'm
 you
 know
 it
 tells


am
 I
 early
 or
 late
 is
 this
 a
 stock


that's
 done
 well
 for
 a
 long
 time
 you


know
 which
 probably
 means
 I'm
 late


doesn't
 always
 mean
 I'm
 late
 but


probably
 is
 it
 a
 stock
 that
 hasn't
 done


well
 and
 th
 those
 were
 the
 ones
 I


particularly
 like
 you
 know
 to
 screen
 for


because
 I'd
 look
 at
 them
 some
 of
 them


were
 no
 good
 you
 know
 they're
 always


going
 to
 be
 dogs
 Duds
 but
 particularly


if
 there
 was
 change
 if
 there
 was
 change


in
 the
 management
 or
 the
 portfolio
 of


businesses
 that
 they
 were
 in
 all
 the


environment
 was
 changing
 for
 the
 better


then
 I'd
 look
 especially
 with
 UK


companies
 i'
 look
 at
 the
 shareholder


list
 I
 found
 it's
 it's
 a
 very
 underrated


thing
 to
 look
 at
 shareholder
 lists
 and


what
 I
 was
 looking
 for
 is
 are
 the
 funds


that
 I
 rate
 already
 owners
 of
 this


company
 this
 is
 particularly
 so
 medium


and
 smaller
 companies
 and
 that
 was
 very


much
 the
 heart
 of
 my
 Approach
 I
 mean
 as


the
 funds
 got
 bigger
 I
 bought
 more
 big


companies
 but
 I
 think
 my
 greatest
 love


was
 in
 medium
 small
 companies
 because


you
 could
 if
 you
 did
 your
 work
 you
 knew


that
 you
 knew
 more
 on
 those
 companies


than
 most
 people
 did
 what
 were
 the
 type


of
 shareholders
 you
 would
 have
 you
 like


I
 mean
 I
 can't
 you
 know
 I'm
 I'm
 10
 years


out
 of
 date
 from
 from
 doing
 it
 or
 even


longer
 but
 there
 were
 there
 were
 certain


funds
 that
 I
 rated
 and
 it
 it
 was
 if
 I


saw
 lots
 of
 them
 there
 then
 I
 knew
 I
 was


late
 they
 had
 all
 discovered
 it
 before


me
 if
 I
 saw
 none
 of
 them
 there
 I
 mean


that
 might
 be
 a
 great
 sign
 or
 it
 might


be
 just
 it's
 a
 terrible
 business
 and
 no


one's
 ever
 going
 to
 buy
 this
 perhaps
 the


best
 were
 maybe
 there
 was
 already
 one


other


fund
 that
 I
 rated
 and
 that
 sort
 of
 said


well
 they
 they've
 already
 picked
 this
 up


and
 then
 but
 it
 leaves
 lots
 of
 room
 for


other
 people
 to
 come
 in
 later
 did
 you


look
 at
 buy
 and
 sell
 recommendations
 and


so
 on
 or
 what
 did
 you
 do
 with
 those
 yes


I
 you
 know
 the
 the
 the
 two
 great
 things


of
 the
 stock
 market
 the
 weighing
 and
 the


voting
 most
 people
 spend
 all
 their
 time


on
 the
 weighing
 and
 I
 I
 would


underestimate
 that
 and
 obviously
 our


analysts
 spend
 all
 their
 time
 on
 the


weighing
 but
 the
 voting
 was
 the
 bit
 that


I
 really
 was
 interested
 looking
 trying


to
 measure
 sentiment
 in
 stock
 and
 that


that's
 ownership
 and
 things
 like
 Insider


dealing
 I
 was
 that
 that
 was
 really


important
 to
 me
 if
 The
 Insider
 trades


confirmed
 or
 conflicted
 with
 my
 view
 so


that
 the
 CEOs
 were
 buying
 for
 instance


well
 yeah
 the
 CEO
 were
 buying
 but
 I
 also


use
 charts
 as
 a
 sort
 of
 confirming
 or


not
 confirming
 sign
 people
 find
 that


difficult
 you
 know
 Anthony
 why
 why
 do


you
 think
 charts
 are
 important
 but
 if
 if


the


chart
 confirm
 my
 fundamental
 View
 and
 my


my
 general
 view
 I
 might
 take
 a
 bigger


position
 and
 if
 the
 chart
 didn't
 if
 if


the
 chart
 started
 to
 roll
 down
 it's


something
 it
 was
 one
 of
 the
 factors
 I


might
 cut
 back
 my
 position
 because
 it


was
 always
 incremental
 to
 me
 I
 never


came
 in
 one
 day
 and
 bought
 a
 huge


position
 in
 a
 company
 I
 was
 normally


building
 something
 up
 as
 my
 conviction


increased
 and
 then
 the
 share
 price
 moved


or
 something
 changed
 and
 then
 probably
 I


was
 reducing
 it
 so
 that
 that
 for
 me
 it


wasn't
 black
 and
 white
 and
 management


you
 management
 meeting
 is
 quite


management
 was
 really
 important
 you
 know


I
 at
 the
 height
 I
 was
 doing
 sort
 of


companies
 a
 day
 but
 it
 was
 REM


meting
 just
 in
 one
 meeting
 I
 I
 find
 yeah


people
 impress
 you
 but
 it
 it
 it's
 seeing


how
 the
 story
 develops
 and
 are
 they


consistent
 in
 what
 they
 say
 how
 do
 you


decide
 the
 entry
 into
 a
 contrarian


position
 as
 I
 say
 the
 the
 whole
 amul
 of


things
 that
 I
 looked
 at
 and
 when
 I
 I


thought
 it
 was


interesting
 I
 would
 buy
 a
 position
 but
 I


normally
 start
 um
 it
 was
 normally
 at


half
 a
 percent
 so
 50
 bips
 type
 position


in
 the
 company
 and
 then
 as
 my
 conviction


increased
 I
 might
 go
 up
 to
 100
 and
 then


up
 to
 200
 and
 then
 I
 have
 a
 few


positions
 where
 I
 perhaps
 got
 up
 to
 400


it
 was
 interesting
 in
 the
 early
 days
 I


thought
 of
 everything
 400
 that's
 like
 4%


of
 your
 portfolio
 of
 the
 portfolio
 in


the
 early
 days
 I
 thought
 of
 everything


absolutely
 because
 obviously
 in
 the
 last


10
 oh
 know
 last
 20
 years
 or
 so
 one


thinks
 much
 more
 in
 terms
 of
 relative


positions
 than
 absolute
 positions
 but


that
 that's
 how
 I
 did
 it
 and
 I
 normally


had
 you
 know
 a
 thesis
 on


it
 one
 of
 the
 things
 I
 particularly
 like


were
 asymmetric
 Returns
 what
 does
 that


what
 does
 that
 mean
 so
 stocks
 where
 I


thought
 the
 downside
 was
 limited
 but


they
 might
 in
 certain
 circumstances
 have


a
 lot
 of
 upsid
 so
 the
 upside
 and


downside
 wasn't
 the
 same


in
 in
 a
 lot
 of
 stocks
 it
 well
 they
 of


might
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 upside
 but
 they
 also


can
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 downside
 so
 the


downside
 was
 protected
 by
 maybe
 a
 very


strong
 balance
 sheet
 or
 a
 business
 with


very
 good
 cash
 flows
 or
 whatever
 it
 is


but
 they
 had
 something
 like
 like
 a
 drug


Discovery
 or
 they
 were
 drilling
 for
 oil


or
 something
 that
 if
 if
 they
 were
 lucky


this
 could
 make
 a
 a
 huge
 difference
 to


the
 valuation
 what
 would
 be
 be
 what


would
 be
 the
 most
 contrarian
 thing
 you


can
 do
 just
 now
 you
 think
 in
 the
 market


China
 to
 buy
 China
 to
 buy
 China


definitely
 I
 mean
 look
 every
 other


Market
 in
 the
 world
 not
 every
 but
 nearly


every
 Market
 is
 near
 its
 high
 China's


near
 its
 low
 so
 China
 must
 be
 the


contrarian
 position
 at
 the
 moment
 and


how
 would
 you
 fund
 that
 what
 would
 you


what
 would
 you
 sell
 America
 the
 whole


America
 everyone
 loves
 valuations
 are


high
 all
 the
 money
 has
 been
 going
 into


America
 the
 other
 thing
 I
 think
 is
 very


important
 in
 investment
 is
 often
 divide


the
 journey
 from
 the


arrival
 markets
 move
 during
 the
 journey


and
 normally
 when
 you
 get
 to
 the
 arrival


that
 is
 the
 end
 of
 a
 trend
 so
 I
 think
 in


America
 you
 know
 the
 inauguration
 of


trump
 is
 is
 is
 the
 end
 of
 the
 journey
 up


to
 that
 with
 China
 everyone's
 been


scared
 of
 the
 tariffs
 you
 know
 for
 for


months
 and
 months
 I
 think
 the
 date
 the


tariffs
 come
 could
 M
 main
 the
 Turning


Point
 well
 they
 came
 today
 right
 yeah
 so


maybe
 it's
 today
 and
 the
 other
 thing


look
 when
 I
 look
 at
 and
 I
 think
 some
 the


idea
 that


AI
 only
 rubs
 off
 on
 a
 small
 handful
 of


of
 US
 Stocks
 it
 makes
 no
 sense
 to
 me
 and


I
 think
 some
 of
 the
 China
 so
 what
 do
 you


mean
 by
 that
 AI
 has
 driven
 The


Magnificent
 Seven
 or
 six
 of
 the
 seven


yeah
 you
 know
 to
 new
 new
 higher
 and


higher
 levels
 and
 I
 wouldn't
 I'm
 not


belittling
 AI
 but
 the
 you
 know
 the
 stock


market
 H
 loves
 these
 sort
 of
 situations


it's
 so
 similar
 to
 the
 doom
 and
 the


stock
 market
 loves
 it
 and
 drives
 up
 the


stocks
 in
 anticipation
 but
 the
 idea
 that


only
 a
 handful
 of
 companies
 are
 going
 to


have
 the
 you
 know
 control
 the
 I
 Ai
 and


you've
 seen
 in
 the
 last
 few
 weeks
 some


of
 that
 rub
 off
 to
 China
 so
 I
 I
 think


American
 Tech
 into
 Chinese
 Tech
 now
 look


I'm
 not
 belittling
 everything
 all
 the


risk
 to
 do
 with
 China
 I
 mean
 the
 E


economy
 has
 got
 problems
 the
 the
 the
 the


poit
 the
 geopolitical
 situation
 is
 risky


in
 China
 but
 what
 are
 the
 domestic


investors
 in
 China
 going
 to
 do
 we've
 had


a
 threeyear
 bare
 Market
 the
 authorities


in
 China
 want
 the
 stock
 market
 higher


um
 bond
 yields
 are
 record


low
 are
 they
 going
 to
 go
 back
 into
 prop


I
 think
 not
 in
 a


hurry
 gold
 has
 done
 well
 they've
 gone


into
 gold
 there's
 really
 one
 other
 place


they
 can
 go
 to
 which
 which
 is
 equities


so
 yeah
 my
 my
 my
 view
 today
 is
 that


we're
 in
 the
 early
 stage
 of
 a
 b
 a
 new
 B


market
 in
 China
 um
 just
 going
 back
 to


the
 US
 where
 do
 where
 do
 where
 does


crypto
 fit
 into
 to
 this
 not
 not
 much
 for


someone
 like
 me
 I
 I
 just
 can't
 analyze


crypto
 no
 so
 but
 it
 it
 it
 to
 me
 it's
 one


of
 the
 signs
 of
 excess
 so
 if
 you're


looking
 you
 know
 for
 a
 market
 that's


high
 and
 has
 excess
 then
 crypto
 is
 an


indication
 of
 that
 so
 you
 you
 think
 it's


maybe
 the
 end
 of
 a
 a
 bull
 market
 or
 some


science
 yeah
 just
 how
 how
 how
 do
 you


expected
 to
 unfold
 I
 don't
 know
 nowadays


the
 bare
 markets
 tend
 to
 be
 sharper
 and


and
 happen
 quicker
 and
 they're
 over


quicker
 I
 don't
 think
 I
 can
 predict
 how


it
 is
 but
 I'm
 just
 saying
 in
 in
 the
 way


I
 look
 at
 markets
 and
 Cycles
 the
 the
 the


US
 market
 is
 near
 the
 top
 of
 its
 phase


you
 know
 nothing
 goes
 up
 in
 a
 straight


line
 in
 this
 business
 and
 you
 know
 and


the
 Very
 fact
 America's
 you've
 had
 20%


return
 whatever
 it
 is
 for
 two
 years


running
 it
 just
 you
 know
 when
 things
 are


high
 and
 the
 valuations
 are
 high
 I
 just


think
 your
 odds
 as


investor
 reduce
 of
 making
 money


okay
 so
 super
 stupid
 question
 why
 don't


you
 just
 sell
 when
 it
 starts
 to
 go
 down


well
 you
 never
 quite
 know
 do
 you
 no
 if


it
 was
 clear
 and
 that's
 the
 trouble
 and


look
 you
 know
 I
 Nicolai
 I'm
 someone
 who


said
 most
 of
 my
 time
 in
 investment
 I


don't
 want
 to
 take
 Market
 bets
 now
 I've


given
 you
 some
 Market


views
 because
 I'd
 you
 know
 I'd
 rather


find


something
 find
 your
 Competitive
 Edge


find
 your
 competitive
 Advantage
 for


instance
 you
 know
 the
 the
 Thousand


investors
 trying
 to
 second
 guess
 the
 FED


where
 am
 I
 going
 to
 have
 a
 competitive


advantage
 that's
 why
 mainly
 I
 like
 to


look
 at
 companies
 so
 even
 with
 a
 market


view
 I
 I
 wouldn't
 bet
 my
 whole
 portfolio


on
 so
 you
 don't
 spend
 a
 lot
 of
 time
 on


macro
 no
 no
 and
 um
 is
 it
 different
 uh
 is


it
 different
 being
 equitarian
 investor


in
 a
 bull
 market
 versus
 a
 beer
 market


what
 are
 the
 other
 different


characteristics
 um
 is
 it
 different
 in
 a


bull
 market
 versus
 a
 bare
 Market
 that's


an
 interesting
 question
 I
 havn't
 really


thought
 of
 it
 in
 that
 context
 one
 things


I
 found
 in
 the
 bull
 market
 the
 my
 number


of
 Holdings
 went
 up
 I
 could
 find
 more


interesting


situations
 and
 in
 the
 bare
 Market


normally
 I
 prune
 back
 the
 number
 of


Holdings
 I
 try
 to
 concentrate
 it
 it's


one
 of
 things
 I
 say
 when
 managers
 are


doing
 poorly
 you
 know
 try
 go
 through


every
 stock
 every
 you
 know
 the
 reasoning


for
 owning
 every
 stock
 and
 and


concentrate
 where
 where
 you're
 strongest


the
 the
 other
 thing
 I
 think
 is
 really


important
 in
 investment
 is
 listen
 to
 the


other
 View
 and
 it
 perhaps
 it
 comes
 back


to
 this
 sort
 of
 most
 people
 listen
 to


the
 Views
 that
 confirm
 you
 know
 Google's


an
 amazing
 investment
 so
 everyone
 will


listen
 to
 the
 Bulls
 about


Google
 if
 I
 had
 a
 big
 position
 in
 Google


my
 I'd
 be
 spending
 most
 my
 time


listening
 to
 the
 Bears
 of
 Google
 to
 see


what's
 changing
 and
 I
 think
 that's
 very


important
 listen
 to
 the
 counterview


listen
 to
 the
 shorts
 if
 if
 you've
 got
 if


you're
 long
 of
 something
 and
 you
 see
 the


shorts
 out
 there
 try
 and
 find
 out
 why


the
 shorts
 are


short
 do
 you
 find
 that
 short
 sellers


short
 sellers
 are
 good
 I
 don't
 think
 I


have
 a
 sort
 of
 special
 view
 so
 many
 left


of
 them
 after
 this
 Market
 I
 guess
 but
 um


I
 always
 give
 the
 famous
 case
 um
 of
 of
 a


company
 I
 owned
 it
 was
 actually
 an
 all


company
 and
 we
 had
 a
 position
 as
 a
 house


and
 one
 day
 the
 I
 had
 a
 meeting
 with


hedge
 fund
 that
 was
 short
 of


it
 and
 I
 was
 sitting
 there
 and
 after
 10


minutes
 it
 just
 hit
 me
 like
 a
 flash
 that


they
 were
 right
 and
 we
 were
 wrong
 and
 so


and
 that
 that's
 you
 know
 when
 you're


dealing
 with
 gray
 not
 black
 or
 white


it's
 gray
 how
 I
 think
 hearing
 the
 count


view
 is
 really
 important
 do
 you
 think


the
 difficulty
 in
 being
 a
 Garian
 um


investor
 is
 that
 you
 may
 lose
 your
 job
 I


mean
 now
 you're
 not
 you're
 not
 going
 to


lose
 your
 job
 you're
 going
 to
 lose
 your


job
 now
 by
 owning
 that's
 the
 whole
 point


the
 big
 seven
 companies
 that's
 why


that's
 why
 there's
 so
 few
 of
 them
 around


and
 I
 remember
 you
 know
 in
 the
 dotom


bubble
 the
 great
 I
 can't
 remember
 was
 it


uh
 PN
 d
 p
 yeah
 yeah
 yeah
 Andre
 somebody


die
 yeah
 yeah
 he
 was
 sacked
 yeah
 I
 think


Within
 two
 months
 of
 the
 of
 the
 peak
 of


the
 bubble
 the
 internet
 bubble
 and


that's
 that's
 the
 trouble
 so
 many
 people


you
 know
 are
 so
 short
 term


and
 no
 no
 no
 approach
 works
 every
 every


year
 year
 in
 year
 right
 in
 my
 view
 and


you've
 got
 to
 find
 what
 works
 for
 you


and
 stick
 to
 it
 I'm
 I
 I
 I
 am
 cautious


about
 people
 who
 say
 they
 can
 you
 know
 I


can
 be
 a
 growth
 investor
 and
 this


environment
 and
 then
 a
 value
 investor


and
 then
 something
 else
 I
 I
 don't
 think


that's
 easy
 for
 an
 individual
 anyway
 how


long
 can
 you
 be
 wrong
 before
 you
 change


your
 mind
 how
 you
 know
 how
 stubborn
 are


you
 well
 that's
 that's
 an
 interesting


thing
 I
 think
 it's
 to
 do
 you


stubbornness
 versus
 conviction
 you


mustn't
 let


conviction
 I
 was
 always
 one
 of
 my


colleagues
 said
 you
 know
 they
 were
 on


the
 edge
 of
 their
 seat
 with
 stalk
 I


think
 that's
 you
 have
 conviction
 but
 you


you've
 got
 to
 be
 open
 to
 changing
 that
 I


think
 that's
 terribly
 important
 so


stubbornness
 but
 but
 it's
 a
 difficult


business
 because
 in
 my
 view
 you
 can
 get


by
 with
 luck
 for
 three
 years
 I
 think


over
 three
 years
 it's
 skill
 it's
 not


luck
 but
 anyone's
 record
 less
 than
 three


years
 might
 purely
 be
 luck
 or
 or
 the


opposite
 might
 might
 be
 lack
 of
 luck
 if


you
 see
 I
 mean
 yeah
 um
 now
 how
 do
 you


know
 when
 you're
 wrong
 I
 think
 it's
 the


keeping
 the
 open
 mind
 I
 think
 keeping


the
 open
 mind


look
 you
 know
 G
 getting
 it
 right
 55%
 of


the
 time
 is
 is
 is
 great
 so
 45%
 of
 the


time
 you're
 going
 to
 be
 wrong
 so
 youve


got
 to
 realize
 that
 this
 is
 a
 business


where
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 times


we're
 wrong
 and
 you've
 just
 got
 to
 learn


from
 it
 and
 and
 and
 and
 move
 on
 and
 one


of
 the
 things
 I
 always
 say


is
 the
 things
 that
 often
 differentiate


the
 good
 Managers
 from
 the
 bad
 managers


is
 not
 the
 successes
 it's
 it's
 not


having
 the
 losers
 I
 think
 if
 you
 can
 cut


out
 your
 losers
 that
 can
 take
 you
 from


you
 know
 an
 average
 or
 better
 than


average
 in
 in
 up
 to
 the
 top
 cile
 how
 do


you
 deal
 with
 stress
 yourself
 um
 I


suppose
 may
 maybe
 that's
 why
 I
 was
 good


contrarian
 it
 didn't
 get
 to
 me
 yeah
 yeah


obviously
 there
 were
 certain
 times
 it


got
 to
 me
 and
 you
 know
 after
 the
 the


great
 market
 crash
 in
 87
 and
 stuff
 you


you
 sort
 of
 yeah
 it
 does
 keep
 you
 at


weight
 at
 night
 for
 a
 few
 nights


thinking
 gosh
 you
 know
 has
 this
 all


changed


but
 I
 think
 the
 whole
 point
 is
 I
 could
 I


could
 cope
 with
 stress
 and


which
 which
 meant
 I
 guess
 that
 I
 could


switch
 off
 and
 that's
 when
 you
 compose


music
 that's
 when
 I
 I
 I
 didn't
 have
 that


much
 time
 for
 writing
 music
 when
 I
 was


running
 money
 day
 to
 day
 but
 yes
 that


was
 one
 of
 things
 family
 whatever
 it


might
 be
 and
 now
 you
 compose
 church


music
 and
 I
 compose
 a
 range
 of
 music
 but


I've
 written
 two
 operas
 that's
 been
 the


main
 thing
 that
 I've
 done
 the
 biggest


things
 that
 I've
 done
 wow
 that's
 that's


impressive
 that's


impressive
 um
 now
 how
 do
 you
 avoid


overconfidence
 how
 do
 you
 stay
 humble


after
 such
 a
 long
 successful
 period
 Well


I
 think
 this
 is
 why
 you've
 got
 to


analyze
 yourself
 in
 this
 business
 and
 I


think
 a
 a
 good
 degree
 of
 humility
 is


really
 helpful
 so
 I'm


slightly
 if
 people
 are
 very


arrogant
 and
 therefore
 to
 me
 that
 means


not
 always
 but
 often
 they're
 not


willing
 to
 analyze
 themselves
 and
 know


their
 their
 failings
 Etc
 I
 I
 think


that's
 important


so
 humil
 I
 think
 humility
 sort
 of
 helps


is
 that
 part
 of
 the
 corpor
 culture
 where


you
 were
 I
 we
 like
 to
 have
 a
 range
 you


know
 of
 people
 I
 I
 think
 it's
 very


dangerous
 in
 this
 business


to
 only
 take
 one
 type
 of
 person
 into
 it


I
 think
 you've
 got
 to
 have
 a
 range
 of


people
 with
 different
 skills
 Etc
 but


yeah
 if
 if
 people
 were
 very
 emotional


you
 found
 that
 out
 quite


quickly
 it
 didn't
 there
 were
 I'm
 not


saying
 never
 to
 that
 but
 I
 think
 often


that
 was
 not
 going
 to
 help
 them
 just


moving
 on
 to
 the
 market
 and
 how
 it's


changed
 so
 with
 all
 the
 passive
 money


Trend
 following
 and
 so
 on
 just
 how
 have


things
 changed
 in
 the
 market
 I
 think
 it


makes
 the
 trends
 go
 on
 longer
 yeah


that's
 definitely
 the
 case
 you
 know
 and


the
 and
 the
 quality
 of
 the
 competition


goes
 up
 the
 whole
 time
 so


it
 it
 was
 easier
 to
 do
 it
 20
 30
 years


ago
 when
 not
 everyone
 was
 visiting
 the


companies
 the
 amount
 of
 information


wasn't
 there
 the
 ability
 to
 process


information
 has
 changed
 but
 funny


enough
 you
 still
 get
 big
 anomalies
 this


is
 this
 is
 the
 fascinating
 thing
 and


almost
 the
 dumb


money
 produces
 the
 the
 anomalies
 at


sometimes
 and
 and
 the
 trend
 goes
 on
 for


longer
 so
 it's
 a
 longer
 wait
 and
 people


get
 can't
 you
 know
 can't
 do
 the
 waiting


as
 it
 were
 but
 it
 does
 change
 so
 some


people
 think
 you
 know
 the
 markets
 have


become
 more
 efficient
 over
 time
 people


are
 much
 better
 therefore
 the
 the


anomalies
 have
 disappeared
 well
 no
 in


some
 ways
 some
 of
 this
 creates
 new


anomalies
 so
 the
 correction
 comes
 later


but
 when
 it
 comes
 it's
 bigger
 yeah
 how


do
 you
 build
 an


organization
 uh
 where
 there
 is
 room
 for


people
 who
 think
 differently
 like
 this


how
 do
 how
 do
 how
 sorry
 how
 do
 you


construct
 how
 do
 you
 make
 an


organization
 how
 do
 you
 there
 were


common
 things
 to
 our
 approach
 the
 way
 we


do
 it
 at
 Fidelity
 of
 having
 you
 know
 a


team
 of
 analysts
 and
 a
 team
 of
 portfolio


managers
 and
 most
 people
 came
 in
 as


analyst
 trained
 as
 analyst
 normally
 did


three
 rotations
 as
 analyst
 in
 different


sectors
 Industries
 they
 covered
 and
 then


if
 we
 thought
 they
 had
 it
 in
 them
 off


after
 that
 they
 gave
 a
 chance
 to
 be
 a


portfolio
 manager


but
 so
 that
 was
 common
 how
 they
 approach


things
 were
 different
 we
 had
 some
 great


growth
 managers
 as
 well
 as
 contrarian


value
 managers
 income
 managers
 Etc
 so


what
 we
 didn't
 have
 was
 one
 style
 across


the
 whole
 of
 fidelity
 and
 in
 fact
 I
 was


and
 particularly
 more
 in
 a
 management


role
 as
 I've
 been
 the
 last
 10
 years


terribly
 Keen
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 we
 had


different
 funds
 with
 different


approaches
 because
 as
 as
 you
 know


approach
 can
 stay
 out
 of
 favor
 for
 quite


a
 while
 like
 value
 at
 the
 moment
 and


therefore
 you
 you
 need
 a
 a
 mixture
 of


different
 funds
 and
 that
 that's
 what
 we


Tred
 to
 do
 if
 you
 get
 um
 a
 whole
 room
 to


agree
 on
 something
 being
 a
 good
 idea
 is


it
 then
 normally
 a
 good
 idea
 no
 no
 and


that's
 that's
 the
 you
 know
 like
 decision


making
 by
 committee
 investment
 is


normally
 doesn't
 work
 because
 by
 the


time
 everyone
 agrees
 you
 probably
 catch


the
 the
 tail
 end
 of
 something
 yeah
 and


it
 comes
 back
 as
 I
 was
 saying
 you
 know


often
 the
 best
 opportunities
 you
 feel


relatively
 uncomfortable
 so
 I'm
 your


analyst
 I
 come
 to
 you
 and
 I
 pitched


these
 there
 and
 it's
 just
 like
 I
 think


it's
 really
 great
 and
 you
 said
 yeah
 well


done
 and
 then
 you
 do
 the
 exact


opposite
 yeah
 I
 mean
 the
 the
 analysts


know
 you
 know
 the
 fund
 manager
 is
 not


going
 to
 do
 everything
 that
 they
 say
 but


one
 of
 things
 obviously
 we
 look
 at
 is


how
 much
 a
 fund
 is
 in
 line
 with
 what
 the


analysts
 are
 saying
 and
 I
 think
 that's


important
 and
 so
 there's
 no
 requirement


on
 our
 fund
 managers
 I
 I
 found
 it
 was


often
 timing
 because
 as
 a
 contrarian
 you


were
 often
 a
 bit
 earlier
 that
 the
 other


thing
 when
 my
 funds
 got
 very
 large
 you


know
 the
 UK
 special
 situations
 at
 one


stage
 I
 think
 it
 was
 five
 times
 bigger


than
 the
 next
 biggest
 mutual
 fund
 in
 the


UK
 well
 because
 you
 were
 doing
 so
 well


because
 it
 had
 done
 well
 and
 that
 but


that
 was
 a
 constraint
 in
 in
 in
 in
 in
 the


future
 so
 I


knew
 in
 order
 to
 get
 a
 decent
 position
 I


couldn't
 often
 wait
 till
 the
 stock
 had


turned
 and
 it
 was
 on
 its
 way
 up
 I
 you


know
 the
 liquidity
 was
 when
 the
 the


stock
 price
 was
 still
 low
 m
 M
 another


thing
 that
 that
 I
 often
 say
 at
 slightly


different
 point
 but
 when
 you
 run
 large


funds
 I
 tended
 to
 have
 more


Holdings
 um


and
 it's
 really
 important
 that
 you


balance
 how
 much
 time
 you
 spend
 on


looking
 at
 the
 positions
 you
 already


have
 versus
 looking
 for
 new


positions
 often
 it's
 called
 Defensive


investment
 versus
 offensive
 which
 is


going
 out
 for
 new
 things
 and
 the


tendency
 is
 when
 you
 run
 a
 big
 fund
 to


spend
 too
 much
 time
 defensively
 and
 not


enough
 time
 offensively
 what
 do
 you


think
 is
 the
 right
 split
 of
 time
 I
 I


don't
 know
 if
 there's
 a
 right
 I
 think


it's
 it's
 it's
 making
 sure
 maybe
 a


quarter
 of
 your
 time
 at
 least
 is
 spend


offensively
 going
 out
 looking
 for
 new


ideas
 and
 the
 way
 I
 did
 that
 was


particularly
 using
 the
 Fidelity
 team
 of


analysts
 and
 some
 of
 the
 portfolio


managers
 I
 couldn't
 go
 to
 Every
 meeting


of
 a
 stock
 I
 owned
 so
 I'd
 use
 them
 to


report
 back
 to
 me
 but
 I
 made
 sure
 I
 went


to
 enough
 meetings
 of
 the
 ones
 I
 didn't


own
 but
 I
 thought
 I
 might
 want
 to


own
 so
 that
 that
 was
 important
 but
 it's


an
 interesting
 philosophical
 question


you
 know
 how
 much
 time
 do
 you
 spend
 on


things
 you
 already
 like
 I
 mean
 how
 how


do
 you
 go
 back
 to
 your
 old
 favorite


hotels
 so
 do
 you
 check
 out
 some
 new


things
 you
 know
 or
 yeah
 you
 have
 to
 keep


do
 you
 have
 chicken
 and
 fries
 every


night
 or
 do
 you
 sometimes
 try
 lasagna


but
 you
 can't
 forget
 Al
 conversely
 you


can't
 forget
 about
 things
 you
 own


because
 the
 world
 changes
 you
 know
 it


never
 stays
 the
 same
 is
 it
 more


difficult
 to
 find
 young
 contrarians
 now


given
 social
 media
 Eco


Chambers
 that's
 an
 interesting
 question


I
 don't
 I
 don't
 think
 I
 can
 give
 you
 a


definitive
 answer
 to
 that
 um
 I
 think


each
 era


breeds
 you
 know
 the
 majority
 of
 people


if
 if
 you
 live
 through
 a
 time
 like
 to


today
 the
 recent
 five
 years
 or
 whatever


it's
 been
 about
 growth
 growth
 growth


obviously
 most
 new
 investors
 are
 going


to
 be
 influenced
 by
 that
 they
 they
 don't


have
 the
 long-term
 perspective
 to
 put


this
 cycle
 in
 the
 context
 of
 the
 longer


cycle


um
 so
 yeah
 I
 think
 there's
 an
 element


you
 know
 we'll
 go
 through
 a
 good
 period


for
 value
 and
 then
 probably
 all
 young


people
 will
 want
 to
 be
 value
 investors


but
 that
 where
 does
 Europe
 fit
 into
 that


just
 now
 um
 I
 don't
 know
 on
 on
 Europe
 um


is
 is
 Europe
 in
 a
 way
 just
 the
 opposite


of
 America
 so
 if
 if
 the
 US
 market
 goes


down
 Europe
 will
 do
 relatively
 better
 I


don't
 think
 it's
 as
 black
 and
 white
 as


that
 no
 and
 look
 and
 not
 everything
 in


America
 is
 on
 I
 mean
 there
 are
 a
 lot
 of


very
 attractive
 value
 stocks
 in
 America


so
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 paint
 tar
 the
 whole


of
 America
 with
 the
 same
 brush
 but
 but


European
 markets
 are


also
 near
 their
 Peak
 so
 it's
 not
 as
 if


Europe
 hasn't
 moved
 to
 date
 you
 know


someone
 who
 spent
 four
 years
 in
 in
 in


Hong
 Kong
 running
 a
 Chinese
 fund
 I
 mean


you
 sort
 of


feel
 that
 the
 you
 know
 the
 the
 East
 is


it's
 going
 to
 be
 the
 their
 the
 the
 next


decade
 or
 two
 is
 going
 to
 be
 dominated


by
 the
 East
 rather
 than
 the
 west


and
 the
 trouble
 with
 Europe
 is
 they
 bog


down
 with
 you
 know
 so
 much
 baggage
 from


the
 past
 moving
 into
 the
 kind
 of
 um
 the


governance
 models
 here
 yeah
 when
 you
 are


a
 contrarian
 in
 um
 um
 portfolio
 manager


and
 you
 do
 the
 opposite
 of
 everybody


else
 you
 can
 be
 wrong
 for
 a
 long
 period


of
 time
 what
 are
 the
 implications
 for


how
 you
 should
 remunerate


people
 okay
 that
 that's
 interesting


um
 you
 know
 most
 of
 our
 remuneration


based
 on
 1
 three
 and
 five
 years
 and
 the


most
 on
 the
 three
 and
 often
 it
 might
 be


just
 the
 one
 and
 three
 years
 I


think
 then
 you've
 got
 to
 have
 some
 view


of
 their
 long-term
 success
 I
 I've
 had
 I


you
 know
 in
 my
 time
 I
 had
 three
 bad


years
 in
 a
 row
 or
 in
 a
 row
 yes
 and
 that


was
 the
 worst
 time
 that
 was
 yeah
 it
 was


sort
 of
 the
 8991
 yeah
 and
 Fidelity
 sto


with
 me
 you
 know
 my
 I
 didn't
 get
 the


bonus
 that
 that
 I
 got
 in
 the
 good
 times


but
 they
 stuck
 with
 me
 and
 I
 think
 how


bad
 was
 it
 oh
 you
 know
 it's
 it's
 bad


after
 three
 bad
 years
 you
 you
 start
 to


question
 then
 it
 comes
 back
 you
 know


none
 of
 us
 so
 believe
 in
 what
 they
 do


that
 you
 know
 it's
 the
 sort
 of
 business


that
 every
 day
 you
 think
 gosh
 you
 know


do
 what
 I
 know
 and
 what
 I
 think
 I
 know


and
 my
 experience
 is
 it
 still
 valid
 you


question
 yourself
 but
 I
 felt
 felt
 it
 was


but
 how
 do
 you
 remunerate
 I
 think


management
 has


to
 I
 think
 one
 gets
 over
 time
 but
 it


does
 take
 time
 a
 view
 these
 managers


with
 this
 style
 we
 think
 are
 really
 good


at
 what
 they
 do
 and
 when
 they
 come
 into


a
 bad
 patch
 and
 the
 bad
 patches
 are


probably
 longer
 because
 of
 the
 dumb


money
 the
 passive
 money
 making
 the


trends
 go
 on
 longer


um
 you
 you
 have
 to
 bear
 that
 in
 mind
 I
 I


can't
 be
 specific
 on
 remuneration
 but
 I


think
 we
 were
 aware
 of
 that
 yeah
 I
 think


probably
 an
 in
 an
 institution
 is
 not


more
 contrarian
 than
 the
 weakest
 link


right
 so
 if
 you
 have
 a
 management


committee
 which
 doesn't
 accept
 it
 then


you
 have
 a
 problem
 or
 a
 board
 which


doesn't
 accept
 it
 yes
 that
 that's
 that's


true
 but
 but
 you
 have
 to
 have
 the
 bo
 you


know
 the
 management
 committee
 has
 to


come
 back
 to
 this
 thing
 that


we
 need
 different
 runners
 in
 the
 race


and
 you
 know
 the
 whole
 history
 of


investment
 something
 that's
 done
 well


for
 quite
 a
 few
 years
 is
 probably
 not


going
 to
 be
 the
 thing
 that's
 going
 to
 do


well
 for
 the
 next
 few
 years
 I
 think


that's
 one
 of
 the
 mistakes
 you
 know


people
 think
 it's
 so
 strange
 they
 think


these
 tech
 stocks
 can
 go
 up
 every
 day


forever
 and
 ever
 I
 mean
 they
 they
 don't


realize
 there's
 a
 cycle
 to
 everything


it's
 not
 CU
 they're
 bad
 business


businesses
 not
 you
 know
 it's
 nothing
 to


do
 with
 the
 business
 it's
 it's
 to
 do


with
 this
 um
 voting
 Factor
 the
 sentiment


the
 sentiment
 doing
 overdoing
 things
 and


it
 it's
 why
 I
 think
 it's
 so
 important
 to


measure
 sentiment
 can
 you
 uh
 take


the
 the
 contrarian
 to
 other
 parts
 of


your
 life
 I
 mean
 writing
 operas
 is
 not


necessarily
 mainstream
 yeah
 I
 don't


think
 you
 can
 have
 people
 ask
 me
 that


you
 know
 does
 that
 make
 your
 whole
 life


contrarian
 no
 I
 mean
 I
 have
 things
 that


I
 love
 and
 things
 I
 don't
 love
 but


they're
 not
 necessarily
 extremely


contrarian
 I
 know
 it's
 rare
 to
 find


people
 who
 write
 operas
 but
 that
 that
 is


rare
 rather
 than
 contrarian
 if
 you
 see


what
 I
 mean
 well
 Anthony
 not
 many
 people


like
 you
 around
 anymore
 and
 fortunately


uh
 it's
 been
 a
 true
 pleasure
 having
 you


here
 big
 thank
 you
 for
 sharing
 your
 it's


been
 a
 delight
 to
 to
 talk
 over
 things


with
 you
 thank
 you
