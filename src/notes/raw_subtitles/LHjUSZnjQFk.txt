hi
 everyone
 I'm
 Nicola
 tangan
 the
 CEO
 of


the
 Norwegian
 so
 wealth
 fund
 and
 today


I'm
 here
 with
 Deborah
 crew
 the
 CEO
 of


Dio
 now
 Dio
 one
 of
 the
 most
 successful


brand
 builders
 in
 the
 world
 they
 have
 a


portfolio
 which
 include
 things
 like
 smov


Guinness
 Bailey's
 Johnny
 Walker
 lots
 of


great
 tequila
 brands
 and
 tanker
 in
 the


Gin
 sector
 we
 own
 2.2%
 of
 the
 company


equivalent
 to
 $1.3
 billion
 pleasure
 to


have
 you
 here
 it's
 great
 to
 be
 here


thanks
 Deborah
 what's
 happening
 in
 this


Bears
 industry
 just
 now
 first
 of
 all
 we


see
 a
 really
 long
 runway
 for
 growth
 in


beverage
 alcohol
 and
 particularly
 in


spirits
 and
 you
 know
 and
 it's
 it's
 Total


Beverage
 alcohol
 has
 been
 growing


consistently
 for
 20
 plus
 years
 and


alcohol
 is
 a
 percent
 of
 discretionary


spending
 and
 percent
 of
 consumer
 kind
 of


discretionary
 wallets
 is
 quite
 modest


it's
 less
 than
 2%
 and
 that's
 been
 very


consistent
 over
 time
 uh
 no
 doubt
 right


now
 the
 the
 industry
 is
 quite
 challenged


and
 it's
 challenged
 because
 of
 the
 the


cyclical
 kind
 of
 economic
 uh
 pressures


the
 uh
 inflationary
 the
 prolonged


inflation
 that
 that
 consumers
 are
 having


to
 navigate
 um
 has
 compressed
 that
 kind


of
 discretionary
 wallet
 and
 that's


really
 impacting
 the
 volumes
 of
 the


industry
 that
 being
 said
 people
 forget


just
 how
 resilient
 the
 industry
 is
 and


so
 you
 know
 we
 do
 see
 this
 it's
 cyclical


it's
 going
 to
 come
 back
 and
 this


resilience
 can
 really
 be
 explained


because
 of
 the
 kind
 of
 underlying


structural
 drivers
 of
 demand
 um
 that


really
 give
 us
 Tailwinds
 are
 if
 we
 look


at
 some
 of
 the
 uh
 some
 of
 the
 things


which
 are
 happening
 just
 now
 uh
 are


young
 people
 drinking
 less
 than
 before


so
 what
 we're
 seeing
 is
 um
 so
 gen
 Z
 are


expressing
 um
 and
 and
 that
 they
 prefer


to
 moderate
 that
 being
 said
 the
 actual


behavior
 um
 we
 what
 we're
 seeing
 in


Behavior
 is
 more
 of
 what
 we
 would
 call


zebra
 striping
 which
 is
 um
 you
 know
 I
 go


into
 a
 bar
 um
 I
 order
 a
 Guinness
 first


I'm
 still
 out
 with
 my
 friends
 and
 so
 uh


the
 next
 thing
 I'm
 going
 to
 order
 is
 a


Guinness
 z00
 that's
 how
 I'm
 moderating


um
 but
 at
 the
 same
 time
 I'm
 staying
 very


much
 within
 Guinness
 I'm
 staying
 in
 the


moment
 I
 still
 feel
 like
 I'm
 part
 of
 it


and
 so
 we're
 actually
 seeing
 that
 Jin
 Z


behavior
 um
 you
 know
 they're
 not


moderating
 as
 much
 as
 what
 um
 uh
 you


know
 people
 think
 um
 and
 so
 they
 drink


like
 every
 other
 alcoholic
 non-alcoholic


drink
 yeah
 and
 and
 they're
 clearly
 my


friends
 are
 not
 gen
 Z
 though
 well
 and


they're
 also
 they're
 coming
 into
 Spirits


faster
 so
 the
 other
 thing
 that
 we're


really
 experiencing
 is
 that
 while
 maybe


overall
 they
 are
 um
 you
 know
 moderating


through
 some
 behaviors
 they
 are
 they're


actually
 coming
 into
 Spirits
 faster
 um


and
 that's
 because
 of
 drinks
 like
 rtds


they're
 coming
 into
 tequila
 faster
 uh


because
 they're
 drinking
 Spirits
 with


food


um
 so
 there's
 you
 know
 it's
 one
 of
 those


that
 we
 see
 it
 as
 much
 of
 an
 opportunity


as
 we
 see
 it
 as
 um
 a
 headwind
 the
 other


thing
 going
 on
 is
 lifestyle
 so
 that's


what
 what
 you're
 kind
 of
 getting
 at
 is


this
 moderation
 area
 so
 but
 I'll
 start


by
 saying
 first
 of
 all
 social


socializing
 and
 kind
 of
 that
 uh
 the


social
 dynamics
 that
 unite
 us
 and
 the


local
 nuances
 of
 that
 socializing
 is
 a


big
 part
 of
 how
 how
 much
 of
 your
 sales


would
 be
 in
 you
 know
 in
 restaurants
 bars


and
 how
 much
 would
 be
 at
 home
 so
 that's


one
 of
 the
 trends
 we
 we
 should
 talk


about
 because
 what
 we're
 seeing
 is


actually
 more
 occasions
 we're
 seeing
 an


expansion
 of
 these
 socializing
 occasions


coming
 it
 like
 and
 they're
 quite


Diversified
 now
 it
 used
 to
 be
 a
 lot
 of


restaurants
 and
 bars
 but
 now
 you
 see


more
 and
 more
 socializing
 occurring
 at


home
 they're
 smaller
 it's
 kind
 of
 a


smaller
 setting
 there's
 maybe
 fewer
 you


know
 it's
 more
 informal
 setting
 but
 we


are
 seeing
 more
 occasions
 coming
 home
 um


and
 that's
 not
 just
 a
 CO
 Trend
 we
 were


seeing
 we've
 been
 seeing
 this
 trend
 for


a
 long
 time
 Co
 clearly
 kind
 of
 made
 home


as
 Fortress
 but
 that
 is
 a
 big
 part
 of


what
 we're
 also
 seeing
 a
 rise
 of
 what
 we


call
 the
 third
 spaces
 so
 what
 that
 is
 is


you're
 not
 in
 a
 bar
 you're
 not
 at
 home


but
 maybe
 you're
 out
 at
 a
 sports
 kind
 of


Arena
 or
 you're
 at
 a
 festival
 um
 this
 is


big
 for
 kind
 of
 ginz
 they're
 out
 and


about
 when
 they
 are
 consuming
 alcohol


they're
 often
 out
 in
 these
 third
 spaces


and
 so
 what
 we're
 seeing
 in
 the
 industry


is
 there's
 more
 formats
 and
 Siz


and
 you
 know
 this
 is
 like
 Rise
 of
 rtds


and
 some
 of
 this
 that
 you're
 seeing
 is


all
 uh
 the
 industry
 really
 capturing


those
 occasions
 and
 that's
 another
 big


kind
 of
 Tailwind
 for
 us
 but
 just
 if
 we


take
 these
 two
 two
 things
 so
 one
 uh


young
 people
 drink
 less
 how
 how
 how


significant
 is
 that
 yeah
 so
 let's
 talk


about
 moderation
 for
 a
 second
 because


it's
 not
 just
 we've
 we've
 been
 tracking


this
 trend
 for
 quite
 some
 time
 we
 call


it
 mindful


consumption
 um
 so
 I
 talked
 about
 how


value
 has
 been
 consistently
 growing


beverage
 alcohol
 for
 a
 long


time
 within
 that
 though
 and
 by
 the
 way


popularity
 has
 not
 waned
 it's
 actually


been
 quite
 strong
 70%
 of
 households


participate
 in
 that's
 been
 a
 pretty


steady
 Trend
 as
 well
 but
 volume
 per
 caps


actually
 peaked
 in
 2012
 and
 then
 they've


been
 slightly
 but
 steadily
 kind
 of


declining
 really
 since
 2012
 now
 what
 I


mean
 by
 slight
 it
 would
 be
 like
 from


2012
 till
 now
 it's
 like
 a
 bottle
 of
 wine


so
 it
 is
 slight
 but
 it
 is
 coming
 down


and
 we've
 seen
 that
 moderating
 trend
 for


a
 long
 time
 time
 so
 we
 drink
 less
 but


more
 expensive
 stuff
 yeah
 and
 actually


that's
 exactly
 what
 we
 say
 we
 say
 people


want
 to
 drink
 better
 not
 more
 and
 we've


set
 our
 whole
 growth
 strategy
 really


around
 that
 about
 and
 by
 the
 way
 Spirits


underneath
 of
 that
 per
 caps
 have
 held
 in


quite
 quite
 good
 because
 Spirits
 is


gaining
 from
 beer
 and
 wine
 we're
 gaining


in
 like
 food
 occasions
 and
 some
 of
 this


that
 you
 wouldn't
 have
 seen
 before


that's
 kind
 of
 been
 a
 space
 for
 wine
 and


beer
 what
 about
 some
 of
 the
 health


Trends
 and
 the
 anti-obesity
 drugs
 and
 so


on
 how
 is
 that
 impacting
 you
 yeah
 you


know
 we're
 not
 seeing
 that
 as
 separate


and
 distinct
 from
 those
 moderating


trends
 that
 we've
 been
 seeing
 you
 know


so
 look
 supposedly
 15
 million
 Americans


at
 any
 given
 time
 are
 are
 now
 on
 these


or
 at
 least
 trying
 you
 know
 these
 type


of
 weight
 loss
 drugs
 and
 and
 perhaps


they're
 on
 for
 other
 reasons
 as
 well


other
 health
 reasons
 um
 but
 we're
 not


seeing
 a
 that
 trend
 line
 break
 so
 while


people
 are
 being
 more
 mindful
 about
 what


they're
 consuming
 we're
 we're
 not
 seeing


that
 as
 as
 kind
 of
 this
 separate
 kind
 of


break
 in
 that
 in
 the
 overall
 trend
 are


you
 seeing
 big
 differences
 between


geographies
 is
 the
 trend
 in
 Europe
 very


different
 from


Asia
 I
 mean
 not
 really
 I
 would
 say
 this


is
 more
 of
 a
 developed
 Market
 phenomenon


um
 and
 and
 so
 that
 is
 where
 we're
 you


know
 where
 we're
 seeing
 that
 you
 know
 we


do
 see
 these
 Trends
 do
 tend
 to
 go
 around


the
 world
 and
 I
 would
 say
 in
 general
 we


are
 seeing
 kind
 of
 premiumize
 and
 people


thinking
 more
 about
 you
 know
 what


they're
 what
 they're
 consuming
 talking


of
 which
 um
 is
 the
 legalization
 of


Mariana
 having
 an
 impact
 on
 drink
 cons


well
 you
 know
 we're
 not
 really
 seeing


that
 either
 it's
 kind
 of
 a
 different


occasion
 you
 know
 this
 comes
 back
 to
 our


occasions
 are
 more
 these
 social


occasions
 that
 we
 talked
 about
 where
 you


tend
 to
 be
 like
 so
 socializing
 86%
 of


the
 time
 when
 you're
 having
 a
 drink


you're
 having
 it
 in
 the
 company
 of


others
 so
 those
 are
 bigger
 occasions
 for


us
 really
 than
 um
 quite
 often
 uh


cannabis
 and
 some
 of
 this
 which
 has
 been


legal
 now
 for
 some
 quite
 some
 time
 in
 in


several
 states
 in
 the
 US
 and
 we're
 not


really
 seeing
 once
 again
 A
 distinct
 you


know
 break
 in
 sort
 of
 the
 trends
 that


we've
 been
 seeing
 for
 quite
 some
 time


now
 how
 does
 this
 impact
 the
 way
 you


market
 and
 brand
 your
 products
 yeah
 so


we
 like
 I
 said
 we
 have
 grounded
 all
 of


our
 uh
 strategy
 and
 growth
 strategies


really
 within
 the
 spirits
 gaining


occasions
 from
 beer
 and
 wine
 so


expanding
 our
 Spirits
 occasions
 and


premiumize
 so
 our
 portfolio
 um
 is


oriented
 more
 more
 toward
 premium
 now
 so


almost
 I
 don't
 know
 62%
 of
 our
 portfolio


is
 sort
 of
 Premium
 Plus
 and
 that


compares
 to
 the
 industry
 average
 of
 kind


of
 being
 like
 35%
 so
 over
 time
 we've


actually


divested
 um
 kind
 of
 some
 of
 our
 more


value
 Brands
 and
 we've
 actually
 invested


in
 things
 like
 you
 mentioned
 our
 our


tequila
 brands
 earlier
 those
 are
 kind
 of


Ultra
 Premium
 priced
 so
 we've
 reoriented


our
 portfolio
 to
 more
 premiumization
 and


then
 from
 a
 marketing
 standpoint
 there's


there's
 six
 trends
 that
 we
 are
 that
 that


we've
 kind
 of
 said
 we
 want
 to
 lead
 in


shape
 so
 not
 surprisingly
 moderation
 one


so
 we've
 gone
 out
 we've
 acquired
 some


non-
 out
 kind
 of
 spirit
 Brands
 so
 ritual


in
 the
 US
 is
 one
 of
 those
 um
 convenience


so
 this
 is
 sort
 of
 these
 rtds
 and
 you


know
 if
 you're
 out
 in
 these
 third
 spaces


what
 are
 you
 doing
 it's
 luxury
 so
 we're


still
 seeing
 luxury
 as
 being
 um
 you
 know


we're
 going
 to
 see
 by
 2028
 almost
 a


quarter
 um
 of
 the
 category
 we
 think
 will


be
 in
 these
 kind
 of
 more
 Super
 Premium


Plus
 priced
 uh
 products
 so
 luxury
 is
 a


part
 with
 food
 so
 you
 may
 go
 what
 is


this
 you
 know
 I'm
 a
 Texan
 so
 um
 the
 best


thing
 with
 Mexican
 food
 is
 a
 margarita


it's
 not
 beer
 wine
 so
 those
 are
 the


types
 of
 things
 we're
 going
 after
 what


do
 you
 have
 with
 your
 steak
 um
 I
 would


have
 whiskey
 for
 sure
 okay
 good
 a
 good


Smoky
 like
 Isa


whiskey
 by
 the
 way
 what
 is
 your
 favorite


drink
 so
 you
 know
 I
 love
 all
 of
 the


children
 um
 I
 you
 know
 so
 but
 not
 in
 the


same
 glass
 at
 the
 same
 time
 yeah
 no
 no


no
 no
 um
 I'm
 a
 big
 tequila
 fan
 I'm
 a


Texan
 so
 you
 know
 so
 Don
 Julio
 I'm
 1942


but
 I'm
 I'm
 also
 a
 big
 I
 like
 a
 pety


scotch
 so
 I
 like
 our
 Johnny
 Walker
 black


I
 like
 our


lagavulin
 um
 you
 know
 in
 the
 summer
 I


like
 a
 good
 genen
 and
 tonic
 I
 like
 a


good
 Tanger
 tonic
 so
 pretty
 FX


pretty
 flexible
 um
 now
 um
 I
 should
 ask


you
 what
 your
 favorite
 drink
 is
 well
 I'm


I'm
 I'm
 actually
 uh
 a
 bit
 more
 of
 a
 wine


drinker
 but
 if
 I
 were
 to
 hit
 one
 of
 your


products
 it
 would
 probably
 be
 uh
 the


Gonic
 does
 it
 matter
 if
 you're
 like


traveling
 or
 no
 mainly
 that
 would
 be


summer
 but
 but
 not
 very
 often
 that's


your
 summer
 but
 not
 very
 often
 okay
 well


we
 got
 to
 work
 on
 you
 totally
 totally


anytime
 uh
 tariffs


yes
 well
 I
 mean
 look
 we're
 in
 180


countries


and
 we're
 a
 big
 importer
 and
 exporter


and
 so
 clearly
 we
 love
 free
 trade
 um
 you


know
 however
 honestly
 over
 time
 we
 have


dealt
 with
 a
 lot
 of
 Duties
 and
 tariffs


and
 you
 know
 disruptions
 so
 we
 take
 a


long
 view
 of
 these
 things
 and
 we
 look
 at


it
 and
 say
 you
 know
 we've
 we
 certainly


can
 navigate
 through
 the
 any
 of
 these


things
 you
 know
 and
 I
 mean
 look
 there's


been
 tariffs
 and
 and
 high
 duties
 on


Scotch
 for
 years
 is
 an
 example
 going


from
 uh
 Scotland
 into
 India
 um
 they're


short-term
 disruptive


no
 doubt
 um
 and
 it's
 probably
 the


uncertainty
 that's
 the
 hardest
 thing
 to


plan
 for
 is
 when
 you
 don't
 you
 know
 it's


hard
 to
 mitigate
 those
 until
 you
 know


exactly
 what
 those
 are
 going
 to
 look


like
 so
 you
 know
 we're
 clearly
 staying


very
 close
 on
 all
 of
 it
 and
 um
 you
 know


but
 we
 see
 that
 from
 a
 long
 run
 we
 can


absolutely
 mitigate
 those
 things
 we
 know


what
 to
 do
 you
 know
 it's
 just
 really


more
 of
 just
 navigating
 through
 the


short
 run
 and
 you
 know
 how
 do
 we
 how
 do


we
 mitigate
 that
 when
 you
 buy
 Brands
 I


mean
 you
 bought
 for
 instance
 uh
 tequila


brand
 from
 George
 Clooney
 I
 think
 you


paid
 a
 billion
 dollars
 so
 yes
 well
 done


him
 uh
 when
 when
 do
 you
 when
 do
 you
 buy


well
 done
 us
 it's
 been
 a
 great
 brand
 for


us
 win-win
 um
 but
 when
 do
 you
 when
 do


you
 buy
 a
 brand
 and
 when
 do
 you
 build
 it


and
 how
 um
 you
 know
 what
 are
 what
 are


the
 considerations
 here
 yeah
 I
 mean
 you


know
 look
 we
 do
 have
 a
 you
 know
 we've


got
 13
 billion
 do
 Brands
 we're
 number


one
 or
 number
 two
 in
 many
 of
 our
 of


these
 categories
 so
 um
 I
 really
 love
 our


portfolio
 you
 know
 that
 being
 said
 um


you
 you
 know
 we
 do
 look
 for
 spaces
 where


we
 don't
 have
 uh
 maybe
 a
 strong
 of
 a


brand
 or
 a
 brand
 because
 we
 also
 are


across
 price
 tiers
 as
 well
 um
 you
 know


so
 that
 can
 be
 important
 as
 well
 where


sometimes
 we
 don't
 feel
 like
 you
 know
 we


have
 a
 premium
 enough
 brand
 or
 um
 like


in
 the
 non-al
 space
 our
 most
 recent


acquisition
 in
 ritual
 in
 the
 US
 uh
 we


had
 seed
 lip
 that
 we
 took
 it
 was
 a
 big


brand
 for
 us
 in
 the
 UK
 that
 was
 non
 out


um
 but
 in
 you
 know
 in
 the
 US
 this
 ritual


um
 seed
 lip
 is
 kind
 of
 more
 in
 the
 Gin


space
 I
 would
 say
 and
 you
 know
 ritual
 uh


had
 a
 brand
 that
 kind
 of
 spanned
 across


as
 a
 tequila
 alternative
 a
 Jin


alternative
 a
 whiskey
 alternative
 Etc


and
 so
 that
 has
 been
 the
 number
 one
 we


felt
 like
 we
 didn't
 have
 anything
 that


could
 go
 there
 so
 we
 went
 out
 um
 and


acquired
 that
 likewise
 we
 we
 dispose
 of


Brands
 um
 you
 know
 some
 of
 our
 disposals


that
 we've
 done
 in
 India
 we
 disposed
 of


kind
 of
 our
 value
 and
 popular
 kind
 of


price
 point
 because
 we
 just
 see
 a


long-term
 premiumization
 there
 and
 that


part
 of
 the
 portfolio
 represented
 a
 lot


of
 volume
 but
 it
 wasn't
 necessarily
 set


to
 drive
 growth
 for
 the
 future
 so


acquisition
 wise
 we
 kind
 of
 look
 for


where
 we
 don't
 have
 but
 but
 quite


honestly
 most
 spaces
 we
 can
 really
 go


after
 With
 Our
 Brands
 and
 and
 we've
 got


a
 consumer
 Choice
 framework
 that
 helps


us
 it
 actually
 looks
 at
 these


socializing
 Trends
 it
 looks
 at
 um
 across


we've
 got
 37
 markets
 that
 we
 track
 like


220
 million
 occasions
 that
 we're
 taking


a
 look
 at
 what
 they're
 drinking
 uh
 who


they're
 with
 how
 they're
 drinking


because
 it's
 look
 at
 socializing
 as
 well


as
 what
 they're
 what
 they're


doing
 and
 how
 do
 you
 use
 that
 analytics


so
 you
 have
 all
 this
 incredible
 data
 and


we
 probably
 should
 inject
 here
 that
 you


have
 your
 background
 from
 the


intelligence
 service
 so
 you
 are
 really


into
 Data
 I
 do
 I
 I
 am
 into
 Data
 I
 love


data
 and
 and
 and
 I
 love
 it
 because
 it


really
 helps
 us
 do
 you
 know
 Precision


marketing
 and
 when
 you
 get
 when
 you
 get


that
 right
 when
 you
 get
 the
 right
 brand


at
 the
 right
 time
 you
 know
 to
 the
 right


person
 I
 mean
 that
 that
 experience
 it


elevates
 the
 whole
 experience
 and
 that's


what
 we're
 trying
 to
 do
 we're
 trying
 to


elevate
 these
 moments
 for
 so
 you
 have


220
 million
 data
 points
 I
 mean
 what
 do


you
 what
 do
 you
 what
 do
 we
 do
 with
 that


that
 helps
 us
 in
 deploying
 for
 for
 one


it
 helps
 us
 see
 the
 best
 opportunities


we
 marry
 that
 up
 with
 the
 Best
 Brands
 we


make
 sure
 that
 we
 are
 you
 know
 marketing


within
 that
 occasion
 and
 we
 serve
 up
 the


best
 serve


options
 for
 for
 people
 it
 you
 know
 it


just
 helps
 us
 be
 much
 more
 precise
 about


where
 to
 go
 and
 especially
 in
 these
 type


of
 moments
 where
 it's
 quite
 volatile
 and


you
 do
 have
 consumers
 Under
 Pressure


being
 able
 um
 you
 know
 when
 we
 get
 this


right
 consumers
 are
 willing
 to
 spend


money
 because
 they
 see
 value
 and
 that


they're
 getting
 great
 quality
 exactly


what
 they
 want
 um
 so
 let
 so
 let's
 take


an
 example
 here
 so
 jny
 Johnny
 Walker


yeah
 you
 have
 different
 types
 of
 Johnny


Walker
 at
 different
 price
 points
 so
 how


does
 is
 architecture
 work
 how
 do
 you


think
 about
 it
 I
 mean
 Johnny
 Walker
 so


the
 most
 expensive
 Johnny
 Walker
 what
 is


that
 yeah
 well
 we
 just
 launched
 the


Vault
 did
 you
 see
 this
 so
 this
 we


launched
 a
 um
 this
 is
 going
 to
 be
 a


customized
 Johnny
 Walker
 blend
 for
 you


it's
 50,000
 pounds
 for
 that
 privilege
 so


it
 is
 at
 the
 tippy
 top
 of
 but
 it
 is
 a


personalized
 experience
 around
 Johnny


Walker
 and
 you
 get
 to
 go
 to
 to
 Princess


Street
 in
 Edinburgh
 and
 we
 will
 craft


this
 for
 you
 and
 so
 we


you
 know
 this
 is
 a
 very
 special


experience
 in
 and
 of
 itself
 so
 we
 have


all
 the
 way
 of
 that
 all
 the
 way
 to
 you


know
 a
 Johnny
 Walker
 red
 which
 depending


upon
 the
 market
 that
 you're
 in
 and
 in


between
 you
 got
 blue
 and
 black
 we've
 got


black
 we've
 got
 blue
 we've
 got
 green
 and


gold
 we've
 got
 double
 black
 we
 it
 really


spans
 and
 and
 I
 have
 to
 say
 I've
 been


around
 marketing
 for
 a
 long
 time


probably
 one
 of
 the
 most
 unique
 brands


in
 the
 world
 how
 much
 because
 we
 span


all
 of
 that
 credibly
 how
 much
 more


profitable
 is
 the
 expensive
 version


versus
 the
 cheap


version
 we
 have
 great
 margins
 across


scotch
 and
 part
 of
 it
 is
 um
 you
 know


look
 you
 know
 it's
 how
 you
 make
 Scotch


so
 remember
 for
 Johnny
 Walker
 black
 um


if
 you
 want
 to
 be
 selling
 that
 uh
 10


years
 from
 now
 you
 better
 have
 barreled


it
 and
 put
 it
 in
 a
 barrel
 two
 years
 ago


so
 it's
 a
 12-year-old
 scotch
 and
 you


know
 we
 have
 a
 a
 you
 know
 quite
 a


competitive
 mode
 around
 that
 because
 of


you
 know
 we're
 very
 good
 at
 blending
 and


Distilling
 we're
 very
 good
 at
 maturing


we're
 very
 good
 at
 bottling
 we're
 very


good
 at
 getting
 this
 out
 around
 the


world
 so
 our
 margins
 across
 Scotch
 are


you
 know
 are
 very
 good
 whether
 we're


selling
 it
 because
 remember
 if
 you're


this
 like
 Johnny
 Walker
 red
 is
 not
 in
 a


barrel
 for
 12
 years
 it's
 in
 a
 barrel
 for


much
 less
 time
 so
 therefore
 all
 of
 these


prices
 kind
 of
 correspond
 to
 you
 know


what
 we've
 put
 into
 the
 product
 so
 I


think
 that's
 so
 uh
 interesting
 so
 when


uh
 in
 the
 past
 when
 I
 studied
 this


industry
 uh
 you
 kind
 of
 differentiate


between
 white
 spirits
 and
 brown
 Spirits


White
 Spirit
 you
 go
 from
 a
 potato
 to


cash
 in
 one
 week
 right
 right
 you
 can
 go


I
 mean
 you
 can
 make
 V
 guy
 in
 one
 week


right
 although
 you
 can
 from
 nothing
 well


the
 brown
 the
 brown
 Spirits
 you
 need
 to


seller
 and
 age
 and
 you
 have
 no
 sales


whilst
 you
 do
 this
 so
 you
 it's
 you
 need


to
 have
 pretty
 Deep
 Pockets
 right
 yeah


and
 it's
 a
 very
 you
 know
 and
 these
 are


very
 different
 businesses
 but
 you
 take


something
 like
 tequila
 which
 is
 both


both
 a
 white
 and
 a
 dark
 spirit
 M
 but
 in


Tequila
 you
 know
 you're
 spending
 seven


years
 with
 the
 the
 the
 blue
 agave
 plant


and
 then
 you
 age
 it
 so
 Reposado
 is
 one


of
 our
 uh
 fastest
 growing
 kind
 of
 Don


Julios
 right
 now
 and
 that's
 actually


aged
 you
 know
 at
 least
 six
 months
 so


that
 process
 if
 you
 think
 about
 from
 the


from
 the
 seed
 all
 the
 way
 to
 you
 know


that's
 so
 even
 in
 within
 white
 Spirits


now
 you've
 got
 uh
 a
 range
 of
 things


going
 on
 around
 aging


um
 particularly
 on
 on
 tequila
 if
 you


think
 about
 it
 that
 way
 although


Reposado
 does
 start
 to
 get
 into
 more
 the


the
 dark
 Spirits
 it's
 one
 of
 the
 reasons


we're
 excited
 about
 tequila
 is
 because


it
 goes
 from
 white
 to
 dark
 it
 goes


across
 occasions
 Daytime
 Nighttime
 you


know
 because
 his
 dark
 Spirits
 you
 tend


to
 uh
 consume
 those
 in
 certain
 occasions


so
 whiskies
 rums
 you
 tend
 to
 consume


those
 in
 certain
 occasions
 and
 then


likewise
 you
 know
 for
 white
 Spirits
 you


know
 those
 are
 daytime
 occasions
 a
 lot


although
 you
 have
 a
 good
 nightclub


cocktails
 too
 so
 it
 you
 know
 it
 is
 quite


interesting
 this
 expansion
 of
 occasions


and
 where
 we're
 seeing
 drinks
 and
 how


versatile
 Spirits
 is
 is
 one
 of
 the


things
 how
 loyal
 are
 we
 to
 Our
 Brands


how
 loyal
 yeah
 we're
 very
 loyal
 you
 mean


what
 kind
 of
 loyalty
 we
 see
 from


consumers
 or
 yeah
 I
 mean
 like
 let's
 say


now
 I'm
 I'm
 into
 one
 type
 of
 drink
 do
 I


always
 drink
 the
 same
 thing
 I
 consumers


drink
 in
 repertoire
 for
 sure
 so
 and


particularly
 you
 know
 I
 I
 I
 was
 listing


some
 of
 the
 Trends
 we
 go
 after
 there's
 a


whole
 Trend
 around
 exploration
 and


experiences
 that
 we
 see
 people
 wanting


to
 try
 new
 things
 and
 so
 quite
 often


it's
 the
 reason
 um
 on
 trade
 in
 the


industry
 is
 so
 important
 often
 people
 go


with
 what
 bartenders
 recommend
 or
 what


they
 see
 on
 a
 menu
 often
 people
 will
 go


in
 and
 not
 really
 know
 what
 they're


going
 to
 to
 purchase
 until
 they
 get
 sort


of
 inspired
 by
 by
 something
 and
 that's


you
 know
 like
 I
 said
 the
 versatility
 of


spirits
 is
 one
 of
 the
 things
 that
 gives


us
 a
 great
 long
 runway
 for
 growth
 what's


the
 brand
 what's
 the
 one
 brand
 you
 would


love
 to
 have
 which
 you
 haven't


got


oh
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 I'm
 going
 to
 answer


that
 because
 you're
 going
 to
 buy
 it
 soon


right
 I
 was
 going
 to
 say
 you
 don't
 want


to
 you
 don't
 want
 to
 prepare
 anyone
 do


you
 think
 uh
 do
 you
 think
 about
 it
 like


a
 portfolio
 like
 we
 think
 about
 the


portfolio
 of
 companies
 we
 own
 do
 you


think
 about
 your
 Brands
 like
 that
 well


we
 do
 I
 mean
 you
 know
 because
 this
 comes


back
 to
 you
 want
 to
 be
 quite
 precise
 in


your
 marketing
 so
 we
 have
 kind
 of
 the


consumer
 Choice
 framework
 to
 where
 we


see
 um
 like
 as
 we're
 expanding
 tequila


around
 the
 world
 we
 see
 certain
 markets


that
 we
 think
 are
 ready
 more
 or
 less


ready
 for
 that
 right
 um
 but
 we
 also
 have


a
 market
 growth
 framework
 as
 well
 that


we
 look
 at
 markets
 that
 same
 way
 of
 just


in
 general
 taking
 a
 look
 at
 the
 market


and
 the
 you
 know
 the
 tax
 the
 regulatory


uh
 the
 profitability
 that
 we
 can
 get
 out


of
 the
 market
 and
 and
 we
 make
 those
 type


of
 strategic
 allocations
 upfront
 as
 well


to
 say
 um
 you
 know
 look
 there's
 certain


bets
 you're
 placing
 for
 10
 years
 from


now
 you
 know
 you
 look
 at
 we
 just
 opened


up
 uh
 un
 12
 which
 is
 our
 Chinese
 whiskey


Distillery
 um
 you
 know
 these
 are
 these


are
 10year
 bets
 that
 you're
 doing
 in


something
 like
 that
 compared
 to
 you
 know


we
 know
 that
 in
 the
 next
 you
 know
 couple


of
 years
 we're
 seeing
 a
 lot
 more


opportunity
 in
 some
 of
 the
 developed


markets
 um
 because
 we're
 seeing
 kind
 of


faster
 recovery
 um
 potentially
 coming


out
 of
 some
 of
 of
 some
 of
 those
 markets


in
 some
 of
 those
 areas
 switching
 gear


herbit
 Cora
 culture
 What's
 the
 corpa


culture
 like
 in
 dio
 yeah
 so
 if
 I
 if
 I


came
 in
 I
 start
 to
 work
 what
 kind
 of


things
 I
 would
 I
 would
 observe
 yeah
 well


we
 always
 say
 you
 know
 we've
 got
 30,000


brand
 builders
 whether
 you're
 in
 Supply


marketing
 Finance
 HR
 everyone
 is
 quite


focused
 on
 Our
 Brands
 and
 building
 our


brands
 people
 love
 the
 history
 um
 we


have
 a
 lot
 of
 passion
 around
 Our
 Brands


and
 so
 if
 you
 look
 at
 our
 you
 kind
 of


got
 a
 bar
 on
 each
 floor
 here
 right
 Nell


we
 do
 we
 have
 and
 a
 shop
 in
 it's
 not
 on


each
 floor
 but
 we
 do
 have
 more
 than
 one


bar
 in
 the
 office
 so
 yeah
 so
 I
 mean


people
 love
 it
 and
 it's
 but
 we've
 got


four
 values
 we
 that
 that
 are
 very
 much
 I


think
 help
 describe
 our
 culture
 we're


passionate
 about
 consumers
 and


customers
 value
 each
 other
 we're
 very


collaborative
 culture
 uh
 proud
 of
 what


we
 do
 I
 think
 we're
 very
 proud
 not
 only


of
 Our
 Brands
 but
 also
 things
 that
 we
 do


in
 the
 community
 you
 know
 around


sustainability
 you
 know
 Etc
 and
 then


there
 is
 one
 value
 that
 so
 actually
 when


I
 came
 in
 as


um
 a
 COO
 and
 then
 uh
 was
 announced
 I


would
 be
 CEO
 I
 actually
 went
 out
 to
 a


bunch
 of
 our
 senior
 leaders
 not
 the


executive
 team
 but
 a
 couple
 layers
 down


and
 asked
 them
 to
 help
 me
 sort
 of
 assess


our
 culture
 and
 values
 in
 various


markets
 and
 across
 functions
 around
 the


world
 in
 an
 effort
 to
 kind
 of
 reignite


and
 sort
 of
 strengthen
 the
 culture
 and


there
 was
 one
 value
 that
 as
 they
 looked


at
 we
 had
 a
 value
 called
 be
 the
 best


which
 sounds
 great
 on
 the
 surface
 um
 and


there's
 many
 great
 things
 about
 it
 but


it
 was
 creating
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 culture
 of


perfection


um
 if
 it
 wasn't
 the
 best
 you
 know
 bad


news
 didn't
 travel
 as
 fast
 um
 when
 you


think
 about
 wanting
 to
 you
 know


consumers
 move
 fast
 today
 it's
 kind
 of
 a


volatile
 World
 needing
 Speed
 and
 Agility


in
 the
 culture
 we
 felt
 like
 be
 the
 best


was
 undermining
 us
 so
 we
 actually


changed
 that
 to
 be
 better
 and


subsequently
 rolled
 out
 behind
 some


behaviors
 that
 would
 help
 us
 uh
 so
 we


called
 them
 behavioral
 dialup
 how
 would


we
 be
 better
 as
 a
 you
 know
 from
 a


cultural
 standpoint
 it
 was
 about
 being


externally
 focused
 collaborating
 but
 we


put
 the
 word
 efficiently
 behind
 it
 so


continuing
 to
 collaborate
 but
 having
 the


right
 only
 the
 right
 people
 in
 the
 room


instead
 of
 having
 kind
 of
 to
 get
 gain


agreement
 from
 a
 cast
 of
 thousands


before
 you
 would
 do
 something
 um
 act


decisively
 was
 part
 of
 it
 as
 well


um
 experimenting
 and
 learning
 have
 you


seen
 changes
 on
 the
 back
 of
 this
 we
 have


um
 it's
 it's
 difficult
 it's
 difficult
 to


change
 corpor
 culture
 is
 um
 but
 we've


changed
 you
 know
 what
 was
 great
 about
 it


though
 I
 will
 say
 is
 this
 didn't
 come


from
 me
 pushing
 this
 out
 or
 the


executive
 team
 this
 actually
 came
 from


across
 our
 organization
 this
 is
 what


they
 wanted
 to
 change
 and
 that
 it's


taking
 some
 of
 the
 best
 of
 be
 the
 best


but
 also
 injecting
 kind
 of
 learning
 and


continuous
 Improvement
 in
 it
 so
 like


we've
 changed
 some
 of
 our
 Global


processes
 like
 Innovation
 where
 you
 know


we
 had
 kind
 of
 the
 classic
 five
 kind
 of


stage


Innovation
 that
 particularly
 for
 things


that
 are
 less
 risk
 we've
 gotten
 that


down
 to
 two
 it's
 only
 two
 stages
 and


it's
 we've
 really
 cut
 down
 on
 the
 number


of
 people
 that
 have
 to
 weigh
 in
 it's


helping
 us
 get
 Innovation
 out
 faster
 so


how
 much
 F
 how
 much
 how
 much
 faster
 do


you
 launch
 new
 products
 now
 do
 you
 think


that
 well
 in
 that
 compared
 to
 the
 old
 we


we
 were
 able
 to
 take
 out
 almost
 a
 year


from
 some
 of
 our
 processes
 I
 mean
 that


tells
 you
 something
 because
 some
 of


these
 take
 longer
 you
 know
 when
 you're


doing
 a
 big
 kind
 of
 breakthrough


Innovation
 it's
 one
 thing
 but
 if
 you're


doing
 we
 had
 that
 same
 process
 for


almost
 everything
 and
 so
 therefore
 you


know
 that's
 allowed
 us
 to
 take
 that
 out


we're
 also
 failing
 faster
 and
 learning


because
 this
 comes
 back
 to
 you
 don't


have
 to
 be
 not
 everything
 will
 work
 and


if
 we
 can
 fail
 fast
 and
 sort
 of
 learn


from
 it
 and
 adapt
 um
 and
 actually
 we


celebrate
 some
 of
 those
 now
 you
 know


it's
 like
 this
 isn't
 working
 and
 here's


what
 we
 learned
 from
 it
 and
 we're
 moving


on
 tell
 me
 something
 that
 didn't
 work
 a


launch
 that
 didn't
 work
 which
 we
 supp


total
 Fiasco
 we
 just
 had
 because
 we
 just


had
 a
 a
 meeting
 on
 this
 um
 and
 we
 we


celebrated
 it
 much
 like
 if
 you've
 heard


of
 uh
 you
 know
 Dia
 deos
 muos
 The
 Day
 of


the
 Dead
 you
 celebrate
 those
 things
 that


you've
 killed
 um
 and
 so
 you
 know
 we've


got
 a
 um
 a
 a
 ready
 to
 to
 drink
 Margarita


that
 we
 had
 a
 brand
 on
 it
 um
 a
 straw


that
 it
 was
 just
 kind
 of
 it
 just
 didn't


work
 and
 so
 it
 was
 you
 know
 there
 was
 a


poem
 read
 out
 about
 it
 what
 went
 wrong


and
 then
 we
 all
 thanked
 it
 for
 what
 it


had
 done
 for
 us
 and
 we
 were
 moving
 on


you
 you
 know
 and
 we
 had
 you
 know
 there


was
 kind
 of
 a
 a
 scroll
 of
 these
 that
 we


have
 but
 it's
 you
 know
 it
 was
 quite
 a


great
 way
 um
 this
 was
 at
 our
 senior


leader
 meeting
 that
 we
 could
 sort
 of


celebrate
 that
 we're
 out
 there


experimenting
 and
 learning
 and
 moving
 on


and
 by
 the
 way
 we've
 got
 a
 great
 we're


launching
 KAS
 Amigos
 ready
 to
 drink
 in
 a


can
 we've
 learned
 a
 lot
 from
 the
 prior


launch
 and
 you
 know
 it
 enables
 you
 to


just
 move
 on
 have
 you
 had
 any
 big


surprises
 on
 the
 upside
 um
 and
 the


reason
 why
 I'm
 ask
 you
 I
 read
 this
 book


about
 this
 drink
 which
 scored


unbelievably
 badly
 on


taste
 and
 it
 was
 then
 launched
 at
 a
 very


high
 price
 per
 you
 know
 with
 small
 cans


and
 is
 now
 one
 of
 the
 biggest
 sellers
 in


the
 world
 is
 Red
 Bull
 yeah
 I
 mean
 uh
 the


tasting
 notes
 were
 just
 unbelievably
 bad


yeah
 and
 so
 it's
 kind
 of
 shocking
 that


it's
 taking
 taken
 the
 world
 right
 have


you
 had
 any
 like
 big
 surprises
 where
 you


thought
 this
 is
 not
 going
 to


particularly
 work
 and
 then
 suddenly
 Bang


Yeah
 I
 mean
 look
 I
 think
 um
 you
 know


it's
 you
 know
 it's
 interesting
 because


what
 you
 do
 have
 is
 a
 lot
 of
 times
 um


you
 know
 there
 are
 things
 that
 when
 we


launch
 it
 I
 think
 will
 do
 better
 or


worse
 and
 so
 you
 do
 get
 surprised


sometimes
 something
 that
 you
 think
 is


going
 to
 do
 really
 well
 and
 then
 it
 just


doesn't
 get
 you
 know
 it
 doesn't
 get
 the


upt
 and
 then
 you
 know
 vice
 versa
 um
 I'm


trying
 to
 think
 if
 there's
 anything
 in


you
 know
 that
 I've
 kind
 of
 seen
 lately


that
 has
 really
 surprised
 me
 I
 you
 know


I
 think
 you
 know
 quite
 often
 one
 of
 the


most
 important
 things
 is
 to
 get
 things


right
 kind
 of
 end
 to
 end
 and
 so


sometimes
 you
 know
 it
 is
 about
 getting


the
 system
 behind
 it
 it's
 about
 getting


great
 brand
 work
 out
 to
 explain
 what


what
 it
 what
 it
 is
 um
 you
 know
 I
 think


I've
 been
 surprised
 by
 just
 how
 well
 um


things
 like
 you
 know
 Reposado
 is
 doing


not
 that
 Reposado
 tequila
 isn't
 great


but
 it's
 just
 it's
 been
 amazing
 how
 this


is
 all
 of
 a
 sudden
 taken
 over
 kind
 of


the
 world
 even
 more
 so
 than
 like
 AO


which
 actually
 is
 aged
 a
 little
 bit


longer
 and
 kind
 of
 has
 you
 know
 what
 in


my
 opinion
 is
 a
 little
 bit
 smoother


tasting
 note
 but
 you
 know
 but
 that
 seems


to
 be
 the
 one
 that's
 really
 hitting
 it


for
 consumers
 so
 I
 think
 sometimes
 you


can't
 you
 just
 can't
 judge
 what
 is
 what


is
 going
 to
 be
 really
 amazing
 although


there
 will
 be
 people
 that
 will
 say
 I


know
 exactly
 why
 and
 so
 you
 know
 a
 lot


of
 times
 you
 have
 brand
 Champions
 within


this
 the
 system
 that
 kind
 of
 you
 know


keep
 plugging
 through
 um
 you
 know
 we're


launching
 right
 now
 we've
 got
 a
 a
 a


Captain
 Morgan
 um
 sweet
 chili
 lime
 oh


you
 know
 so
 that's
 quite
 an
 aggressive


kind
 of
 different
 taste
 um
 but
 we


developed
 it
 with
 Jen
 Z's
 and
 so
 you


know
 I
 don't
 even
 in
 many
 ways
 I'm


thinking
 I
 don't
 even
 know
 how
 to
 think


about
 that
 right
 I'm
 possibly
 too
 old
 to


to
 judge
 um
 smof
 Tamarindo
 is
 another


good
 one
 where
 we
 um
 this
 is
 actually


taken
 over
 the
 world
 and
 this
 is
 one


that
 the
 Mexico
 team
 launched
 a
 long


time
 ago
 I
 remember
 when
 it
 was
 coming


into
 the
 US
 the
 US
 was
 kind
 of
 going


well
 we'll
 do
 it
 as
 a
 limited
 time
 offer


we'll
 see
 and
 then
 over
 time
 that
 that


ended
 up
 being
 a
 a
 real
 favorite
 it's


one
 of
 the
 you
 know
 best
 flavors
 on


smernoff
 so
 you
 do
 get
 surprised
 for


sure
 now
 some
 people
 um
 are
 kind
 of


Old-Timers
 in
 their
 companies
 you
 have


experiences
 from
 a
 lot
 of
 other
 consumer


goods
 companies
 right
 you've
 been
 in


craft
 nesle
 PepsiCo
 yeah
 right


absolutely
 how
 do
 you
 weigh
 the
 the


positives
 and
 negatives
 of
 having
 a
 lot


of
 experience
 versus
 being
 in
 one


company
 the
 whole
 time
 yeah
 I
 mean
 think


you
 know
 we
 always
 look
 and
 I
 you
 know


this
 is
 a
 unique
 industry
 and
 so
 it
 is


it
 is
 very
 important
 that
 you
 have
 kind


of
 deep
 industry
 knowledge
 in
 many
 ways


it's
 also
 a
 very
 local
 industry
 so
 it's


very
 important
 like
 it
 used
 to
 be
 when


we
 would
 go
 around
 the
 world
 expanding


our
 Brands
 it
 was
 like
 kind
 of
 expats
 on


the
 move
 over
 time
 we're
 seeing
 you
 know


if
 great
 Brands
 get
 built
 with
 local


activation
 and
 you
 know
 resonating


within
 culture
 and
 so
 having
 local


knowledge
 is
 important
 and
 so
 over
 time


we
 always
 want
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 we've


injected
 enough
 local
 kind
 of
 experience


as
 well
 even
 if
 they've
 had
 to
 come
 from


outside
 the
 industry
 to
 kind
 of
 build


that
 um
 so
 we
 kind
 of
 have
 like
 a


combination
 of
 deep
 Spirits
 experience


local
 knowledge
 and
 then
 also
 bringing


in
 new
 capability
 I
 do
 think
 you
 know
 as


you
 come
 in
 from
 sometimes
 other


companies
 there's
 things
 that
 other


companies
 are
 doing
 that
 you
 can
 kind
 of


inject
 into
 the
 culture
 here
 tell
 me


something
 that
 you
 have
 brought
 from


your
 your
 past
 history
 inia
 yeah
 I
 think


look
 um
 you
 know
 from
 working
 at
 places


like
 Pepsi
 and
 you
 know
 um
 you
 know
 our


our
 new
 CFO
 is
 is
 from
 Coke
 you
 know
 one


of
 the
 things
 that's
 really
 popular


right
 now
 are
 smaller
 sizes
 smaller


sizes
 in
 the
 industry
 used
 to
 be
 thought


of
 is
 kind
 of
 only
 you
 know
 these
 are


like
 think
 about
 things
 like
 the
 airline


bottles
 you
 know
 these
 50
 MLS
 or
 like
 a


375
 so
 kind
 of
 half
 the
 size
 of
 a
 normal


bottle
 of
 of
 spirits
 those
 are
 those
 are


driving
 the
 growth
 in
 the
 US
 right
 now


in
 fact
 you
 know
 and
 and
 and
 they're


being
 driven
 on
 premium
 Brands
 so


because
 the
 industry
 used
 to
 think
 about


this
 as
 a
 value
 size
 we
 didn't
 put
 our


premium
 brands
 in
 this
 now
 we've
 got


1942
 Don
 Julio
 and
 these
 little
 50
 MLS


these
 are
 so
 popular
 I
 mean
 they
 have
 to


they
 have
 to
 put
 them
 behind
 the
 usually


behind
 the
 cash
 register
 yeah
 that's


because
 they're
 easy
 to
 steal
 right
 well


but
 but
 still
 they're
 not
 stealing
 the


other
 50
 MLS
 you
 know
 there
 it
 is
 just


and
 it's
 not
 and
 these
 are
 not


inexpensive


but
 but
 they've
 captured
 you
 know
 for


one
 it's
 capturing
 this
 moment
 of
 it's
 a


pressured
 wallet
 right
 and
 sometimes
 you


only
 have
 a
 certain
 amount
 of
 cash
 um


but
 it's
 also
 you
 know
 look
 you
 you
 may


pay
 15
 even
 up
 up
 to
 almost
 $20
 for
 this


but
 you
 know
 but
 people
 look
 at
 that
 and


go
 hey
 it's
 it's
 got
 some
 cache
 it's
 you


know
 it's
 cute
 you
 can
 dip
 it
 over
 in
 a


in
 a
 bottle
 so
 everybody
 knows
 what


you're
 drinking
 you
 know
 that
 you
 so


some
 of
 these
 type
 of
 things
 but
 of


course
 Pepsi
 and
 Coke
 have
 been
 doing


these
 various
 sizes
 for
 a
 long
 time
 and


I
 think
 you
 know
 it's
 those
 types
 of


things
 that
 you
 know
 sometimes
 having


those
 injection
 of
 other
 ideas
 you
 need


to
 understand
 of
 course
 the
 norms
 and


sort
 of
 what's
 Happening
 underneath
 of


it
 but
 you
 know
 we
 have
 found
 if
 you
 do


it
 well
 you
 don't
 want
 to
 take
 you
 know


you
 don't
 want
 to
 cheapen
 these
 brands


in
 any
 way
 but
 if
 you
 still
 merchandise


them
 well
 if
 they're
 in
 a
 nice
 glass


bottle
 um
 it's
 actually
 meeting
 consumer


needs
 right
 now
 what's
 your
 leadership


style
 like
 yeah
 I
 mean
 um
 I
 always
 think


it's
 hard
 to
 describe
 your
 own


leadership
 style
 but
 if
 if
 I
 ask
 your


colleagues
 yeah
 I
 think
 look
 I
 you
 know


one
 of
 the
 things
 that
 I
 learned
 so
 I
 my


first
 kind
 of
 job
 out
 of
 college
 I
 was
 I


was
 in
 the
 Army
 and
 so
 very
 different


environment
 um
 but
 I
 think
 it
 has
 in


kind
 of
 frankly
 informed
 a
 lot
 about
 how


I
 think
 about
 leadership
 you
 know
 when


when
 I
 took
 my
 first
 job
 in
 the
 Army
 um


you
 know
 you
 walk
 in
 you're
 a
 you're
 a


brand
 new
 lieutenant
 everybody
 knows


more
 about
 everything
 than
 what
 you
 do


and
 all
 of
 a
 sudden
 you
 you
 figure
 out


really
 quickly
 that
 it's
 about
 it's


really
 not
 about
 you
 at
 all
 it's


actually
 about
 making
 the
 team
 better


and
 so
 um
 you
 know
 it's
 about
 how
 do
 you


get
 people
 at
 their
 best
 how
 do
 you
 get


the
 team
 really
 working
 you
 know
 in
 the


business
 world
 when
 you
 come
 in
 you
 tend


to
 get
 promoted
 because
 you
 do
 something


really
 well
 and
 then
 all
 of
 a
 sudden


you're
 supervising
 people
 now
 that
 are


doing
 that
 same
 thing
 so
 you
 kind
 of
 get


functional
 expertise
 first
 I
 do
 think
 I


do
 always
 think
 about
 kind
 of
 leadership


first
 and
 making
 sure
 that
 what
 am
 I


doing
 to
 get
 the
 best
 out
 of
 the
 team


and
 to
 maximize
 the
 team
 and
 so
 I
 am
 you


know
 quite
 focused
 on
 that
 and
 it's
 it's


just
 always
 been
 part
 of
 you
 know
 how
 I


think
 it
 should
 be
 done
 and
 so
 you
 know


that's
 why
 you
 know
 when
 you
 ask
 me
 the


question
 about
 uh
 what
 do
 we
 look
 you


know
 uh
 as
 as
 we're
 hiring
 people
 or
 you


know
 all
 of
 those
 types
 of
 things
 I
 I


try
 to
 think
 about
 that
 team
 Dynamic


it's
 not
 just
 one
 individual
 you
 know
 it


is
 about
 the
 team
 do
 you
 think
 there's
 a


difference
 between
 American
 leadership


style
 and
 European
 leadership
 style
 I


mean
 yes
 and
 no
 I
 mean
 you
 know
 there


are
 some
 Universal
 truths
 I
 think
 about


what
 people
 are
 looking
 for
 in
 a
 leader


you
 know
 I
 think
 you
 know
 people
 want


you
 know
 what
 I'm
 seeing
 is
 more


generational
 differences
 than
 I'm
 seeing


sort
 of
 geographic
 differences
 I
 think


um
 I'm
 seeing
 from
 younger
 folks
 they


want
 more
 time
 with
 you
 and
 they
 really


want
 to
 um
 you
 know
 that
 like
 like
 I


felt
 like
 coming
 up
 I
 kind
 of
 wanted
 my


boss
 to
 leave
 me
 alone
 you
 know
 um
 and


now
 you
 see
 much
 more
 of
 um
 you
 know


it's
 always
 sort
 of
 our
 younger
 uh
 folks


that
 will
 ask
 the
 first
 questions
 in
 a


meeting
 you
 know
 they
 you
 know
 they
 want


to
 get
 they
 want
 to
 get
 to
 know
 you
 much


more
 and
 in
 a
 much
 more
 intimate
 way
 I


think
 it's
 social
 media
 you
 know
 they're


used
 to
 just
 consuming
 and
 knowing
 a
 lot


about
 a
 person
 um
 and
 so
 you
 know
 that's


probably
 a
 bigger
 difference
 that
 I'm


seeing
 versus
 Geographic
 do
 people
 dare


to
 give
 you
 proper
 feedback
 oh
 yeah
 I


always
 look
 at
 feedback
 as
 being
 you


know
 like
 look
 they're
 just
 trying
 to


help
 you
 you
 know
 so
 you
 go
 into
 a


meeting
 you
 go
 into
 an
 investor
 meeting


as
 an
 example
 and
 they're
 like
 uh
 you


know
 I
 would
 have
 said
 it
 this
 way


versus
 that
 or
 you
 know
 so
 quite
 kind
 of


that
 more
 in
 the
 moment
 kind
 of
 feedback


or
 that
 was
 really
 good
 I
 think
 next


time
 if
 you
 hear
 you
 know
 people
 are


always
 nice
 about
 how
 they
 say
 it
 to
 the


boss
 you
 know
 you
 might
 want
 to
 say
 this


or
 or
 that
 but
 you
 know
 a
 lot
 of
 times


as
 a
 leader
 you
 have
 to
 ask
 for
 it
 sure


you
 know
 some
 people
 don't
 feel
 as


comfortable
 just
 kind
 of
 putting
 it
 out


there
 but
 I
 I
 do
 always
 try
 to
 ask
 for


it
 and
 I
 try
 to
 um
 you
 know
 when
 I
 come


out
 of
 something
 or
 you
 know
 even
 I'll


tell
 you
 last
 week
 before
 our
 senior


leader
 meeting
 um
 you
 know
 I
 always
 try


to
 test
 some
 of
 the
 messages
 to
 go
 is


this
 what
 people
 are
 thinking
 about
 um


just
 to
 make
 sure
 you
 know
 you
 land
 your


message
 right
 when
 you
 look
 back
 at
 your


career
 what
 are
 some
 of
 the
 moments


which
 were
 kind
 of
 like
 changing
 for
 you


you
 know
 probably
 the
 most
 recent
 one


was
 even
 uh
 to
 kind
 of
 come
 back
 in
 you


know
 so
 I
 I'd
 been
 CEO
 at
 rynolds
 Amer


in
 British
 American
 Tobacco
 bodas
 and
 so


I
 had
 I
 had
 left
 kind
 of
 being
 an


executive
 and
 I
 was
 doing
 non-ex
 kind
 of


board
 work
 I
 was
 doing
 PE
 work
 and
 um


and
 then
 I
 got
 on
 the
 diio
 board
 and
 uh


through
 various
 conversations
 you
 know
 I


now
 in
 hindsight
 I
 I
 recognize
 you
 know


Ivan
 and
 jav
 are
 both
 were
 trying
 to


prod
 me
 into
 perhaps
 coming
 back
 as
 an


exact
 it
 was
 a
 big
 decision
 I
 had
 to


unwind
 a
 lot
 of
 things
 that
 I
 you
 know


you
 set
 up
 board
 workor
 and
 you
 you're


involved
 in
 various
 you
 know
 PE
 type
 of


um
 uh
 you
 know
 roles
 and
 uh
 and
 so


backing
 out
 from
 that
 and
 then
 uh
 you


know
 coming
 back
 into
 to
 an
 exec
 and
 and


really
 kind
 of
 taking
 a
 step
 back
 right


because
 I
 had
 been
 a
 CEO
 and
 so
 then
 you


know
 coming
 in
 uh
 you
 know
 as
 president


of
 North
 America
 and
 uh
 so
 really
 kind


of
 backing
 up
 but
 I
 I
 felt
 it
 was


important
 because
 you
 this
 is
 a


different
 industry
 and
 you
 got
 to
 get
 to


learn
 the
 industry
 right
 and
 so
 um
 did


you
 have
 any
 did
 you
 have
 any
 mentors


who
 helped
 you
 absolutely
 what's
 the
 key


to
 good
 mentorship
 yeah
 I
 think
 and
 I've


had
 a
 lot
 of
 different
 mentors
 through


my
 through
 my
 life
 that
 I've
 used
 at


various
 times
 um
 The
 MENTOR
 that
 I'm


using
 a
 lot
 right
 now
 so
 Susan
 Cameron


who
 I
 was
 who
 I
 followed
 at
 Reynolds


um
 was
 an
 incredibly
 successful
 CEO
 and


um
 and
 helped
 me
 make
 that
 CEO


transition
 and
 then
 you
 know
 um


unfortunately
 because
 I
 you
 know
 I


didn't
 get
 a
 transition
 um
 with
 Ivan


really
 um
 it
 was
 great
 to
 have
 her
 to


kind
 of
 lean
 on
 a
 bit
 um
 you
 know
 as
 I


was
 navigating
 through
 you
 know
 that


kind
 of
 CEO
 transition
 I
 think
 in
 a


mentor
 it's
 been
 helpful
 to
 have


somebody
 who
 really
 knows
 me
 and
 kind
 of


knows
 you
 know
 so
 to
 your
 point
 if


people
 don't
 often
 get
 feedback
 you
 know


or
 to
 have
 someone
 who
 will
 you
 know
 who


will
 give
 you
 messages
 that
 maybe
 others


won't
 give
 you
 um
 is
 really
 important


and
 then
 I
 you
 know
 I
 I
 love
 people
 with


experience
 you
 know
 um
 uh
 you
 know


Javier
 our
 our
 our
 chairman
 our


ex-chairman
 now
 um
 you
 know
 knows
 the


industry
 really
 well
 and
 so
 you
 know
 he


is
 one
 that
 you
 know
 no
 doubt
 I'm
 going


to
 go
 to
 lunch
 with
 and
 continue
 to
 you


know
 pick
 his
 brain
 on
 things
 so
 I
 think


when
 they
 can
 provide
 you
 sort
 of
 um


things
 that
 you
 don't
 know
 or
 make
 you


think
 about
 things
 and
 in
 a
 new
 way
 but


also
 know
 you
 well
 enough
 to
 know
 how


you
 need
 to
 hear
 it
 and
 receive
 it
 I


think
 is
 important
 when
 do
 you
 wake
 up


in
 the
 morning
 when
 do
 I
 wake
 up
 depends


on
 what
 time
 I
 I
 travel
 a
 lot
 so


sometimes
 the
 hours
 are
 ridiculous
 um


I'm
 still
 uh
 I
 like
 to
 work
 out
 first


thing
 in
 the
 morning
 so
 I
 tend
 to
 kind


of
 get
 up
 early
 to
 be
 able
 to
 do
 that


before
 I
 go
 unless
 I'm
 taking
 a
 really


early
 plane
 and
 then
 I
 don't
 work
 out
 do


do
 do
 you
 work
 out
 most
 days
 I
 try
 to
 do


it
 at
 least
 four
 times
 a
 week
 I
 think


it's
 a
 great
 way
 to
 you
 know
 manage
 kind


of
 stress
 and
 I
 I
 tend
 to
 it's
 good


thinking
 time
 actually
 I'm
 I'm
 I
 like


you
 know
 I
 run
 so
 it's
 quite
 solitary


and
 you're
 kind
 of
 in
 your
 own
 head
 and


and
 how
 do
 you
 relax
 I
 like
 to
 read
 and


I
 read
 for
 fun
 I
 don't
 read
 terribly


sophisticated
 books
 this
 is
 fiction
 this


is
 fun
 um
 you
 know
 it
 really
 is
 more
 of


an
 escape
 almost


um
 so
 and
 then
 you
 know
 I
 like
 I
 mean


look
 I
 you
 know
 I
 do
 like
 to
 sort
 of


travel
 and
 and
 see
 things
 it's
 hard
 when


you're
 traveling
 for
 work
 you
 know


sometimes
 you
 go
 into
 a
 market
 and


you're
 like
 I
 could
 have
 been
 anywhere


you
 know
 I
 was
 just
 in
 a
 hotel
 so
 I
 do


try
 to
 see
 things
 along
 the
 way
 that
 you


know
 um
 if
 I
 can
 you
 know
 when
 I
 was
 in


China
 I
 went
 to
 go
 see
 you
 know
 the


panda
 Reserve
 you
 know
 like
 I
 like
 to


you
 know
 take
 a
 moment
 to
 really
 enjoy


uh
 you
 know
 the
 world
 and
 what's
 out


there
 what
 kind
 of
 advice
 would
 you
 give


to
 young


people
 yeah
 you
 know
 I've
 been
 I


recognize
 I'm
 really
 fortunate
 in
 that
 I


uh
 my
 mom
 and
 dad
 you
 know
 I
 was
 raised


to
 kind
 of
 think
 I
 could
 do
 anything
 I


mean
 it
 was
 like
 all
 possibilities
 were


open
 and
 I
 know
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 don't


have
 that
 you
 know
 so
 I
 feel
 quite


privileged
 in
 that
 that
 being
 said
 I


know
 when
 I
 you
 know
 I
 think
 as
 as
 a
 kid


and
 growing
 up
 and
 you
 know
 I
 always


gravitated
 towards
 things
 I
 was
 just


sort
 of
 naturally
 good
 at
 um
 um
 and
 then


when
 I
 went
 into
 the
 army
 all
 of
 a


sudden
 I
 was
 asked
 to
 do
 a
 lot
 of
 things


I
 didn't
 know
 how
 to
 do
 and
 quite


frankly
 I
 was
 terrible
 at
 it
 at
 first
 um


I
 wasn't
 very
 athletic
 at
 the
 time
 I


certainly
 didn't
 know
 how
 to
 shoot


anything
 I
 didn't
 you
 know
 like
 these


were
 very
 different
 tasks
 and


um
 but
 on
 the
 other
 side
 of
 that
 you


know
 ultimately
 I
 learned
 I
 got
 you
 know


I
 got
 pretty
 decent
 at
 it
 and
 and
 so


that
 gives
 you
 an
 incredible
 amount
 of


confidence
 and
 sort
 of
 resilience
 so


you're
 not
 a
 good
 shooter
 I
 I
 actually


am
 a
 really
 good
 shot
 it's
 a
 surprise


but
 I
 am
 but
 it
 is
 one
 of
 those
 things


that
 I
 think
 the
 the
 amount
 of


resilience
 and
 confidence
 that
 that
 has


given
 me
 later
 in
 life
 of
 like
 and
 so
 I


you
 know
 I
 always
 tell
 people
 try
 new


things
 try
 things
 that
 kind
 of
 scare
 you


a
 little
 bit
 because
 you
 might
 you're


going
 to
 surprise
 yourself
 more
 often


than
 not
 and
 get
 beyond
 that
 and
 I
 think


that
 can
 be
 an
 incredible
 source
 of


confidence
 and
 grit
 which
 I
 think
 you


know
 is
 really
 important
 in
 this
 world


well
 deah
 it's
 been
 great
 having
 you
 on


should
 we
 um
 hit
 the
 bar
 and
 try
 out


some
 new
 thanks
 absolutely
 I
 need
 to
 get


you
 to
 try
 something
 Beyond
 wine


wonderful
 thank
 you
 so
 much
 thanks
