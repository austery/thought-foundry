[Music]


this
 is
 the
 ultimate
 test
 of
 aerogel
 I


put
 myself
 on
 the
 line
 to
 see
 who
 wins


in
 the
 Battle
 of
 flamethrower
 versus


aerogel


[Music]


so
 if
 you
 really
 want
 to
 see
 the


insulating
 properties
 of
 air
 gel
 you
 got


to
 put
 it
 to
 the
 test
 and
 this
 material


here
 is
 like
 the
 most
 insulating
 right


what
 is
 this
 yeah
 so
 this
 is
 pyro
 gel


xte
 it's
 made
 by
 Aspen
 aerogel
 so
 it's


one
 centimeter
 thick
 it
 doesn't
 look


like
 the
 blue
 stuff
 because
 it's


actually
 a
 fiberglass
 blanket
 that's


infused
 with
 aerogel
 by
 the
 blue
 stuff


he
 means
 this
 silica
 aerogel
 it's
 made


of
 the
 same
 material
 as
 sand
 or
 glass


but
 if
 you
 zoom
 into
 the
 nanoscale
 you'd


see
 it
 has
 a
 sponge-like
 structure
 with


tiny
 pores
 just
 tens
 of
 nanometers


across
 now
 aerogel
 can
 be
 up
 to
 99.8%


air
 but
 it's
 a
 better
 thermal
 insulator


than
 air
 because
 those
 pores
 are
 so
 tiny


that
 hot
 air
 struggles
 to
 diffuse


through
 them
 plus
 the
 nanoscale


structure
 itself
 is
 a
 poor
 conductor
 of


heat
 but
 aerogel
 is
 pretty
 fragile
 in


this
 form
 and
 so
 it's
 not
 really


practical
 for
 most
 uses
 instead
 what
 you


can
 do
 is
 actually
 take
 tiny
 particles


of
 aerogel
 and
 embed
 them
 in
 a
 composite


material
 like
 blankets
 but
 it
 has
 the


additional
 component
 iron
 oxide
 just


basically
 rust
 that
 makes
 it
 opaque
 to


infrared
 radiation
 so
 it's
 good
 at


stifling
 conduction
 convection
 and


radiation
 and
 on
 the
 other
 side
 of
 this


insulating
 aerogel
 blanket
 we
 have
 Ben


who
 he's
 from
 Cape
 Cod
 and
 responded
 to


a
 tweet
 of
 mine
 when
 I
 asked
 if
 anyone


in
 this
 area
 has
 a
 flamethrower
 or
 a
 not


a
 flamethrower
 in
 this
 case
 from
 the


boring
 company
 have
 you
 ever
 fired
 this


before
 I
 have
 not
 so
 this
 will
 be
 at


first
 okay
 so
 what
 we're
 gonna
 do
 is
 try


to
 test
 what
 the
 temperature
 is
 on
 the


far
 side
 of
 that
 blanket
 when
 we
 put
 the


flamethrower
 at
 full
 bore
 on
 to
 this


side
 all
 right
 are
 you
 ready
 I'm
 ready


all
 right
 let's
 give
 this
 a
 try
 right


here
 I
 have
 the
 FLIR
 thermal
 camera
 this


is
 the
 T
 1020
 which
 can
 record
 up
 to


2,000
 degrees
 Celsius
 first
 for


comparison
 let's
 see
 what
 this


flamethrower
 can
 do
 to
 something
 that's


not
 aerogel
 let's
 put
 it
 to
 the
 test
 on


this
 super-sized


she's
 kiss
 there
 you
 go
 all
 right
 Ben


within
 seconds
 the
 temperature
 of
 the


chocolate
 is
 up
 to
 hundreds
 of
 degrees


Celsius


around
 30
 seconds
 the
 whole
 thing
 starts


to
 collapse


even
 after
 the
 flamethrower
 is
 removed


parts
 of
 the
 chocolate
 are
 still
 well


over
 600
 degrees
 Celsius
 I
 think
 this
 is


what
 the
 internet
 likes
 they
 like
 really


hot
 things
 applied
 to
 you
 know
 novelty


objects
 okay
 now
 is
 the
 time
 to
 really


put
 aerogel
 to
 the
 test
 he's
 about
 to


put
 the
 flame
 for
 our
 full
 bore
 on
 this


side
 of
 the
 blanket
 just
 one
 centimeter


away
 will
 be
 my
 hand
 on
 the
 backside
 of


the
 blanket


one
 heart


come
 in
 not
 I
 don't
 feel
 any
 Heat


that
 is
 crazy


propane
 burns
 at
 about
 2,000
 Celsius
 so


this
 point


I
 barely
 feel
 anything


that
 is
 incredible


[Music]


they
 look
 like
 from
 the
 back


feels
 like
 feels
 warm
 what
 about
 the


other
 side
 how
 hots
 the
 other
 side
 so


this
 flame
 door
 was
 producing
 over
 660


degrees
 Celsius
 on
 this
 side
 meanwhile


on
 the
 other
 side
 we
 were
 just
 measuring


about
 50
 degrees
 Celsius
 we're
 going
 up


to
 the
 highest
 range
 that
 this
 camera


can
 do
 up
 to
 2000
 degrees
 Celsius
 okay
 I


know
 we're
 not
 gonna
 be
 able
 to
 see
 much


except
 for
 the
 really
 hot
 stuff
 let's
 go


for
 it
 that
 is
 just
 insane
 but
 this


blanket
 is
 still
 not
 hot


you
 see
 that
 with
 the
 thermal
 how
 hot
 is


it
 50
 degrees
 see
 on
 the
 thermal
 I
 got


900
 at
 one
 point
 yeah
 and
 it's
 actually


still
 it's
 over
 200
 degrees
 Celsius


right
 now
 whoa
 yeah
 right
 there
 and
 I


can
 still
 touch
 it
 yeah
 can
 you
 see
 my


handprints
 after
 I
 touched
 it
 Wow


now
 you
 might
 be
 wondering
 how
 it's


possible
 to
 touch
 something
 hotter
 than


100
 degrees
 Celsius
 without
 getting


burned
 well
 for
 that
 we
 need
 to
 go
 to


another
 demonstration
 this
 is
 a
 hot


plate
 set
 to
 around
 150
 degrees
 Celsius


and
 on
 top
 of
 it
 is
 a
 metal
 plate
 that


is
 mostly
 covered
 in
 about
 a
 millimeter


of
 an
 air
 gel
 coating
 called


air
 lawn
 but
 a
 small
 square
 in
 the


corner
 is
 left
 uncovered
 this
 says
 about


120
 627
 degrees
 Celsius
 so
 clearly


hotter
 than
 boiling
 water
 so
 would
 you


put
 your
 hand
 in
 boiling
 water


I
 don't
 think
 so
 that
 would
 hurt
 but


what
 about
 putting
 it
 on
 this
 coating
 so


let
 me
 try


how's
 it
 feel
 not
 like
 130
 degrees
 it


feels
 hot
 but
 yeah
 but
 it
 doesn't
 feel


like
 130
 degrees
 I
 wonder
 to
 prove
 the


point
 there's
 some
 water
 in
 a
 little


beaker
 when
 I
 move
 that
 oh
 yeah
 your


figure
 yeah
 totally
 your
 hand
 prints


thermal
 handprints
 left
 behind
 so
 I
 was


cooling
 down
 the
 surface
 cooling
 it
 down


over
 here
 this
 is
 not
 coated
 and
 this
 is


I
 think
 slightly
 hotter
 it's
 about
 it's


Wow
 180
 degrees
 Celsius
 so
 that
 is
 the


part
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 touch
 yeah
 I


definitely
 don't
 want
 to
 touch
 it


because
 it
 doesn't
 have
 Erica
 on
 it
 this


is
 such
 a
 thin
 coating
 it's
 about
 a


millimeter
 but
 even
 that
 millimeter
 of


aerogel
 means
 that
 you
 can
 touch


something
 that
 otherwise
 you
 would
 be


totally
 unable
 to
 touch
 this
 would


definitely
 burn
 you
 and
 that's
 why


there's
 a
 little
 beaker
 of
 water
 with
 a


dropper
 is
 there
 you
 go
 I
 moved
 it
 okay


so
 take
 some
 of
 that
 and
 just
 to
 prove


the
 point
 put
 it
 on
 the
 metal
 square
 let


me
 put
 some
 of
 this
 on
 that
 piece
 of


metal
 here
 I'm
 gonna
 drop
 a
 little
 bit


of
 water
 on
 it
 so
 we
 can
 see
 this
 really


cools
 the
 drops
 that
 splattered
 off
 onto


the
 aerilon
 coating
 are
 not
 boiling


let's
 have
 a
 look
 here


and
 this
 water
 doesn't
 doesn't
 boil


right
 there
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 this
 is


gonna
 be
 like
 he
 trip
 he
 transferred


through
 the
 water
 it
 gets
 hot
 put
 your


finger
 on
 the
 air
 a
 lot
 itself
 without


the
 water
 right
 like
 there
 yeah
 no
 big


deal
 right


yeah
 I
 mean
 that's
 not
 it's
 not


uncomfortable
 it's
 clearly
 hot
 but
 it's


but
 it's
 not
 like
 you
 know
 putting
 your


hand
 in
 boiling
 water
 which
 is
 kind
 of


crazy
 because
 it
 is
 hotter
 than
 boiling


water
 but
 it
 just
 doesn't
 conduct
 the


energy
 to
 your
 hand
 that
 fast
 that's


really
 weird


they
 use
 this
 for
 applications
 which


they
 call
 safe
 touch
 so
 that's
 something


that
 would
 normally
 instantly
 burn
 you


something
 hot
 enough
 to
 boil
 water
 you


could
 hold
 your
 hand
 on
 four
 minutes
 and


it
 wouldn't
 at
 all
 okay
 so
 far
 in
 this


video
 I
 focused
 on
 using
 air
 gel
 in
 hot


applications
 but
 it
 works
 equally
 well


at
 the
 other
 end
 of
 the
 temperature


spectrum
 at
 cryogenic
 temperatures
 and


this
 comes
 in
 handy
 for
 things
 like


liquefied
 natural
 gas
 plants
 or
 by
 NASA


when
 they're
 using
 liquid
 helium
 you


need
 really
 good
 insulation
 to
 keep
 the


heat
 out
 I
 mean
 those
 cold
 pipes
 if


they're
 not
 insulated
 properly
 can
 end


up
 with
 huge
 ice
 falls
 on
 them
 which
 not


only
 is
 inefficient
 it's
 also
 incredibly


dangerous
 so
 this
 is
 one
 of
 the
 major


applications
 for
 aerogel
 these
 days
 if


you
 take
 a
 piece
 of
 cryo
 gel
 and
 dip
 it


in
 liquid
 nitrogen
 for
 a
 good
 while
 it


is
 still
 flexible
 when
 you
 bring
 it
 out


and
 that's
 kind
 of
 essential
 when
 you're


working
 with
 material
 that
 needs
 to


function
 at
 ultra
 cold
 temperatures
 here


is
 a
 carbon
 aerogel
 that
 has
 been


submerged
 in
 liquid
 nitrogen
 and
 as
 that


liquid
 nitrogen
 turns
 back
 into
 the
 gas


state
 it
 functions
 like
 its
 own
 air


hockey
 puck
 except
 instead
 of
 the
 air


coming
 from
 the
 table
 it
 comes
 from
 the


puck
 itself
 you
 can
 even
 buy
 ski
 jackets


these
 days
 that
 have
 special
 aerogel


lined
 pockets
 that
 stay
 significantly


warmer
 than
 standard
 jacket
 pockets
 and


they're
 specially
 made
 for
 your
 cell


phone
 so
 that
 it
 doesn't
 freeze
 up
 in


the
 cold
 weather
 you
 know
 I
 feel
 like


this
 is
 a
 story
 of
 something
 that


started
 as
 an
 oddity
 as
 something
 that


didn't
 really
 have
 applications
 but


clearly
 is
 a
 anime


insulation
 and
 can
 be
 made
 into
 a
 really


strong
 fire
 retardant
 material
 why
 would


they
 insulate
 subsea
 oil
 pipelines
 with


this
 material
 that's
 a
 really


interesting
 question
 so
 this
 was
 what
 we


would
 call
 the
 killer
 app
 for
 aerogel


the
 oil
 that
 comes
 out
 of
 wells
 in
 the


deep
 ocean
 is
 very
 viscous
 and
 slaggy


and
 so
 if
 you
 just
 had
 a
 pipe
 with
 that


oil
 it
 would
 basically
 gum
 up
 and
 so


what
 you
 have
 to
 do
 is
 put
 another
 pipe


around
 it
 and
 fill
 that
 gap
 with


insulation
 it's
 called
 a
 pipe
 and
 pipe


configuration
 and
 so
 they
 heat
 the
 oil


they
 have
 to
 keep
 it
 flowing
 but
 you


need
 to
 insulate
 that
 so
 that
 it
 doesn't


lose
 all
 of
 its
 heat
 to
 the
 cold


temperatures
 of
 the
 surrounding
 ocean
 so


if
 you
 think
 about
 laying
 pipes
 like


that
 from
 a
 ship
 you
 have
 these
 long


segments
 of
 pipe
 that
 the
 ship
 has
 to


basically
 pick
 it
 off
 put
 over
 the
 side


of
 the
 boat
 and
 drop
 down
 the
 ocean
 so


you
 know
 at
 some
 point
 the
 pipe
 becomes


so
 big
 and
 so
 heavy
 and
 capsized
 the


boat
 so
 they're
 really
 only
 three


vessels
 on
 the
 planet
 that
 we're
 big


enough
 to
 lay
 that
 really
 large
 diameter


pipe
 for
 subsoil
 pipelines
 Aspen


aerogels
 came
 along
 and
 said
 hey
 guys


we've
 got
 this
 really
 great
 new


insulation
 it's
 three
 times
 better
 than


polyurethane
 so
 I
 can
 take
 this
 much


polyurethane
 foam
 and
 shrink
 it
 into
 an


insulation
 that's
 that
 much
 aerogel
 now


what
 it
 did
 was
 allowed
 you
 to
 shrink


the
 outer
 diameter
 pipe
 of
 this
 pipe
 and


pipe
 configuration
 substantially
 and


because
 of
 that
 mass
 reduction
 from
 the


smaller
 diameter
 pipe
 all
 of
 a
 sudden


250
 ships
 around
 the
 world


Callay
 that
 smaller
 diameter
 pipe


without
 any
 loss
 of
 performance
 in
 the


oil
 pipeline
 and
 so
 that
 resulted
 in


alleviating
 years
 back
 logs
 of
 these


pipe
 lines
 that
 need
 to
 get
 laid
 and


save
 billions
 of
 billion
 stars
 now
 when


we
 filmed
 this
 video
 I
 knew
 the
 title


would
 probably
 be
 something
 like


flamethrower
 versus
 aerogel
 but
 I
 didn't


think
 of
 it
 like
 a
 real
 battle
 like
 what


would
 it
 mean
 for
 the
 aerogel
 to
 win


that
 it
 just
 you
 know
 didn't
 get
 hot
 or


something
 but
 as
 it
 turns
 out
 in
 the


flamethrower
 user
 manual
 it
 instructs


you
 only
 to
 ever
 pull
 the
 trigger
 for


seven
 seconds
 at
 a
 time


maximum
 but
 to
 get
 the
 shot
 and
 to
 get


the
 blanket
 hot
 enough
 I
 frequently
 told


Ben
 to
 pull
 the
 trigger
 for
 5
 or
 10


times
 that
 long


that's
 like
 that
 was
 like
 triple
 okay


and
 what
 we
 noticed
 over
 the
 course
 of


the
 shoot
 was
 that
 the
 flamethrower
 was


working
 less
 and
 less
 well
 and
 we


thought
 it
 was
 out
 of
 fuel
 but
 it
 just


turned
 out
 something
 inside
 it
 was


breaking
 and
 by
 the
 end
 we
 couldn't
 even


pull
 the
 trigger


so
 I'm
 sorry
 Ben
 and
 in
 the
 battle
 of


flamethrower
 versus
 air
 gel


I
 think
 air
 gel
 definitely
 won


you
