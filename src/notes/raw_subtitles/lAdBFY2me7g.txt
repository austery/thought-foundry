 really
 in
 a
 hurry
 we're

minute
 long
 but
 probably
 what
 you'll

when
 you
 heard
 10
 minutes
 you're
 going


to
 want
 to
 hear
 the
 whole
 thing
 now
 what


we
 do
 Wednesday
 full
 episode
 Fridays
 the


short
 episode
 tune


in
 hi
 everybody
 today
 we
 are
 in
 really


good
 company
 with
 one
 of
 the
 most


successful
 entrepreneurs
 and
 Venture


Capital
 investors
 of
 all
 time
 vard
 kosla


vard
 um
 co-founded
 Sun
 Microsystems
 back


in
 1982
 and
 kosla
 ventures
 in
 2004
 and


Kosta
 Ventures
 is
 uh
 making
 money
 in


technology
 whilst
 also
 doing
 good
 stuff


for
 society
 so
 uh
 warm
 welcome
 anod


great
 to
 be
 here
 you
 say
 that
 it
 is
 only


the
 improbable
 which
 is
 important
 what


do
 you
 mean
 by
 that
 most
 in
 this
 goes


immediately
 into
 my
 views
 on
 expert


opinion
 it's
 very
 good
 at
 predicting


the
 an
 extrapolation
 of
 the
 past
 as


opposed
 to
 a
 new
 kind
 of
 vision
 for
 the


future
 how
 do
 you
 identify
 these


situations
 where
 experts
 are
 totally


wrong
 I
 think
 it's
 very
 hard


to
 identify
 precisely
 these
 situations


when
 we
 invested
 in
 open
 AI
 in
 2018
 is


when
 we
 made
 the
 commitment
 to
 invest
 it


was
 hard
 to
 say
 when
 there
 would
 be
 a


breakthrough
 in


AI
 what
 was
 predictable
 was
 the
 trend


line
 was
 an


exponential
 it
 was
 very
 likely
 we
 were


in
 the
 F
 flat
 part
 of
 the
 curve
 of
 an


exponential
 the
 early
 changes
 suddenly


AI
 capability
 took
 off
 uh
 I
 would
 call


that
 improbable
 because
 nobody
 else
 was


predicting
 it
 what
 have
 been
 your
 best


investments
 in


1996
 we
 invested
 in
 a
 company
 called


Juniper
 that
 said
 tcpip
 would
 be
 the


protocol
 for
 the
 internet
 there
 was
 not


a
 single
 Telco
 player
 AT&T
 Verizon
 they


had
 different
 names
 them
 before
 their


mergers
 and
 all
 that
 that
 predicted


tcpip
 would
 be
 the
 protocol
 for
 the


internet
 and
 they
 had
 other
 uh
 more


technical
 reasons
 for
 going
 with
 other


protocols
 uh
 we
 just
 bet
 on
 that
 uh
 we


got
 a


2500x
 investment
 over
 about
 five
 years
 I


was
 at
 Klein
 hins
 then
 we
 made
 7
 billion


on
 a
 $3
 million
 investment
 uh
 uh
 that


was
 very
 nice
 I
 was
 at
 K
 Perkins
 at
 that


point
 we
 also
 invested
 in
 Google
 when
 it


was
 a
 couple
 of
 flaky
 PhD
 students
 and


you
 didn't
 know
 how
 large
 it
 would
 be


how
 important
 the
 improbable
 would
 be


when
 they
 were
 talking
 about
 organizing


the
 world's
 information
 it
 was
 hard
 to


extrapolate
 1996
 from
 two
 kids
 talking


about
 that
 to
 it
 will
 change
 the
 world


in
 many
 many
 ways
 so
 those
 are
 all


improbables
 characteristics
 of
 people


with
 the
 resolve
 and
 determination
 with


persistence
 with
 low
 probability
 high


impact
 bets
 and
 the
 environment
 being


right
 for
 them
 to
 find
 a
 tow
 hold
 and


then
 expand
 from
 there
 those
 are


characteristics
 we
 look
 for
 from
 an


investment
 point
 of
 view
 s
 now
 I'm
 I'm
 a


flaky
 PhD
 student
 uh
 I
 come
 into
 your


office
 what
 kind
 of
 things
 do
 you
 ask
 me


I
 say
 he
 not
 I
 got
 a
 super
 plan
 I'm


going
 to
 change
 the
 world
 here
 we
 see


that
 all
 the
 time
 and
 we
 have
 to
 judge


how
 persistent
 will
 they
 be
 if
 we


talking
 to
 them
 about
 the
 investment
 for


a
 month
 or
 two
 you
 can
 usually
 tell
 how


fast
 they
 will
 learn
 how
 do
 you
 screen


for
 fast
 learning
 how
 how
 can
 you
 figure


out
 whether
 I'm
 you
 can
 watch
 somebody


and
 see
 how
 well
 they
 answer


questions
 uh
 if
 you
 challenge
 them
 how


they
 respond
 are
 they
 thinking
 from


first


principles
 uh
 and
 saying
 let
 me
 examine


this
 assumption
 or
 are
 they
 being


reactive
 I
 know
 this
 to
 be
 true
 which
 is


very
 common
 in
 experienced
 business


people
 we've
 always
 done
 it
 this
 way


we've
 uh
 had
 the
 world
 this
 is
 always


worked
 I've
 done
 this
 for
 30
 years
 those


are
 all
 bad
 signs
 for
 an


entrepreneurial
 person
 let's
 um
 utilize


some
 of
 your
 smart
 thinking
 now
 and


let's
 try
 to
 predict
 the
 future
 which


you
 have
 done
 in
 a
 in
 a
 fantastic
 Ted


talk
 so
 you
 have
 identify
 12
 trends
 for


the
 future
 and
 I'd
 love
 to
 dive
 into


each
 one
 of
 them
 if
 you
 don't
 mind
 but


just
 uh
 before
 that
 just
 what
 these


Trends
 what
 do
 they
 have
 in
 what
 do
 they


have
 in
 common
 what
 are
 they
 about
 my


particular
 area
 of
 expertise
 and
 I
 hate


to
 even
 call
 it


expertise
 it's
 more
 specul
 smart


speculation
 or
 I
 call
 them
 intelligent


gats
 of
 what
 might
 be
 possible
 uh
 is


technology
 driven
 let's
 dive
 into
 some


of
 these
 radical
 uh
 predictions
 you
 have


first
 one
 expertise
 will
 be
 free
 we
 very


close
 to
 the
 point
 where
 AI
 is
 as
 good


as
 the
 median
 person
 in
 most
 areas
 and


then
 because
 it's
 computation
 only
 it


can
 be
 replicated
 infinitely
 there's
 a


million
 doctors
 in
 the
 US
 couple
 of


hundred
 thousand
 primary
 care
 doctors


and
 then
 specialists
 in
 various
 areas


but
 if
 you
 could
 have
 10
 times
 the


amount
 of
 expertise
 it
 would
 be
 near


free


uh
 and
 we
 could
 provide
 a
 lot
 more


Primary
 Care
 without
 much
 cost
 and
 maybe


even
 substantially
 lower
 cost
 you
 also


say
 that
 you
 think
 labor
 will
 be
 free
 I


do
 think
 uh
 and
 this
 is
 a
 little
 harder


to
 project
 today
 but
 uh
 almost
 certainly


over
 the
 next
 five
 years
 we
 will
 develop


bipe
 robots
 that
 means
 robots
 that
 have


two
 legs
 and
 two


arms
 that
 can
 do
 the
 kind
 of
 work
 humans


can
 if
 you
 had
 a
 billion
 such
 robots


they
 could
 do
 more
 work
 because
 they
 can


work
 24hour


chefs
 um
 than
 all
 the
 human
 labor
 today


what
 about
 uh
 the
 growth
 of
 computing


power


Computing
 as
 a
 cost
 per
 unit
 of


computing
 is
 declining
 very
 very


rapidly
 what
 has
 been
 very


expensive
 is
 programming
 these
 computers


and
 most
 people
 can't
 program
 a
 computer


I
 do
 think
 we
 will
 get
 to
 a
 world
 where


you
 can
 program
 it
 with
 voice
 in
 natural


language
 and
 you
 can
 use
 them
 much
 more


effectively
 so
 the
 range
 of
 uses
 could


expand
 dramatically
 because
 what
 I'm


talking
 about
 is
 essentially
 an
 AI


computer
 programmer
 so
 when
 Computing
 is


free
 or
 you
 know
 extremely
 cheap
 as


electricity
 and
 water
 is
 now
 what
 what


will
 it
 change
 you
 will
 be
 able
 to


program
 almost
 any
 task
 There's
 7


billion
 humans
 each
 could
 have
 10
 agent


so
 imagine
 70
 billion
 agents
 running


around
 the
 internet
 doing
 tasks
 for


computers
 what
 about
 the
 tailor
 making


or
 medicine
 you're
 talk
 about
 the
 signs


of
 medicine
 changing
 as
 well
 we
 are


already
 doing
 it
 you
 know
 cancer
 is
 a


large
 uh
 problem
 in
 the
 world
 of
 course


in
 human
 health
 um
 with
 very
 few
 really


effective
 Solutions
 we
 can
 delay
 death
 a


little
 bit
 but
 if
 you
 could
 tailor


design
 a
 protein
 to
 interfere
 with
 that


cancer
 one
 person's
 cancer
 not
 a
 drug


approved
 for
 all
 7
 billion
 people
 on
 the


planet
 AI
 will
 let
 us
 design
 drugs


predictably
 for
 one
 person's
 cancer
 what


about
 food
 what
 will
 you
 do
 to
 food
 the


food
 we
 eat
 will
 be
 the
 food
 we
 eat
 but


can
 we
 produce
 it
 with
 a
 lot
 less


chemicals
 for
 example
 absolutely
 because


uh
 robots
 can
 pick
 bugs
 off
 trays


instead
 of
 bombarding
 them
 with


pesticides
 or
 herbicides
 clean
 power
 you


are
 also
 a
 strong
 believer
 in
 nuclear


fusion
 um
 how
 do
 you
 see
 this
 I'm
 very


optimistic
 in
 the
 next
 five
 years
 nobody


will
 doubt
 that
 Fusion
 is
 a
 viable


technology
 and
 then
 we'll
 have
 the
 30s


and
 40s
 to
 scale
 It
 Up
 My
 Hope
 for


Fusion
 is
 we
 use
 current
 power
 plants


but
 replace
 coal
 boilers
 or
 natural
 gas


boilers
 with
 Fusion
 boilers
 we
 may
 need


to
 replace
 the
 turbine
 too
 but
 retrofit


old
 plants
 with
 Fusion
 clean
 power
 much


cheaper
 much
 cleaner
 and
 of
 course
 much


more
 scalable
 so
 then
 energy
 will
 be


free
 too
 basically
 you're
 free
 I
 hope


you
 paint
 um
 a
 very
 positive
 uh
 picture


of
 the
 world
 here
 and
 in
 this
 world
 what


is
 your
 advice
 to
 young
 people
 I
 used
 to


say
 pursue
 your
 passions
 as
 long
 as
 you


can
 make
 a
 living
 at
 it
 I'll
 drop
 the
 as


long
 as
 you
 can
 make
 a
 living
 at
 it


because
 I
 think
 there'll
 be
 enough


abundance
 in
 society
 for
 sociey
 to


support


uh
 a
 minimum
 level
 of
 living
 for


everybody
 independent
 of
 the
 job
 it's


been
 really
 really
 great
 uh
 talking
 to


you
 thank
 you
 very
 much
 great
 to
 talk
 to


you
