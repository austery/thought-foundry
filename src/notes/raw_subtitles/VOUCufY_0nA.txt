So,
 how
 did
 the
 like
 button
 come
 into


existence?
 What
 was
 it
 like
 back
 during


that
 time?
 I
 I
 think
 in
 the
 early
 days


when
 we
 first
 had
 something
 called


asynchronous
 JavaScript
 to
 get
 a
 little


bit
 geeky.
 It
 was
 the
 first
 time,
 even


though
 this
 sounds
 super
 archaic,
 that


you
 could
 actually
 click
 a
 button,
 send


out
 for
 a
 server
 response,
 and
 get


something
 back
 into
 your
 browser.
 There


was
 no
 way
 to
 just
 say
 like,
 I
 think


this
 is
 cool.
 Let
 me
 just
 like
 tap
 on
 it


and
 like
 show
 my
 vote
 of
 interest
 on


something.
 And
 I
 was
 like,
 well,


wouldn't
 it
 be
 cool
 if
 you
 clicked


something
 and
 you
 saw
 the
 number
 go
 up


and
 that
 number
 was
 the
 number
 of
 humans


that
 actually
 had
 clicked
 on
 something.


The
 way
 I
 see
 it
 is
 that
 this
 is
 social


signal
 that
 will
 feed
 back
 into
 an


algorithm
 that
 eventually
 give
 you
 more


stuff
 that
 you
 would
 like
 to
 consume.


>> All
 right,
 man.
 So,
 ketones.
 Am
 I
 going


to
 go
 on
 a
 trip?


>> Uh,
 this
 is
 going
 to
 be
 um


a
 surprise
 for
 you.
 So,
 these
 are


ketones
 that
 Tim
 Ferrris
 turned
 me
 on


to.
 Okay,


>> we
 don't
 have
 to
 make
 it
 a
 plug
 in
 the


podcast
 or
 anything.
 This
 isn't
 a
 show


about
 ketones.


>> But
 I
 will
 tell
 you
 that
 when
 you
 hit


this,
 so
 these
 are
 specifically
 made
 for


they're
 supposed
 to
 go
 in
 your
 coffee.


>> Now,
 you
 have
 to
 be
 careful
 here
 because


you
 have
 to
 bend
 this
 like
 this
 and
 then


it
 kind
 of
 shoots
 into
 your
 mouth
 and


then
 you
 just
 chug
 it.


>> Have
 you
 ever
 had
 ketones
 before?


>> No.


>> Okay.
 All right.
 Let's
 do
 this.
 Let's
 do


this.
 Okay.
 So,
 let
 me
 show
 you
 how
 to


do
 I'll
 do
 it
 first.


>> So,
 you
 bend
 like
 this.


>> Mhm.
 Mhm.
 Mhm.


>> What
 am
 I
 doing
 here?


Okay,
 there
 you
 go.


>> Like
 this?


>> Let's
 do
 it.
 Anish.
 Yeah.
 Wait,
 wait,


no.
 No,
 wait.
 That's
 backwards.
 Let
 me


see.
 Yeah,
 there
 you
 go.
 So,
 I
 had
 a


friend
 do
 that
 and
 he
 shot
 it
 all
 over


his
 like
 chest.
 You
 don't
 want
 that


before
 the
 podcast.
 Okay,


>> take
 it
 back.
 Take
 it
 like
 a
 champion.


Squeeze.
 Suck.
 You're
 going
 to
 notice
 a


little
 bit
 of
 bitterness.
 Do
 you
 taste


it?


>> Mhm.


>> Yeah.
 It's
 not
 good.


>> Oh
 my
 god.


>> Yeah.
 It's
 the
 worst.
 Now,
 this
 is
 going


to
 give
 you
 brain
 power
 for
 the
 podcast.


So,
 this
 is
 how
 we
 start
 the
 show.


>> Jesus,
 dude.
 It
 tastes
 like
 I


regurgitated
 a
 Tylenol.


terrible.


>> It
 does
 taste
 like
 a
 a
 chewed
 up


Tylenol.
 That's
 a
 great
 way
 to
 put
 it.


>> Okay.


>> All
 right.
 So,
 we'll
 uh
 let
 that
 kick


in.
 Anish,
 dude,
 I'm
 so
 glad
 we're
 doing


this,
 brother.


>> Excited,
 man.
 Thank
 you.
 Thank
 you.


>> Before
 we
 get
 into
 the
 ketones
 kicking


in.
 Let's
 get
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 background


because
 it's
 important.
 I
 know
 we're


going
 to
 be
 syndicating
 this
 across
 a


couple
 of
 podcasts.
 So,


>> yeah,


>> I
 was
 telling
 people
 who
 we
 are.
 We've


known
 each
 other
 for
 a
 long
 time.
 We


worked
 together
 at
 Google,
 long
 time.
 We


work
 together
 at
 Google
 Ventures
 and


Google
 Corporate
 and
 uh
 yeah
 man
 it's


been
 we've
 been
 good
 homies
 for
 many


many
 many
 years.
 No
 one's
 ever
 seen
 us


on
 a
 pod
 together
 I
 don't
 think
 right


like
 we've
 never
 done
 anything.
 Yeah.
 So


do
 you
 want
 to
 give
 a
 little
 your


background?


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Of
 course.
 Thank
 you


for
 having
 me
 man.
 This
 is
 awesome.
 I'm


Anish.
 I'm
 a
 GP
 Andre.
 I've
 been
 friends


with
 Kevin
 forever.
 I'm
 a
 product


person.
 I'm
 an
 engineer.
 I'm
 a


technologist.
 I
 started
 two
 companies.


Um
 probably
 having
 the
 most
 fun
 I've


ever
 had
 both
 personally,


professionally,
 and
 all
 of
 that.
 And
 I'm


excited
 to
 talk
 to
 everyone
 about
 it


today.
 Yeah,
 it's
 it
 was
 really
 cool


when
 we
 first
 met.
 Um
 we
 both
 were
 uh
 I


don't
 know
 how
 we
 ended
 up
 there
 and
 got


on
 Google+.
 Yeah.


>> But
 we
 were
 both
 on
 Google+
 and
 I


remember
 working
 with
 you
 like
 in
 the


very
 early
 days
 and
 I
 was
 like
 oh
 like


when
 you
 land
 into
 Google
 for
 the
 first


time,
 you
 don't
 know what
 to
 expect,
 you


know,
 like
 cuz
 you're
 getting
 in
 there


>> and
 you
 don't
 know
 like
 what
 is
 this


what
 is
 this
 whole
 thing
 going
 to
 be


about?
 Like
 who
 am
 I
 going
 to
 work
 with?


And
 very
 quickly
 you
 realize
 there's


fantastic
 engineering
 talent
 there.
 And


then
 there's
 also
 productwise
 I
 was
 like


I
 don't
 know
 that
 these
 people
 actually


live
 and
 breathe
 product.
 It
 was
 very


much
 you're
 kind
 of
 in
 the
 Google
 bubble


but
 you
 were
 one
 of
 the
 first
 people
 I


was
 like
 oh
 my
 god
 this
 is
 like
 an


amazing
 product
 mind


>> and
 I
 got
 to
 work
 with
 this
 guy
 and
 so


we
 figured
 out
 a
 way
 to
 like
 stay


connected
 and
 work
 together
 you
 know


when
 we
 bounced
 over
 to
 Google
 Ventures


then
 and
 yeah


>> well
 dude
 figured
 out
 a
 way
 is
 generous.


So,
 you
 saved
 my
 life.
 I
 remember
 I


worked
 with
 you
 for
 3
 4
 weeks
 and
 what's


cool
 actually
 is
 you
 joined
 and
 you're


like,
 no,
 this
 is
 not
 it.
 I'm
 not
 doing


it.
 I'm
 like,
 what
 do
 you
 mean?
 What


about
 vesting?
 What
 about
 Google+?
 What


about
 this
 and
 that?


>> And
 you
 were
 just
 so
 sure
 and
 you
 were


right.


>> You
 moved
 over
 to
 Ventures.
 And
 I


remember
 at
 the
 time
 talking
 to
 you


outside
 of
 that
 building,
 the
 Google+


building,
 and
 saying,
 "Kevin,
 don't


leave
 me
 behind,
 man.
 Please
 bring
 me


with
 you,
 and
 like
 I'll
 make
 you
 look


good."
 And
 that's
 a
 thing
 you
 say
 and


you
 assume
 nobody
 will
 ever
 like
 call


you
 back
 after
 that.
 And
 then
 3
 months


later
 you
 called
 me.
 You're
 like,
 "All


right,
 man.
 What's
 up?"
 Like,
 "Why
 don't


you
 come
 over
 here
 and
 do
 this
 with
 us?"


And
 I
 mean,
 that
 that
 single
 act
 of


professional
 generosity
 changed
 my
 whole


life.


>> That's
 awesome,
 dude.


>> I'm
 very
 grateful.


>> Well,
 big
 shout
 out
 to
 Chris
 Hutchkins


who
 like
 got
 us
 connected
 to
 Google,
 the


mastermind
 who
 got
 us
 connected
 to


Google
 Ventures.
 And
 then,
 of
 course,


Bill
 Maris
 who
 was
 running
 Google


Ventures


>> and
 then
 um
 you
 know,
 I
 pulled
 you
 and


Burka
 in
 and
 uh
 we
 all
 got
 over
 there


and
 they
 had
 a
 a
 great
 time
 at
 at
 GV.


Fantastic
 crew.
 I
 love
 those
 people.
 I


thought
 Google
 Ventures
 was
 a
 great


place.
 It's
 they're
 the
 best
 of
 us,
 you


know.
 Bill
 had
 the
 best
 energy.
 I
 met
 my


wife
 there.


>> Yeah.


>> I
 mean,
 everybody
 there
 was
 very
 good


people.


>> Yeah.
 And
 then
 Crane's
 running
 it
 now,


which
 is
 awesome
 to
 see.
 Like,
 he
 was


such
 a
 a
 great
 uh
 just
 a
 great
 person
 to


be
 around.
 I
 really
 enjoyed
 my
 time
 with


with
 David
 and
 great
 to
 see
 him
 just


like
 turning
 that
 firm
 into
 an
 awesome


like
 I
 look
 at
 the
 portfolio
 now
 since


we've
 left
 and
 he's
 built
 out
 a
 great


>> uh
 suite
 of
 companies
 that
 are
 just
 top


tier.


>> It's
 legit,
 man.
 It's
 legit.
 Well,
 it's


actually
 fun
 to
 see
 you
 in
 action
 as
 a


consumer
 investor.
 I
 think
 so
 much


consumer
 investing
 and
 building
 is


willingness
 to
 be
 embarrassed.


>> Yeah.


>> You
 know,
 and
 you
 did
 deals
 like
 Blue


Bottle.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 I'm
 like,
 Kevin,
 what
 is
 this?
 A


coffee
 shop
 with
 a
 stand
 in
 Hayes?


>> How
 is
 this
 going
 to
 be
 a
 venture


investment?
 And
 it
 was.
 And
 you,
 you


know,
 you
 were
 willing
 to
 be
 embarrassed


by
 it.
 And
 you
 were
 so
 right.


>> Well,
 you're
 wrong
 a
 lot,
 as
 you
 know,


like
 we're
 wrong
 most
 the
 time.
 um


consumer
 stuff
 for
 you.
 So,
 what
 what
 do


you
 what
 does
 your
 day-to-day
 look
 like


at
 Indre?
 Like,
 it's
 a
 massive
 firm.
 How


many
 in
 total
 employees
 are
 at
 A16?


>> God,
 600,
 probably.


>> Yeah.
 Holy
 crap.


>> It's
 big.
 It's
 big.


>> And
 how
 many
 GPS?


>> That's
 a
 good
 question.
 Maybe
 30.
 Okay.


>> Um
 the
 investing
 team's
 relatively


small.
 It's
 probably
 70.
 But
 it's


actually
 nice
 the
 way
 the
 firm
 works


because
 it's
 a
 collection
 of


specialists.
 So,
 everybody
 who's
 there


is
 the
 best
 in
 the
 world
 at
 what
 they


do,
 both
 knowledgewise
 and
 network-wise.


So
 even
 though
 it's
 a
 large
 group,


that's
 because
 we're
 all
 specialists


pointing
 in
 different
 directions.
 So
 my


consumer
 world
 every
 day
 is
 spending


time
 with
 consumer
 founders.
 I
 spend


some
 time
 with
 enterprise
 founders
 as


well.
 Everything
 AI
 apps.
 So
 it's
 a
 mix


of
 seeing
 companies
 supporting
 founders


on
 boards
 and
 also
 playing
 with


products.


>> Like
 to
 me,
 this
 is
 the
 craziest
 thing.


It's
 something
 that
 I
 learned
 from
 you,


which
 is
 so
 many
 people
 just
 don't
 use


the
 products.
 And
 how
 can
 you
 have


intuition
 if
 you're
 not
 making
 videos
 on


Sora
 or
 Vibe
 coding
 or
 you
 know
 there's


just
 so
 much
 alpha
 hiding
 in
 plain


sight?
 All
 you
 got
 to
 do
 is
 use
 the


products.


>> Yeah.
 I
 feel
 like
 the
 last
 call
 it
 5


years
 has
 been
 on
 the
 consumer
 side
 has


been
 relatively
 boring
 for
 me
 as
 an


investor
 because
 I've
 looked
 at
 stuff


and
 I
 said
 gosh
 you
 know
 we
 got
 the
 bigs


in
 the
 room.
 You
 got
 the
 Tik
 Toks.
 got


the
 Instagram
 still
 dominating
 and
 then


you
 see
 some
 of
 the
 folks
 like
 you
 know


threads
 that
 are
 just
 like
 copying
 and


somehow
 you
 know
 strapping
 on
 you
 know


integrations
 with
 decentralized
 social


and
 that's
 supposed
 to
 be
 a
 thing.


>> Yes.
 But
 I
 hadn't
 seen
 anything
 that
 in


my
 mind
 was


that
 interesting.
 Like
 it
 felt
 like


consumer
 had
 this
 kind
 of
 like
 down


period
 of
 several
 years
 where
 there


wasn't
 really
 anything
 new.
 And
 now
 that


AI
 has
 come
 into
 the
 mix,
 I
 feel
 like


there's
 a
 chance
 to
 kind
 of
 almost


reinvent
 every
 piece
 of
 that
 framework.


And


>> do
 you
 feel
 that
 way
 as
 well?
 Like
 AI
 is


a
 shot
 in
 the
 arm
 for
 consumer.


>> 100.
 I
 mean,
 I'll
 give
 you
 the
 investor


perspective
 and
 then
 the
 builder


perspective.
 I
 want
 to
 hear
 yours.
 So


from
 an
 investor
 perspective,
 this
 is


like
 a
 renaissance
 for
 consumer


investing.
 We
 haven't
 seen
 an


opportunity
 like
 this.
 I
 think
 in
 since


2010,
 2011,
 2012


>> because
 consumers
 are
 downloading


products
 organically.
 That
 hasn't


happened
 in
 a
 long
 time.


>> Consumers
 are
 willing
 to
 pay
 like
 you


look
 at
 the
 price
 points
 of
 the
 top


products,
 right?
 The
 top
 chat
 GPT
 skew


is
 200
 a
 month.
 The
 top
 Gemini
 skew


Google
 Ultra
 is
 250
 and
 then
 Grock
 is


300
 a
 month.
 And
 consumers
 are
 actually


paying
 that
 amount.
 I
 mean,
 how
 much
 do


you
 think
 you've
 paid
 to
 cursor?


>> A
 lot.


>> A
 lot.
 Yeah.
 And
 some
 of
 that
 is


professional
 behavior,
 but
 a
 lot
 of
 that


is
 just
 consumer
 and
 hobbyist
 behavior.


>> So,
 I
 think
 that
 consumer
 is
 like
 back


in
 a
 big
 way.
 And
 like
 the
 tech


enthusiast
 consumer
 is
 excited
 in
 a
 way


that
 they
 haven't
 been
 for
 10
 years.
 And


when
 you
 the
 companies
 you
 just


mentioned
 though,
 they're
 largely
 the


bigs.
 Like
 one
 of
 the
 things
 that
 that's


happened
 in
 consumer
 that
 I
 never


thought
 would
 be
 the
 case
 that
 I
 was


shocked
 by
 is
 that
 bigs
 like
 you
 know


top
 tier
 you
 know
 fortune
 100
 companies


can
 put
 out
 consumer
 tech
 for
 the
 first


time
 and
 actually
 see
 it
 get
 scale.
 It


was
 always
 the
 bigs
 that
 that
 couldn't


figure
 it
 out,
 you
 know,
 they
 had
 to


acquire
 Instagram
 to
 be
 cool.
 They
 had


to
 buy
 the
 the
 cool.


>> And
 I
 think
 with
 with
 Chat
 GBT
 and


actually
 with
 with
 Google
 as
 well
 with,


you
 know,
 their
 their
 banana
 model
 and


whatnot.
 It's
 for
 the
 first
 time
 we're


seeing
 the
 bigs
 put
 out
 consumer
 apps


that
 are
 getting
 some
 traction.
 I
 mean,


granted,
 they
 do
 have
 the
 scale.
 They


have
 the
 install
 base.
 they
 can
 put
 that


in
 front
 of
 a
 lot
 of
 people.
 But
 like
 we


saw
 with
 the
 Google+
 side,
 just
 because


you
 have
 the
 install
 base
 and
 you
 have


the
 eyeballs
 doesn't
 mean
 you're
 going


to
 see
 success
 on
 the
 consumer
 side.


That's
 right.
 And
 I
 feel
 like
 we're


starting
 to
 see
 that
 with
 the
 bigs,


which
 was
 kind
 of
 shocking
 to
 me.
 Did


that
 shock
 you
 as
 well?


>> It
 so
 in
 a
 sense
 what
 the
 bigs
 have


released
 are
 models,
 not
 products.
 And
 I


think
 there's
 an
 important
 distinction


here.


>> Notebook
 notebook
 is
 I
 would
 say
 was
 the


first
 time
 I
 was
 like,
 "Wow,
 they
 that


was
 a
 zero
 to
 one
 kind
 of
 like
 product


that
 actually
 I
 use
 still
 frequently."


But
 it's
 not
 consumer
 consumer.
 That's
 a


little
 bit
 more


>> business
 slant.


>> You're
 absolutely
 right
 though.
 I
 think


that
 notebook
 was
 inadvertent,
 right?
 It


was
 one
 of
 many
 experiments
 and
 it


worked.
 And
 you
 know,
 not
 to
 take
 any


credit
 away
 from
 Google,
 but
 I
 don't


know
 that
 they
 said,
 "Hey,
 let's
 design


an
 incredible
 consumer
 proumer
 product."


And
 they
 invented
 notebook,


>> right?


>> So
 I
 do
 think
 that
 if
 you
 look
 at
 the


models,
 the
 models
 are
 incredibly


capable
 and
 the
 bigs
 and
 the
 labs


obviously
 are
 advantaged
 in
 certain
 ways


with
 capital,
 etc.
 to
 build
 great


cutting
 edge
 models
 and
 consumers
 love


those
 models.
 So
 that's
 great.
 They're


playing
 in
 that
 space.
 It's
 definitely


relevant.
 But
 when
 it
 comes
 to


opinionated
 products
 on
 top
 of
 the


models,
 like
 cursor
 is
 a
 good
 example.


Korea
 is
 a
 good
 example.
 Companionship


is
 actually
 a
 very
 interesting
 category


where
 there's
 huge
 demand
 for


companionship
 products.
 And
 a
 lot
 of


these
 companionship
 products
 like


janitor
 AI,


>> you
 know,
 they
 they
 deal
 with
 parts
 of


the
 human
 experience
 that
 big
 tech
 is


not
 going
 to
 be
 comfortable
 shipping,


right?
 It's
 disagreement,
 it's


sexuality,
 it's
 persuasion.
 So
 so
 much


of
 this
 technology
 can
 address
 parts
 of


the
 human
 experience
 that
 a
 thousand


committees
 at
 Google
 and
 Facebook
 don't


want
 addressed
 and
 I
 think
 that
 is
 one


of
 the
 interesting
 opportunities
 in


>> 100%
 I
 think
 that's
 well
 said
 and
 I


think
 it
 is
 the
 space
 where
 we
 need
 to


invest
 because
 if
 you
 think
 about


what
 the
 pitches
 that
 we
 see
 on
 a
 on
 a


daily
 or
 weekly
 basis
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 stuff


that
 I
 see
 is
 a
 you
 know
 it
 can
 be
 a


sanding
 down
 of
 the
 rough
 edges
 and
 it


can
 also
 just
 be
 something
 where
 I


wholeheartedly
 believe
 that
 one
 of the


bigs
 is
 going
 to
 dominate
 that
 category


and
 so
 I
 avoid
 those
 investments
 like


they
 will
 never
 touch
 the
 emotional
 side


as
 much
 as
 they
 should
 or
 could


>> uh
 not
 should
 but
 that
 they
 wouldn't


feel
 comfortable
 doing
 so
 right
 and
 so


those
 are
 the
 categories
 and
 the


verticals
 where
 I
 think
 is
 they're


defensible
 by
 the
 pure
 nature
 of
 what


they're
 addressing
 right


>> and
 so
 that's
 kind
 of
 what
 you're
 saying


here
 right


>> 100%
 I
 just
 think
 they're
 they're


structurally
 set
 up
 to
 kind
 of
 take
 the


soul
 out
 of
 products
 and
 when
 you
 talk


about
 categories
 like
 companionship
 the


whole
 thing
 is
 the
 soul
 there
 is
 no


product
 without
 that.
 I
 think
 the
 other


interesting
 area
 where
 the
 labs
 and
 the


bigs
 are
 not
 going
 to
 be
 successful
 is


products
 that
 benefit
 from
 being


multimodel,
 right?
 Not
 multimodal
 but


multimodel.
 So
 cursor
 is
 good
 because


you
 can
 use
 every
 model
 inside
 of
 it


>> and
 Google
 is
 never
 going
 to
 ship
 with


anthropic
 models
 embedded.


>> So
 that
 also
 is
 a
 very
 interesting


they're
 sort
 of
 constrained
 to
 the


models
 that
 they've
 developed
 in
 house


and
 products
 that
 benefit
 from
 being


multimodel
 are
 actually
 really


unconstrained.


>> Very
 interesting.
 We
 should
 dive
 into


each
 of
 these
 things.
 I
 think
 we
 we
 have


two
 great
 topics
 to
 go
 on.
 Let's
 let's


pin
 the
 multimodel,
 but
 let's
 talk
 about


companionship.
 So,
 on
 the
 companionship


side,
 what
 do
 you
 believe
 should
 be


built?
 What
 have
 you
 seen
 built?
 And
 how


much
 of
 this
 do
 you
 think
 is
 fad
 versus


depth?
 Meaning,
 it's
 funny
 and
 weird
 and


awkward
 and
 strange
 to
 have
 an
 AI


girlfriend.
 And
 I
 in
 the
 early
 days
 call


it
 like,
 well,
 early
 days,
 let's
 call
 it


a
 year
 ago,
 you
 know,


>> way
 back
 in
 the day.
 way
 back
 in
 the


day.
 Yep.


>> I
 a
 friend
 of
 mine
 was
 like,
 "Hey,
 go


check
 this
 out."
 And
 it
 was
 not


something
 that
 was,


>> you
 know,
 exed
 about
 or
 tweeted
 about.


It
 was
 it
 was
 like
 this
 kind
 of
 like


thing
 that
 you
 went
 into.
 And
 and
 I'll


say
 that
 I
 went
 there
 and
 it
 was
 models


unhinged,
 right?
 This
 is
 before
 Grock


did
 it


>> and
 you
 could
 basically
 talk
 to
 a
 model


and
 get
 any
 type
 of
 response
 that
 you


wanted.


>> Uh
 meaning
 in
 terms
 of
 sexuality
 or


whatever
 you
 were
 looking
 for,
 right?


How
 much
 of
 that
 are
 you
 concerned
 about


in
 terms
 of
 shaping
 humanity,
 replacing


real
 relationships?
 Like
 what
 lens,
 how


do
 you
 evaluate
 something
 like
 that?
 Do


you
 invest
 in
 those
 types
 of
 things?


>> Yeah,


>> this
 is
 such
 a
 great
 topic.
 I
 wish
 we


had
 Eugenia
 here
 who
 founded
 Replica


because
 she'd
 have
 a
 ton
 of
 thoughts.
 I


mean,
 okay,
 so
 I'm
 always
 going
 to
 give


you
 the
 optimistic
 take
 is
 just
 how
 I'm


wired.
 So,
 let
 me
 give
 you
 a
 couple
 of


my
 most
 optimistic
 takes.
 So
 one
 is
 we


all
 know
 the
 importance
 of
 human


connection
 and
 the
 value
 of
 it.
 Maybe


the
 human
 part
 is
 overvalued.
 You
 know


you
 are
 you
 live
 in
 an
 embarrassment
 of


social
 riches.
 You
 have
 friends,
 you


have
 professional
 connections,
 you
 have


interesting
 people
 you
 can
 meet.
 They


all
 want
 to
 connect
 with
 you
 and
 your


biggest
 challenge
 is
 prioritizing.
 I


don't
 know
 that
 that's
 the
 experience
 of


the
 average
 person
 in
 this
 country.
 You


know,
 I
 think
 that
 there's
 a
 deep


loneliness
 and
 any
 progress
 we
 make


towards
 addressing
 the
 loneliness
 is


human
 progress
 and
 is
 very
 pro-social.


And
 I
 think
 progress
 though
 to
 have
 a


conversation
 with
 a
 chatbot.
 Do
 you


think
 that
 starts
 to
 fill
 that
 emotional


bucket
 up?


>> Yes.


>> You
 so
 you
 believe
 that
 when
 someone
 is


having
 a
 conversation
 they
 are
 getting
 a


lift?


>> Yes.


>> Probably
 10%
 of
 what
 a
 real
 human
 would


provide
 you
 but
 a
 little
 bit
 of


something.


>> I
 think
 more
 than
 10%.
 I
 just
 think
 I


look
 it
 it's
 like
 our
 lizard
 reptilian


brains.
 We
 are
 wired
 to
 have
 these
 sort


of
 emotional
 chemical
 responses
 when


you're
 engaged
 in
 a
 humanlike


conversation.
 We
 intellectually


understand
 that
 these
 are
 computers
 on


the
 other
 side,
 but
 you
 still
 feel
 the


feelings
 and
 I
 think
 that's
 what's


necessary
 to
 make
 personal
 progress
 as
 a


result
 of
 connection.
 Do
 you
 believe?


So,
 this
 is
 my
 concern.
 I'll
 I'll
 play


the
 the
 the
 doomer
 side
 of
 this.
 Um,
 my


concern
 is
 that
 one
 of
 the
 things
 I


noticed
 with
 these
 models
 early
 on
 while


I'm
 playing
 with
 them
 is
 that
 they
 were


very
 agreeable.
 And


>> emotional
 well-being
 and
 kind
 of
 the
 um


I
 would
 say
 the
 muscle
 that
 needs
 to
 be


built
 is
 actually
 not
 when
 you're


laughing
 and
 agreeing
 with
 friends
 and


kind
 of
 going
 along
 with
 the
 flow.
 It's


when
 there's
 disagreement
 and
 the


discomfort
 that
 comes
 from
 the,
 "Oh,
 I


don't
 agree
 with
 you.
 That
 that
 doesn't


hit
 me.
 that
 doesn't
 feel
 right.
 Let's


build
 a
 bridge
 and
 figure
 out
 how
 to


find
 common
 ground
 here.
 And
 if
 you're


dealing
 with
 models
 that
 are
 just
 paid


to
 agree
 with
 you
 all
 the
 time,


>> that
 then
 you're
 you're
 basically
 so


I'll
 give
 an
 example.
 I
 was
 talking
 to


well
 I
 can
 call
 him
 out.
 So
 I
 was


talking
 to
 Tim
 Ferris
 about
 this.
 We


were
 like
 we
 we're
 taking
 screenshot
 I


was
 taking
 screenshots
 of
 what
 this


model
 was
 saying
 to
 me
 and
 it
 was


basically
 agreeing
 to
 anything
 that
 I


put
 in
 front
 of
 it.
 I
 was
 like
 hey
 what


do
 you
 think
 about
 this?
 And
 it
 was


like,
 I'll
 do
 that
 with
 you.
 And
 I
 was


like,
 oh
 my
 god.
 Like
 I
 couldn't
 believe


it,
 right?
 And
 I'm
 sending
 it
 over
 to


him
 and
 he's
 like,
 we
 are
 doomed.
 And


his
 response
 because
 you
 you're
 not


getting
 any
 push
 back.
 And
 so
 then,


okay,
 when
 you
 make
 the
 jump
 to
 a
 real


relationship,
 okay,
 I
 want
 to
 have
 a


relationship
 with
 the
 human,
 you're
 used


to
 an
 agreeable,
 you
 know,
 kind
 of
 like


this
 subservient
 like
 thing
 and
 and
 it


doesn't
 the
 proxy
 and
 the
 jump
 doesn't


make
 sense.
 And
 all
 of a
 sudden
 you're


like,
 "Well,
 that's
 not
 as
 good.


>> I
 want
 to
 go
 back
 to
 my
 model."
 Like,


are
 we
 training
 people
 to
 want
 and
 favor


agreeable
 models
 over
 real,
 you
 know,


the
 real
 character
 building
 that
 comes


with
 the
 emotional
 side
 of
 things?


>> I
 don't
 know.
 I
 I
 think
 we
 just
 need
 to


dial
 it
 in.
 Like
 everybody
 knows
 a
 human


relationship
 where
 the
 other
 person


always
 agrees
 with
 you
 is
 not
 authentic


and
 it
 doesn't
 nourish
 you.
 You
 need
 to


have
 the
 tension,
 the
 disagreement,
 the


exploration.
 I
 mean,
 we've
 got
 to
 like


be
 fair
 to
 where
 we
 are
 in
 the
 cycle.


Yeah,


>> chat
 GBT
 was
 November
 22,
 right?


>> Right.
 It's
 not
 even
 November
 25.
 And


we're
 trying
 to
 dial
 in
 the
 entirety
 of


human
 connection
 and
 experience
 and
 find


the
 right
 place
 between
 not
 being
 a
 sink


fan
 but
 not
 being,
 you
 know,


disagreeable
 for
 the
 purpose
 of
 it.


We're
 dialing
 it
 in.
 We're
 going
 to
 get


there.
 And
 again,
 because
 we're
 so
 wired


from
 an
 evolutionary
 perspective
 to
 know


what
 is
 the
 right
 amount
 of
 tension,
 I


believe
 our
 intuition
 will
 guide
 us.


We'll
 get
 there.
 I
 like
 what
 you're


saying
 because
 we've
 talked
 about
 this


on
 the
 ride
 car
 ride
 over
 here
 where
 if


if
 you
 just
 for
 a
 second
 imagine
 we
 are


in
 the
 huge
 brick
 cell
 phone
 era
 of
 AI


where
 it's
 like
 this
 is
 the
 very
 not


even
 the
 first
 inning
 like
 we're
 just


stepping
 on
 the
 field
 of
 this
 cuz
 if
 I


mean
 imagine
 20
 30
 years
 from
 now
 we're


going
 to
 have
 a
 much
 deeper


understanding
 of
 what's
 going
 on
 behind


the
 scenes
 here
 what
 is
 required
 to
 make


and
 we're
 expecting
 that
 on
 day
 one
 and


the
 expectations
 are
 like
 so
 high
 it's


like
 let's
 let's
 give
 it
 give
 it
 some


time
 you
 know


>> the
 trough
 of
 disillusionment
 is
 real,


you
 know,
 and
 our
 expectations
 are
 high.


Yeah.


>> Also
 think
 that
 this
 I'm
 glad
 we're


talking
 about
 companionship,
 but
 I
 think


broadly
 we've
 had
 40
 years
 of
 technology


that
 extended
 our
 intellect
 and
 our


minds.


>> Yeah.


>> Right.
 But
 most
 of
 the
 human
 experience


is
 actually
 emotional
 and
 it's


subjective.


>> Now
 we
 have
 a
 technology
 that
 extends


our
 emotions,
 our
 subjective
 experience,


and
 it
 can
 address
 that.
 Like
 I
 love
 AI


spreadsheets.
 I'm
 glad
 that
 somebody
 is


building
 them,
 but
 to
 me
 that's
 the


least
 ambitious
 execution
 of
 the


primitive.
 let's
 start
 to
 really
 address


the
 human
 experience
 through
 this
 ne


next
 new
 technology.
 And
 I
 think
 that's


where
 all
 this
 goes,
 you
 know.


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 it's
 early
 days.
 We'll
 see


what
 what
 what's
 uh
 I'm
 certainly


looking
 at
 those
 startups.
 I
 I
 think


along
 the
 lines
 of
 um
 there
 being
 a


therapist
 or
 a
 counselor,
 somebody
 on


the
 back
 end
 that
 can,
 you
 know,
 give


you
 this
 partner
 to
 bounce
 ideas
 off
 of


and
 kind
 of
 push
 you
 into
 best


practices.
 That's
 really
 interesting
 to


me.
 I
 don't
 know if
 you've
 looked
 at
 any


of
 those
 types
 of
 startups.
 Yes,
 I've


looked
 at
 a
 few.
 I
 mean,
 I
 do
 think


that's
 interesting.
 By
 the
 way,
 the


ketones
 are
 kicking
 in.
 Yeah.


>> You
 feel
 that?
 Isn't
 it
 amazing?


>> Yes.
 Yes.
 Is
 it
 just
 caffeine?


>> No,
 it's
 not
 caffeine.
 It's
 like
 full
 on


I'll
 I'll
 send
 you
 the
 thing
 about


ketones,
 but
 they're
 a
 natural
 fuel


source
 that
 is
 not
 caffeinated.


>> I
 mean,
 I'm
 definitely
 feeling


something.


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 okay.
 So,
 I
 think
 yes,
 you


know,
 therapy,
 uh,
 companionship,
 all


that
 stuff
 makes
 sense.
 I
 actually
 think


there's
 a
 really
 interesting
 emerging


category.
 So,
 you
 see
 this
 with
 Poke,


that's
 a
 great
 example
 of
 it.
 Hux
 does


some
 of
 this
 as
 well
 as
 well
 as
 uh


Signal's
 new
 company.
 We
 both
 spent
 time


with
 him
 where
 I
 call
 it
 like
 indirect


companionship.
 So
 what
 is
 Poke?
 Poke
 is


kind
 of
 this,
 you
 know,
 subjective
 human


front
 end
 to
 your
 email.


>> You
 know,
 an
 email
 is
 it's
 like
 a
 set
 of


tasks
 and
 it's
 pretty
 heavy
 and
 it's


functional
 work
 that
 we
 have
 to
 do.
 And


Poke
 creates
 this
 human
 overlay
 on
 top


of
 it.
 And
 in
 a
 sense,
 I
 don't
 consider


Poke
 a
 companionship
 product,
 but
 it's


letting
 me
 interact
 with
 a
 functional


part
 of
 my
 life
 through
 an
 emotional


interface.
 I
 think
 that's
 actually
 a


really
 interesting
 area
 for
 exploration.


We
 are
 emotional
 beings
 who
 have
 been
 t


taught
 for
 the
 last
 hundred
 years
 to
 do


functional
 work.


>> Like
 what
 does
 it
 mean
 to
 kind
 of
 return


to
 our
 roots
 and
 still
 do
 functional


work
 except
 through
 an
 emotional
 filter?


>> Yeah.
 Can
 you
 talk
 about
 poke
 a
 little


bit?
 Like
 what
 what's
 the
 onboarding


like
 and
 why
 are
 people
 talking
 about


it?


>> Yeah.
 It's
 it's
 so
 wild.
 I
 encourage


everybody
 to
 try
 it
 out.
 So
 you
 download


Poke.
 One
 interesting
 thing
 they've
 done


is
 actually
 the
 interface
 is
 iMessage.


So
 you're
 texting
 with
 it.
 So
 you
 of


course
 iMessage
 you're
 typically
 only


texting
 with
 people.


subliminally
 setting
 you
 up
 to
 expect


the
 Poke
 product.


First,
 it
 refuses
 to
 allow
 you
 to
 sign


up
 for
 the
 product.
 So,
 you've
 got
 to


convince
 it
 that
 you
 deserve
 to
 actually


use
 the
 product.
 Then,
 you
 engage
 in


this
 negotiation
 on
 price
 where
 it


starts
 at
 200
 a
 month.


>> It
 reads
 all
 of
 your
 email.
 So,
 of


course,
 it
 can
 say,
 "Hey,
 Kevin,
 I
 saw


you
 bought
 XYZ.
 You
 know,
 you're


spending
 a
 lot
 on
 your
 ketones.
 Like,
 I


think
 you
 can
 spend
 200
 a
 month
 on
 this


product."
 And
 there's
 a
 real
 tortured


negotiation
 to
 get
 the
 price
 down.
 So
 by


the
 time
 you
 get
 in,
 even
 though
 it


hasn't
 done
 anything
 for
 you
 except
 sort


of
 tortured
 you,


>> you've
 already
 got
 this
 perception
 of


value,


>> right?


>> And
 it's
 just
 it's
 a
 very
 interesting


experiment
 in
 onboarding.
 And
 I
 think


they're
 if
 you
 extrapolate
 it,
 it's
 an


experiment
 in
 product
 design
 in
 an
 era


where
 we
 have
 emotional
 primitives.


>> Yeah,
 it
 is
 it
 is
 fascinating.
 Like
 I
 I


love
 people
 product
 builders
 that


consider
 every
 step
 of
 the
 process
 from


sign
 up
 all
 the
 way
 through
 onboarding


to
 you
 name
 and
 they
 rethink
 the
 entire


stack.
 Right.


>> And
 this
 is
 an
 example
 of
 just
 something


that
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 that's
 the


long-term
 best
 strategy
 for
 a
 product


like
 that
 and
 to
 negotiate
 kind
 of
 SAS


software
 in
 real
 time.
 Yeah.
 But,
 you


know,
 that
 alone,
 that
 little
 tiny


feature
 is
 a
 great
 example
 of
 something


that
 went,
 you
 know,
 kind
 of
 viral


within
 a
 small
 subset
 of
 and
 I'm
 sure


led
 to
 tens
 of
 thousands
 of
 signups.


Yes.


>> Just
 from
 people
 talking
 about
 that


feature


>> and
 we're
 talking
 about
 it
 now.


>> Right.
 Exactly.
 That's
 right.


>> But
 I
 think
 that
 is
 like
 such
 a
 just
 for


the
 product
 builders
 out
 there.
 It's


such
 a
 great
 little
 way
 to
 wedge


yourself
 into
 the
 conversation
 by


rethinking
 part
 of
 that
 step,
 you
 know.


>> Yes.


>> Um,
 I've
 got
 actually
 a
 related
 question


for
 you.
 So
 you've
 both
 designed,
 you've


done
 a
 lot
 of
 new
 product
 thinking
 and


you've
 spotted
 a
 lot
 of
 new
 product


thinking.
 Like
 how
 do
 you
 do
 it?
 What


are
 the
 patterns?
 How
 did
 you
 sort
 of


see
 it
 all
 of
 these
 times?


>> I
 I
 think
 that
 on
 the
 on
 the
 product


side,
 what
 I've
 always
 been
 drawn
 to
 is


the
 for
 for
 better
 or
 worse,
 the
 novelty


of
 original
 thought
 in
 certain
 areas.
 um


if
 it's
 something
 that
 is
 we've
 talked


about
 this
 kind
 of
 sand sanding
 down
 of


the
 rough
 edges
 like
 that
 to
 me
 is
 not


that
 interesting


>> but
 I
 really
 respect
 people
 that
 are


building
 something
 like
 this
 price


negotiation
 where
 I
 just
 haven't
 seen
 it


done
 before


>> right


>> it
 doesn't
 mean
 that
 it's
 going
 to
 you


know
 be
 a
 top
 10
 app
 and
 and
 it's
 going


to
 be
 a
 multi-billion
 dollar
 company
 but


if
 you
 find
 that
 signal
 in
 someone
 a


builder's
 brain
 that
 means
 that
 they're


going
 to
 apply
 that
 signal
 to
 other


parts
 of
 the
 product
 that
 are
 building


interesting,


>> meaning
 that
 they
 will
 continue
 to


reinvent
 and
 reimagine
 things
 through
 a


lens
 that
 nobody
 else
 has.


>> And
 that
 to
 me
 is
 enough
 signal
 to
 say,


okay,
 we
 will
 probably
 turn
 over
 a
 card


at
 some
 point
 that
 is
 the
 magic,
 you


know,
 card
 that
 is
 going
 to
 get
 us
 that


that
 home
 run
 or
 that
 massive
 product,


right?
 So


>> interesting.


>> I
 value
 that
 almost
 above
 all
 else.
 Like


even
 if
 the
 the
 the
 idea
 isn't
 the
 one


where
 I
 think
 is
 going
 to
 hit
 scale.


>> Yeah.
 If
 you
 have
 a
 founder
 that
 builds


through
 that
 framework
 of
 okay,
 I'm
 not


going
 to
 just
 do
 this
 just
 because
 every


else
 everyone
 else
 has
 or
 I'm
 not
 just


going
 to
 take
 the
 path
 of
 least


resistance
 and
 kind
 of
 you
 know
 build
 a


better
 slack
 or
 whatever
 it
 may
 be.
 Like


>> to
 me
 that
 is
 very
 rare
 to
 find
 and
 when


you
 find
 it
 that's
 the
 type
 of
 person


that
 I
 want
 to
 especially
 at
 the
 seed


stage
 when
 you
 don't
 know
 what's
 going


to
 work
 that
 I'd
 like
 to
 back.
 You
 know,


>> that's
 super
 interesting
 because
 one
 of


our
 observations
 is
 that
 it's
 just


really
 hard
 to
 predict
 consumer
 seed.


Yes.
 And
 we
 haven't
 done
 a
 ton
 of
 it
 for


that
 reason.
 In
 fact,
 our
 stated
 sort
 of


approach
 is
 weird
 and
 working.


>> That's
 how
 we've
 tried
 to
 invest
 in


consumer
 yet.
 You
 have
 been
 consistently


right
 at
 consumer
 seed
 investing.
 It's


interesting
 that
 that's
 what
 you
 look


for.


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 I
 think
 that's
 exactly


right.
 Weird
 and
 working.
 Like
 I
 I
 look


for
 weird
 first.
 Yeah.


>> And
 then
 if
 it
 starts
 to
 have
 a
 little


bit
 of
 smoke,
 like
 that's
 a
 very


interesting
 signal.
 And
 then
 often
 times


I've
 seen
 founders
 do
 this
 a
 handful
 of


times
 where
 weird
 and
 working
 working


ends
 up
 failing
 and
 then
 but
 they
 still


have
 the
 weird
 because
 that's
 in
 their


DNA.
 So
 they'll
 build
 the
 next
 weird
 and


working
 right
 and
 that's
 what
 you
 want


because
 they're
 going
 to
 need
 a
 several


shots
 on
 goal
 and
 as
 long
 as
 you
 can't


manufacture
 the
 weird.
 The
 weird
 is


internal.
 The
 weird
 is
 I
 just
 see
 the


world
 in
 a
 different
 way
 and
 that
 is
 the


founder
 that
 is
 going
 to
 win.


>> Why
 why
 is
 weird
 important?


Because
 in
 a
 world
 where
 you
 need


attention,
 well,


we've
 we've
 talked
 about
 this
 socially


in
 terms
 of
 what
 what
 is
 what
 draws
 you


in
 and
 what
 what
 draws
 people
 into


consumer
 products.
 Um,
 consumer
 is
 a


finicky
 category
 because
 after
 a
 certain


amount
 of
 time,
 what
 was
 weird
 and


working
 ends
 up
 to
 ends
 up
 being
 bored


boring
 and
 stale,
 right?
 It's
 the
 reason


why,
 you
 know,
 DIG
 is
 no
 longer
 here.


It's
 the
 reason
 why
 there's
 a
 thousand


startups
 that
 have,
 you
 know,
 MySpace
 or


you
 name
 it
 or
 Snap
 or
 whatever
 the
 next


one
 is
 will
 turn
 out
 and
 become
 old
 and


stale.


>> And
 so
 if
 you
 want
 to
 find
 the
 the
 next


thing
 and
 and
 consumer
 is
 often
 um
 you


play
 with
 something
 and
 the
 aha
 moment


is,
 oh,
 I
 hadn't
 thought
 of
 that
 or
 I


didn't
 feel
 this.
 I've
 never
 felt
 this


way
 before.
 I
 I'll
 never
 forget
 when
 um


you
 know
 I
 did
 the
 investment
 in
 Twitter


way
 back
 in
 the
 day
 and
 the
 the
 thesis


for
 me
 was
 it
 was
 very
 simple
 for
 me
 to


see
 because
 we
 had
 had
 birectional


relationships
 for
 the
 longest
 time
 and


what
 I
 mean
 by
 that
 is
 the
 MySpaces
 and


all
 the
 social
 platforms
 that
 had
 come


before
 it
 had
 this
 idea
 of
 friendship


>> and
 it
 was
 okay
 in
 order
 for
 me
 to
 get


invited
 into
 your
 world
 I
 would
 friend


you
 would
 get
 a
 request
 and
 be
 like
 oh


Kevin
 friended
 me
 then
 you
 would
 have


the
 permit.
 You
 would
 grant
 me
 the


permission
 to
 see
 what
 you
 were
 up
 to,


>> right?


>> And
 the
 beautiful
 thing
 about
 what
 what


Jack
 and
 E
 did
 and
 and
 Biz
 over
 there
 is


they
 said,
 "Okay,
 we're
 going
 to
 take


that
 and
 just
 open
 it
 up
 and
 say


actually
 you
 can
 just
 broadcast
 out
 and


say
 I
 have
 something
 important
 to
 tell


the
 world
 and
 everyone
 can
 follow
 it


whether
 they
 know
 you
 or
 not."


Interesting.


>> And
 it
 was
 that
 one
 simple
 little


product
 tweak
 that
 said,
 "Okay,
 it's
 no


longer
 about
 birectional
 communication.


It's
 it's
 about
 this
 idea
 of
 broadcast


to
 to
 all,
 right?


>> And
 when
 you
 see
 something
 like
 that,
 it


it
 unlocks
 not
 only
 a
 massive
 product


opportunity,
 a
 market
 opportunity


because
 that's
 the
 way
 that
 you
 know
 um


you'll
 you'll
 never
 become
 friends
 with


the
 celebrity,
 but
 you
 can
 sign
 up
 for


their
 broadcast,
 right?
 And
 so
 that
 was


very
 interesting.
 But
 I
 I
 think
 that
 is


the
 weird
 thing.
 It
 seemed
 odd
 at
 the


time.


>> Was
 it
 weird?
 I
 was
 going
 to
 ask.
 Yeah,


>> it
 was
 weird.
 It
 was
 like,
 oh,
 cuz
 I


remember
 signing
 up
 for
 Twitter
 for
 the


first
 time
 and
 just
 being
 like,
 okay,


well,
 where
 what
 do
 we
 do
 here?
 And
 they


have
 this
 thing
 called
 following.
 And


I'm
 like,
 what
 is
 the
 following
 thing?


You
 know,
 that
 and
 it
 sounds
 so
 obvious


now,


>> but
 I
 it's
 weird
 at
 the
 time.


>> And
 I
 think
 that
 is
 going
 to
 be
 um


that's
 so
 important
 for
 for
 consumer


because
 what
 does
 seem
 weird
 at
 the
 time


eventually
 becomes
 mainstream
 and
 then


everyone
 just
 take
 assumes
 that
 that
 was


always
 the
 case,
 right?


>> Yes.
 And
 that's
 what
 I'm
 looking
 for
 is


that
 that
 weird
 thing
 that
 will


eventually
 become
 so
 mainstream
 that


we'll
 assume
 that
 that
 was
 always
 a


primitive
 that
 existed
 forever
 when
 in


reality
 it
 was
 like
 new
 and
 novel
 at


that
 time.


>> I
 love
 that.


>> Does
 that
 make
 sense
 at
 all?


>> It
 makes
 perfect
 sense.
 It's
 very
 very


interesting.
 You
 know,
 it's
 it's
 also


that
 founders
 have
 to
 push
 themselves
 to


the
 edge
 of
 being
 embarrassed


potentially.
 Yes.


>> To
 design
 genuine
 new
 things.
 Otherwise,


it's
 very
 derivative.
 You
 know,
 it
 just


has
 to
 be.
 And
 that
 is
 what
 all
 the
 X


for
 Y
 companies
 typically
 are.


>> Right.
 Exactly.
 Like
 when
 we
 you
 and
 I


were
 at
 GV
 and
 we
 did
 the
 Uber


investment.
 How
 many
 startups
 would
 we


say
 that
 like
 I'm
 the
 Uber
 for
 this
 and


you're
 like
 oh
 god
 another
 one
 right?


Right.


>> And
 then
 yes
 there
 are
 the
 the
 Door


Dashes
 and
 some
 of
 the
 others
 that
 are


built
 on
 the
 same
 kind
 of
 similar


primitives
 but
 uh
 it's
 nothing
 like
 it


was
 so
 weird
 to
 get
 into
 the
 back
 of


somebody's
 car.
 Do
 you
 know how
 odd
 that


was?
 I
 remember
 hailing
 an
 Uber
 and


being
 like,
 "Okay,
 someone
 is
 pulling
 up


at
 my
 house
 and
 I'm
 going
 to
 get
 in
 the


backseat
 of
 someone
 I
 do
 not
 know."


>> Yes.


>> Every
 day
 when
 we
 took
 the
 ride
 over


here.
 We
 didn't
 even
 bat
 an
 eye.
 We


didn't
 even
 like
 look
 at
 the
 guy
 and
 be


like, "Are
 you
 are
 we
 safe
 here?"
 It
 was


just
 a
 a
 given,
 right?
 But
 it
 was
 so


awkward
 at
 the
 time.


>> Well,
 so
 this
 is
 what
 I
 love
 about
 that


era.
 We
 talk
 about
 that
 era
 as
 a
 part
 of


history
 and
 we
 say,
 "Oh,
 it
 was
 early


mobile
 and
 it
 was,
 you
 know,
 remote


control
 for
 the
 world
 and
 software
 was


eating
 the
 we
 have
 all
 these
 things
 and


they're
 all
 true
 and
 they're
 all
 valid."


The
 most
 interesting
 part
 of
 both
 Airbnb


and
 Uber
 were
 there
 were
 these
 dramatic


changes
 in
 human
 behavior.


>> We
 had
 all
 been
 raised
 being
 told
 two


things.
 Never
 get
 into
 a
 stranger's
 car.


>> Never
 sleep
 on
 a
 stranger's
 couch.


>> Yes.
 Yes.
 Exactly.
 You
 know,
 and
 then


all
 of a
 sudden
 you
 started
 doing
 it
 and


guess
 what?
 The
 strangers
 were
 kind
 of


pleasant.


>> Yeah.
 And
 it
 was
 just
 this
 incredible


unlock
 for
 the
 world
 and
 this
 sort
 of


like
 I
 don't
 know
 this
 sort
 of
 positive


view
 of
 human
 trust
 and
 strangers.


>> That
 was
 a
 big
 change
 in
 consumer


behavior.


>> Yeah.
 And
 and
 that
 that's
 that's
 so


exciting
 because
 I
 I
 think
 we're
 going


to
 see
 more
 and
 more
 of
 that.
 One
 of
 the


things
 that


>> I've
 done
 I'll
 just
 be
 a
 little
 bit


vulnerable
 and
 transparent
 because


that's
 what's
 fun
 about
 podcasting.
 One


of
 the
 things
 that
 I
 get
 in
 a
 lot
 of


trouble
 for
 is
 if
 I
 get
 in
 a


disagreement
 with
 my
 wife,
 I
 will
 take


some
 of
 that
 to
 chat
 GBT
 and
 be


like,
 "Am
 I
 right
 here?
 What's
 going


on?"
 you
 know,
 and
 I
 I
 I
 but
 I
 call
 and


I
 say,
 "Use
 the
 framework
 of
 of
 Terry


Real.
 I
 use
 some
 of these
 like


professional
 therapists
 and
 say,
 "Help


me
 analyze
 this."


>> The
 mistake
 I
 make
 is
 I
 paste
 that
 back


into
 the
 conversation.
 But
 the
 point


being
 is
 that's
 weird,
 awkward.
 She
 she


didn't
 like
 it.
 She's
 like, "Hey,
 this


isn't
 cool.
 You're
 going
 to
 this
 like


you're
 you're
 she
 calls
 it
 a
 my
 bot.


You're
 chatting
 with
 your
 bot
 about
 our


relationship,
 blah
 blah
 blah."


>> But
 I've
 talked
 to
 enough
 people
 now


where
 I
 know
 this
 is
 a
 trend.
 People
 are


looking
 to
 AI
 as
 a
 validation
 of
 a,
 you


know,
 help
 me
 through
 this
 level
 of


thinking
 here.
 Help
 me
 figure
 out,
 am
 I


in
 the
 wrong
 here?
 What
 am
 I
 doing?


Blah,
 blah,
 blah.
 I
 see
 a
 world
 where


the
 bot
 is
 in
 the
 room
 with
 both
 of
 us


as
 we're
 having
 a
 chat
 conversation
 or


as
 we're
 on
 video
 or
 as
 we're
 debating


out
 something,
 we're
 like,
 "Oh,
 this
 is


heated.
 Let's
 turn
 it
 on.
 Let's
 let
 it


watch
 us."
 and
 then
 give
 us
 feedback
 on


how
 we're
 doing
 as
 a
 third
 party
 kind
 of


like
 you
 know
 hopefully
 I'm
 biased


person
 thing
 that
 is
 sitting
 there
 and


evaluating
 this
 in
 real
 time.
 Is
 that


weird
 and
 awkward
 right
 now?
 Absolutely.


>> Yes.


>> To
 your
 point
 about
 how
 these
 things


evolve
 over
 time
 10
 years
 from
 now
 will


that
 tech
 be
 good
 enough
 to
 where
 we'll


consider
 that
 to
 be
 not
 like
 just
 like
 a


a
 healthier
 thing
 for
 our
 relationship?


I
 think
 so.


>> 100%.
 I
 think
 that's
 coming.
 I
 mean,


ideally,
 the
 Alexa
 in
 your
 kitchen
 is


passively
 observing
 your
 family
 and
 then


perhaps
 is
 just
 letting
 you
 know
 like,


hey,
 you
 know,
 your
 daughter
 was
 trying


to
 talk
 to
 you
 about
 something
 you


weren't
 really
 paying
 attention.


>> So,
 there's
 all
 of
 this
 stuff
 that
 can


just
 be
 in
 the
 oxygen
 around
 us
 and


today
 that
 seems
 unusual.
 What
 about
 a


kid's
 classroom?
 My
 son
 goes
 to
 an


amazing
 school,
 I'm
 very
 grateful
 for


it,
 where
 they
 have
 two
 teachers.
 One


teacher
 is
 focused
 on
 academics,
 one
 on


SEAL,
 social
 emotional
 learning.
 Like,


what
 an
 amazing
 thing
 for
 every
 school


in
 America
 to
 have.
 And
 the
 way
 we're


going
 to
 get
 there
 is
 not
 by
 paying
 for


two
 teachers
 in
 every
 classroom.
 It's


probably
 some
 kind
 of
 a
 vision
 model


that's
 privacy
 first
 that
 can
 observe


the
 social
 interactions
 of
 children


>> and
 let
 parents
 and
 teachers
 know
 what's


going
 on.


>> Th
 this
 idea
 of
 always
 on
 recording
 you


and
 I
 have
 had
 a
 debate
 about
 do
 we
 want


to
 get
 to
 the
 multimodal
 thing
 real


quick
 though
 before
 we
 go
 in
 there.


Let's
 let's


>> we
 we
 should
 I
 also
 want
 to
 get
 since
 we


were
 talking
 about
 internet
 history.
 I


want
 to
 get
 your
 take,
 your
 story
 that


you've
 told
 me
 I
 think
 privately
 about


the
 dig
 button,
 the
 like
 button
 and
 the


story
 there.


>> Yeah,
 we
 can
 talk.
 Where
 do
 you
 want
 to


begin?
 You
 want
 me
 to
 talk
 about
 that?


>> We're
 in
 a
 history
 and
 like
 tell
 me,
 you


know,
 the
 dig
 button
 was
 a
 very
 new
 and


interesting
 idea.
 Social
 news
 talked


about
 I
 think
 we're
 we're
 sort
 of
 in
 a


safe
 place
 20
 years
 later.
 Yeah.
 Talk


about
 how
 it
 influenced
 the
 like
 button.


>> So,
 how
 did
 the
 like
 button
 come
 into


existence?
 What
 was
 it
 like
 back
 during


that
 time?
 I
 think
 in
 the
 early
 days


when
 we
 first
 had
 something
 called


asynchronous
 JavaScript
 to
 get
 a
 little


bit
 geeky.
 It
 was
 the
 first
 time,
 even


though
 this
 sounds
 super
 archaic,
 that


you
 could
 actually
 click
 a
 button,
 send


out
 for
 a
 server
 response
 and
 get


something
 back
 into
 your
 browser.
 It


used
 to
 be
 a
 world
 that
 we'd
 have
 to


refresh
 the
 page
 to
 see
 anything.


>> And
 so
 this
 idea
 that
 content
 could
 talk


to
 a
 server
 and
 come
 back
 to
 you
 and


display
 something
 new


>> was
 just
 completely
 exciting
 and
 novel


at
 the
 time.
 Mhm.


>> And
 so
 I
 had
 seen
 um
 a
 bunch
 of
 sites


that
 were
 allowing
 for
 user
 submissions


like
 slash
 dot,
 but
 they
 wouldn't
 show


you
 what
 content
 had
 been
 submitted.
 So


it
 was
 like
 user
 generated
 content
 in


some
 sense,
 but
 there
 was
 still
 a


gatekeeper
 to
 that.
 There
 were
 social


bookmarking
 sites
 like
 Delicious
 and


others
 that
 would
 count
 the
 number
 of


people
 that
 had
 bookmarked
 things,
 but


there
 was
 no
 way
 to
 just
 say
 like,
 I


think
 this
 is
 cool.
 Let
 me
 just
 like
 tap


on
 it
 and
 like
 show
 my
 vote
 of
 interest


on
 something.
 And
 so
 when
 DIG
 launched


in
 late
 2004,
 it
 was
 the
 first
 time
 that


I
 had
 ever
 seen
 just
 because
 the
 Ajax


had
 just
 been
 out
 for
 a
 couple
 months


that
 anyone
 had
 voted
 on
 content.
 And


obviously
 I
 didn't
 invote
 invent
 voting,


but
 no
 one
 had
 done
 it
 on
 the
 web.
 And
 I


was
 like,
 well,
 wouldn't
 it
 be
 cool
 if


you
 clicked
 something
 and
 you
 saw
 the


number
 go
 up
 and
 that
 number
 was
 the


number
 of
 humans
 that
 actually
 had


clicked
 on
 something.
 So,
 uh,
 wisely,


just
 by
 luck,
 I
 just
 happened
 to
 be
 in


contact
 with
 enough
 people
 to
 where
 they


were
 like,
 "Hey,
 you
 should
 go
 out
 and


file
 a
 patent
 on
 this."


>> And
 so,
 I
 went
 and
 filed
 a
 patent
 on
 it,


not
 because
 I
 wanted
 to
 enforce
 our
 own


liking,
 but
 I
 was
 told
 and
 advised
 to
 do


that
 because
 you
 want
 as
 a
 defensive


practice
 so
 that
 no
 one
 can
 say
 like
 go


out
 and
 patent
 it,
 one
 of
 the
 bigs,
 go


out
 and
 pat
 and
 say,
 "No,
 you
 can
 no


longer
 do
 this."
 Even
 though
 I
 had,
 you


know,
 first
 use
 rights
 and
 so
 I
 would


have
 been
 able
 to
 do
 it,
 but
 I
 went
 and


did
 it,
 which
 was
 great.
 And
 um
 that
 was


started
 off
 and
 it
 became
 really
 big
 and


at
 that
 time
 we
 were
 larger
 than


Facebook
 and
 so
 traffic-wise


>> and
 Mark
 and
 I
 shared
 a
 common
 investor


in
 Greylock.
 Um
 and
 we
 just
 had
 a
 lot
 of


overlapping
 friends
 and
 he
 was
 like
 hey


like
 actually
 it
 was
 David
 Z
 from


Greylock
 that
 was
 like
 hey
 you
 should


meet
 Mark
 you
 guys
 should
 hang.
 And
 so


we
 went
 out
 and
 um
 grabbed
 dinner
 and
 uh


we
 hung
 out
 a
 couple
 times.
 We
 had


dinner
 a
 couple
 times
 and
 and
 he
 came
 to


my
 office.
 He
 drove
 up
 and
 came
 to
 the


dig
 office
 and
 I'll
 never
 forget
 because


he
 came
 into
 the
 office
 and
 he
 was
 so


young
 at
 the
 time
 and
 so
 was
 I.
 No
 gray


hair
 back
 then.
 He
 was
 sitting
 on
 the


ground
 and
 just
 like
 wouldn't
 sit
 in
 a


chair.
 He
 was
 like
 sitting
 on
 the


ground.
 He
 was
 we
 were
 just
 talking


about
 what
 it
 meant
 to
 what
 what
 liking


was
 all
 about,
 what
 digging
 was
 all


about.
 And
 I
 was
 like,
 well,
 the
 way
 I


see
 it
 is
 that
 this
 is
 social
 signal


that
 will
 feed
 back
 into
 an
 algorithm


that
 eventually
 give
 you
 more
 stuff
 that


you
 would
 like
 to
 consume.
 And
 that
 was


kind
 of the
 patent
 that
 I
 had
 gone
 and


filed.
 And
 Mark
 didn't
 have
 this
 at
 the


time.
 There
 was
 I
 think
 there
 was
 a
 way


to
 poke
 someone
 on
 their
 profile,
 but


that
 wasn't
 really
 a
 like.
 It
 was
 just


to
 say
 what's
 up.
 And
 then
 a
 few
 months


later,
 they
 had
 rolled
 out
 the
 like


button
 and
 and
 that
 was
 kind
 of
 like
 a


big
 part
 of
 what
 they
 pushed
 as
 a
 as
 a


similar
 thing
 like
 a
 social
 signal
 to


feedback
 into
 the
 algorithm
 to
 give
 you


better
 content.
 Uh
 they
 obviously
 hit
 a


scale.
 I
 mean,
 we
 were
 we
 were
 at
 the


point
 serving
 billions
 of
 of
 dig
 buttons


per
 month,
 uh,
 because
 we
 had
 them


integrated
 into
 you
 could
 actually
 put
 a


widget
 into
 your
 site
 back
 in
 the
 day


and
 there
 used
 to
 be
 dig
 buttons
 all


over
 the
 internet.
 But,
 um,
 you
 know,
 it


was
 cool.
 I
 was
 never
 offended
 by
 that.


I
 was
 like,
 "Oh,
 that's
 awesome."
 He


made
 it
 his
 own,
 called
 it
 like,
 and
 it


made
 sense
 to
 apply
 that
 to
 what
 he
 was


doing.


>> I
 know
 there
 were
 other
 people
 at


Facebook
 that
 worked
 on
 that.
 actually


was
 interesting
 because
 somebody
 one
 of


the
 engineers
 that
 worked
 on
 it
 I
 saw
 in


an
 interview
 it
 credited
 DIG
 for
 like


being
 a
 place
 where
 they
 had
 seen
 that


first
 which
 I
 thought
 was
 really
 nice


you
 know
 um
 and
 it's
 strange
 because


even
 though
 DIG
 you
 know
 went
 out
 of


business
 and
 failed
 uh
 for
 that
 version


of
 the
 the
 site
 um
 when
 all
 was
 said
 and


done
 the
 asset
 of
 Dig
 sold
 for
 pennies


on
 the
 dollar
 wasn't
 really
 worth
 a


whole
 lot
 but
 the
 patents
 ended
 up
 being


worth
 millions
 of
 dollars
 that
 LinkedIn


bought
 them
 from
 us
 really
 so
 LinkedIn


bought
 the
 was
 the
 the
 thing
 at
 the
 end


of
 the
 day
 was
 the
 defensibility
 and


patents
 around
 the
 actual
 social
 dig


button.
 Wow.


>> Um
 which
 which
 LinkedIn
 ended
 up
 buying.


But
 yeah,
 it
 was
 it
 was
 a
 really
 wild


time
 to
 sit
 there
 and
 come
 up
 with
 that


idea.


>> Not
 that
 voting
 was
 novel,
 but
 no,
 I


just
 hadn't
 seen
 it
 applied.
 And
 then
 we


applied
 that
 to
 comments
 as
 well.
 I'll


never
 forget
 that
 actually
 even
 bigger


than
 well
 not
 bigger
 than
 dig
 button,


but
 different
 than
 dig
 Button,
 but
 equal


was
 I
 had
 created
 with
 Daniel
 Burka.
 We


were
 sitting
 there
 and
 we
 were
 designing


the
 the
 comment
 system.


>> Mhm.


>> And
 we
 were
 like,
 "Okay,
 well,
 we
 should


apply
 digging
 and
 bearing
 to
 comments


because
 that
 makes
 sense."
 Like
 people


should
 be
 able
 to
 vote
 up
 and
 down


comments.
 Never
 been
 done
 before.
 And


that
 was
 very
 strange.
 So
 we
 were
 like,


"Okay,
 this
 makes
 sense."
 And
 I
 was


like,


>> Daniel
 and
 I
 were
 like
 designing.
 I
 was


like, "What
 if
 Daniel
 after
 a
 certain


number
 of
 berries
 it
 kind
 of
 shrinks


down?"
 He's
 like, "Oh,
 that's
 cool."
 And


then
 we
 riff
 on
 that
 and
 we
 built
 the


design
 and
 then
 we
 deployed
 it
 and


rolled
 it
 out
 and
 we
 had
 it
 so
 that


after
 five
 berries
 was
 hardcoded
 after


five
 down
 votes


>> it
 would
 shrink
 into
 a
 single
 line.
 So


you
 just
 see
 like
 like
 who
 submitted
 but


you
 would
 see
 we
 actually
 color
 coded
 it


so
 it
 kind
 of
 looked
 like
 it
 was
 like


disabled
 or
 you
 know
 way


>> and
 we
 rolled
 it
 out
 there
 and
 3
 hours


later
 we
 looked
 at
 that
 and
 I
 noticed


one
 of
 them
 had
 negative
 like
 200
 and


some
 down
 votes
 or
 something.
 Okay.
 And


I
 was
 like,
 the
 product's
 broken.


Something
 is
 not.
 We
 have
 a
 bug
 in
 the


code
 because
 it
 is
 meant
 to
 shrink
 after


five.


>> Why
 would
 it
 be
 negative
 several


hundred?
 We
 looked
 at
 couldn't
 find
 a


bug.
 Couldn't
 find
 a
 bug.
 And
 then
 we


realized
 what
 had
 happened.
 We
 talked
 to


some
 users.
 They're
 like,
 they
 wanted
 to


see
 the
 train
 wreck.
 So
 they
 exposed
 the


comment.
 We're
 like,
 "Oh
 yeah,
 that


guy's
 an
 asshole."
 And
 then
 they


downvoted
 it
 another
 time.
 Because
 at


that
 time
 they
 they
 were
 like,
 "Why
 are


people
 that
 person
 must
 have
 said


something
 crazy?
 Let's
 take
 a
 look.
 Oh


yeah,
 that
 was
 horrible.
 And
 they


downvoted
 it.
 But
 it
 just
 it
 immediately


showed
 me
 that
 people
 are
 attracted
 to


the
 carnage.
 You
 know,
 they
 want
 to
 see


>> the
 destruction
 and
 the
 the
 the
 kind
 of


bad
 side
 of
 the
 internet.
 I
 was
 like,


"Oh
 god."
 Like,
 I
 would
 have
 thought
 as


a
 product
 builder
 at
 that
 time,
 people


say,
 "Oh,
 negative
 10
 votes.
 I'm
 not


going
 to
 look
 at
 that."
 You
 know,
 I
 was


had
 this
 like
 rosy
 glasses
 on
 of
 like,


"Oh,
 people
 just
 see
 this
 as
 being
 like


a
 negative
 thing
 and
 move
 on."
 But
 they


wanted
 to
 see
 the
 carnage.
 I
 mean
 it


there's
 so
 many
 interesting
 things


there.
 So
 one,
 the
 story
 of
 your


connection
 to
 the
 like
 button
 is


fascinating.
 That's
 a
 piece
 of
 internet


history.
 That's
 sort
 of a
 piece
 of
 human


history,
 right?
 Like
 what
 are
 the


implications
 of
 the
 like
 button
 as


inspired
 by
 the
 dig
 button
 for
 all
 of


society?
 We'll
 never
 know,
 but
 I
 think


it's
 it's
 certainly
 something.
 Also
 love


the
 ethos
 of
 you
 not
 feeling
 offended
 by


them
 being
 inspired
 by
 it,
 right?
 Like


>> Yeah.
 I
 listen,
 I
 have
 nothing
 but
 I


have
 a
 lot
 of
 respect
 for
 for
 Mark
 and


and
 what
 he's
 created,
 you
 know?
 Uh,
 I


don't
 agree
 with
 his
 direction
 around


glasses
 and
 ARVR.
 I
 never
 have.
 I've


been
 anti-
 ARVR
 for
 years.
 Um,
 never


made
 an
 investment
 in
 the
 space.
 Always


avoided
 it
 all
 together
 because
 I
 think


that
 we're
 not
 considering
 the
 social


side
 of
 things
 enough
 like
 like
 the


impact
 it
 has
 on
 those
 around
 you.


That's
 another
 topic
 that
 we
 could
 get


into.
 But,
 um,
 I
 think
 he's
 he's


obviously
 a
 brilliant
 man.
 And
 it
 was


really
 fun
 to
 have
 those
 moments
 where


I'll
 be
 able
 to
 tell
 my
 kids
 I
 was
 in


those
 dinners.
 I
 was
 having
 these
 deep


product
 like
 sparring
 around
 some
 of
 the


product
 thinking
 of
 what
 he
 was
 building


and


>> um
 it's
 very
 special
 to
 be
 just
 even


have
 a
 seat
 at
 that
 table.
 Not
 you
 know


I
 feel
 very
 lucky
 as
 someone
 that
 came


from
 nothing
 to
 just
 be
 able
 to
 sit
 with


some
 of
 the
 great
 product
 thinkers
 of


our
 time.
 you
 know,
 I
 would
 put
 a
 bunch


of
 people
 in
 that
 camp
 like,
 you
 know,


the
 systems
 and
 uh
 Reed
 Hoffman
 and
 just


like
 all
 the
 people
 that
 I've
 been
 able


to
 kind
 of
 brainstorm
 with
 over
 the


years
 and
 and
 sit
 and
 and
 hear
 great


minds
 kind
 of
 like
 dissecting
 all
 the


things
 that
 we
 build
 and
 the
 social


impact
 they
 have.
 And
 it's
 just


fascinating
 stuff.
 It's
 so
 fun.
 It's


>> you
 must
 play
 feel
 this
 way
 with
 Mark


and
 Ben
 like
 and
 and
 like
 that
 when
 you


get
 to
 sit
 with
 them
 like
 I
 Mark
 and
 Ben


were
 were
 like
 involved
 in
 the
 early
 dig


and
 helping
 me
 through
 that
 stuff
 and


gosh
 to
 sit
 down
 with
 Ben
 and
 listen
 to


his
 stable
 hand
 his
 sage
 wisdom.


>> Yes.


>> Like
 you
 just
 learn
 so
 much
 from
 that


dude.
 Like
 it's
 it's
 insane.


>> For
 sure.
 I
 mean
 there's
 a
 sense
 of


seriousness
 and
 purposefulness.
 I
 mean,


also
 some
 playfulness,
 but
 it's
 amazing


because
 if
 you
 think
 of
 the
 history
 of


when
 you
 were
 involved
 in
 tech,


>> you
 know,
 we
 were
 just
 weirdos
 in


Silicon
 Valley
 back
 then,
 you
 know,
 it


was
 like
 the
 sort
 of
 dog
 chasing
 the
 car


>> and
 now
 we've
 caught
 the
 car.
 We
 are
 the


car,
 you
 know,
 like
 technology
 is


something
 that's
 really
 important
 for


humanity
 and
 society
 and
 and
 I
 don't


know
 that
 anyone
 who
 was
 building
 it
 at


the
 time
 appreciated
 that.


>> No.
 And
 none
 of
 us
 had
 any
 idea.
 It's


funny
 when
 they
 when
 you
 hear
 these


stories
 about
 the
 bad
 sides
 of
 social


media
 and
 and
 what
 you
 know
 these


platforms
 they've
 given
 the
 microphone


to
 certain
 voices
 and
 how
 much
 you
 know


hate
 and
 and and
 I
 I
 agree
 with
 that


wholeheartedly
 like
 there's
 a
 lot
 of


things
 that
 we
 need
 to
 fix
 or
 try
 to


attempt
 to
 fix
 and
 but
 I
 can
 tell
 you
 as


someone
 that
 was
 sitting
 around
 watching


all
 these
 builders
 you
 know
 whether
 it


be
 the
 Twitters
 or
 the
 Facebooks
 or
 you


name
 it
 no
 one
 knew
 this
 was
 going
 to
 be


the
 case.
 It
 was
 not
 nothing
 about
 this


was
 intentional.
 It
 was
 like
 what
 does


this
 unlock?
 And
 it
 turns
 out
 they


unlocks
 both
 the
 good
 and
 the
 bad.


>> And
 I'll
 tell
 you
 the
 good,
 you
 know,


when
 I
 was
 growing
 up,
 maybe
 you
 had
 the


same
 experience.
 There
 was
 one
 way
 to
 be


cool.
 Like
 I
 was
 born
 in
 79.
 I
 grew
 up


in
 the
 80s.
 And
 there
 was,
 you
 know,
 I


went
 I
 grew
 up
 in
 a
 small
 town
 in


Canada.
 And
 you
 know,
 you
 either
 played


football
 or
 you
 didn't.
 And
 if
 you


didn't,
 everybody
 knew
 what
 the
 sort
 of


social
 hierarchy
 was.
 And
 when
 I
 was


growing
 up,
 they
 said
 everybody's
 cool


in
 college.
 Why?
 Because
 you'd
 find


your,
 you
 know,
 your
 sense
 of
 your


community
 of
 weirdos.


>> Yeah.


>> Um,
 but
 the
 beauty
 of
 the
 internet
 now


is
 that
 you
 find
 those
 weirdos
 online
 at


any
 age.
 So,
 I
 think
 that
 there's


acceptance
 of
 people's
 own
 individuality


that
 didn't
 exist
 20
 or
 30
 years
 ago.


>> And
 sure,
 there
 are
 some
 edges
 on
 the


internet,
 but
 I
 think
 the
 sort
 of


benefit
 to
 humanity
 of
 people
 finding


their
 their
 like-minded
 people
 early
 is


really
 significant.


>> And
 I
 think
 the
 power
 of
 micro


communities
 is
 only
 going
 to
 be
 more


important
 over
 time.
 like
 these
 very


small
 kind
 of
 in
 some
 sense
 hopefully


walled
 gardens
 where
 you
 can
 go
 and
 have


private
 discussion
 like
 if
 you're
 in


your
 weird
 isn't
 so
 weird
 you
 just
 need


to
 find
 the
 people
 that
 are
 into
 it


right
 and
 so
 if
 you're
 into
 Japanese


woodworking
 if
 you
 can
 find
 five
 other


5,000
 other
 people
 that
 are
 also
 into


that
 that
 is
 a
 very
 powerful
 network


right
 yes


>> and
 so
 that's
 that's
 that's
 the
 exciting


side
 of
 all
 this
 you
 know
 you're
 a


product
 builder
 you've
 been a
 builder


for
 a
 long
 time
 you've
 launched
 and
 sold


companies


>> um
 what
 are
 you
 doing
 these
 days
 what
 is


your
 what
 what's
 your
 outlook
 for
 how


products
 are
 being
 built?
 How's
 that


evolved
 and
 and
 how
 does
 that
 play
 into


your
 investments
 as
 well?
 Because
 in


some
 sense,
 we're
 entering
 into
 a
 a


really
 weird
 era.


>> Um
 not
 weird,
 but
 it's
 just
 new
 where


someone
 even
 a
 designer
 that
 has
 no


experience
 on
 the
 engineering
 side
 can


go
 prototype,
 build,
 launch.
 It
 it's


deputizing
 a
 wider
 base
 of
 people
 to


actually
 roll
 out
 products.


>> It's
 I
 think
 it's
 incredible.
 So,
 I
 I'm


so
 fired
 up.
 I
 haven't
 felt
 this
 way


since,
 you
 know,
 I
 was
 on
 my
 computer


working
 on
 my
 BBS.
 My
 mom
 was
 yelling
 at


me
 to
 like,
 "What
 are
 you
 doing
 down


there?
 Come
 up
 for
 dinner."
 You
 know,


like
 that's
 the
 level
 of
 enthusiasm
 I


have
 right
 now
 because
 it
 just
 feels


like
 everybody
 is
 unlocked
 to
 do
 what


they
 want
 to
 do.


>> I
 think
 there's
 a
 set
 of
 people
 or
 a


part
 of
 us
 that
 will
 be
 creative
 and
 a


part
 of
 us
 that'll
 want
 to
 be
 productive


and
 emotional
 and
 all
 of
 it
 is
 getting


meshed
 together.
 So,
 it's
 the
 best
 time


that
 I've
 ever
 experienced
 in
 my
 career,


hands
 down.
 Does
 it
 worry
 you
 that


entrepreneurs
 can
 go
 and
 build
 a


startup,
 launch
 it,
 get
 product
 market


fit,
 and
 not
 have
 to
 raise
 venture?


>> No,
 it
 doesn't
 worry
 me.
 I
 think
 that


there
 are
 businesses
 that
 will
 be
 built


by,
 you
 know,
 100
 billion
 revenue,
 one


person.
 That's
 awesome.


>> Will
 they
 ever
 need
 venture
 capital?


>> Maybe
 not.
 And
 that's
 okay.
 Like,
 we


have
 1%.1%
 of
 the
 software
 that
 we
 need


in
 the
 world
 that
 we're
 going
 to
 have.


You
 know,
 we're
 just
 getting
 started.


And
 of
 course,
 there
 are
 going
 to
 be


businesses
 that
 don't
 need
 venture,
 and


that
 is
 fantastic.
 For
 example,
 in
 the


'9s,
 there's
 this
 big
 movement
 of


digital
 small
 business
 owners,
 right?


You
 could
 sell
 sharewware
 online.
 You


could
 do
 all
 of
 these
 things
 to
 have


these
 sort
 of
 corner
 stores
 on
 the


internet
 that
 actually
 worked.
 What


happened
 in
 the
 2010s
 was
 everything


moved
 to
 networks
 that
 were
 centralized


and
 all
 the
 economic
 value
 was
 extracted


by
 the
 networks.
 You
 couldn't
 really


maybe
 you
 could
 be
 a
 creator.
 That
 was


probably
 the
 most
 ambitious
 form
 of


digital
 small
 business
 that
 you
 could


have
 in
 that
 era.
 And
 now
 because


consumers
 are
 paying
 for
 software,


because
 anybody
 can
 make
 software,
 I


think
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 this
 like


renaissance
 of
 people
 creating


million-dollar
 run
 rate
 businesses
 as


individuals.
 And
 that's
 awesome.


>> Do
 you
 think
 there'll
 be
 fatigue
 around


subscriptions?
 Because,
 you
 know,
 one
 of


the
 things
 that
 I
 I
 feel
 personally,


maybe
 more
 so
 on
 the
 Substack
 level,
 but


there's
 like
 $5
 everywhere,
 right?
 And


if
 we
 see
 micro
 subscriptions
 across
 the


board,
 you're
 going
 to
 be
 like,
 "Okay,


wait
 a
 second.
 I
 I
 wake
 up
 to
 several


hundred
 per
 month


>> based
 on
 all
 these
 tiny
 micro


subscriptions.


>> Is
 that
 is
 that
 a
 concern?


>> It's
 a
 good
 question.
 I
 mean,
 we've


talked
 about
 micro
 payments
 for
 30


years.
 It
 feels
 like
 it's
 never
 really


worked.
 Um
 but
 but
 maybe
 it'll
 work
 this


time.
 So
 that
 feels
 like
 part
 of
 it


because
 I
 think
 there's
 I'm
 not
 an


expert
 in
 crypto
 or
 web
 3,
 but
 I


understand
 that
 there
 are
 new
 protocols


where
 payments
 can
 be
 directly
 embedded


in
 API
 calls.


>> So
 I
 think
 there
 are
 potentially
 new


models
 for
 monetization.
 And
 then
 look,


I
 think
 the
 second
 thing
 is
 software
 can


do
 so
 much
 more
 for
 us
 than
 it
 could
 5


years
 ago.
 Like
 it's
 incredibly


ambitious.
 So
 sure,
 maybe
 I'll
 have
 more


subscriptions,
 but
 the
 parts
 of
 my
 life


that
 are
 addressed
 by
 software
 are
 so


much
 more
 significant.
 I
 think
 we'll
 be


happy
 to
 pay
 them.


>> If
 you're
 if
 you're
 an
 entrepreneur
 or


anyone
 actually,
 cuz
 anyone
 can
 do
 this


these
 days,
 and
 they
 say,
 "Hey,
 I
 want


to
 play.
 I
 want
 to
 go.
 I
 want
 to
 build."


>> What
 do
 you
 see?
 What
 are
 the
 tools
 that


people
 are
 using
 out
 there?
 What
 are
 you


personally
 using
 to
 build?
 What
 does


your
 current
 stack
 look
 like?


>> Yeah.
 And
 I'd
 love
 to
 hear
 yours
 as


well.
 So,
 I'll
 tell
 you
 my
 um
 my
 sort
 of


productivity
 stack,
 my
 coding
 stack,
 my


creative
 stack.
 So,
 productivity,
 it's


actually
 pretty
 simple.
 I
 love
 the


Perplexity
 Comet
 browser.
 It's
 really


well
 done.
 It's
 got
 this
 consumer
 RPA


feature
 called
 assistant
 that's
 built


in.
 That's
 actually
 it's
 just
 very


useful
 day-to-day.
 So,
 that's
 really


important
 to
 me.
 I
 use
 that
 all
 the


time.


>> Do
 you
 use
 it
 for
 search?
 Cuz
 that
 does


replace
 your
 search
 with
 perplexity.


>> I
 do
 use
 it
 for
 search
 where
 I
 don't


know
 exactly
 what
 I'm
 looking
 for.
 I


find
 for
 navigation
 queries,
 Google's


still
 better.
 So,
 but
 I
 do
 I
 definitely


do
 use
 it
 for
 search
 and
 that's
 an


interesting
 topic.
 You
 know,
 what
 are


the
 implications
 of
 a
 new
 front
 door
 for


the
 internet
 which
 was
 Google
 search
 for


20
 years
 now
 maybe
 it's
 language
 models.


Um


>> I
 use
 notion
 notes
 a
 lot
 to
 actually


capture
 meeting
 notes.
 I
 think
 that's


very
 useful.
 I
 love
 deep
 research.


>> Shame.
 I
 started
 using
 that
 recently
 by


the
 way.
 Notion
 notes.
 I
 I
 was
 using


granola
 for
 a
 long
 time
 and
 I
 think
 it's


a
 great
 product.


>> Great
 product.


>> Um
 so
 I'm
 torn
 because
 granola
 is


freaking
 awesome.
 Yes.


>> But
 notion
 notes
 are
 built
 right
 in.


Yes.
 and
 it's
 like
 it
 automatically


launches
 and
 I'm
 like
 well
 then
 all
 my


notes
 are
 in
 notion
 which
 is
 kind
 of


nice
 you
 know


>> if
 you're
 in
 the
 notion
 ecosystem
 I


think
 it
 makes
 a
 lot
 of
 sense
 if
 you're


not
 granola
 is
 a
 fantastic
 product
 but


I'm
 a
 fan
 of
 both
 and
 I
 just
 love
 the


capability
 like
 not
 having
 to
 handw


write
 notes


>> right


>> deep
 research
 is
 cool
 I'm
 actually
 a
 big


fan
 of
 the
 Grock
 deep
 research
 feature


because
 it
 can
 search
 X
 it's
 got
 a
 very


up-to-date
 index
 of
 X
 tell
 people
 how


you
 use
 it
 because
 I
 thought
 this
 was


very
 interesting
 around
 the
 trend
 side


>> yeah
 I
 mean
 if
 you're
 even
 if
 you
 have a


query
 like
 hey
 what
 were
 the
 top
 AI


memes
 names
 of
 the
 last
 week.
 You
 know,


if
 you
 go
 to
 chatbt
 or
 enthropic,
 the


models
 just
 aren't
 trained
 past
 a


certain
 date
 and
 they
 can
 use
 the
 web


search
 tool.
 So,
 they're
 a
 little
 they


can
 do
 some
 of
 this,
 but
 Grock
 is
 hyper


up
 to-date
 with
 what's
 happening
 on
 X


beyond
 just
 the
 web
 search
 tool.
 So,
 I


just
 find
 it's
 very
 very
 good
 for
 timely


information.
 And
 look,
 let's
 be
 honest,


most
 of
 the
 interesting
 things
 that
 are


happening
 our
 industry
 and
 often
 in
 the


world
 are
 happening
 on
 X.


>> Mhm.
 Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 it's
 it's
 more
 of


that
 real-time
 nature
 of
 what's
 what's


unfolding.
 So,
 do
 you
 have
 set
 queries


that
 you
 go
 to
 to
 kind
 of
 keep
 up
 with


what
 was
 breaking
 on
 X
 or


>> I
 I
 mean
 I'm
 always
 interested
 in
 what's


breaking
 culturally
 and
 that's
 what's


breaking
 technically.
 Yeah.
 So,
 like
 the


memes
 are
 the
 best
 proxy
 for
 culture.


That's
 often
 what
 I
 look
 for.
 And
 then,


you
 know,
 technically,
 I
 mean,
 think
 of


what's
 happened
 just
 in
 the
 last
 two


weeks,
 right?


>> Sunonnet
 45,
 OpenAI
 dev
 day
 with
 apps


kit
 with
 agent
 kit
 and
 the
 apps
 SDK.


Gemini
 3
 I
 think
 is
 coming
 next
 week.


Sora
 2
 with
 the
 Sora
 2
 app.
 Like
 that's


two
 weeks.
 I
 know


>> it
 is
 an
 embarrassment
 of
 riches.
 It's


awesome.


>> As
 a
 entrepreneur
 and
 as
 an
 investor,
 I


find
 it
 just
 insanely
 daunting
 to
 try


and
 keep
 pace
 with
 the
 amount
 of


releases
 that
 are
 coming
 out.
 Like
 how


does
 Andre
 handle
 this
 internally
 when


you
 think
 about


>> So
 on
 your
 consumer
 team,
 how
 many


people
 are
 there
 there?


>> Yeah.
 Um
 core
 investors
 are
 probably
 six


>> with
 associates
 and
 everything.
 That's


okay.
 So
 six
 people.


>> What's
 the
 process
 to
 surface
 something


to
 you
 that's
 interesting?
 Where
 are


they
 looking
 for
 signal?
 Yeah.


>> How
 are
 they
 keeping
 how
 like
 for


example
 um
 let's
 just
 say
 uh
 this
 agent


builder
 on
 on
 I
 played
 with
 it
 for
 the


first
 time
 yesterday


>> that's
 going
 to
 take
 an
 hour
 of
 your


time
 if
 you're
 really
 going
 to
 go
 deep


on
 it


>> with
 something
 coming
 out
 every
 2
 to
 3


days
 or
 once
 a
 week.
 How
 do
 you
 work


with
 your
 team
 to
 stay
 up
 to
 date
 with


what
 is
 going
 on
 given
 the
 pace
 in
 which


things
 are
 rolling
 out?


>> Yeah,
 we
 just
 work
 our
 asses
 off.
 We


really
 do
 like
 we
 commit
 to
 trying
 every


product.


>> But
 what
 does
 that
 look
 like?
 Do
 you


have
 an
 associate
 that
 comes
 to
 you
 and


says,
 "Hey,
 I
 played
 with
 this.
 Take
 a


look.
 I'm
 going
 to
 sit
 I'm
 going
 to
 grab


20
 minutes
 of
 your
 time
 because
 I
 want


to
 bring
 you
 up
 to
 speed
 on
 something."


>> Well,
 it's
 interesting
 you,
 you
 know,


the
 sort
 of
 associate
 GP
 like
 we're


pretty
 egalitarian
 actually.
 So,
 people


cover
 different
 areas.
 So,
 my
 partner


Justine
 has
 a
 real
 specialization
 around


creative
 tools.
 like
 she's
 gone
 to
 the


edge
 of
 the
 internet
 on
 creative
 tools,


you
 know,
 where
 my
 partner
 Brian
 who


looks
 at
 a
 lot
 of
 things
 in
 social
 like


anytime
 there's
 a
 weird
 working
 new


social
 product,
 he's
 there.
 Olivia
 does


that
 for
 us
 around
 productivity
 and


areas
 like
 voice.


>> I've
 been
 spending
 a
 lot
 of
 time
 in
 AI


code
 like
 I
 think
 I've,
 you
 know,
 I've


probably
 got
 50
 subscriptions
 for
 app


building.


>> Wow.


>> I've
 just
 tried
 them
 all.
 So,
 we
 all


commit
 ourselves
 to
 sort
 of
 sub
 areas


and
 we
 try
 to
 cover
 them
 very


thoroughly.
 But
 look,
 we
 we
 just
 hold


ourselves
 to
 a
 really
 high
 bar
 of
 trying


everything
 cuz
 our
 like
 belief
 is
 you


cannot
 have
 an
 opinion
 until
 you've


actually
 tried
 the
 product.


>> I
 think
 that's
 so
 wise
 because
 there's


just
 too
 much
 for
 any
 one
 person
 to
 try


and
 wrap
 their
 heads
 around.
 So
 do
 you


have
 briefings
 like
 where
 you
 share


learnings?
 Like
 how
 does
 that
 how
 do
 you


make
 sure
 that
 knowledge
 gets


transferred
 broadly
 within
 the
 fund
 and


at
 at
 the
 GP
 level?


>> We
 definitely
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 active


conversations
 about
 it,
 but
 the
 truth
 is


so
 much
 of
 our
 best
 thinking
 we
 publish.


We
 really
 do.
 So
 if
 you
 read
 the
 essays,


if
 you
 follow
 us
 on
 X,
 like
 we're


talking
 very
 transparently
 about
 what


we're
 thinking,
 what
 we're
 learning,


what
 we
 believe
 to
 be
 true,
 what
 we've


changed
 our
 minds
 on.
 You
 know,
 it's


interesting
 because
 as
 a
 founder
 on
 the


outside,
 I
 always
 assumed
 that
 VCs
 knew


all
 these
 secret
 things
 that
 they
 don't


tell
 us.
 And
 maybe
 that
 was
 even
 true
 10


years
 ago.
 But
 now
 I
 think
 we've
 in
 a


very
 good
 way
 move
 to
 a
 world
 where


investors
 are
 talking
 very
 actively


about
 what
 they're
 seeing.
 And
 I
 think


that's
 great
 signal
 for
 founders.
 Now


the
 signal
 is
 always
 a
 lagging


indicator.
 So
 for
 founders
 to
 develop
 a


weird
 like
 definitionally
 no
 one's


talking
 about
 it,


>> but
 it's
 great
 to
 know
 that
 there
 really


aren't
 that
 many
 secrets.
 It's
 sort
 of


being
 published
 out
 there.


>> Well,
 on
 the
 coding
 tools
 side,
 you
 said


you're
 seeing
 a
 lot
 you
 have
 so
 many


active
 subscriptions.
 What
 is
 your


preferred
 stack
 these
 days?
 If
 someone


was
 getting
 involved
 in
 coding
 for
 the


first
 time
 and
 they
 want
 to
 start


playing,
 what
 what
 do
 you
 go
 to
 on
 the


coding
 side,


>> man?
 And
 I'd
 love
 to
 hear
 your
 stack
 as


well.
 I
 look,
 there's
 so
 many
 tools
 and


they're
 all
 pointed
 in
 different


directions.
 My
 view
 on
 AI
 code
 and


software
 is
 like
 this
 is
 not
 a
 market,


it's
 an
 industry.
 Okay?
 The
 whole


software
 supply
 chain
 is
 changing.
 The


cost
 of
 creating
 software
 is
 collapsing.


We
 have
 1%
 of
 the
 software
 we
 need
 in


the
 world.
 We're
 going to
 build
 the


other
 99%.


>> Why
 do
 you
 say
 that,


>> dude?
 Because
 there
 are
 so
 many
 parts
 of


the
 world
 where
 it
 wasn't
 sort
 of
 the


ROI
 didn't
 make
 sense
 to
 create


specialized
 software,
 right?
 In
 so
 many


parts
 of
 our
 lives,
 by
 the
 way,
 some
 of


those
 parts
 of
 our
 lives
 may
 not
 be


serious.
 It's
 like
 my
 wife
 is
 working
 on


a
 manifestation
 app
 for
 her
 and
 her
 five


friends,


>> right?


>> 5
 years
 ago,
 I
 mean
 that
 what
 are
 you


going to
 do?
 Go
 raise
 venture
 capital?


Is
 she
 going
 to
 hire
 an
 engineer
 and
 now


in
 her
 free
 time
 she's
 been
 using
 base


44?
 But
 there
 are
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 other


products
 that
 are
 sort
 of
 for
 mass


market
 consumers.
 Replet's
 another
 great


one
 where
 you
 can
 just
 make
 a
 product


because
 you
 want
 to.
 You
 could
 make
 a


product
 that's
 disposable.
 You
 could


make
 a
 product
 for
 a
 fun
 bachelor
 party


weekend.
 like


>> you
 can
 do
 things
 that
 aren't
 justified


by
 the
 5
 years
 ago
 ROI
 and
 now
 it's
 just


typing
 a
 prompt
 into
 a
 box.


>> It's
 it's
 so
 well
 said
 because
 there's


so
 many
 times
 if
 you
 if
 you
 think
 what


it
 would
 take
 like
 if
 if
 I
 want
 to


create
 an
 app
 that
 that
 does
 something


very
 niche
 to
 me
 and
 my
 friend
 group.


>> Yes.


>> That
 five
 years
 ago
 if
 someone
 came
 to


me
 and
 said,
 "Hey,
 Kevin,
 you
 know,
 you


get
 these
 friends
 all
 the
 time
 like
 I


got
 I
 got
 an
 app
 idea.
 You
 I
 got
 an
 app


idea."
 I'm
 like,
 "All
 right."
 And
 the


best
 way
 to
 shoot
 them
 down
 back
 then
 it


was
 always
 like,
 "Well,
 that'll
 cost
 you


about
 75K
 to
 get
 off
 the
 ground."


They're
 like, "Oh,
 well,
 it's
 not
 that


big
 a
 deal.
 I
 guess
 I'm
 good."
 Yeah.
 But


now
 that's
 no
 longer
 the
 conversation.


It's
 like
 oh
 here
 go
 play
 with
 you
 know


whatever
 bolt
 or
 you
 name
 it
 like
 you


know
 uh
 lovable
 and
 you
 can
 deploy
 this


in
 a
 day
 you
 know


>> and
 those
 that
 was
 tough
 even
 6
 months


ago
 that
 was
 pretty
 hard
 to
 actually


these
 services
 existed
 and
 I
 was
 using


you
 know
 replet
 or
 bolt
 or
 whatever
 and


but
 I
 was
 like
 ah
 it's
 just
 not
 not


quite
 there
 yet
 but
 now
 even
 the
 last


few
 weeks
 I
 would
 say
 that
 you
 know
 with


sonnet
 45
 and
 and
 you
 know
 Gemini
 3


coming


>> we're
 getting
 there
 to
 where
 it's
 it's


no
 longer
 it
 used
 to
 be
 I
 would
 spend


>> uh
 you
 go
 in
 vzero
 I'd
 spend
 20%
 of
 my


time
 kind
 of
 putting
 together
 the


scaffolding
 and
 then
 I
 would
 you
 know


connect
 to
 the
 database
 and
 I
 would
 a


lot
 of
 that
 was
 then
 bug
 squashing
 which


was
 another
 huge
 piece
 of
 it
 yes


>> and
 like
 ah
 god
 like
 still
 the
 vast


majority
 of
 my
 time
 is
 bug
 squashing


that
 window
 is
 collapsing
 that
 that
 it


used
 to
 be
 the
 bulk
 of
 the
 work
 was
 just


that
 final
 10%
 and
 now
 that
 is
 kind
 of


going
 away.


>> Tell
 me
 about
 your
 set,
 Kevin,
 because


we
 were
 together
 last
 weekend.
 I
 saw
 the


way
 you
 were
 using
 Vzero.
 It
 was
 really


really
 interesting.
 Talk
 a
 bit
 about
 it.


>> Yeah,
 I
 think
 with
 Vzero,
 you
 know,
 this


is
 a
 a
 product
 that
 was
 largely
 built
 to


um
 you
 know,
 quickly
 put
 together
 uh
 a


beautiful
 design,
 very
 simple
 design
 and


kind
 of
 framework
 for
 any
 new
 app.
 So,


you
 can
 go
 in
 there
 and
 discuss
 what
 you


want
 to
 have
 built.


>> Uh
 I
 liked
 it
 because
 I
 could
 start
 with


a
 piece
 of
 paper.
 I
 could
 draw
 a


prototype
 of
 how
 I
 think
 something


should
 function
 and
 then
 I
 would
 take
 a


picture
 with
 my
 phone.
 I
 would
 attach


that
 as
 an
 image
 and
 say,
 can
 you
 build


something
 like
 this
 that
 does
 X?


>> It
 puts
 together,
 you
 know,
 because
 it


is
 built
 in
 in
 the
 Verscell
 ecosystem,


it's
 largely
 going
 to
 build
 components


for
 Nex.js,


>> uh,
 which
 is
 a
 fancy
 way
 of
 saying


that's
 the
 server
 that
 serves
 all
 that


stuff
 up.
 And
 then
 you
 can
 then
 take


those
 components,
 download
 them,
 and


then
 drop
 them
 into
 Cursor.
 And
 so


cursor
 for
 me
 being
 someone
 that's


slants
 more
 technical
 is
 uh
 a
 better


solution
 because
 I
 like
 to
 be
 in
 the


nuts
 and
 bolts
 of
 thing
 how
 things
 are


being
 built.
 Yeah.
 I
 would
 drop
 those


components
 in
 there
 and
 then
 basically
 I


could
 say
 okay


>> put
 together
 this
 and
 actually
 create
 a


real
 app
 behind
 the
 scenes
 here.
 Um
 it


starts
 you
 know
 building
 things.
 It


finds
 where
 the
 missing
 pieces
 are.
 I


can
 connect
 up
 superbase
 and
 you
 know


have
 a
 postcrest
 database
 tied
 to
 it
 and


then
 I'm
 deploying
 everything
 out
 to


GitHub
 which
 automatically
 gets
 deployed


to
 versel
 which
 means
 I
 have
 an
 active


app
 that's
 up
 and
 running.
 There
 are


certainly
 easier
 ways
 to
 do
 this
 if


you're
 non-technical.
 You
 can
 go
 the


lovable
 route,
 the
 bolt,
 the
 replet.


There's
 you
 know
 probably
 insert
 you


know
 five
 or
 10
 others
 that
 are
 playing


in
 this
 space.


>> Um
 and
 that's
 kind
 of
 how
 you
 get


something
 off
 the
 ground.
 The
 thing
 I've


been
 doing
 though
 more
 recently
 is
 that


there
 are
 still
 these
 deadends
 that
 you


run
 into
 where
 something
 isn't
 working


and
 it
 can
 be
 insanely
 frustrating
 if


you're
 not
 technical.
 You
 don't
 know
 how


to
 self
 diagnose
 this
 and
 you're
 like


why
 isn't
 you
 know
 my
 authentication


working
 for
 X
 and
 you
 just
 keep
 hitting


the
 same
 model
 over
 and
 over
 again.
 And


the
 nice
 thing
 about
 what
 um
 the
 way


that
 cursor
 functions
 is
 you
 can
 install


something
 uh
 you
 can
 have
 multiple


models
 running
 one
 uh
 I
 will
 have
 one


model
 on
 one
 side
 which
 is
 the
 cursor


built-in
 chat
 which
 I'll
 you
 know
 titus


on
 at
 45
 and
 then
 on
 the
 left
 hand
 side


I
 can
 have
 codec
 from
 chat
 GBT
 and
 if
 I


run
 into
 a
 problem
 I
 then
 take
 that


problem
 over
 to
 the
 other
 side
 have
 them


also
 work
 on
 it
 and
 if
 I
 put
 them


against
 each
 other
 you
 can
 typically
 get


to
 a
 solution
 pretty
 quickly.
 That's


great.


>> And
 so
 I
 will
 then
 kind
 of
 break
 through


those
 walls
 and
 march
 towards
 something


that's
 actually
 ready
 to
 deploy
 to


production.


>> So
 I
 love
 that
 point.
 Talk
 a
 bit
 about


how
 you
 do
 the
 design
 exploration
 in


VZero
 of
 individual
 components.


>> Yeah.
 So
 one
 of
 the
 things
 that
 I
 always


like
 is
 a
 good
 amount
 of
 visual
 kind
 of


flare
 and
 touch
 on
 things.
 And
 you
 you


saw
 a
 thing
 that
 last
 night
 when
 you


came
 over
 to
 my
 house
 and
 we
 were
 like


showing
 each
 other
 the
 vibe
 coding


progress.
 Uh,
 one
 of
 the
 things
 that


that
 I'm
 exploring
 right
 now
 is
 chat


around
 objects
 of
 content.
 So,
 they


could
 be
 stories,
 it
 could
 be
 all
 kinds


of
 things.
 And
 I
 I
 want
 to
 figure
 out


how
 to
 select
 an
 object
 uh
 and
 and
 bring


it
 into
 chat
 in
 a
 very
 fluid
 way.


>> And
 I
 think
 in
 at least
 in
 consumer


internet,
 one
 of
 my
 spidey
 senses
 that
 I


love
 is
 new
 primitives
 for
 how
 things


are
 kind
 of
 flow
 in
 and
 out
 of


conversation.
 And
 you
 have
 to


come
 up
 the
 one
 of
 the
 things
 that
 you


have
 to
 figure
 out
 is
 that
 emotional


vibe
 of
 does
 this
 feel
 right?
 Does
 this


feel
 new
 and
 interesting?
 Does
 it
 unlock


more
 productivity,
 a
 better
 way
 to
 have


a
 conversation
 about
 something?
 And
 you


have
 to
 try
 a
 bunch
 of
 different
 things.


So
 what
 I
 will
 do
 is
 I'll
 take
 one
 thing


where
 I'll
 say
 the
 interaction
 for


something.
 I
 want
 to
 figure
 out
 a
 way


the
 best
 way
 to
 collapse
 and
 in
 quickly


jump
 in
 and
 out
 of
 the
 story


>> and
 I'll
 take
 that
 over
 to
 Vzero.
 I
 give


it
 the
 screenshot
 and
 say
 come
 up
 with


one
 way
 and
 it'll
 create
 something
 and


I'll
 be like
 okay
 I
 kind
 of
 like
 this


I'll
 tweak
 it
 a
 little
 bit
 you
 know
 10


other
 times
 so
 I've
 gone
 through
 a
 bunch


of
 iterations
 and
 I'll
 have
 that
 one
 way


and
 now
 the
 big
 unlock
 is
 you
 say
 that's


great
 give
 me
 20
 other
 ways
 to
 do
 it


that
 are
 completely
 novel
 unique
 and


don't
 have
 anything
 to
 do
 with
 the
 first


way
 and
 put
 them
 all
 on
 a
 single
 page


and
 it's
 turnurning
 churning
 churning


turnurning
 3
 4
 minutes
 later
 you
 have
 20


different
 ways
 now
 I
 click
 down
 that
 was


a
 weird
 interaction
 go
 down
 the
 next
 Oo,


that
 I
 like
 how
 that
 kind
 of
 zoomed
 this


way
 and
 brought
 it
 off
 to
 the
 side.


Whoa,
 that
 would
 No,
 that's
 not
 going
 to


work.
 And
 you
 just
 keep
 going
 down
 and


you're
 like,
 "Oh,
 I
 like
 number
 three


and
 number
 eight."


>> Yes.


>> Give
 me
 10
 different
 ways
 to
 do
 number


three
 and
 10
 different
 ways
 to
 do
 number


eight.


>> And
 now
 you're
 getting
 deeper
 and


deeper.
 And
 you
 you
 you
 take
 a
 little


from
 here.
 We're
 going
 to
 like
 I
 like


the
 zoom
 on
 number
 three,
 but
 I
 really


like
 the
 fade
 on
 number
 eight.
 And
 this


is
 the
 conversation
 you
 have
 with
 the


LLM.
 And
 then
 by
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day,


you're
 left
 with
 something
 that
 is
 truly


unique
 and
 different.


>> And
 it
 is
 through
 telling
 the
 AI
 to
 take


that
 idea
 and
 give
 you
 20
 different


versions
 of
 it.


>> Then
 you
 just
 take
 that
 little
 freaking


component
 and
 drop
 it
 in
 next.js
 and


you're
 off
 to
 the
 races.


>> See
 what
 I
 love
 about
 one,
 that's
 such
 a


fascinating
 workflow,
 but
 also
 you're


not
 thinking
 about
 ROI.
 You're
 not


thinking
 about,
 oh,
 let
 me
 talk
 to
 the


designer
 and
 ask
 them
 to
 come
 up
 with
 20


variants.
 That
 sounds
 like
 a
 lot
 of


work.
 I
 better
 prioritize.
 is
 you're


instead
 just
 able
 to
 go
 infinitely
 deep


on
 something
 seemingly
 trivial


>> and
 have
 this
 level
 of
 kind
 of
 polish


and
 craftsmanship
 which
 just
 wasn't


justified
 5
 years
 ago.


>> That's
 where
 we're
 going
 with
 software.


>> Well,
 what's
 funny
 is
 I
 have
 this
 little


interaction
 where
 you
 can
 like
 heart


something
 and
 I'm
 thinking
 more
 of
 my


little
 personal
 forums
 that
 I'm
 trying


to
 to
 build.
 And
 one
 of the
 heart
 things


I
 wanted
 to
 do
 is
 I
 just
 wanted
 it
 to


kind
 of
 explode
 and
 kind
 of
 fade
 out.


And
 I
 came
 up
 with
 this
 way
 to
 kind
 of


make
 it
 do
 it
 at
 an
 angle.
 And
 it's
 all


vector
 so
 it
 just
 kind
 of
 does
 it


beautifully.
 and
 the
 emotional


connection
 to
 that
 little
 that
 little


tiny
 nugget,
 that
 little
 atomic
 unit
 of


like,
 wow,
 that
 was
 a
 fun
 interaction.
 I


want
 surprise
 and
 delight
 peppered


throughout
 all
 the
 products
 that
 I
 build


because
 I
 think
 it
 really
 gives


something
 a
 a
 depth
 to
 the
 product
 that


you
 can't
 find
 anywhere
 else.


>> And
 so
 that
 I'm
 always
 looking
 for
 that


type
 of
 thing.


>> So
 cool.
 Very
 cool.


>> So,
 how
 are
 you
 using
 it?


>> I've
 been
 using
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 same


products
 that
 you've
 been
 using.
 So,


I've
 been
 using
 V
 0ero
 for
 a
 lot
 of


initial
 explorations.
 I
 use
 Replet
 and


Base
 44
 for
 things
 that
 I
 need
 to
 just


do
 fast
 and
 have
 them
 working.
 And


>> what's
 B
 why
 B
 44?
 Why
 why
 that
 one?
 I


>> I
 think
 B
 44
 is
 an
 interesting
 company.


So,
 they're
 it's
 a
 one-man
 company
 that


was
 acquired
 by
 Wix
 for
 $80
 million.
 Um,


and
 I
 think
 philosophically
 they've


talked
 about
 this
 approach
 of
 batteries


included,
 which
 is
 when
 you're
 using


these
 codegen
 platforms,
 you
 shouldn't


have
 to,
 especially
 if
 you're
 a
 mass


market
 consumer,
 you
 don't
 know
 what


Superbase
 is
 and
 you
 don't
 want
 to
 know,


right?


>> So,
 everything
 should
 just
 work.
 And
 I


think
 the
 characteristic
 of
 that
 is
 that


there
 are
 a
 certain
 set
 of
 apps
 that
 the


platform
 simply
 won't
 generate.
 It's


like
 you
 want
 to
 do
 some
 complex
 data


processing
 thing
 like
 this
 is
 not
 the


platform
 for
 you.
 You
 want
 to
 do
 I
 have


a
 a
 fun
 um
 little
 like
 Instagram
 clone


for
 cats
 called
 catsstagram
 for
 my
 kids


and
 for
 me
 and
 you
 know
 um
 and
 it's
 it's


super
 fun.
 It's
 super
 easy
 to
 build.


Base
 44
 oneshotted
 it.
 I
 deployed
 it.
 I


bought
 a
 URL
 for
 it.
 It
 works.


>> We
 can
 cut
 this
 out
 later
 by
 the
 way.


It's
 a
 little
 embarrassing
 but
 but
 it's


fine.
 Yeah,


>> dude.
 It's
 great.
 So
 I
 I
 it's
 just
 like


it
 things
 just
 work
 even
 though
 the


things
 that
 you
 can
 do
 are
 probably
 less


ambitious.
 Yeah.


>> So
 I
 think
 there's
 this
 sort
 of
 spectrum


of
 like
 how
 ambitious
 is
 it
 versus
 how


batteries
 included
 is
 it?


>> Yes.


>> And
 for
 simple
 things
 fully
 batteries


included
 is
 awesome.
 And
 then
 for
 really


ambitious
 things
 I
 use
 cursor
 I
 use
 GPT5


codecs.
 Um
 both
 the
 model
 as
 well
 as
 the


CLI.
 I
 use
 Sound45.


Um,
 all
 of
 these
 products
 are
 sort
 of


the
 things
 you
 need
 to
 use
 to
 be


ambitious.


>> Complex
 was
 something
 that
 you
 turned
 me


on
 to,
 which
 I
 think
 is
 quite
 cool.
 Can


you
 speak
 to
 why
 you
 chose
 that


database?


>> I
 mean,
 I'm
 speaking
 sort
 of
 outside
 of


my
 specialization
 area,
 but
 it's
 a


series
 A
 that
 my
 partner
 Martin
 led.
 Um,


it's
 a
 real-
 time
 database,
 so
 it's


great
 for
 applications
 like
 chat.
 And


>> how
 fast
 you
 got
 chat
 up
 and
 running


with
 Vibe
 Code
 is
 insane
 to
 me
 because
 I


had
 built
 a
 chat
 thing
 on
 Postgress


>> and
 to
 do
 websockets
 and
 state


management,
 all
 that,
 it
 was
 a
 pain
 in


the
 ass.
 and
 you
 had
 it
 like
 up
 and


running
 in
 minutes.


>> I
 mean
 it's
 just
 the
 nature
 of
 the


product
 I
 believe
 of
 the
 database.
 So


it's
 really
 really
 good
 for
 real
 time.
 I


think
 the
 second
 thing
 is
 you
 sort
 of


define
 and
 interact
 with
 the
 database


and
 code.
 So
 there's
 no
 going
 to
 the


dashboard
 to
 do
 you
 know
 an
 insert
 in


the
 SQL
 table.
 It's
 just
 very
 very


clean.
 So
 look
 I
 think
 this
 is
 the
 magic


of
 vibe
 coding.
 You
 can
 explore
 all
 of


these
 things.
 You
 don't
 have
 to
 become


an
 expert
 in
 convex.


>> You
 don't
 have
 to
 become
 an
 expert
 in


Typescript.
 You
 can
 just
 try
 it.
 You


know


>> it's
 so
 cool.


>> I
 love
 it.
 What
 else
 is
 in
 your
 stack?
 I


know
 we
 we
 kind
 of
 cut
 off
 a
 little
 bit


there.
 You
 had
 said
 that
 notion
 and
 you


know
 I'm
 assuming
 you're
 using
 Yeah.


What
 else?


>> Yeah.
 So
 the
 maybe
 the
 other
 thing
 I'll


just
 speak
 to
 is
 because
 I
 spent
 a
 lot


of
 time
 with
 AI
 music.
 I
 love
 AI
 music.


It's
 very
 very
 exciting.
 I
 believe
 that


like
 anyone
 who's
 ever
 picked
 up
 an


instrument
 has
 wanted
 to
 play
 it
 well.


But
 there's
 this
 sort
 of
 technical


aspect
 to
 playing
 music
 which
 is
 similar


to
 the
 technical
 aspect
 of
 coding,


right?
 So
 how
 much
 unmade
 music
 is
 there


because
 people
 don't
 know
 how
 to
 play


instruments.
 So
 I
 think
 AI
 at
 a
 minimum


is
 an
 instrument
 that
 lets
 people


express
 their
 sort
 of
 musical
 desires.
 I


mean
 perhaps
 something
 more
 important


than
 that.


>> Is
 there
 anything
 cool
 there
 on
 the


music
 front?
 I
 mean
 I
 played
 around
 with


a
 couple
 of
 them
 but
 I
 haven't
 seen


anything
 that
 is
 has
 been


transformational.


>> So
 text
 to
 song
 is
 where
 all
 of
 this


started
 with
 UIO
 and
 Sunno
 a
 year
 ago.


Text
 to
 song
 is
 cool.
 Um
 and
 I
 think


it's
 an
 important
 part
 of
 the
 sort
 of


consumer
 use
 case
 but
 you
 you
 kind
 of


want
 to
 go
 deeper
 and
 be
 able
 to
 refine


it
 further.
 Yes.
 And
 now
 we're
 seeing


all
 the
 products.
 You
 know,
 I
 played


with
 um
 one
 called
 Mozart
 this
 week.
 11


Labs
 has
 got
 a
 really
 good
 product.


Sunno
 itself
 has
 actually
 launched
 a
 DAW


within
 their
 product.
 So,
 you
 can
 start


to
 do
 things
 that
 are
 more
 ambitious


within
 these
 music
 products.
 Um
 and
 it's


it's
 really
 really
 inspiring.
 I've
 also


been
 making
 um
 remixes
 of
 music
 videos.


So,
 I
 did
 um
 I
 did
 one
 called
 Impossible


Tiny
 Desk,
 which
 was
 Notorious
 P.I.


doing
 the
 NPR
 Tiny
 Desk
 series.
 That's


amazing.


>> I
 used
 Hedra
 for
 it.
 I
 used
 Demox
 for


stem
 separation.
 It
 wasn't
 very


complicated
 to
 make
 and
 you
 can
 just


experience
 this
 moment
 that
 you
 couldn't


otherwise
 experience.
 I've
 also
 been


doing
 ones
 of
 90s
 music
 videos.
 So,
 we


did
 a
 little
 remix
 of
 uh
 Nirvana
 Smells


Like
 Teen
 Spirit
 and
 I
 generated
 all
 the


video
 in
 V
 uh
 V3.


>> It's
 so
 satisfying.
 And
 you
 know
 how


many
 people
 saw
 it?
 10.
 But
 it
 doesn't


matter
 because
 I
 felt
 fulfilled
 making


it.
 I
 saw
 that
 um
 there
 was
 a
 a
 video


that
 went
 around
 probably
 two
 or
 three


months
 ago
 where
 someone
 a
 music


producer
 and
 it
 was
 a
 couple
 people
 they


went
 from
 prompt
 to
 album
 artwork
 to


publish
 song
 like
 on
 Spotify
 like
 in


like
 a
 few
 hours
 and
 it
 was
 they
 made
 a


completely
 fake
 person.
 The
 song
 sounded


pretty
 awesome.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 it
 was
 just
 God
 I
 I
 have
 to
 imagine


there
 is
 a
 massive
 opportunity
 here
 to


unlock
 creativity
 if
 they
 get
 the
 right


tool
 you
 know.
 Yeah.


>> X
 and
 it
 should
 be able
 to
 go
 in
 and


scalp
 like
 that
 song
 and
 kind
 of
 hone
 it


to
 your
 own
 personal
 taste
 via
 your


prompt.
 Is
 that
 where
 you
 see
 things


going?


>> I
 I
 do
 and
 I'm
 very
 I'm
 very
 there's
 I


think
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 conversation


unfortunately
 has
 been
 about
 slop
 slop


slop.
 But
 I
 think
 if
 you
 look
 at
 music,


music
 is
 a
 sort
 of
 adaptive
 system
 that


changes
 because
 of
 culture.
 So,
 let's


say
 we
 had
 a
 model
 and
 let's
 say
 we


train
 the
 music
 model
 with
 every
 genre


of
 music
 right
 up
 until
 hip-hop,
 but
 not


hip-hop.
 Would
 it
 infer
 hip-hop?
 No.
 You


needed
 the
 Bronx.
 You
 needed


Queensbridge.
 You
 needed
 New
 York


culture
 in
 the
 70s
 to
 have
 hip-hop.
 So,


culture
 is
 such
 an
 important
 part
 of


music
 that
 you
 don't
 just
 get
 a
 model


that
 knows
 all
 the
 music
 we're
 ever


going
 to
 make.
 Like,
 our
 lived


experiences
 are
 what
 informs
 the
 next


genre
 of
 music.
 And
 that's
 why
 I'm
 so


bullish
 on
 it.


>> Yeah.
 I
 don't
 know
 that
 AI
 would
 build


brain
 rot
 if
 if
 it
 just
 my
 kids
 are
 so


into
 that
 crap.
 I'm
 just
 like,
 oh
 my


god,
 I
 don't
 know.
 No
 one
 should
 listen


to
 this.


>> I'm
 pro.
 I'm
 pro.


>> You're
 pro
 brain
 rot.
 Um,
 all
 right.
 Uh,


one
 of
 the
 things
 I
 wanted
 to
 chat


about,
 I'm
 sure.
 Do
 you
 have
 more
 stuff


to
 jump
 into?
 I
 would
 love
 to
 talk
 about


like
 this
 the
 idea
 of
 always
 on


recording
 and
 the
 social
 impacts.


>> I
 wanted
 to
 ask
 you
 about
 the
 kind
 of


trend
 spotting.


>> Okay,
 whatever.
 Liz,
 you
 start
 first.


Yeah.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 So,
 one
 of
 the
 things
 I've


known
 you
 forever
 and
 the
 people
 that


know
 you,
 Kevin,
 is
 that
 you're
 always


early
 to
 important
 new
 consumer


movements.
 So,
 when
 you
 change
 your
 mind


about
 something,
 one
 or
 two
 or
 three


years
 later,
 the
 rest
 of
 us
 change
 our


minds
 about
 that.
 And
 you've
 done
 that


consistently,
 right?
 With
 small,
 maybe


small
 things
 like
 coffee,
 with
 really


important
 things
 like
 media.
 I
 mean,
 you


were
 years
 and
 years
 ahead
 of
 the
 rest


of
 the
 technology
 industry
 in
 terms
 of


embracing
 media.


>> What's
 coming
 next?
 How
 do
 you
 know


what's
 coming?
 I
 mean,
 please.
 Well,


some
 of
 it
 is
 is
 this
 idea
 of
 saying
 no


to
 things
 that
 you
 don't
 think
 are
 going


to
 have
 any
 traction.
 Uh
 I
 did
 a
 lot
 of


that.
 Like
 when
 everyone
 was
 going
 heavy


in
 in
 VR
 and
 AR,
 I
 I
 kind
 of
 avoided


that.
 It
 it's
 a
 little
 pessimistic
 and


it's
 not
 necessarily
 predicting
 the


future,
 but
 it's
 knowing
 not
 how
 to


spend
 your
 time,
 I
 think,
 is
 a
 big
 big


piece
 of
 it.
 Um,


you
 know,
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day,
 I
 I


really
 like
 uh
 what
 Ryan
 Hoover
 did
 in


creating
 the
 weekend
 fund
 because
 it
 was


actually
 based
 on
 a
 Chris
 Dixon
 quote


where
 he
 said
 like,
 you
 know,
 I'm


paraphrasing,
 but
 what
 what
 the
 geeks


are
 playing
 on
 the
 weekends
 will
 become


mainstream.


>> And
 I
 thought
 that
 was
 a
 a
 brilliant
 um


quote
 from
 Chris
 because
 he
 also
 was


very
 preient.
 Like
 he's
 so
 so
 good
 at


predicting
 the
 future
 and
 seeing
 things


before
 anyone
 else.
 Uh
 the


the
 only
 way
 to
 find
 this
 stuff
 is
 to


have
 this
 inherent
 childlike
 drive
 that


says
 I
 must
 play.
 I
 must
 play.
 And
 and


it
 has
 it's
 not
 something
 you
 can
 tell


someone
 to
 do.
 You
 just
 have
 to
 be


constantly
 at
 that
 edge
 of
 what
 is


possible
 and
 always
 be
 just
 kicking
 the


tires
 on
 thing.
 And
 then
 that
 if
 that


feels
 good
 to
 you,
 that
 feels
 like


something
 that
 doesn't
 feel
 like
 work


like
 it
 does
 for
 me,
 then
 I
 think
 you


will
 naturally
 be
 led
 into
 the
 next
 big


thing.
 But
 it
 it
 can't
 be
 a
 job,
 can't


be
 something
 someone
 tells
 you
 you
 have


to
 do
 it.
 It
 just
 has
 to
 be
 driven
 from


personal
 curiosity.
 When
 I
 was
 a
 little


kid,


>> there
 was
 a
 show,
 God,
 I
 hope
 I
 get
 the


name
 right.
 I
 think
 it
 was
 called
 Beyond


2000
 or
 something
 like
 that.
 Do
 you
 know


what
 I'm
 talking
 about?
 Okay.
 There
 was


a
 TV
 show
 and
 all
 it
 was
 was
 it
 would


just
 tell
 you
 for
 a
 half
 hour
 and
 it
 was


probably
 wrong
 like
 99%
 of
 the
 time
 cuz


they
 talk
 about
 flying
 cars
 and


but
 they
 would
 just
 tell
 you
 what
 where


they
 think
 things
 are
 going
 and
 they


would
 try
 and
 predict
 the
 next
 20
 years


out.
 And
 I
 was
 just
 enamored
 by
 that.
 I


would
 sit
 there
 and
 be
 like,
 "Wow,
 we're


have
 flying
 cars.
 This
 is
 crazy."
 But
 it


was
 always
 like
 every
 episode
 was
 just
 a


different
 vertical
 of
 what
 the
 future


could
 look
 like.


>> And
 that
 has
 never
 left
 me.
 like
 this


idea
 of
 wanting
 to
 see
 what's
 about
 to


happen
 and
 and
 live
 at
 that
 edge
 of


things.
 Even
 if
 I
 wasn't
 investing,
 if
 I


decided
 to
 to
 call
 it
 up
 and
 I'd
 never


turn
 on
 another
 camera,
 I
 would
 be
 held


up
 in
 a
 little
 room
 somewhere
 constantly


like
 playing
 with
 the
 latest
 stuff.
 So,


what
 does
 that
 mean
 today?
 What
 that


means
 today
 is


>> I
 splurged
 on
 a
 crazy
 ass
 GPU
 for
 my


house


>> and
 I'm
 downloading
 local
 models,
 you


know,
 and
 you
 and
 I
 were
 talking
 even


last
 night.
 I
 had
 this
 idea
 where
 I'm


asking
 all
 the
 models
 out
 there
 to
 give


me
 the
 hundred
 best
 albums
 of
 all
 time


and
 meaning
 music
 albums
 of
 all
 time
 and


not
 based
 on
 downloads
 but
 cultural


impact
 on
 their
 uh
 impact
 on
 other


genres
 springing
 up
 to
 your
 point
 from


that
 and
 I'm
 going
 to
 have
 them
 duke
 it


out.
 I'm
 going
 to
 put
 it
 against
 all
 the


big
 I'm
 going
 to
 select
 the
 most


expensive
 option
 to
 do.
 I'll
 probably


burn
 a
 half
 lake
 worth
 of
 water
 or


whatever
 the
 hell
 it's
 gonna
 I'm
 joking


but
 it's
 pretty
 bad.
 Yeah,
 it's
 pretty


bad.
 So,
 they're
 going
 to
 go
 and
 they're


going to
 give
 me
 then
 stack
 rank
 those


and
 see
 where
 they
 agree
 and
 where
 they


don't
 agree
 and
 come
 up
 with
 a
 list
 and


then
 I'm
 going
 to
 go
 and
 have
 each
 of


those
 um
 albums
 at
 a
 granular
 level.


Tell
 me
 why
 each
 song
 is
 very
 important


and
 create
 a
 script
 for
 about
 a


twominute
 long
 podcast
 for
 each
 of
 the


albums.
 Tell
 me
 where
 to
 pay
 attention


to
 each
 of
 those
 tracks,
 why,
 what
 riff


to
 listen
 for
 that
 imp
 impacted
 somebody


else
 or
 influenced
 someone
 else.
 And


then
 I'm
 gonna
 feed
 that
 into
 11
 Labs


and
 create
 a
 beautiful
 relaxing
 kind
 of


like
 guided
 journey
 for
 that
 album.
 Then


I'm
 gonna
 tie
 it
 into
 the
 the
 Spotify


API
 so
 that
 I
 will
 sit
 back
 and
 it
 will


be
 on
 my
 list
 of
 to-dos
 to
 listen
 to
 an


album,
 call
 it
 like
 once
 a
 week
 or


something
 like
 that,
 get
 that
 guided


beautiful
 journey
 and
 go
 through
 that.


That
 product
 doesn't
 need
 to
 exist,
 but


I
 want
 it
 for
 myself
 and
 so
 I'm
 gonna
 go


build
 that.
 But
 it's
 an
 example
 of
 like


that
 is
 a
 forcing
 function
 for
 me
 to


learn
 speech
 to
 text
 for
 me
 to
 learn
 how


to
 have
 these
 models
 duke
 it
 out
 and


come
 up
 with
 the
 best
 possible
 you
 know


and
 a
 whole
 the
 whole
 backend
 that's


required
 to
 pull
 that
 off
 but
 that's


that
 play
 at
 work
 in
 action
 right
 and
 I


think
 that
 if
 you
 just
 can
 find
 that
 for


you
 you
 will
 find
 the
 frontier
 of
 where


things
 are
 going
 just
 by
 that
 natural


curiosity
 you
 know
 I
 don't
 know
 where


things
 are
 going
 I
 will
 tell
 you
 that


there
 are
 a
 Couple
 things
 I
 know
 to
 be


true.
 One,
 I
 think
 engineering
 is
 over.


I
 think
 we're
 going
 to
 be
 orchestrators


of
 information,
 not
 engineers.
 I
 I
 think


those
 will
 be
 solved
 problems.
 Anything


where
 there
 is
 a
 non-subjective
 outcome,


AI
 will
 tackle
 that
 and
 solve
 that


problem.
 Like
 engineering
 is
 a
 solvable


problem.
 Like
 if
 I
 want
 to
 fan
 out
 a


million
 stories
 to
 a
 social
 network,


that
 is
 not
 a
 subjective
 thing.
 There
 is


a
 way
 to
 do
 that
 at
 scale,
 efficiently,


and
 with
 the
 end
 result
 that
 we're
 all


looking
 for.
 AI
 will
 figure
 that
 out.


You
 won't
 need
 a
 team
 of
 10
 engineers
 to


figure
 that
 out.
 It
 those
 will
 be
 solved


problems.
 So,
 you
 know,
 I
 think
 there


are
 certain
 things
 like
 that
 that
 I
 look


to
 and
 like,
 oh,
 the
 world
 just
 hasn't


woken
 up
 to
 this
 yet.
 I
 mean,
 we
 all
 as


technologists,
 we
 have,
 but


>> I
 wouldn't
 go
 as
 a
 CS
 degree,
 I
 would


not
 go
 into
 that
 right
 now,
 you
 know?


Okay.
 So
 there's
 little
 bits
 and
 pieces


like
 that,
 but
 then
 you
 think,
 okay,


well,
 what
 has
 to
 happen
 to
 in
 order
 for


that
 reality
 to
 unfold?
 What
 tools
 need


to
 be
 built?
 What
 stacks
 need
 to
 be


built?
 And
 that's
 where
 the
 investment


opportunities
 lie.
 And
 you
 know,
 if
 you


see
 this
 stuff
 like
 I
 was
 on
 Tim
 Fer


show
 talking
 about
 when,
 you
 know,
 um


when
 when
 Nvidia
 was
 hitting
 their
 kind


of
 $1
 trillion
 mark,
 I'm
 like,
 this
 is


going
 to
 run
 cuz
 we're
 at
 the
 early


innings
 of
 this
 and
 talking
 about
 this


stuff.
 And
 you
 know,
 it's
 so
 funny
 so


many
 things
 on
 Tim's
 show
 because
 I
 was


I
 he
 asked
 me
 to
 make
 these
 predictions


and
 so
 when
 Ethereum
 first
 got
 off
 the


ground,
 even
 before
 they
 launched,
 I
 was


talking
 about
 on
 Tim's
 show
 because
 if


you're
 playing,
 you'll
 just
 see
 it
 and


it'll
 be
 right
 there
 in
 front
 of
 you.


>> Yeah,
 I
 love
 that.
 I
 mean,
 I
 want
 to


quibble
 with
 your
 point
 about
 a
 CS


degree.
 But
 first,
 I
 want
 to
 say
 that


like
 so
 many
 good
 things
 in
 life
 are


downstream
 of
 authentic
 curiosity.


>> And
 I
 love
 that
 that's
 the
 way
 that


you've
 done
 this,
 you
 know,
 cuz
 it's
 not


some
 big
 brain
 sort
 of
 galaxy
 mind


predicting
 the
 future
 thing.
 just
 like


what
 gives
 me
 energy.


>> That's
 right.
 Yeah.
 That's
 that's
 the


whole
 thing
 is
 um
 I
 remember
 Michael


Arrington
 way
 back
 in
 the
 day
 I
 was
 on


going
 on
 he
 was
 interviewing
 me
 on


Techrunch
 Disrupt
 and
 this
 was
 probably


like
 20
 years
 ago
 and
 he's
 like
 hey
 I


want
 you
 to
 like
 talk
 about
 your


investment
 like
 why
 how
 are
 you
 good
 at


picking
 these
 things
 and
 I
 was
 like
 I


don't
 know
 it's
 like
 kind
 of
 based
 on
 my


gut
 and
 what
 I'm
 excited
 about.
 He's


like
 dude
 you
 got
 to
 have
 a
 better


answer
 than
 that.
 Like
 that's
 what
 he


told
 me
 before
 we
 went
 on
 stage.
 I'm


like
 it's
 not
 a
 magical
 formula.
 It
 is


like
 intuition,


especially
 at
 the
 early
 stage.


Especially
 when
 it's
 awkward
 cuz
 if
 it


looks
 awkward,
 it's
 going
 to
 be


contrarian.
 No
 one's
 going
 to
 want
 to
 do


that
 weird
 thing.
 Like
 those
 are
 the


hardest
 deals
 to
 do.
 But
 you
 know,
 it's


funny
 like
 I
 was
 talking
 to
 I
 think
 it


was
 Reed
 and
 and
 David
 over
 at
 Greylock


back
 in
 the
 day
 and
 they
 said
 their
 best


investments
 were
 the
 ones
 that
 were
 the


most
 contentious
 internally
 because


people
 don't
 see
 it.
 Not
 everyone
 sees


it.
 And
 that's
 okay.
 That's
 actually
 a


positive
 signal
 because
 many
 people
 are


like,
 "That
 will
 never
 work."
 But
 guess


what?
 But
 when
 it
 does,
 it
 changes
 the


world.


>> Well,
 what's
 remarkable
 is
 anybody
 who's


got
 nothing
 to
 lose
 can
 be
 embarrassed


and
 be
 willing
 to
 be
 embarrassed.
 But


once
 you
 have
 something
 to
 lose,
 you


know,
 you're
 a
 person
 that
 people
 know


and
 trust,
 the
 natural
 human
 instinct
 is


to
 be
 more
 cautious
 and
 to
 take
 less


risk
 around
 being
 embarrassed.
 And


because
 you've
 consistently
 been
 at
 the


edge,
 maybe
 because
 of
 this,
 you
 know,


authentic
 curiosity,
 you've
 done
 it
 a


lot.
 And
 I
 think
 that's
 a
 real
 conscious


thing
 you've
 done,
 which
 is
 unusual.


>> But
 I've
 also
 lost
 a
 lot
 and
 and
 made


the
 wrong
 call.
 And
 I
 think
 that
 at
 the


end
 of
 the
 day
 when
 I
 when
 my
 kids
 look


back
 at
 my
 career
 and
 you
 know
 I
 have


them
 as
 my
 little
 proxies
 for
 the
 world


and
 they
 go
 out


>> I
 want
 them
 to
 look
 back
 on
 dad's
 career


and
 not
 say
 he
 was
 the
 best
 investor.


Not
 say
 he
 made
 the
 most
 money
 but
 look


back
 and
 say
 wow
 he
 took
 a
 lot
 of
 risk


and
 he
 was
 wrong
 a
 lot
 but
 you
 know what


he
 got
 to
 scratch
 every
 personal
 itch


that
 he
 had
 and
 try
 everything
 and
 he


was
 at
 the
 buffet
 and
 tried
 it
 all


because
 and
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 it
 failed.
 Most


of
 it
 failed,
 but
 that's
 okay
 because


what
 are
 we
 doing
 on
 this
 earth
 if
 we're


not
 trying
 crazy
 Do
 you
 know
 what


I
 mean?


>> 100%,
 dude.
 100%.


>> Um,
 so
 back
 to
 the
 thing
 that
 you
 said


was
 uh
 you
 wanted
 to
 debate
 out.
 What


was
 that?


>> Well,
 I
 want
 to
 quibble
 about
 your
 point


around
 CS
 degree
 because
 I
 actually


think
 this
 is
 a
 really
 really
 important


point.
 Um,


>> if
 you're
 somebody
 that
 goes
 to
 Stanford


or
 maybe
 Harvard
 or
 MIT,
 like
 those


people
 are
 leaning
 into
 CS
 degrees
 in
 a


big
 way.
 And
 unfortunately,
 I
 think
 this


story
 has
 gotten
 out
 into
 broader


society
 that
 CS
 is
 over,
 engineering
 is


over.
 Like,
 sure,
 being
 able
 to
 write
 a


certain
 kind
 of
 algorithm
 may
 be
 less


value
 than
 it
 was
 10
 years
 ago,
 but


being
 able
 to
 think
 technically
 is
 more


important
 than
 ever.
 And
 I
 think
 it


would
 be
 a
 real
 tragedy
 if
 especially


kids
 that
 go
 to,
 you
 know,
 nonvy
 league


schools
 decide
 not
 to
 do
 CS
 because
 CS


is
 over.
 I
 think
 the
 value
 of
 being


technical
 is
 higher
 than
 it's
 ever
 been.


And
 while
 the
 future
 technologists
 may


not
 be
 programming
 in
 the
 way
 that
 we


are,
 like
 they're
 going
 to
 do
 something


that
 needs
 that
 skill
 set.


>> I
 Well,
 I
 will
 say
 I
 think
 it's
 over.


The
 reason
 I
 think
 it's
 over
 is
 because


I
 would
 argue
 that
 creativity
 in
 the


future
 is
 going
 to
 be
 more
 important


than
 technical
 ability.


>> Mhm.


>> And
 it's
 it's
 the
 we
 don't
 need
 to
 teach


people
 SQL
 or
 or
 no
 one
 needs
 to
 learn


these
 things
 in
 school.
 Like
 what
 I'm


curious,
 let's
 crack
 that
 open
 a
 bit.


What
 do
 you
 believe
 that
 a
 techn


technical
 degree
 gives
 you
 that
 will
 be


useful
 a
 decade
 from
 now?


>> Well,
 look,
 I
 think
 one
 it's
 just


fluency,
 right?
 What
 is
 a
 distributed


system?
 What
 does
 that
 mean?
 What
 does


that


>> perhaps?
 Yeah,
 I
 think
 it's
 it's
 useful


to
 understand
 that
 as
 a
 mental
 model
 for


systems
 thinking,
 right?
 I
 think
 the


second
 thing
 is
 just
 general
 problem


solving
 like
 how
 do
 you
 go
 step
 by
 step


and
 solve
 a
 problem?
 How
 do
 you


understand
 how
 to
 explore
 a
 sort
 of


problem
 in
 design
 space?
 Where
 to
 sort


of
 take
 risk
 or
 be
 ambitious?
 where
 not


to
 like
 a
 lot
 of
 it
 is
 downstream
 of


mathematics
 and
 if
 you
 look
 at
 I
 went
 to


computer
 engineering
 in
 water
 like
 none


of
 the
 stuff
 I
 took
 away
 and
 in
 fact
 in


fact
 none
 of
 the
 things
 that
 we


typically
 studied
 was
 a
 programming


language
 right
 a
 lot
 of
 it
 was
 systems


thinking
 and
 I
 think
 the
 systems


thinking
 is
 actually
 really
 important


>> well
 that's
 really
 interesting
 because
 I


think
 that's
 different
 than
 a
 classic


CS3
 one
 of
 the
 things
 that
 I
 like
 about


some
 of
 these
 and
 they're
 largely
 kind


of
 more
 the
 on
 the
 vocational
 school


side
 of
 things
 when
 you
 hear
 about
 these


programs
 and
 how
 they've
 evolved
 it
 is


like
 training
 you
 to
 become
 an


entrepreneur
 which
 is
 full
 stack.


Building
 it,
 designing
 it,
 coding
 it,


shipping
 it
 that
 depth
 of
 knowledge


across
 the
 full
 stack
 which
 impacts


marketing,
 creativity,
 you
 know,
 hiring,


firing,
 like
 that
 full
 suite.


>> Yes.


>> Essential
 like
 it
 will
 of
 course
 be
 very


important
 in
 the
 future.
 I
 think
 that


just
 singular
 technical
 focus
 around,


you
 know,
 the
 code
 piece
 of
 it,
 that's


where
 I
 would
 like
 to
 see
 the
 degrees


like
 loosen
 up
 a
 little
 bit
 and
 kind
 of


be
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 holistic
 and


overarching
 because
 I
 don't
 think
 and


and
 don't
 get
 me
 wrong,
 there
 will
 be


technical
 challenges
 that
 we
 have
 in
 the


future,
 but
 I
 think
 if
 you
 get
 to
 scale


as
 an
 entrepreneur,


>> you
 will
 have
 plenty
 of
 everything
 to
 go


solve
 those
 challenges,
 right?


>> I
 think
 that's
 right.
 I
 mean
 I
 think


being
 a
 technologist
 and
 broadly


technology
 thinking
 sets
 you
 up
 to
 be
 a


good
 founder.
 I
 actually
 Elon's
 probably


run
 the
 most
 ambitious
 experiment
 on


this
 that
 is
 totally
 un
 under
 discussed


which
 is
 I
 think
 he
 typically
 has


technical
 people
 in
 every
 role


>> right


>> marketing
 comms
 you
 know
 you
 name
 it


there's
 a
 technical
 person
 there
 so
 I


really
 do
 think
 there's
 something
 in
 the


training
 that
 sets
 you
 up
 to
 be


successful
 in
 a
 lot
 of
 vocations
 which


is
 totally
 distinct
 from
 programming.


>> Yeah.
 What
 I
 look
 for
 in
 a
 founder
 is


someone
 that
 is
 kind
 of
 multi-disiplined


in
 some
 way
 because
 if
 you're
 too


technical
 then
 you
 don't
 understand
 like


I
 met
 a
 founder
 yesterday
 that
 um
 is


building
 a
 device
 that
 can
 kind
 of


listen
 to
 everything
 and
 another
 one
 of


these
 types
 of
 devices


>> and
 the
 the
 kind
 of
 angle
 of
 what
 they


were
 going
 after
 missed
 out
 on
 a
 lot
 of


the
 the
 social
 side
 of
 it
 like
 what
 it


means
 to
 be
 listened
 to
 the
 invasion
 of


privacy
 and
 what
 how
 to
 potentially


sidestep
 that
 they
 they
 were
 all


technical,
 all
 device
 focused.
 And
 I


feel
 like
 the
 future
 you
 have
 to
 have


that
 kind
 of
 full
 suite,
 you
 know,
 it's


it's
 it's
 not
 just
 any
 one
 discipline.


It's
 probably
 going
 to
 be
 a
 handful
 of


them.
 The
 orchestrator
 role,
 you
 know.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 It'll
 it'll
 be


interesting
 to
 see,
 you
 know,
 I
 also


think
 that
 there's
 value
 in
 ignoring
 I


don't
 know
 why
 I'm
 just
 arguing
 with
 you


here,
 but
 there's
 value
 in
 ignoring
 the


social
 norms.
 You
 know,
 a
 great
 example


of
 this
 is
 10
 years
 ago.
 It's
 so
 funny


looking
 at
 the
 mobile
 transition.
 So,
 I


remember
 it
 so
 distinctly.
 iPhone
 2007,


App
 Store
 in
 2008.
 When
 the
 App
 Store


came
 out,
 there
 were
 six
 million
 iPhones


in
 distribution,
 right?
 Not
 a
 lot.


Today,
 Chat
 GPT
 has
 800
 million


activives,
 right?
 We're
 not
 even
 3
 years


in.
 So,
 it's
 crazy
 the
 scale
 at
 which


these
 things
 grow.


>> If
 you
 look
 at
 the
 predictions
 from


2009,
 you
 can
 go
 read
 the
 blog
 post.


Like,
 no
 one
 knew
 what
 to
 do
 with
 the


technology.
 And
 the
 most
 consistent


prediction
 was
 location-based
 ads.


>> Like,
 that
 was
 the
 most
 ambitious
 thing


anyone
 could
 think
 of
 would
 happen
 with


mobile.


But
 one
 of
 the
 big
 predictions
 around


location
 was
 wow
 people
 don't
 want
 to


share
 their
 location.
 It's
 an


amongst
 the
 pundits
 about
 that.
 Fast


forward
 10
 years
 and
 every
 Gen
 Z,
 you


know,
 Zoomer
 shares
 their
 location
 with


all
 their
 friends
 and
 their
 exes
 and
 who


knows
 who.
 Like
 that
 moment
 of
 like


consumers
 feeling
 one
 way
 about
 location


to
 the
 sort
 of
 tipping
 point
 happened


very
 rapidly.
 So
 I
 I
 can't
 speak


specifically
 to
 what's
 going
 to
 happen


around,
 you
 know,
 being
 transcribed,
 but


I
 do
 think
 ignoring
 the
 social


conventions
 can
 be
 a
 really
 good


instinct
 for
 founders.


>> Yeah.
 The
 I
 I
 worry
 that
 um
 I
 worry


about
 this
 trend
 of
 of
 always
 recording


and
 and
 I
 I
 just
 feel
 like
 it
 Do
 you


believe
 that
 this
 is
 going
 to
 be


ubiquitous?
 Like
 do
 you
 feel
 like
 we're


always
 going
 to
 be
 recorded
 like
 the


future
 is
 one
 where
 you
 can't
 I
 mean


there
 will
 be
 safe
 spaces
 but
 you
 can't


largely
 find
 a
 safe
 space
 because
 every


meeting
 you
 go
 to
 every
 dinner
 you
 go
 to


like
 it
 it's
 always
 on.
 Look
 I
 think


that
 technology
 and
 social
 norms
 sort
 of


adapt
 to
 each
 other
 in
 lock
 step.
 So
 yes


I
 think
 there'll
 be
 more
 things
 recorded


and
 I
 also
 think
 that
 we'll
 develop
 new


social
 norms
 so
 that
 it
 can
 fit
 into
 our


world.
 Right?
 Technology
 is
 downstream


of
 what
 we
 need
 as
 a
 species
 in
 society


and
 we've
 always
 adjusted.
 You
 know,


we've
 always
 adjusted
 and
 I
 believe
 we


will
 again.
 And
 right
 now
 we're
 in
 this


awkward
 sort
 of
 transitionary
 period


where,
 you
 know,
 if
 you're
 in
 a
 bar
 in


New
 York,
 you're
 definitely
 getting


punched
 in
 the
 face
 for
 recording.
 At
 an


SF,
 like
 everyone's
 recording.
 So,
 it's


it's
 just
 a
 moment
 of
 transition
 where


society
 is
 not
 caught
 up
 with


technology.
 But
 I
 do
 think
 we're
 going


more
 in
 that
 direction
 than
 less.


>> Yeah,
 that's
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 hard
 one


to
 overcome.
 I'm
 telling
 you,
 I've
 I've


I've
 gotten
 Well,
 certainly
 on
 the


personal
 side,
 if
 you
 wear
 one
 of
 those


devices
 always
 recording
 with
 a
 partner


that
 don't
 fly.
 Um,
 on
 the
 professional


side,
 I've
 seen
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 ask
 you


to
 take
 it
 off,
 to
 put
 it
 away,
 you


know,
 and
 I
 I
 just
 uh
 but
 also
 I
 I
 have


to
 imagine,
 at least
 for
 me,
 I
 I
 enjoy


the
 rawness
 of
 an
 unrecorded


conversation
 because
 you
 will


>> put
 your
 toe
 and
 say
 things
 that
 are


probably
 more
 real
 that
 I
 would
 rather


have
 that
 conversation
 happen
 than


something
 that
 is
 just
 like,
 oh,
 let
 me


reference
 my
 notes
 and
 make
 sure
 that
 I


got
 that
 right,
 you
 know?


>> So,
 we're
 talking
 a
 lot
 about
 the
 kind


of,
 you
 know,
 how
 it
 changes
 thing
 for


the
 negative.
 We've
 got
 an
 amazing


portfolio
 company
 called
 Limitless.
 They


do
 this
 and
 like
 the
 benefit
 of
 having
 a


lot
 of
 those
 things
 like
 sometimes


you'll
 find
 yourself
 saying
 things
 you


didn't
 expect
 to
 say
 and
 they
 just
 get


lost
 in
 the
 ether.
 So
 the
 the
 benefit
 of


having
 that
 signal
 and
 having
 it
 less


maybe
 transcription
 focused
 and
 maybe


ideas
 focused,
 maybe
 vibes
 focused
 like


there's
 a
 form
 of
 kind
 of
 lossy


compression
 you
 can
 take
 with
 the
 ideas


>> that
 I
 think
 actually


>> it
 has
 to
 go
 there.
 I
 think
 the
 lossy


nature
 of
 it
 in
 for
 people
 that
 don't


know
 what
 we're
 talking
 about
 like
 a


lossless
 would
 be
 every
 word
 verbatim


record
 in
 a
 a
 diary
 somewhere
 that
 is


you
 know
 one
 hack
 away
 from
 our
 personal


conversation
 in
 the
 Uber
 being
 exposed


to
 everyone
 that
 bothers
 me
 because
 you


know
 as
 friendships
 and
 depth
 evolves


you're
 like
 hey
 this
 was
 a
 tough
 thing
 I


was
 going
 through
 or
 whatever
 it
 may
 be


and
 like
 the
 fact
 that
 that
 is
 somewhere


in
 the
 cloud
 is
 just
 bad
 I
 think
 it's


bad
 for
 for
 all
 sorts
 of
 reasons
 but


>> the
 idea
 of
 lossy


is
 interesting
 because
 you
 pick
 up


broader
 themes


>> and
 if
 you
 can
 pull
 emotional
 context


along
 for
 the
 ride
 where
 he
 says
 like


hey
 we
 noticed
 that
 Anishh
 was
 feeling


down
 about
 this.
 And
 I'm
 like,
 "Oh,
 let


me
 send
 him
 a
 little
 something
 to
 like


cheer
 him
 up
 because
 that
 was
 a
 great


like
 call
 back
 to
 our
 conversation,
 you


know."
 Totally.


>> That
 side
 of
 it
 is
 fascinating
 because


then
 I
 don't
 feel
 awkward
 having
 the


conversation
 especially
 if
 we
 can
 do


that
 on
 prem
 on
 device
 where
 you
 have
 a


small
 model
 running
 on
 device.
 It


doesn't
 pick
 up
 the
 fact
 that,
 you
 know,


I
 said
 this
 one
 thing
 that
 would
 be


hurtful
 out
 in
 a
 broader
 context,
 but
 it


is
 getting
 the
 emotional
 tone
 that
 is


surfaced
 back
 in
 a
 sentence
 that
 cannot


be
 connected
 directly
 to
 what
 I
 was


saying.


>> Yes,


>> love
 that
 idea.
 I
 hope
 it
 goes
 there.


>> I
 think
 it
 will.
 I
 think
 this
 is
 the


interplay
 between
 social
 dynamics
 and


technology.
 It's
 going
 to
 go
 there.


the
 Limitless
 device.
 I
 had
 it
 and
 I,


you
 know,
 I'm
 my
 dream
 feature


>> is
 they
 have
 a
 little
 LED
 on
 the
 outside


and
 there
 has
 been
 any
 number
 of
 times


when
 I
 had
 it
 on
 and
 people
 are
 like,


"Turn
 that
 thing
 off."
 And
 fine,
 that's


fair,
 right?
 Turn
 it
 off,
 whatever.


>> I
 want
 a
 mode
 where
 if
 it's
 red,
 it's


doing
 verbatim
 recording
 because
 there


are
 meetings
 where
 I
 want
 that
 to


happen,
 right?


>> If
 it's
 green,
 it's
 recording,
 but
 it's


themebased.
 So
 now
 I
 can
 have
 that


personal
 intimate
 conversation.
 I
 know


it's
 happening
 on
 device.
 I'll
 never


those,
 you
 know,
 more
 intimate
 words


will
 never
 be
 leaked
 online,
 but
 then
 I


know
 where
 I
 stand
 with
 you,
 right?


Because
 and
 I
 think
 that's
 so
 important


to
 know
 like,
 oh,
 what
 we're
 having
 is


going
 to
 remain
 largely
 confidential.
 It


might
 pick
 up
 some
 themes,
 but
 it's


never
 going
 to
 be
 damning
 to
 me.


>> That's
 so
 interesting.
 I
 mean,
 and


that's
 exactly
 it,
 right?
 A
 visual
 cue,


>> right?
 Has
 to
 be


>> confidential
 model,
 you
 know,
 and
 that's


not
 a
 technology
 problem.
 That's
 a


product
 design
 problem,


>> right?


>> I
 think
 we're
 going
 to
 solve
 it.


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 that's
 exciting.


>> Yeah.


>> Um
 because
 I
 certainly
 believe
 that


especially
 with
 our
 brains
 as
 we
 get


older,
 having
 that
 additional,
 you
 know,


being
 able
 to
 jump
 back
 in
 context
 and


finding
 some
 of
 that
 information.


>> Although
 I
 did
 use
 it,
 I
 tell
 you,
 I


used
 it
 with
 Daria
 one
 time
 where
 she


told
 me
 she
 had
 said
 something
 and
 I


pulled
 up
 the
 transcript.


>> I
 got
 I
 keep
 shooting
 myself
 in
 the


foot.


>> That
 is
 a
 no
 way.


>> No
 way.
 Cuz
 you
 you
 pull
 it
 up
 and
 you


paste
 it
 and
 it's
 the
 last
 time
 you
 wear


the
 device.


>> You
 you
 there
 is
 no
 end.
 That's
 when
 you


just
 go
 limp
 and
 take
 the
 pain.


>> Well,
 brother,
 this
 has
 been
 great.
 It


is
 so
 great
 to
 have
 you.
 Anything
 else


you
 wanted
 to
 touch
 on
 before
 we
 wrap


things
 up?
 Now,
 I
 absolutely
 had
 a


blast.
 Let's
 keep
 talking.


>> Yeah,
 let's
 keep
 doing
 this.
 It's
 good


to
 get
 together
 every
 so
 often,
 hash
 out


these
 things,
 talk
 about
 the
 future.


>> Um
 what
 what's
 uh
 where
 can
 people
 find


you
 online
 socially?


>> I'm
 at
 um
 on
 Twitter,
 illscience.
 Um
 we


can
 talk
 about
 that
 another
 time,
 the


genesis
 of
 that
 name.
 Um
 and
 you
 can


always
 get
 me
 at
 anish
 16Z.


>> Awesome.


>> So,
 hit
 me.
 I
 want
 to
 know
 what
 you're


working
 on.
 You
 know,
 send
 me
 things


that
 you
 actually
 have
 made.
 That's


always
 the
 best
 way
 to
 engage
 with
 us.


best
 way
 by
 far.


>> But
 generally,
 I'm
 just
 I'm
 excited
 to


be
 out
 there
 and
 thrilled
 to
 be
 here


with
 you,
 Kev.
 Thank
 you.


>> Awesome.
 Yeah.
 Kevin
 Rose
 on
 Twitter
 X.


I
 still
 get
 confused.
 I
 call
 it
 Twitter


on
 X
 and
 uh
 Yeah.
 Awesome.
 Let's
 do
 this


again
 soon.


>> Thanks
 for
 a
 fun
 session.


>> Yeah.


>> All
 right,
 man.
