[Music]


hi
 everyone
 I'm
 Nicola
 tangan
 the
 CEO
 of


noras
 Bank
 investment
 management
 and


today
 we're
 diving
 into
 the
 Magical


World
 of
 Disney
 a
 company
 where
 we
 are


the
 lucky
 owner
 or
 more
 than
 1%
 and
 I'm


here
 with
 Bob
 Iger
 the
 Visionary
 leader


who
 transformed
 Disney
 into
 a
 global


entertainment
 Powerhouse
 leading
 Bold


Acquisitions
 like
 Pixar
 marel
 and
 21st


century
 FKS
 Bob
 warm
 welcome
 thank
 you


very
 much
 nice
 to
 be
 here
 no
 I
 think
 no


other
 company
 has
 made
 so
 many
 people


love


and
 cry
 over
 more
 than
 a
 hundred
 years


so
 in
 your
 mind
 what
 is
 it
 that
 makes


Disney
 so
 special
 well
 I
 think
 first
 of


all
 the
 fact
 that
 we've
 touched
 people's


hearts
 for
 as
 you
 cited
 over
 a
 hundred


years
 uh
 is
 Meaningful
 because
 when
 you


tell
 stories
 that
 have
 the
 kind
 of


effect
 that
 our
 stories
 have
 on
 people


uh
 they
 become
 memorable
 they
 become
 you


know
 part
 of
 the
 fabric
 of
 people's


lives
 uh
 and
 there
 are
 also
 stories
 that


are
 frequently
 shared
 with
 other
 people


so
 you
 have
 a
 basically
 a
 number
 of


people
 enjoying
 our
 stories
 together
 and


that
 also
 I
 think
 compounds
 the
 impact


of
 our
 storytelling
 uh
 We've
 also
 you


know
 managed
 to
 um
 stick
 to
 our
 core


values
 and
 I
 think
 that's
 really


important
 you
 know
 what
 you're
 going
 to


get
 when
 you
 see
 the
 name
 Disney
 on
 a


product
 and
 I
 think
 that
 goes
 a
 long
 way


to
 enabling
 us
 to
 be
 relevant
 for
 over
 a


century
 so
 how
 does
 he
 feel
 to
 run
 a


company
 which
 is
 kind
 of
 part
 of
 the


fabric
 of
 human
 history
 well
 it
 is


certainly
 something
 that
 I'm
 aware
 of


because
 with
 it
 comes
 a
 responsibility


not
 just
 to
 uh
 maintain
 and
 to
 continue


to
 strengthen
 the
 legacy
 of
 the
 company


but
 also
 to
 entertain
 at
 the
 highest


level
 of
 quality
 there's
 such
 an


expectation
 from
 our
 consumers
 around


the
 world
 that
 you
 have
 to
 live
 up
 to


and
 at
 times
 even
 work
 to
 exceed


expectations
 and
 I
 think
 with
 that
 again


comes
 I
 wouldn't
 call
 it
 a
 burden


because
 it's
 it's
 a
 responsibility
 that


we
 all
 eagerly
 accept
 but
 we're


certainly
 well
 aware
 of
 our
 uh
 need
 to


serve
 consumers
 expectations
 why
 do
 you


think
 we're
 still
 so
 drawn
 to
 these


imaginary
 worlds
 well
 as
 Walt
 Disney


used
 to
 say
 you
 know
 people
 often
 uh


like
 to
 uh
 e
 either
 experience
 things
 or


or
 or
 or
 hear
 stories
 told
 that
 enables


them
 to
 essentially
 distance
 themselves


from
 kind
 of
 their
 daily
 lives
 and
 their


daily
 responsibilities
 there's
 a
 there's


an
 Escapist
 quality
 but
 I
 think
 in
 many


other
 respects
 with
 Disney
 stories
 you


know
 there
 are
 there
 are
 things
 like
 uh


relatability
 uh
 common
 experiences
 that


are
 reflected
 in
 our
 storytelling
 uh


there's
 the
 whole
 notion
 of
 fantasy
 and


igniting
 people's
 imagination
 and


creating
 magic
 um
 there's
 also
 I
 think


something
 that's
 very
 very
 unique
 to


Disney
 and
 that
 is
 that
 we
 make
 things


that
 can
 be
 uh
 enjoyed
 by
 multiple


Generations
 all
 at
 once
 if
 you
 go
 to
 our


theme
 parks
 you
 see
 that
 grandparents


and
 parents
 and
 and
 their
 children
 for


instance
 uh
 time
 and
 time
 again
 and
 I


think
 that
 is
 very
 very
 unique
 in
 terms


of
 the
 uh
 way
 in
 which
 people
 engage


with
 the
 product
 that
 we
 create
 is
 that


something
 you
 have
 to
 do
 more
 and
 more


to
 build
 in
 appealing
 things
 for
 several


Generations
 It
 just
 strikes
 me
 when
 I


watch
 you
 know
 things
 like
 Finding
 Nemo


you
 have
 built
 in
 so
 many
 uh
 so
 many


layers
 of
 complexity
 that
 appeals
 to
 so


many
 different
 type
 of
 people
 you
 know


we
 we
 try
 to
 essentially
 uh
 tell
 stories


that
 are
 as
 accessible
 as
 possible
 and


that
 best
 reflect
 the
 world
 that
 uh
 we


are
 telling
 stories
 to
 I
 think
 that's


that's
 really
 quite
 critical
 and
 why
 do


you
 think
 so
 a
 common
 denominator
 here


is
 like
 you
 know
 the
 underdog
 who
 wants


to
 become
 a
 hero
 yes
 I
 think
 that
 you


know
 many
 aspects
 of
 our
 storytelling


that
 resonates
 one
 of
 is
 what
 I


basically
 multigenerational
 experience


another
 is
 just
 the
 fact
 that
 we
 try
 to


tell
 stories
 where
 we
 show
 respect
 for


elders
 as
 a
 for
 instance
 you
 certainly


saw
 that
 in
 like
 a
 movie
 like
 up
 by


Pixar
 or
 coco
 which
 was
 also
 a
 Pixar


movie
 we
 like
 Heroes
 Journeys
 we
 know


that
 people
 love
 to
 both
 root
 for
 the


underdog
 but
 also
 cheer
 on
 the
 hero
 as


the
 hero
 is
 you
 know
 basically
 going
 on


some
 Adventure
 or
 seeking
 to
 conquer


evil
 you
 name
 it
 I
 think
 the
 hero's


journey
 is
 a
 very
 very
 important
 part
 of


it
 we
 also
 like
 to
 infuse
 in
 our
 stories


the
 importance
 not
 just
 a
 family
 but
 a


friendship
 really
 important
 uh
 and
 also


elements
 of
 of
 great
 surprise
 but
 I


think
 more
 than
 anything
 else
 stories


that
 create
 a
 sense
 of
 wonder
 that
 make


people
 people
 uh
 smile
 feel
 happy
 uh
 and


feel
 good
 about
 the
 world
 that
 they
 live


in
 do
 you
 feel
 that
 you
 have
 a


responsibility
 to
 promote
 positive


values
 as
 a
 firm
 very
 much
 so
 yes
 I


think
 and
 I
 I
 don't
 view
 it
 as
 a
 burden


but
 I
 do
 view
 it
 as
 critical
 in
 terms
 of


you
 know
 maintaining
 the
 strength
 and


the
 legacy
 of
 of
 Disney
 um
 and
 and
 that


is
 basically
 to
 be
 really
 responsible
 in


how
 we
 tell
 stories
 how
 we
 you
 know


depict
 situations
 or
 characters
 uh
 or
 or


just
 general
 circumstances
 very
 very


important
 yes
 there's
 a
 lot
 of


responsibility
 that
 comes
 with
 just


putting
 the
 Disney
 name
 on
 something


that
 we've
 created
 so
 so
 um
 you
 created


these
 incredible
 um
 characters
 which
 are


so
 important
 for
 for
 our
 culture
 and
 in


a
 way
 it's
 a
 bit
 like
 you
 know
 the
 music


history
 where
 some
 people
 control
 you


know
 the
 back
 cataloges
 is
 it
 do
 you


think
 it's
 right
 that
 one
 company
 should


own
 it
 or
 should
 it
 belong
 to
 humankind


or
 just
 what
 do
 you
 think
 well
 that's
 an


interesting
 question
 well
 obviously
 we


have
 to
 serve
 both
 our
 customers
 and
 our


shareholders
 uh
 and
 when
 we
 put
 our


shareholders
 add-on
 owning
 is
 critical


because
 that
 gives
 us
 the
 ability
 to


obviously
 um
 monetize
 or
 or
 capitalize


financially
 on
 great


creativity
 um
 I
 don't
 think
 we
 have
 a


monopoly
 on
 it
 by
 the
 way
 there
 are
 many


in
 particularly
 in
 today's
 world
 thanks


to
 technology
 um
 almost
 everyone's
 a


Creator
 but
 there's
 more
 that
 is
 being


created
 so
 there's
 more
 competition
 than


ever
 before
 so
 I
 don't
 feel
 feel
 that
 we


in
 any
 way
 you
 know
 have
 cornered
 the


market
 on
 this
 I
 think
 we
 are
 leader
 in


terms
 of
 Storytelling
 in
 the
 world
 but
 I


don't
 think
 we've
 cornered
 the
 market
 if


we
 um
 touch
 on
 the
 culture
 at
 Disney
 how


much
 is
 left
 of
 uh
 Walt
 in
 the
 Disney


Company
 well
 that's
 a
 very
 very
 good


question
 uh
 by
 the
 way
 his
 office
 still


exists
 you
 never
 met
 him
 right
 he
 died


in
 the
 no
 he
 died
 in
 in
 the
 mid-60s
 in


1966
 I
 joined
 uh
 the
 company
 in
 well
 was


ABC
 then


1974
 uh
 became
 Disney
 we
 were
 acquired


by
 by
 Disney
 in
 the
 90s
 now
 I
 never
 met


Walt
 uh
 by
 the
 way
 I
 meet
 people


occasionally
 that
 did
 uh
 just
 by
 the
 way


last
 week
 I
 was
 at
 Disneyland
 and
 I
 met


an
 employee
 that
 had
 been
 with
 a
 company


for
 62
 years
 wow
 and
 when
 I
 asked
 him


what
 the
 highlight
 of
 his
 career
 was
 he


said
 having
 lunch
 with
 Walt
 Disney
 of


course
 then
 I
 sat
 down
 with
 him
 and


wanted
 to
 know
 all
 about
 it
 because
 I'm


always
 very
 curious
 about
 Walt
 I
 think


Walt
 you
 know
 obviously
 is
 responsible


for
 creating
 you
 know
 what
 Disney
 was


and
 in
 many
 respects
 what
 Disney
 is


which
 is
 this
 fondness
 for
 storytelling


telling
 and
 the
 knowledge
 of
 how


valuable
 and
 how
 important
 it
 can
 be
 in


the
 world
 I
 think
 he
 was
 aware
 as
 I
 am


aware
 that
 uh
 the
 world
 needs
 great


storytelling
 it
 could
 argue
 that
 maybe


today
 that
 need
 is
 greater
 than
 ever


before
 and
 serving
 a
 World's
 need
 to
 be


entertained
 at
 the
 highest
 level
 and
 to


be
 to
 hear
 and
 experience
 stories
 at
 the


highest
 level
 I
 think
 is
 a
 is
 a
 worthy


cause
 and
 we
 still
 adhere
 to
 that


principle
 of
 high
 value


infused
 in
 our
 storytelling
 of
 the


knowledge
 that
 you
 know
 we
 our
 sole


purpose
 really
 our
 main
 purpose
 is
 to


tell
 great
 stories
 that
 touch
 people's


hearts
 and
 Inspire
 them
 uh
 all
 over
 the


world
 um
 so
 in
 many
 respects
 it
 hasn't


Walt's
 Legacy
 still
 exists
 the
 other


thing
 that
 still
 exists
 is
 Walt
 was
 I


know
 you
 want
 to
 talk
 about
 this
 as
 it


relates
 to
 technology
 but
 Walt
 loved
 the


use
 of
 Technology
 uh
 in
 in
 terms
 of


enabling
 him
 to
 tell
 better
 stories
 and


embrace
 technology


um
 readily
 to
 do
 that
 and
 that
 to
 serve


the
 purpose
 of
 the
 Storyteller
 that


Spirit
 still
 very
 much
 exists
 at
 the


company
 as
 well
 he
 also
 was
 a
 great
 risk


taker
 and
 uh
 the
 in
 in
 today's
 world
 but


maybe
 you
 could
 argue
 in
 in
 Walt's
 world


too
 you
 know
 taking
 risks
 becomes
 a


critical
 part
 of
 of
 of
 a
 business


particularly
 in
 a
 world
 that's
 changing


so
 fast
 and
 being
 so
 disrupted
 what
 do


you
 think
 he
 would
 have
 made
 of
 today's


technology
 as
 as
 far
 as
 I
 have
 been
 told


by
 people
 who
 knew
 him
 and
 from


everything
 that
 I
 have
 read
 and
 I've


certainly
 read
 just
 about
 every
 history


book
 on
 Walton
 on
 the
 Disney
 Company
 he


just
 loved
 technology
 it
 he
 was
 he
 had
 a


first
 of
 all
 he
 had
 a
 a
 wonderfully


curious
 mind
 which
 is
 also
 very
 critical


by
 the
 way
 and
 I
 think
 with
 that
 he


wanted
 to
 learn
 experiment
 practice


discover
 particularly
 how
 technology


ultimately
 can
 enable
 him
 to
 tell
 better


stories
 uh
 it
 just
 excited
 him
 greatly


and
 I
 always
 exhort
 people
 to
 basically


follow
 the
 similar
 path
 so
 I
 think
 he


would
 be
 really
 I
 think
 motivated
 in


many
 respects
 by
 technology
 today
 and


not
 daunted
 by
 it
 I
 think
 he
 was
 one
 who


believed
 when
 he
 saw
 or
 heard
 about


technology
 he
 immediately
 saw


opportunity
 instead
 of
 threat
 and
 um
 he


view
 technology
 as
 an
 asset
 not
 a


liability
 and
 I've
 tried
 really
 hard
 for


that
 to
 be
 an
 element
 of
 the
 Disney


culture
 the
 Embrace
 of
 Technology
 uh
 and


the
 ability
 to
 try
 and


experiment
 with
 the
 application
 of


technology
 in
 all
 of
 our
 businesses
 now


you
 say
 things
 like
 dream
 big
 anything


can
 happen
 now
 uh
 these
 are
 uh
 in
 a
 way


uh
 quite
 American
 values
 do
 you
 think


the
 company
 could
 ever
 have
 been
 founded


in
 Europe
 what
 was
 inspired
 is
 some
 of


his
 earliest
 greatest
 stories
 were


inspired
 by
 the
 great
 European


storytellers
 of
 the
 brothers
 grim
 and
 H


Christian
 Anderson
 for
 instance
 so
 I
 I


think
 he
 had
 a
 respect
 he
 he
 also
 he


liked
 to
 travel
 and
 he
 traveled
 around


Europe
 and
 in
 many
 respects
 some
 things


that
 he
 built
 at
 Disneyland
 came
 from


his
 inspiration
 the
 inspiration
 that
 he


got
 through


traveling
 um
 and
 learning
 about
 cultures


and
 learning
 about
 places
 and
 and


wanting
 the
 world
 to
 feel
 like
 a
 one


world
 instead
 of
 a
 basically
 a
 a
 world


that
 was
 you
 know
 completely
 completely


broken
 up
 what's
 the
 key
 to
 managing


creative
 genuses
 empathy
 is
 the
 biggest


key
 um
 you
 have
 to
 understand
 that
 uh


when
 a
 Creator
 um
 has
 has
 pitched
 you
 a


great
 story
 and
 and
 you've
 given
 them


the
 ability
 to
 go
 out
 and
 tell
 that


story
 you've
 given
 them
 the
 resources


the
 the
 the
 money
 the
 tools
 the
 place
 to


tell
 that
 story
 um
 that
 story
 is
 often


coming
 from
 within
 them
 it's
 a
 passion


of
 theirs
 it
 is
 the
 invention
 of
 their


own
 mind
 and
 their
 own
 heart
 and
 you


have
 to
 understand
 then
 just
 how


delicate
 it
 is
 to
 to
 manage
 someone
 who


is
 essentially
 um
 creating
 something


that
 comes
 from
 within
 them
 that
 is


inherently


theirs
 uh
 and
 while
 we
 have
 a


responsibility
 on
 behalf
 of
 the
 company


to
 make
 sure
 that
 they're
 telling
 their


stories
 right
 and
 and
 and
 and
 they're


pursuing
 the
 extent
 possible
 perfection


in
 terms
 of
 Storytelling
 and
 that


sometimes
 requires
 us
 to
 lean
 on
 them


more
 in
 order
 to
 get
 the
 results
 that
 we


want
 you
 have
 to
 always
 do
 so
 by
 putting


yourself
 in
 their
 shoes
 that's
 the
 most


critical
 and
 then
 also
 understanding


that
 creativity
 is
 not
 something
 that's


reduced
 to
 math
 or
 science
 it's


extremely
 unpredictable
 there's
 an


inherent
 risk
 involved
 in
 all
 creativity


and
 therefore
 you
 have
 to
 know
 not
 just


how
 to
 un
 under
 not
 just
 how
 to


appreciate
 success
 that
 great
 creativity


can
 generate
 but
 also
 to
 process


basically
 the
 failures
 and
 not
 point


fingers
 and
 not
 second
 yes
 um
 and
 not
 be


ultra
 critical
 when
 a
 creative
 idea


fails
 so
 um
 creative
 people
 go
 through


these
 creative
 Spurs
 right
 and
 they
 can


last
 for
 some
 time
 and
 then
 you
 go


through
 a
 slower
 period
 what
 do
 you
 do


when
 people
 kind
 of
 go
 through
 periods


where
 there
 is
 no
 creativity
 coming
 out


how
 long
 time
 do
 you
 give
 them
 before


you
 expect
 to
 see
 more
 it's
 a
 good


that's
 a
 good
 question
 you
 know
 I'm
 a


big
 believer
 in
 in
 uh
 in
 in
 giving


people
 second
 chances
 for
 what
 I'll
 call


Honest
 mistakes
 and
 not
 giving
 people


Second
 Chances
 when
 you
 know
 there's
 a


transgression
 a
 complete
 lapse
 of


judgment
 or
 in
 some
 form
 or
 another
 a


breakdown
 of
 Integrity
 when
 it
 comes
 to


creativity
 I
 think
 you
 you
 know


everyone's
 had
 a
 failure
 at
 some
 point


in
 their
 lives
 if
 they're
 a
 Creator
 I


don't
 care
 who
 they
 are
 and
 um
 and
 then


you
 know
 that
 includes
 you
 know
 great


composers
 and
 and
 great
 artists
 and
 you


name
 it
 great
 singers
 have
 had
 bad
 songs


and
 Painters
 have
 had
 bad
 pictures
 and
 I


could
 go
 on
 and
 on
 uh
 but
 sometimes
 that


just
 right
 after
 a
 big
 failure
 comes
 a


huge
 hit
 and
 I
 so
 I
 try
 to
 be
 patient


with
 people
 that
 are
 creating
 that
 that


deliver
 something
 that
 is
 less
 than
 we


we
 had
 hoped
 for
 or
 expected
 now
 if
 it


persists
 obviously
 U
 if
 if
 someone
 has


essentially
 completely
 lost
 their


creative
 way
 then
 obviously
 you
 you
 tend


not
 to
 not
 to
 allow
 them
 to
 create
 again


on
 your
 behalf
 who's
 the
 most
 creative


person
 you
 ever
 met


oh
 I've
 been
 really
 fortunate
 in
 my
 life


to
 have
 met
 uh
 some
 wonderfully
 creative


people
 from
 artist
 to
 animators
 to


performers
 um
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 I
 could
 I


don't
 know
 if
 I
 could
 name
 just
 one
 um


but
 I've
 met
 many
 and
 I'm
 lucky
 in
 that


regard
 you
 i'
 including
 you
 know
 I
 could


argue
 you
 know
 Paul
 McCartney
 for


instance
 is
 one
 of
 the
 most
 creative


people
 I've
 ever
 met
 as
 for
 instance


Steven
 Spielberg
 would
 would
 would


easily
 you
 know
 be
 another
 one
 great


people
 that
 work
 at
 Disney
 I
 don't
 want


to
 single
 any
 one
 of
 those
 out
 because
 I


have
 so
 many
 of
 them
 but
 I've
 been
 lucky


in
 my
 life
 particularly
 in
 this
 job
 to


have
 not
 only
 met
 but
 have
 actually
 done


business
 with
 or
 been
 engaged
 with
 some


of
 the
 great
 creators
 of
 our
 time
 I
 mean


you're
 Wily
 considered
 um
 one
 of
 the


most
 successful
 cosos
 but
 are
 you
 are


you
 yourself
 creative
 uh
 I
 don't


consider
 myself
 a
 Creator
 I
 consider


myself
 someone
 that
 uh
 loves
 creativity


that
 appreciates
 it
 that
 for
 the
 most


part
 I
 think
 I
 I
 know
 good
 from
 bad
 I


know
 when
 I
 see
 something
 and
 it's


really
 good
 or
 great
 and
 I
 know
 when
 I


see
 something
 that
 isn't
 I
 think
 I
 put


myself
 more
 in
 an
 editor's
 category
 than


in
 a
 Creator
 category
 where
 I
 can
 uh
 you


know
 lend
 a
 an
 eye
 uh
 hopefully
 an


objective
 eye
 to
 some
 piece
 of


creativity
 and
 and
 give
 input
 um
 as
 more


an
 editor
 than
 anything
 else
 uh
 to
 the


Creator
 to
 help
 them
 um
 improve
 the


quality
 of
 their
 creation
 but
 I'm
 not
 a


Creator
 now
 um
 there
 is
 a
 lot
 of
 money


going
 into
 new
 production
 they're
 very


expensive
 right
 they
 are
 complex
 uh
 big


expectations
 and
 so
 on
 uh
 big
 committees


uh
 these
 um
 processes
 and
 projects
 are


they
 producing
 the
 same
 type
 of


excitement
 and
 creativity
 as
 before
 is


the
 whole
 thing
 just
 becoming
 more


committee
 based
 predictable
 dollar
 what


do
 you


think
 well
 I
 certain
 would
 object
 to
 to


that
 um
 first
 of
 all
 uh
 we
 try
 not
 to


approach
 creativity
 on
 a
 committee
 basis


there
 there
 are
 often
 you
 know
 different


voices
 that
 that
 weigh
 in
 on
 it
 but
 in


the
 end
 it's
 a
 it's
 typically
 one


Creator's
 voice
 that
 has
 to
 basically


rule
 the
 day
 I
 don't
 think
 you
 can


create
 by
 committee
 at
 all
 nor
 can
 you


create
 by
 checking
 boxes
 meaning
 for


someone's
 creativity
 does
 it
 meet
 all


these
 standards
 because
 then
 you
 get


surprised
 by
 something
 or
 or
 or
 does
 it


meet
 all
 this
 criteria
 you
 get
 surprised


by
 something
 that
 may
 not
 but
 is
 equally


good
 um
 so
 I
 don't
 like
 committee


approach
 to
 it
 at
 all
 I
 think
 in
 this


world
 where
 so
 much
 is
 being
 created
 uh


I
 don't
 one
 while
 one
 could
 argue
 it


kind
 of
 duded
 the
 quality
 of


creativity
 um
 I
 think
 could
 also
 argue


that
 today's
 technology
 mostly
 to


produce
 and
 distribute
 creativity
 is
 you


know
 so
 much
 more
 um
 uh
 powerful
 than


yesterday's
 that
 it's
 enabling
 much
 more


creativity
 and
 not
 less
 now
 maybe
 the


quality
 is
 is
 diluted
 a
 bit
 because
 so


much
 more
 is
 being
 made
 but
 I
 I
 still


see
 examples
 constantly
 of
 of
 wonderful


creativity
 and
 just
 you
 thinking
 about


our
 company
 uh
 inside
 out
 too
 would
 be
 a


great
 example
 of
 that
 and
 by
 the
 way


that's
 a
 sequel
 to
 a
 movie
 that
 was
 made


you
 know
 nine
 or
 10
 years
 ago
 um


fantastically
 creative
 and
 very


successful
 commercially
 as
 well
 a
 film
 a


Shogun
 a
 TV
 series
 uh
 that
 we
 produced


as
 a
 for
 instance
 incredibly
 creative
 uh


Deadpool
 and
 Wolverine
 a
 Marvel
 movie


extremely
 creative
 um
 and
 I
 could
 go
 on


and
 on
 so
 um
 I
 don't
 worry
 about
 uh
 a


world
 in
 which
 creativity
 is
 more
 dull


or
 or
 U
 more
 diluted
 there's
 still
 so


many
 creative
 geniuses
 in
 this
 world
 and


I
 don't
 think
 in
 any
 way
 the
 world
 today


is
 is
 reducing
 the
 number
 of
 creative


Geniuses
 I
 might
 argue
 that
 is
 it
 is
 is


bringing
 out
 uh
 their
 their
 genius


because
 technology
 has
 enabled
 more


people
 to
 create
 than
 ever
 before
 and
 to


put
 their
 creativity
 into
 other
 people's


hands
 now
 you've
 been
 first
 at
 ABC
 but


then
 in
 the
 whole
 kind
 of
 Disney
 company


for
 50
 years
 are
 you
 able
 to
 predict


going
 to
 be
 good
 or
 bad
 and
 and
 and
 then


when
 was
 the
 last
 time
 you
 were
 really


surprised
 either
 that
 something
 failed


that
 you
 thought
 was
 going
 to
 be


fantastic
 or
 the
 opposite
 occasionally
 I


see
 something
 that's
 really
 good
 that


ends
 up
 surprising
 me
 on
 the
 upside


because
 it
 resonates
 a
 lot
 more
 than


even
 I
 thought
 it
 might
 for
 some
 reason


um
 that
 happens
 more
 often
 than
 the


opposite
 than
 seeing
 something
 that


failed
 where
 I
 didn't
 think
 it
 would


fail
 but
 as
 we
 get
 as
 we
 get
 older
 Are


we
 more
 are
 we
 Less
 in
 tune
 with
 with


the
 general
 public
 well
 one
 of
 the


things
 that
 we
 get
 paid
 to
 do
 in
 these


jobs
 is
 to
 stay
 in
 tune
 I
 guess
 you


could
 argue
 that
 the
 older
 you
 get
 the


harder
 it
 is
 but
 I
 tried
 so
 I
 don't
 I


don't
 I
 mean
 a
 good
 a
 good


executive
 meaning
 good
 at
 managing


creativity
 and
 good


at
 enabling


creators
 um


H
 has
 done
 a
 a
 lot
 of
 work
 to
 keep
 their


finger
 on
 kind
 of
 the
 pulse
 of
 the
 world


and
 while
 I
 don't
 consider
 myself
 the


world's
 greatest
 expert
 on
 today's


culture
 I
 certainly
 have
 a
 number
 of


touch
 points
 into
 the
 culture
 that


enable
 me
 to
 understand
 and
 appreciate


it
 more
 by
 the
 way
 some
 of
 it
 is


personal
 I
 have
 five
 grandchildren
 where


the
 oldest
 is
 eight
 and
 the
 the
 youngest


is
 eight
 and
 the
 oldest
 is
 16
 as
 if
 for


instance
 just
 spending
 time
 with
 them
 uh


we
 also
 have
 Generations
 people
 working


for
 the
 company
 I'm
 73
 years
 old
 and


been
 around
 50
 years
 I
 engage
 with


people
 at
 the
 company
 that
 are
 50
 years


younger
 than
 I
 am
 that
 are
 closer
 to


today's
 culture
 than
 I
 am
 but
 I
 also


make
 it
 a
 part
 of
 my
 daily
 routine


really
 to
 access
 I'll
 call
 it
 new


culture
 um
 you
 know
 and
 I
 whether
 it's


watching
 um
 you
 know
 short
 form
 videos


or
 user
 generated
 content
 or
 engaging
 in


Social
 platforms
 trying
 to
 m
 contain


relevance
 or
 we're
 trying
 to
 understand


really
 what
 is
 what
 resonates
 to
 in


today's
 world
 um
 you
 know
 I
 think
 it's


critical
 that
 that
 that
 our
 product


resonates
 as
 well
 and
 sometimes
 it


obviously
 or
 often
 it
 requires
 us
 to
 be


you
 know
 really
 aware
 of
 um
 consumer


Trends
 consumer
 interests
 and
 uh
 and
 and


disruption
 in
 terms
 of
 people's
 tastes


and
 uh
 how
 people
 are
 spending
 their


time
 being
 entertained
 Bob
 um
 what
 makes


a
 great
 leader
 well
 I
 think
 there
 are
 a


number
 of
 things
 that
 um
 you
 know
 that


that
 go
 into
 becoming
 or
 being
 a
 great


leader
 one
 I
 talked
 about
 a
 little
 bit


and
 that's
 having
 the
 ability
 to
 ba
 to


balance
 Heritage
 and
 Innovation
 um
 and


and
 I
 think
 that's
 critical
 it's
 knowing


basically
 um
 how
 to
 innovate
 uh
 even


though
 you
 know
 you're
 you're
 surrounded


in
 a
 way
 by
 by
 Legacy
 um
 that's
 really


important
 um
 similar
 in
 nature
 you
 have


to
 have
 a
 foot
 in
 the
 present
 and
 a
 foot


in
 the
 future
 at
 all
 times
 you
 have
 to


obviously
 spend
 time
 managing
 your


business
 for
 today
 make
 sure
 that
 it's


Peak
 quality
 uh
 efficiency
 Etc
 but
 you


also
 have
 to
 be
 looking
 around
 the


corner
 at
 what
 uh
 business
 opportunities


or
 where
 your
 business
 might
 go
 tomorrow


if
 you
 have
 two
 feet
 in
 the
 future
 then


you're
 not
 managing
 your
 business
 enough


in
 the
 present
 you
 have
 two
 feet
 in
 the


present
 then
 you're
 not
 preparing
 your


your
 company
 or
 yourself
 for
 the
 future


so
 that
 balance
 is
 really
 important
 and


we
 talked
 about
 having
 empathy
 I
 think
 I


try
 not
 just
 for
 create
 with
 creators


but
 for
 many
 people
 to
 put
 myself
 in


their
 shoes
 to
 understand
 you
 know
 what


they're
 experiencing
 U
 I
 also
 feel


certainly
 at
 Disney
 a
 great
 leader
 has


to
 have
 a
 deep
 appreciation
 and
 respect


for
 creators
 in
 the
 creative
 process
 you


know
 that's
 critical
 um
 I
 also
 and
 I


talk
 about
 this
 a
 lot
 um
 you
 have
 to
 be


an
 optimist
 people
 don't
 want
 to
 follow


pessimists
 a
 dose
 of
 realism
 is
 often


critical
 uh
 to
 get
 people
 um
 motivated


and
 to
 to
 energize
 them
 a
 bit
 but
 always


by
 maintaining
 a
 sense
 of
 hope
 you


mentioned
 it's
 important
 to
 be
 an


optimist
 I've
 heard
 you
 say
 uh
 that
 you


have
 absolutely
 no
 fear
 I
 guess
 I
 was


kind
 of
 lucky
 I'm
 I'm
 not
 an
 overly


anxious
 person
 and
 I
 I
 don't
 know
 I
 used


to
 joke
 every
 once
 in
 a
 while
 say
 I


wasn't
 born
 with
 a
 fear
 Gene
 look
 any


human
 being
 has
 some
 element
 of
 fear


within
 them
 but
 I'm
 not
 I'm
 not
 fear


does
 not
 is
 doesn't
 guide
 me
 at
 all
 I'm


I'm
 guided
 more
 by
 opportunity
 uh
 by
 um


a
 desire
 to
 discover
 and
 to
 um
 and
 to


experiment
 uh
 and
 I
 think
 actually
 when


I
 describe
 great
 leaders
 I
 think
 it's


having
 someone
 who's
 really
 curious
 who


wants
 to
 innovate
 who
 wants
 to
 discover


who
 wants
 to
 know
 what's
 around
 the


corner
 and
 is
 not
 just
 looking
 at
 what


the
 past
 or
 even
 the
 present
 but
 is
 kind


of
 looking
 at
 all
 of
 those
 things
 also


it's
 clear
 a
 Leader's
 got
 to
 have
 a
 lot


of
 an
 ability
 to
 really
 focus
 to
 set


priorities
 and
 stick
 to
 them
 and
 to
 be


decisive
 no
 one
 wants
 a
 leader
 that
 is


not
 is
 not
 capable
 of
 making
 decisions


on
 a
 timely
 basis
 that
 creates
 so
 so


much
 destruction
 when
 it
 comes
 to


productivity
 yeah
 I've
 heard
 you
 say
 the


ability
 to
 act
 is
 um
 is
 important
 but


how
 how
 important
 is
 energy
 uh
 because


um
 you
 you
 are
 up
 uh
 is
 it
 right
 you're


up
 just
 off
 4:00
 CL
 every
 every
 day
 yes


that's
 correct
 that's
 correct
 that's
 uh


I
 mean
 that's
 that's
 the
 type
 of
 uh
 time


only
 Bakers
 have
 uh
 use
 on
 their
 alarm


clo
 you
 know
 well
 um
 we
 can
 talk
 about


that
 there's
 a
 reason
 that
 I
 get
 up


early
 not
 just
 how
 I'm
 wired
 but
 it
 it


serves
 a
 a
 great
 purpose
 but
 you
 know


before
 I
 get
 to
 that
 I
 think
 you
 know


you
 mentioned
 the
 word
 energy
 I
 don't


talk
 about
 it
 that
 much
 I'm
 it's
 great


that
 you
 brought
 that
 up
 um
 because
 a


great
 leader
 has
 to
 be
 an
 energetic


leader
 too
 uh
 look
 I
 I'm
 a
 human
 being


so
 if
 I'm
 really
 tired
 from
 Global


Travel
 and
 long
 hours
 and
 who
 knows
 what


I'm
 not
 afraid
 to
 uh
 to
 show
 that
 to
 my


people
 because
 I
 think
 that's
 sort
 of
 a


way
 of
 being
 relatable
 they
 feel
 this


that
 too
 it's
 human
 nature
 sometimes
 you


to
 be
 feel
 overworked
 and
 tired
 um
 but
 I


think
 you
 have
 to
 bring
 Mo
 for
 the
 most


part
 you
 got
 to
 bring
 your
 energy
 to


your
 job
 every
 every
 moment
 of
 the
 the


day
 meaning
 every
 waking
 hour
 um
 because


it's
 motivate
 energy
 energy
 is


motivating
 where
 does
 energy
 come
 from


it's
 a
 very
 underresearched
 phenomena
 in


leadership
 what
 is
 it
 I
 think
 it's
 a
 lot


of
 things
 I
 think
 some
 of
 it
 is
 how


you're
 wired
 as
 jeans
 some
 of
 it
 is
 how


you
 have
 um
 you're
 prepared
 so
 I
 I


staying
 in
 shape
 having
 having
 stamina


is
 critical
 for
 me
 and
 that's
 eating


well
 and
 exercising
 and
 just
 taking
 care


of
 my
 body
 and
 my
 mind
 is
 is
 really


important
 I
 could
 not
 do
 this
 job
 if
 I


were
 not
 in
 some
 form
 of
 physical
 and


and
 and
 and
 and
 even
 U
 mental
 health
 do


you
 drink
 wine
 I
 do
 I
 drink
 I
 do
 I
 like


wine
 I
 like
 a
 good
 glass
 of
 wine
 uh
 I'm


drinking
 less
 these
 days
 maybe
 it
 has
 to


do
 maybe
 with
 my
 age
 but
 um
 yeah
 my
 good


glass
 of
 wine
 relaxes
 me
 but
 I'm
 I'm
 I'm


moderate
 when
 it
 comes
 I'm
 moderate
 when


it
 comes
 to
 most
 things
 I
 think
 but
 go
 I


think
 it's
 important
 in
 terms
 of
 the
 the


routine
 because
 one
 could
 argue
 that
 I'm


not
 getting
 enough
 sleep
 but
 that


morning
 time
 for
 me
 is
 rejuvenating


actually
 it's
 first
 of
 all
 it's
 it's


meditative
 it's
 quiet
 um
 the
 stimulation


that
 exists
 in
 my
 life
 when
 it's
 still


dark
 out
 and
 no
 one
 else
 is
 up
 is
 is


toned
 down
 and
 so
 I
 get
 a
 chance
 to
 be


alone
 with
 my
 thoughts
 and
 that
 gives
 me


an
 opportunity
 to
 be
 to
 order
 things


meaning
 to
 to
 figure
 out
 an
 order
 and
 a


a
 set
 of
 priorities
 it
 gives
 me
 an


opportunity
 to
 to
 think
 more
 creatively


I'm
 again
 I'm
 not
 Ser
 say
 I'm
 a
 Creator


but
 just
 in
 terms
 of
 speeches
 I'm
 going


to
 give
 discussions
 I'm
 going
 to
 have


with
 my
 people
 it
 it
 just
 is
 a
 it's
 a


way
 that
 I
 begin
 the
 day
 with
 more


purpose
 uh
 instead
 of
 waking
 up
 and


suddenly
 being
 bombarded
 by
 all
 the


incoming
 that
 comes
 my
 way
 I
 can
 I
 I
 can


attack
 the
 world
 and
 the
 day
 just
 with
 a


a
 little
 bit
 more
 organization
 so
 what


do
 you
 do
 you
 wake
 up
 you
 put
 on
 your


dressing
 go
 you
 go
 down
 to
 the
 kitchen


make
 a
 cup
 of
 coffee
 or
 what
 do
 you
 what


do
 you
 do
 I
 usually
 I
 it's
 funny
 I
 I


I've
 reversed
 this
 since
 I
 I
 came
 back


to
 Disney
 I
 have
 a
 cup
 of
 coffee
 first


yes
 I
 go
 down
 to
 the
 kitchen
 set
 the


coffee
 maker
 the
 night
 before
 so
 there's


a
 timer
 I
 have
 my
 coffee
 and
 then
 I
 put


on
 my
 workout
 clothes
 and
 I
 work
 out
 at


the
 house
 um
 almost
 every
 day
 or
 and
 I


do
 the
 same
 thing
 when
 I'm
 in
 a
 hotel


anywhere
 in
 the
 world
 how
 long
 do
 you


how
 long
 do
 you
 work
 out
 for
 I
 work
 out


for
 about
 an
 hour
 every
 morning
 wow
 um


sometimes
 less
 but
 but
 rarely
 less
 than


45
 minutes
 um
 and
 it's
 again
 I
 I
 I
 like


to
 say
 that
 it's
 for
 sanity
 and
 vanity


purposes
 um
 it
 enables
 me
 as
 I
 said
 to


clear
 my
 head
 but
 I
 also
 you
 know


enables
 and
 and
 better
 prepair
 my
 mind


and
 my
 body
 for
 the
 for
 the
 job
 at
 hand


but
 you
 know
 there's
 a
 van
 there's
 a


vanity
 side
 to
 it
 too
 sure
 when
 you
 go


to
 bed


I
 go
 to
 bed
 between
 10
 and
 11
 most


nights
 moving
 on
 to
 um
 uh
 technology
 we


talked
 a
 bit
 about
 it
 and
 you
 know


you've
 been
 around
 for
 100
 years
 the


company
 that
 is
 um
 I
 I
 read
 that
 only
 45


companies
 out
 of
 1
 million
 survive
 100


years
 so
 it's
 it's
 pretty
 amazing
 right


so
 what
 do
 you
 think
 is
 the
 key
 to


surviving
 for
 100
 years
 I've
 thought


about
 this
 a
 lot
 and
 like
 you
 I've


studied
 basically
 great
 Brands
 and
 and


companies
 and
 Longevity
 and
 tried
 to


understand
 why
 did
 some
 fail
 and
 and
 why


did
 some
 succeed
 for
 years
 and
 years
 uh


including
 studying
 the
 great
 brands
 of


the
 world
 going
 all
 the
 way
 back
 to
 the


1920s
 and
 30s
 uh
 and
 certainly
 in
 my


lifetime
 the
 50s
 and
 60s
 and
 70s
 you


know
 I
 there
 were
 great
 Brands
 and
 you


were
 born
 in
 the
 60s
 you
 probably
 could


name
 a
 bunch
 in
 the
 70s
 or
 maybe
 even


the
 60s
 although
 you
 were
 young
 what


happened
 to
 them
 why
 did
 they
 not


maintain
 their
 relevance
 and
 their
 both


their
 economic
 success
 as
 well
 and
 why


did
 others
 succeed
 and
 what
 I've


concluded
 is
 and
 it's
 it's
 it's
 quite


interesting
 the
 world
 is
 changing
 so


fast
 and
 I'm
 sure
 that's
 been
 the
 case


for
 decades
 and
 in
 such
 profound
 ways


that
 there's
 a
 tendency
 in
 order
 to


maintain
 relevance
 in
 in
 a
 world
 that


may
 not
 look
 anything
 like
 the
 world


that
 existed


when
 a
 company
 or
 a
 brand
 was


created
 there
 companies
 have
 a
 tendency


to
 maintain
 relevance
 to
 abandon
 core


values
 and
 that
 becomes
 the
 death
 of
 the


company
 um
 so
 what
 I've
 tried
 to
 do
 is


understand
 what
 are
 the
 core
 values
 of


Disney
 most
 of
 it
 we've
 talked
 about


which
 is
 basically
 what
 do
 we
 put
 into


our
 storytelling
 uh
 the
 value
 of


creativity
 the
 fact
 that
 it
 drives


everything
 at
 Disney
 um
 but
 then
 it's


critical
 to
 present
 those
 core
 values
 in


more
 relevant
 ways
 so
 sometimes
 it's
 not


about
 the
 story
 you
 tell
 it's
 how
 does


it
 look
 on
 screen
 are
 you


using
 and
 Pixar
 is
 a
 great
 example


computer
 generated
 animation
 versus


handdrawn
 animation
 handdrawn
 animation


looked
 old
 it
 looked
 less
 relevant


computer
 generation
 particularly
 to
 new


generations
 of
 people
 looked
 newer
 more


modern
 Le
 more
 of
 today
 or
 of
 their


lives
 when
 they
 were
 consuming
 it
 uh


that's
 just
 a
 an
 application
 of


technology
 to
 tell
 sometimes
 the
 same


story
 but
 in
 a
 visually
 more
 relevant


way
 another
 thing
 that
 creates
 relevance


is
 how
 you
 distribute
 your
 product
 how


is
 your
 customer
 getting
 access
 to
 it


and
 then
 how
 is
 the
 customer
 consuming


it
 so
 in
 our
 case
 great
 example
 would
 be


streaming
 which
 is
 a
 a
 modern
 way
 of


Distributing
 a
 story
 um
 the
 same
 story


by
 the
 way
 it's
 interesting
 if
 you
 go
 to


Disney
 plus
 today
 you'll
 see
 Snow
 White


from
 1937
 or
 a
 Mickey
 Mouse
 short
 from


1928
 um
 same
 story
 but
 distributed
 in


modern
 technology
 and
 then
 ultimately


consumed
 on
 a
 modern
 device
 how
 do
 you


think
 how
 do
 you
 think
 AI
 will
 change


what
 you're
 doing
 well
 I
 we
 think
 about


this
 a
 lot
 and
 I
 think
 it's
 really


really
 important
 for
 companies
 to
 act


responsibly
 in
 this
 regard
 because
 I


think
 there's
 more
 that
 we
 don't
 know


than
 we
 know
 and
 I
 think
 proceeding
 with


caution
 is
 critical
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 AI


we
 view
 technology
 as
 enabling
 us
 to


really
 do
 three
 things
 we've
 just
 talked


about
 make
 our
 stories
 better
 second


become


uh
 make
 them
 more
 relevant
 to
 consumers


in
 terms
 of
 how
 they're
 distributed
 and


consumed
 so
 that's
 a
 basically
 improving


the
 relationship
 with
 the
 consumer
 and


the
 last
 part
 is
 just
 making
 company


more
 efficient
 I
 believe
 AI
 will
 enable


all
 of
 that
 they
 it
 will
 be
 a
 a
 powerful


tool
 to
 enable
 in
 the
 hands
 of
 a
 great


Storyteller
 to
 enable
 that
 Storyteller


to
 tell
 better
 stories
 in
 addition
 more


efficiency
 and
 I
 think
 ultimately
 enable


us
 to
 gain
 more
 access
 to
 and
 have
 a


closer
 maybe
 more
 intimate
 relationship


with
 our


customers
 what
 I
 what
 I
 don't
 want
 to


accept
 is
 that
 Ely
 will
 destroy
 human


creativity
 and
 I
 think
 as
 a
 company


we're
 going
 to
 try
 very
 hard
 uh
 to


prevent
 that
 from
 happening
 meaning
 I


just
 think
 that
 the
 the
 human
 mind
 is


capable
 of
 telling
 a
 great
 original


story
 in
 ways
 that
 no
 machine
 will
 be


able
 to
 replace
 uh
 hopefully
 for
 many


many
 decades
 to
 come
 if
 ever
 that's
 my


hope
 um
 that
 the
 Storyteller
 is
 in
 fact


the
 one
 who
 tells
 the
 story
 uh
 meaning


their
 story
 that
 creates
 the
 story


particularly
 the
 original
 story
 I
 think


it's
 fine
 as
 we've
 done
 over
 the
 years


as
 Walt
 Disney
 did
 to
 use
 technology
 to


as
 a
 powerful
 tool
 for
 that
 Storyteller


you
 Steve
 Jobs
 likened
 the
 laptop


computer
 as
 a
 bicycle
 of
 the
 mind
 he
 he


studied
 the
 locomotive
 capabilities
 of


species
 and
 discover
 that
 human
 beings


didn't
 Propel
 themselves
 through
 space


very
 fast
 very
 effectively
 uh
 until
 you


gave
 them
 a
 bicycle
 and
 and
 then
 they


were
 the
 fastest
 species
 there
 was
 um


and
 that's
 what
 he
 looked
 at
 he
 he


viewed
 the
 computer
 that
 way
 it
 might


sound
 trite
 it
 might
 sound
 naive
 of
 me


to
 hope
 that
 that's
 what
 AI
 will
 become


because
 I
 know
 that
 there
 are
 many
 and


maybe
 for
 legitimate
 reasons
 that
 worry


uh
 that
 it's
 much
 more
 than
 the
 bicycle


of
 the
 mind
 that
 it
 is
 a
 powerful
 tool


that
 would
 be
 so
 disruptive
 and
 so


destructive
 uh
 that
 ultimately
 will
 be


have
 a
 negative
 effect
 effect
 on


humankind
 and
 I
 think
 we
 have
 to
 we
 have


a
 responsibility
 as
 human
 beings
 to
 see


that
 that
 doesn't
 happen
 now
 um
 some


listeners
 may
 not
 know
 but
 um
 you
 were


uh
 a
 CEO
 for
 15
 years
 uh
 you
 stepped


down
 in
 2020
 came
 back
 after
 two
 years


um
 now
 when
 you
 came
 back
 and
 looked
 at


Disney
 again
 what
 were
 your
 priorities


then
 well
 Disney
 had
 been
 through
 a


really
 difficult
 time
 uh
 obviously
 uh


the
 board
 making
 a
 decision
 to
 remove


the
 the
 former
 CEO
 you
 know
 created
 not


just
 uncertainty
 but
 real
 concern
 so
 I
 I


had
 to
 calm
 the
 first
 thing
 I
 had
 to
 do


was
 really
 calm
 things
 down
 and
 and


reassure
 people
 um
 that
 that
 that
 the


future
 was
 bright
 again
 and
 that
 there


were
 steps
 we
 were
 going
 to
 take
 that
 I


would
 was
 going
 to
 be
 very
 transparent


about
 to
 get
 Disney
 back
 on
 track
 uh
 I
 I


believe
 at
 company's
 culture
 is


everything
 in
 any
 respects
 and
 uh
 a


culture
 that
 uh
 respects
 and
 and
 fosters


great
 creativity
 particularly
 at
 Disney


is
 is
 critical
 I
 had
 to
 return


creativity
 to
 the
 center
 of
 the
 company


it
 had
 the
 company
 had
 been
 restructured


in
 a
 way
 that
 took
 some
 of
 the


accountability
 and
 responsibility
 away


from
 the
 creative
 side
 of
 the
 company
 I


had
 to
 restore
 that
 I
 did
 that
 on
 day


one
 really
 right
 away
 um
 I
 had
 to


instill
 optimism
 again
 in
 the
 company


being
 a
 realist
 and
 how
 many
 things
 we


need
 to
 accomplish
 but
 being
 an
 optimist


in
 terms
 of
 my
 confidence
 that
 we
 would


be
 able
 to
 accomplish
 those
 things
 um
 I


also
 had
 to
 streamline
 the
 organization


make
 it
 much
 more
 clear
 who
 was


responsible
 for
 for
 what
 uh
 there
 was


there
 there
 was
 a
 lot
 of
 fixing
 that
 had


to
 be
 done
 what
 was
 the
 toughest
 part
 of


it
 the
 toughest
 part
 for
 me
 was
 to
 be


patient
 I
 had
 to
 get
 used
 to
 the
 fact


that
 um
 The
 Climb
 upwards
 wasn't
 as


certain
 wasn't
 as
 easy
 uh
 and
 that
 we


were
 starting
 from


a
 very
 low
 point
 and
 I
 had
 to
 be
 patient


in
 terms
 of
 how
 long
 it
 would
 take
 to


get
 where
 I
 felt
 the
 company
 needed
 to


be
 I
 actually
 feel
 quite
 good
 now
 about


where
 we
 are
 we
 have
 a
 lot
 more
 work
 to


do
 and
 Heavens
 even
 if
 we've
 fixed


everything
 there
 still
 will
 be
 work
 to


do
 but
 I
 feel
 really
 good
 about
 not
 only


the
 recent
 successes
 um
 and
 what
 we've


managed
 to
 accomplish
 as
 a
 company
 to


date
 but
 I
 feel
 great
 about
 Thea


trajectory
 of
 our
 company
 going
 forward


is
 it
 difficult
 for
 a
 perfectionist
 to


be
 patient
 it's
 almost
 impossible
 for
 a


professionist
 to
 be
 patient
 that
 is
 one


of
 my
 that
 is
 one
 of
 my
 personal


struggles
 I
 think


um
 but
 I
 think
 over
 time
 you
 teach


yourself
 to
 be
 patient
 because
 well
 by


the
 way
 I
 think
 expressing
 impatience
 is


good
 too
 because
 creating
 a
 sense
 of


urgency
 and
 motivating
 people
 not
 just


to
 do
 great
 things
 but
 to
 do
 them
 faster


is
 a
 good
 thing
 but
 you
 have
 to
 be


realistic
 about
 it
 too
 it
 doesn't
 do


anybody
 any
 good
 to
 demand
 things
 that


that
 happen
 on
 a
 timeline
 that
 is


impossible
 ultimately
 to
 achieve
 so
 I


it's
 it's
 trying
 to
 understand
 trying
 to


get
 people
 moving
 as
 fast
 as
 possible
 in


the
 right
 direction
 but
 understanding


that
 results
 positive
 results
 may
 take


some
 time
 last
 question
 we
 have
 um
 tens


of
 thousands
 of
 young
 listeners
 um
 what


is
 your
 advice
 to
 young
 people
 well
 I
 I


happen
 to
 believe
 to
 the
 extent
 you
 can


either
 teach
 yourself
 to
 be
 curious
 or


to
 the
 extent
 that
 you
 can
 lean
 into
 the


Curiosity
 that
 exists
 within
 you
 that's


really
 important
 a
 curious
 person
 is


someone
 that
 wants
 to
 learn
 someone
 that


wants
 to
 uh
 experience
 new
 things


someone
 that
 wants
 to
 someone
 that


ultimately
 is
 capable
 of
 innovating
 so


find
 that
 Curiosity
 Gene
 within
 you
 and


do
 whatever
 you
 can
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 it


is
 healthy
 and
 and
 vibrant
 that's


critical
 we
 talked
 about
 patients
 that's


important
 in
 managing
 careers
 Find
 Your


Passion
 by
 the
 way
 way
 but
 be
 patient


about
 discovering
 what
 your
 passion
 is


and
 then
 be
 patient
 about
 your
 career


unfolding
 uh
 in
 terms
 of
 its
 timing
 in
 a


n
 in
 a
 more
 natural
 way
 it's
 it's
 rare


that
 I
 usually
 opportunities
 come
 to


people
 that
 are
 prepared
 for
 them
 as


opposed
 to
 people
 creating
 opportunities


completely
 on
 their
 own
 there
 are
 too


many
 outside
 factors
 in
 that
 regard
 I
 I


benefited
 greatly
 from
 having
 um
 bosses


retired
 just
 when
 I
 was
 ready
 to
 take


their
 job
 for
 instance
 now
 that's
 not
 me


creating
 the
 opportunity
 other
 than
 I


made
 sure
 I
 was
 prepared
 for
 it
 when
 it


came
 up
 U
 but
 it
 could
 been
 could
 have


been
 a
 couple
 of
 cases
 that
 they
 decided


to
 retire
 a
 couple
 of
 years
 later
 I


might
 still
 would
 have
 gotten
 their
 jobs


but
 I
 would
 had
 to
 be
 more
 patient
 about


it
 so
 I
 think
 patience
 is
 important


don't
 create
 an
 artificial
 timetable
 for


yourself
 that
 in
 many
 respects
 is
 out
 of


your
 control
 so
 be
 curious
 be
 patient


find
 your
 passion


um
 and
 uh
 and
 and
 apply
 everything


you're
 capable
 of
 doing
 and
 then
 some
 to


whatever
 that
 is
 well
 that's
 a
 that's
 a


a
 great
 uh
 place
 to
 uh
 to
 end
 Bob

 being

 here
 today
