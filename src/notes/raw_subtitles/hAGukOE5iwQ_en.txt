Did
 you
 talk
 about
 permitting
 changes


that
 you
 could
 make
 now
 that
 would
 lower


the
 break
 even
 cost
 of
 oil
 to
 allow


producers
 to
 keep
 pumping
 and
 keep


making
 money?


We
 did.
 We
 did.
 You
 know,
 we
 heard
 a


litany
 of
 delays
 of
 of
 uncertainty
 about


whether
 they
 could
 get
 permits,
 whether


they
 could
 do
 this
 or
 whether
 they
 could


do
 that.
 So,
 we
 were
 in
 listening
 mode


and
 heard
 a
 number
 of
 things.
 And
 our


message
 was
 the
 goal
 of
 this


administration.
 President
 Trump
 got


elected
 to
 increase
 American
 energy


production.
 More
 supply
 means
 lower


costs,
 more
 jobs,
 more
 opportunities,


and
 more
 geopolitical
 power.
 So
 we
 we


were
 in
 listening
 mode,
 but
 absolutely


said
 we
 want
 to
 we
 want
 to
 be
 helpful
 to


unleash
 American
 energy.


Secretary,
 when
 you
 talk
 about
 listening


mode,
 last
 week
 I
 was
 at
 Sarah
 Week
 by


S&P
 Global
 in
 Houston,
 as
 were
 you,
 and


I
 listened
 when
 many
 CEOs
 said
 they
 had


concerns
 about
 tariffs.
 Did
 you
 address


some
 of
 that
 yesterday
 at
 the
 White


House?


Tariffs
 wasn't
 discussed
 at
 the
 meeting.


It
 was
 more
 a
 broader
 unleash
 American


energy
 and
 all
 that.
 We
 actually
 didn't


get
 into
 the
 tariff
 dialogue.


What
 would
 you
 suggest
 then
 to
 energy


producers
 who
 are
 concerned
 if
 if
 not


about
 the
 the
 lasting
 impact
 of
 tariffs,


some
 of
 the
 confusion
 that
 has


surrounded
 this
 conversation,
 Mr.


Secretary,
 you've
 seen
 the
 market


reaction
 and
 this
 is
 a
 reality
 for
 every


business
 owner.


It
 is.
 It
 is.
 Look,
 the
 the
 president's


got
 a
 vision.
 He's
 got
 a
 bold
 agenda
 and


it's
 being
 created
 right
 now.
 So,


there's
 negotiations
 with
 multiple


countries.
 Think
 of
 his
 overwhelming


goal.
 He
 wants
 reciprocal
 trade.
 If
 a


country
 has
 high
 tariffs
 on
 us,
 he
 wants


them
 to
 lower
 their
 tariffs
 on
 us
 and


he'll
 be
 he'll
 match
 that
 reciprocally.


So,
 these
 are
 negotiations
 that
 need
 to


go
 back
 and
 forth.
 So,
 I
 understand
 the


uncertainty.
 Um,
 we
 all
 feel
 it.
 We
 all


see
 it,
 but
 I
 think
 it's
 a
 negotiation


going
 to
 a
 great
 place,
 but
 we
 won't


have
 clarity.
 I
 think
 it
 won't
 be
 that


long,
 but
 we're
 not
 there
 yet.


I
 do
 want
 to
 ask
 you
 a
 question
 about


our
 reporting
 that
 you
 will
 seek
 up
 to


$20
 billion
 to
 accomplish
 the


president's
 goal
 of
 refilling
 the


nation's
 oil
 reserve.
 Obviously,
 you'll


have
 to
 go
 to
 Congress
 on
 that.
 Have
 you


done
 that?
 And
 what
 will
 you
 do
 about


that
 moving
 forward
 in
 Washington
 DC?


Yes,
 it
 it's
 a
 critical
 in
 our
 ask
 and


in
 our
 agenda.
 You
 know,
 that
 the


strategic
 petroleum
 reserve
 is
 for
 just


that.
 It's
 to
 be
 strategic
 safety
 and


security
 in
 the
 event
 of
 very
 bad
 world


events.
 They
 may
 never
 happen.
 We
 hope


they
 don't.
 It's
 like
 insurance.
 But


you've
 got
 to
 be
 prepared
 for
 anything.


We've
 got
 to
 have
 our
 country
 secure
 and


safe
 no
 matter
 what
 happens
 with
 energy


because
 if
 you
 get
 energy
 wrong,
 nothing


else
 matters.
 So
 yes,
 we
 were
 we're


going
 to
 Congress
 to
 get
 money
 for
 that.


Sadly,
 it
 takes
 much
 longer
 to
 refill


the
 strategic
 petroleum
 reserve
 than
 it


took
 to
 drain
 it
 for
 political
 reasons,


not
 strategic
 reasons
 in
 the
 2022


midterm
 elections.
 So,
 it's
 a
 multi-year


process
 to
 fill
 it,
 but
 uh
 we
 want
 to


get
 going
 as
 soon
 as
 we
 can.
 We
 talked


about
 that
 last
 time
 you
 joined
 us
 from


Port
 Sulfur.
 Secretary,
 just
 quickly


before
 we
 move
 on,
 do
 you
 know
 how
 soon


you
 can
 make
 your
 first
 bid
 on
 oil,
 the


first
 batch
 to
 refill
 the
 SPR?


Uh,
 I
 suspect
 in
 that,
 you
 know,
 that's


that's
 up
 to
 Congress.
 So,
 the
 Congress


is
 going
 through
 a
 process
 now,
 though.


Or
 do
 you
 want
 to
 see
 $50
 crude
 before


you
 make
 that
 that
 move?
 Oh,
 no.
 We
 we


we
 would
 happily
 we're
 not
 going
 to


guess
 the
 price
 of
 oil
 and
 all
 that,
 we


would
 happily
 buy
 crude
 right
 now.
 Um,


obviously,
 if
 we
 see
 spikes
 higher
 or


huge
 dislocations,
 we
 might
 stop
 buying


crude.
 But,
 uh,
 no,
 if
 we
 if
 we
 had
 the


approval
 right
 now,
 we'd
 be
 in
 the


market
 today.


President
 Trump,
 Mr.
 secretary


reintroduced
 the
 prospect
 of
 a
 minerals


deal
 with
 Ukraine
 today.
 This
 is
 what
 he


said.
 I'd
 love
 to
 get
 your
 reaction.


We're
 also
 signing
 agreements
 in
 various


locations
 to
 unlock
 uh
 rare
 earths
 and


minerals
 and
 lots
 of
 other
 things
 all


over
 the
 world,
 but
 uh
 in
 particular


Ukraine.
 We're
 doing
 very
 well
 with


regard
 to
 Ukraine
 and
 Russia.
 And
 one
 of


the
 things
 we
 are
 doing
 is
 signing
 a


deal
 very
 shortly
 with
 respect
 to
 rare


earths
 with
 Ukraine
 which
 they
 have


tremendous
 value
 in
 rare
 earth
 and
 we


appreciate
 that.
 Got
 everyone's
 antennas


up
 today
 Mr.
 Secretary.
 What
 are
 you


hearing
 about
 this?
 How
 quickly
 could
 it


happen?


Uh
 I
 think
 a
 deal
 could
 be
 done
 quickly.


It's
 a
 brilliant
 idea
 when
 you
 think


about
 it
 that
 we
 often
 use
 this
 misnomer


term
 natural
 resources.
 Those
 resources


have
 been
 underground
 for
 millions
 of


years
 and
 they
 haven't
 benefited
 anyone.


I
 call
 them
 natural
 materials.
 They
 only


become
 resources
 when
 technology,


capital,
 and
 human
 activity
 brings
 them


out
 of
 the
 ground
 and
 turns
 them
 into


resources.
 But
 to
 have
 the
 United
 States


as
 your
 partner
 to
 develop
 materials


that
 have
 been
 sitting
 there
 for
 a
 long


time
 unused,
 that's
 upside
 to
 Ukraine.


It's
 upside
 to
 the
 United
 States.
 And
 of


course,
 it's
 a
 joining
 together
 of
 the


nations
 in
 a
 in
 an
 effort
 on
 the
 ground


in
 Ukraine.
 If
 I'm
 Ukraine,
 I
 am
 all
 in


on
 that
 deal.
 And
 as
 the
 American
 energy


secretary,
 I
 am
 all
 in
 on
 that
 deal.


You
 know,
 last
 night
 we
 spoke
 with


retired
 General
 Wesley
 Clark,
 former


NATO
 Supreme
 Allied
 Commander.
 Here's


what
 he
 had
 to
 say
 about
 putting
 US


involvement
 in
 energy
 facilities
 in


Ukraine.


Those
 are
 old,
 what
 we
 consider


obsolescent
 nuclear
 plants.
 We
 didn't


design
 those
 plants.
 They're
 not
 our


plants.
 We
 can't
 just
 transplant


transplant
 people
 over
 there
 and
 say,


"Hey,
 by
 the
 way,
 uh
 this
 is
 the
 GE


design,
 go
 after
 it."
 It
 isn't.
 But
 yes,


we
 could
 learn
 to
 take
 care
 of
 those


plants.
 Zaparisia,
 the
 plant's
 been


partially
 occupied
 by
 the
 Russians.
 Uh


they've
 threatened
 to
 to
 to
 damage
 it


and
 destroy
 it
 at
 various
 times.
 It


wouldn't
 be
 such
 a
 bad
 thing
 if
 you
 if


the
 United
 States
 says,
 "Well,
 now
 you


can't
 touch
 it
 because
 we're
 in
 it."


Secretary,
 your
 response
 to
 that?


Yeah,
 of
 course
 there's
 complexities
 in


everything
 when
 you
 do
 business
 o


offshore
 overseas.
 Uh
 boy,
 I've
 done


business
 in
 countries
 much
 more


difficult
 to
 operate
 in
 than
 Ukraine.


But
 uh
 you
 know,
 of
 course,
 the
 general


is
 right.
 It's
 a
 different
 plant
 design,


but
 you
 would
 bring
 local
 experts
 that


know
 that
 plant,
 and
 you'd
 bring


high-end
 nuclear
 experts
 from
 the
 United


States,
 and
 together,
 I
 think
 wise


decisions
 would
 be
 made.
 If
 the


political
 decision
 is
 made
 for
 the
 US
 to


lead
 the
 operation
 of
 that
 plant,
 uh,
 so


be
 it.
 We
 could
 do
 that,
 I
 think,
 with


uh,
 very
 little
 problem.


Well,
 Secretary,
 have
 you
 spoken
 with


any
 American
 companies
 that
 would
 be


interested
 in
 buying
 a
 plant
 like


Zapperia?
 And
 if
 if
 this
 happened,


whether
 it
 was
 that
 or
 another,
 would


your
 department
 regulate
 it?


Uh,
 no
 dialogues
 about
 that
 yet.
 No


dialogues
 about
 that
 yet.
 But
 America's


full
 of
 expertise
 in
 this
 area.
 And
 boy,


I
 at
 the
 Department
 of
 Energy
 have
 been


overwhelmed
 with
 people
 putting
 their


hand
 in
 the
 air
 and
 saying,
 "Put
 me
 in.


How
 can
 I
 help?
 What
 can
 I
 do?"
 So,
 I
 I


think
 we
 would
 see
 tremendous
 interest.


something
 needed
 to
 be
 done.
 We'd
 have


tons
 of
 people
 wanting
 to
 do
