Mouthys
 developed
 his
 theory
 during


England's
 social
 upheaval.
 As
 an


Anglican
 clergyman
 witnessing
 rapid


population
 growth
 alongside


industrialization's
 harsh
 conditions,
 he


rejected
 enlightenment
 optimism
 about


social
 progress.
 The
 French
 Revolution's


radicalism
 reinforced
 his
 conservative


outlook.
 While
 recurring
 food
 shortages


made
 population
 concerns
 immediate,
 his


1798
 essay
 on
 population
 proposed
 that


population
 increases
 geometrically
 while


food
 production
 grows
 arithmetically,


creating
 an
 inescapable
 trap.
 This


mathematical
 certainty
 meant
 poverty
 was


inevitable,
 not
 a
 correctable
 social


problem.
 Malthusian
 theory
 justified


minimal
 poor
 relief
 and
 fundamentally


shifted
 economics
 by
 introducing


scarcity
 as
 a
 central
 problem.
 Though


agricultural
 technology
 ultimately


proved
 his
 predictions
 wrong,
 his


emphasis
 on
 natural
 resource
 limits


remains
 relevant
 in
 environmental


economics
 and
 sustainability
 debates.


Utilitarianism
 Jeremy
 Bentham
 and
 John


Stewart
 Mill.
 Bentham
 and
 Mill
 developed


utilitarianism
 during
 Britain's


industrial
 transition.
 Bentham,
 a
 legal


reformer,
 became
 disillusioned
 with


legal
 fictions
 while
 witnessing


widespread
 poverty
 alongside
 industrial


wealth.
 Mill
 subjected
 to
 intense


education
 by
 his
 father
 and
 Bentham,


experienced
 a
 mental
 crisis
 that
 led
 him


to
 temper
 pure
 rationalism
 with


appreciation
 for
 human
 emotion.
 Their


economic
 theory
 proposed
 that
 optimal


actions
 maximize
 utility,
 the
 greatest


happiness
 for
 the
 greatest
 number.


Bentham's
 philosopic
 calculus
 attempted


to
 quantify
 pleasure
 and
 pain,
 creating


a
 framework
 for
 evaluating
 policies.


Mill
 distinguished
 between
 higher
 and


lower
 pleasures,
 emphasizing


intellectual
 satisfaction
 over
 physical


gratification.
 Utilitarianism
 shifted


economics
 from
 wealth
 accumulation
 to


human
 welfare,
 providing
 the
 foundation


for
 costbenefit
 analysis,
 consumer


theory,
 and
 welfare
 economics.
 It


established
 utility
 maximization
 as
 the


core
 criterion
 for
 economic
 systems.


Marxism
 Karl
 Marx.
 Markx
 developed
 his


ideas
 while
 experiencing
 industrial


capitalism's
 brutal
 early
 phase.
 Born
 to


a
 middle-ass
 Jewish
 family,
 he
 was


repeatedly
 exiled
 for
 his
 political


writing.
 Living
 in
 poverty
 in
 London,


Markx
 observed
 horrific
 factory


conditions
 firsthand.
 The
 failed
 1848


European
 revolutions
 deepened
 his


pessimism
 about
 reform
 within
 the


capitalist
 system.
 His
 economic
 theory


and
 dos
 capital
 focused
 on
 class


struggle
 and
 exploitation.
 Markx
 argued


capitalists
 extract
 surplus
 value
 from


workers
 by
 paying
 less
 than
 the
 value


created.
 He
 identified
 capitalism's


contradictions
 over
 production
 crisis,


falling
 profit
 rates,
 and
 wealth


concentration,
 predicting
 these
 would


cause
 its
 collapse.
 His
 historical


materialism
 theory
 argued
 economic


systems
 evolve
 through
 stages
 based
 on


changing
 production
 modes.
 While
 his


prediction
 of
 capitalism's
 imminent


demise
 proved
 incorrect,
 Marx's
 analysis


of
 exploitation
 and
 systemic
 instability


continues
 to
 influence
 thinking
 about


inequality
 and
 crisis
 theory.


Marginalism
 William
 Stanley
 Jevans,
 Carl


Manger,
 Leon
 Walrus.
 Marginalism
 emerged


independently
 through
 three
 scholars


during
 the
 1870s
 economic
 depression.


Jevans
 brought
 mathematical
 rigor
 to


economics
 during
 Britain's
 industrial


height.
 Manger
 developed
 his
 theories
 in


Habsburg,
 Austria
 and
 Walrus
 applied


mathematical
 modeling
 to
 markets
 in


France.
 All
 three
 sought
 scientific


precision
 in
 an
 era
 enthusiastic
 about


classification
 across
 disciplines.
 Their


breakthrough
 introduced
 marginal


utility.
 the
 additional
 satisfaction


from
 consuming
 one
 more
 unit
 of
 a
 good.


This
 marginal
 revolution
 shifted
 focus


from
 production
 costs
 to
 subjective


consumer
 valuations,
 explaining
 why


diamonds
 cost
 more
 than
 water
 despite


water's
 greater
 necessity.
 By
 applying


calculus
 to
 economic
 decisions,


marginalists
 showed
 how
 individuals


rationally
 allocate
 resources
 at
 the


margin.
 This
 approach
 became


foundational
 to
 modern
 microeconomics,


explaining
 consumer
 behavior,
 optimizing


resource
 allocation,
 and
 clarifying
 how


markets
 establish
 equilibrium
 prices.


Classical
 economics.
 Adam


Smith.
 Smith
 developed
 his
 ideas
 during


the
 early
 industrial
 revolution,


witnessing
 Scotland's
 transformation


from
 agrarian
 to
 manufacturing
 economy.


Raised
 by
 a
 widowed
 mother
 and
 educated


at
 Glasgow
 and
 Oxford,
 Smith
 was


influenced
 by
 his
 mentor
 Hutcherson's


moral
 philosophy
 and
 Hume's
 empiricism.


His
 European
 travels
 exposed
 him
 to


French
 physiocrats
 who
 opposed


mercantalism.
 His
 1776
 wealth
 of
 nations


introduced
 classical
 economics
 with
 its


central
 invisible
 hand
 concept.


Individuals
 pursuing
 self-interest
 in


free
 markets
 unintentionally
 promote


social
 welfare.
 Smith
 championed
 free


trade,
 division
 of
 labor,
 and
 minimal


government
 intervention.
 By
 observing


pin
 factories,
 he
 demonstrated
 how


specialization
 increases
 productivity.


His
 work
 established
 the
 foundation
 for


market
 economies,
 arguing
 that
 natural


liberty
 and
 economic
 affairs
 leads
 to


greater
 prosperity
 than
 government


direction.
 Neocclassical
 Economics.


Alfred


Marshall.
 Marshall
 developed


neocclassical
 economics
 during
 Britain's


transition
 to
 corporate


industrialism.
 Rebelling
 against
 his


strict
 banker
 father,
 he
 pursued


mathematics
 at
 Cambridge
 instead
 of
 a


clerical
 career.
 His
 marriage
 to


pioneering
 female
 economist
 Mary
 Paley


influenced
 his
 interest
 in
 social


improvement.
 Victorian
 reform
 movements


shaped
 his
 thinking
 as
 he
 regularly


visited
 factories
 and
 interviewed


business
 owners.
 In
 his
 1890
 principles


of
 economics,
 Marshall
 synthesized


classical
 economics
 with
 marginalist


insights.
 His
 theory
 introduced


analytical
 tools
 still
 used
 today.


Supply
 and
 demand
 curves,
 elasticity


concepts,
 and
 consumer
 producer
 surplus.


Marshall
 emphasized
 gradual
 economic


adjustments.
 Nature
 makes
 no
 leaps
 and


distinguished
 between
 shortrun
 and
 long


run
 analysis.
 His
 partial
 equilibrium


approach
 examined
 individual
 markets


while
 holding
 broader
 variables


constant.
 By
 balancing
 mathematical


rigor
 with
 practical
 relevance,
 Marshall


established
 the
 methodological


foundation
 for
 mainstream
 economics


throughout
 most
 of
 the
 20th
 century.


Austrian
 school
 Carl
 Manger
 Ludvig


fiscus
 Friedrich
 Hayek.
 The
 Austrian


school
 developed
 amid
 Habsburg
 Empire's


decline
 and
 central
 Europe's
 political


upheavalss.
 Manger's
 work
 began
 as
 a


reaction
 against
 German
 historical


schools
 nationalism.
 Mises
 and
 Hayek's


defense
 of
 free
 markets
 was
 shaped
 by


firstirhand
 experiences
 with


hyperinflation,
 socialism
 and
 fascism
 in


interwar
 Austria.
 Both
 witnessed


political
 extremism.


Mes
 fled
 Nazism
 in
 1940.


Austrian
 economic
 theory
 emphasizes


individualism,
 subjectivism,
 and
 market


processes
 over
 mathematical
 models.
 They


view
 economies
 as
 complex
 systems
 of


individual
 choices
 rather
 than
 aggregate


statistics.
 Hayek's
 knowledge
 problem


argues
 that
 central
 planning
 inevitably


fails
 because
 economic
 knowledge
 is


dispersed
 among
 individuals.
 Their


business
 cycle
 theory
 attributes


downturns
 to
 artificial
 credit


expansion.


While
 often
 outside
 mainstream


economics,
 Austrian
 ideas
 on


entrepreneurship,
 spontaneous
 market


order,
 and
 government
 intervention,


dangers
 significantly
 influenced


libertarian
 thought
 and
 monetary
 policy


debates.
 Institutional
 economics,


Thorstein.
 Vevelin's
 perspective
 emerged


from
 his
 Norwegian
 immigrant
 background


in
 late
 19th
 century
 America.
 His
 rural


upbringing
 during
 the
 populist
 era's


farmer
 versus
 banker
 conflicts
 fostered


skepticism
 toward
 financial
 elites.


Witnessing
 America's
 guilded
 age


inequality
 and
 the
 extravagant


consumption
 of
 industrial
 robber
 barons


shaped
 his
 critical
 stance
 while


repeated
 academic
 career
 setbacks


reinforced
 his
 outsider


position.
 In
 the
 theory
 of
 the
 leisure


class
 1899,
 Vevelin
 introduced


conspicuous
 consumption,
 purchasing


goods
 to
 display
 status
 rather
 than


fulfill
 needs.
 His
 economic
 theory


viewed
 behavior
 as
 shaped
 by
 social


institutions
 and
 evolutionary
 processes


rather
 than
 rational
 calculation.


Vebblelin
 criticized
 the
 disconnect


between
 financial
 speculation
 and


productive
 industry,
 identifying


business
 sabotage
 as
 profit-seeking
 that


reduced
 industrial
 efficiency
 by


highlighting
 how
 social
 institutions


drive
 economic
 behavior.
 Vebblein


pioneered
 evolutionary
 approaches
 to


economics
 and
 provided
 early
 insights


into
 consumer
 psychology,
 corporate


power,
 and
 technological
 change.


Keynesian
 economics.
 John
 Maynard
 Kanes.


Keynes
 developed
 his
 revolutionary
 ideas


in
 response
 to
 the
 Great
 Depression.


Born
 into
 Cambridge
 academic


aristocracy,
 he
 warned
 of
 disastrous


consequences
 from
 the
 Versail
 Treaty's


German
 reparations
 after
 serving
 in
 the


Treasury
 during
 World
 War
 I.
 The


Interwar
 Gold
 standards
 failure
 and


Britain's
 persistent
 unemployment


convinced
 him
 classical
 economics
 needed


revision.
 His
 Bloomsberry
 group


membership,
 artists
 and
 intellectuals


who
 rejected
 Victorian
 values
 gave
 him


courage
 to
 challenge
 orthodoxy.
 His
 1936


general
 theory
 revolutionized


macroeconomics
 by
 arguing
 aggregate


demand
 drives
 economic
 output
 and


markets
 don't
 automatically
 self-correct


during
 downturns.
 Kanes
 demonstrated
 how


rational
 decisions
 to
 save
 during


recessions
 collectively
 worsen


conditions.
 The
 paradox
 of
 thrift.
 He


advocated
 government
 spending
 during


downturns
 to
 stimulate
 demand
 when


private
 spending
 falters.
 His
 concepts


of
 multiplier
 effect,
 liquidity


preference,
 and
 effective
 demand


transformed
 economic
 analysis.
 Keynesian


economics
 fundamentally
 altered


government's
 economic
 role
 worldwide
 and


established
 macroeconomics
 as
 a
 distinct


field.
 Montoriism,
 Milton
 Freriedman.


Freriedman
 developed
 monitoism
 as
 an


intellectual
 contrarian
 during
 the


post-war
 Keynesian
 consensus.
 Born
 to


Jewish
 immigrant
 retailers
 during
 the


depression,
 his
 working-class
 background


shaped
 his
 belief
 in
 individual


opportunity
 over
 government
 assistance.


America's
 1970s
 stagflation,


simultaneous
 high
 inflation,
 and


unemployment
 seemed
 to
 validate
 his


critiques
 of
 Keynesian
 policies.
 While


his
 ideas
 gained
 political
 significance


against
 Soviet
 communism
 during
 the
 Cold


War,
 Freriedman's
 theory
 directly


challenged
 Keynesian
 dominance,
 arguing


that
 inflation
 is
 always
 and
 everywhere


a
 monetary
 phenomenon.
 He
 attributed
 the


Great
 Depression
 primarily
 to
 Federal


Reserve
 policy
 failures
 rather
 than


market


instability.
 Monitoriism
 emphasized


controlling
 money
 supply
 growth
 at
 a


steady
 rate
 to
 maintain
 price
 stability,


rejecting
 discretionary
 fiscal
 policy.


Freriedman
 advocated
 floating
 exchange


rates,
 minimal
 government
 intervention,


and
 free
 markets
 across
 various
 domains.


His
 empirically
 grounded
 approach


transformed
 monetary
 economics
 and


central
 banking
 practices
 worldwide,


shifting
 economic
 policy
 toward


inflation
 control.
 New
 Keynesian


economics,
 Gregory
 Manu,
 Olivier


Blanchard.
 New
 Keynesian
 economics


emerged
 as
 scholars
 sought
 middle
 ground


during
 the
 Keynesian
 monitoriist
 debates


of
 the
 1970s
 to
 80s.
 Manu
 and
 Blanchard


matured
 professionally
 during


computerization's
 revolution
 in
 economic


modeling,
 allowing
 more
 sophisticated


mathematical
 approaches.
 Their


intellectual
 development
 occurred


alongside
 rational
 expectations
 theories


rise
 and
 increasing
 global
 economic


integration
 while
 limitations
 of
 both


pure
 Keynesian
 and
 monetrist
 policies


became
 apparent.
 New
 Keynesian
 theory


maintains
 Keynes's
 emphasis
 on
 aggregate


demand
 while
 incorporating
 microeconomic


foundations
 and
 rational


expectations.
 It
 explains
 market


failures
 through
 concepts
 like
 menu


costs,
 expenses
 of
 changing
 prices,


efficiency
 wages,
 paying
 above
 market


wages
 to
 increase
 productivity
 and
 price


stickiness,
 resistance
 of
 prices
 to


change
 quickly.
 These
 market


imperfections
 prevent
 immediate
 market


clearing,
 justifying
 moderate
 government


intervention
 during
 downturns.
 Unlike


traditional
 Keynesians,
 they
 typically


favor
 monetary
 over
 fiscal
 policy.
 This


synthesis
 has
 become
 the
 dominant


framework
 for
 contemporary
 macroeconomic


policy,
 particularly
 in
 central
 banking.


Behavioral
 economics,
 Daniel
 Conaman,


Richard
 Thaylor.
 Behavioral
 economics


emerged
 from
 Conaman
 and
 Thaylor's


unique
 backgrounds
 outside
 mainstream


economics.
 Conne's
 experiences
 during


Nazi
 occupied
 France
 sparked
 his


interest
 in
 decision-making
 under


uncertainty.
 Trained
 as
 a
 psychologist,


he
 brought
 experimental
 methods
 to


economic
 questions.
 Taylor
 noticed
 as
 a


graduate
 student
 that
 economic
 theories


contradicted
 everyday
 behaviors.
 Their


insights
 gained
 acceptance
 following


financial
 crises
 that
 discredited


irrational
 market
 assumptions.
 Their


theory
 challenges
 the
 rational
 actor


assumption
 by
 demonstrating
 systematic


decision-making
 biases.
 They
 identified


cognitive
 patterns
 like
 loss
 aversion,


fearing
 losses
 more
 than
 valuing


equivalent
 gains,
 anchoring,
 overrelying


on
 first
 information
 encountered.
 Mental


accounting,
 treating
 money
 differently


based
 on
 categorization.
 and
 present


bias,
 overvaluing
 immediate
 rewards.


Thaylor
 developed
 nudge
 theory,
 showing


how
 choice
 architecture
 can
 guide
 people


toward
 welfare
 improving
 decisions
 while


preserving
 freedom
 by
 incorporating


psychological
 realism
 into
 economic


models.
 Behavioral
 economics
 has


transformed
 fields
 from
 finance
 to


public
 policy.
 New
 institutional


economics,
 Douglas
 North,
 Oliver


Williamson,
 Elellanar
 Astramm.
 New


institutional
 economics
 developed
 as


these
 scholars
 sought
 to
 explain
 why


traditional
 models
 failed
 across


different
 societies.
 North's
 merchant


seaman
 experience
 and
 economic
 history


research
 showed
 how
 institutions


determined
 development
 paths.
 Williamson


observed
 organizational
 structures
 that


neocclassical
 economics
 overlooked.


Astramm
 facing
 gender
 barriers
 in


academia
 studied
 how
 marginalized


communities
 successfully
 managed


resources
 without
 formal
 property


rights.
 Their
 work
 emerged
 during


decolonization
 when
 new
 nations
 were


establishing
 institutional
 frameworks.


Their
 theory
 examines
 how
 institutions


formal
 and
 informal
 rules
 governing


human
 interaction
 affect
 economic


performance.
 North
 demonstrated
 how


property
 rights,
 legal
 systems,
 and


cultural
 norms
 determine
 transaction


costs,
 and
 growth


trajectories.
 Williamson
 explained
 why


firms
 exist
 when
 markets
 could


theoretically
 coordinate
 activity.


Austramm
 challenged
 the
 tragedy
 of
 the


commons
 by
 documenting
 successful


community
 resource
 management
 without


privatization
 or
 government
 control.


This
 approach
 bridged
 economics
 with


political
 science
 and
 history,


explaining
 development
 differences


between
 nations
 and
 showing
 economic


performance
 depends
 on
 underlying


governance
 structures.
