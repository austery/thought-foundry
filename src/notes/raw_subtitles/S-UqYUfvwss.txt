- I think a lot of people don't realize
that investing is a
problem that's been solved.
We know what the average returns are
for equity, for fixed income.
We know what inflation looks
like over the long haul.
We know what the economy broadly does,
what the range looks like.
The variable, the wild card,
that we haven't yet solved
for is our own behavior.
There have been literally
thousands of books
telling people, "Here's how to invest,"
but you could do everything right
for years and years and years
and if you just make one or two mistakes,
all of that hard work goes out the window.
Instead of telling people what to do,
let's tell them what not to do.
Let me walk you through the biggest traps
that you should be aware of
that are a danger to
your financial wellbeing.
I'm Barry Ritholtz
and I'm chairman and
chief investment officer
of Ritholtz Wealth Management.
My new book is "How Not to Invest:
The Ideas, Numbers, and Behaviors
that Destroy Wealth
and How to Avoid Them."
- [Narrator] Chapter 1:
Why your brain makes you
a bad investor.
- So our brain is this
wonderfully evolved organ.
It's less than 5% of our body weight,
it consumes 20% of our energy,
and our big brains are what's helped us
essentially dominate the planet.
We're a social cooperative species.
We've evolved and adapted
in a very hostile world.
And all of the instinctual
lessons we've learned
over the past 2 million years,
all of the way we're wired,
are geared to keep us alive
in those sort of dangerous circumstances.
We're highly attuned
to existential threats.
We're primed towards action.
We tend to notice really bad news,
and we tend to ignore good news.
Why?
Because these are all
successful survival strategies
in the wild.
The modern markets have
existed for a century or two.
There were no municipal
bond markets 500 years ago.
There were barely equity
markets 400 years ago.
And so to imagine that 2
million years of evolution
somehow prepares you to make decisions.
You know, most of human history,
we live 20, 25, 30 years.
The idea of having to save and invest
for decades in the future,
it's just so out of our realm.
When we look at how stocks compound,
these are just far, far outside
of our instinctual experience.
We simply have a hard time imagining
the way that math works
because exponential math
didn't help keep you alive on the savanna.
And so we're in a situation where,
the pharmaceutical companies
call this off-label
when they give you a drug for a reason
that's not it's originally
intended purpose,
we use our brains off-label.
Our brains help keep us alive
in a hostile competitive environment.
We're using our brains today
to pick stocks, to make asset allocations,
to make long-term financial decisions.
We simply were never built for this.
And so it's in our
interest to be thoughtful,
to understand why we make these errors
and to try our best to avoid them
if we wanna succeed in
the financial markets.
So it's very useful for investors
to develop a little bit of a spidey sense,
a little bit of a self-awareness
as to what's motivating their behavior.
So let's talk about how our
own cognitive errors and biases
lead to bad decision making
when it comes to investing.
Let's talk about your limbic system.
I want to share a quote from a friend,
Dr. William Bernstein is a
neurologist and investor,
and he said the secret
to success in investing
is managing your limbic system.
That's the part of the brain
that's responsible for your
fight-or-flight response.
"Learn to control your limbic system
or else you will die poor."
That's a pretty strong statement,
but it comes from somebody
who's studied this
over the past few decades.
And our inability to manage our emotions,
our sense of greed and panic
often leads us to bad decisions.
I love the metaphor of
"Star Trek's" Mr. Spock
as a metaphor for the stock market, right?
Mr. Spock is half Vulcan, half human,
one half of his thought
process is very logical,
but he's also influenced by his emotions,
his mother's side of the equation.
And when we see the stock
market, the Spock market,
we see that very often
it's some rationality and
logic fighting with emotions.
Most of the time the
market is fairly rational.
It's a future discounting mechanism.
It takes stock prices and it says,
"Here's what our best estimates are
of future revenue and profits.
And that means prices should
be somewhere along this line."
There are times when the human
emotional half intervenes.
We see it when markets go
vertical, when things get crazy.
Think about late 1999 and
early 2000 when everybody said,
"I have to own me some of
these dot-coms," and piled in.
Sometimes it's to the bottom.
Think about March, 2009,
when people were convinced
stocks were going to zero.
The credit markets are frozen,
the government doesn't
know what it's doing,
stocks are going to zero.
And the people who capitulated,
the people who panic
sold, they regretted it.
When the S&P 500 hit 666
in early March of 2009,
that was a reflection of the emotionality
of all the people in the market
just panicking and fleeing.
Here we are 15 years
later, almost 10x higher.
Logic tells us that we need to
be invested for the long term
and also tells us that we
have to control our emotions
so we don't panic chase stocks up in 2000
and then panic sell stocks
at the lows in 2009.
So humans evolved emotions as
a way to help keep us alive,
to keep us alive on the savanna.
And so when you have this strong feeling,
your natural tendency is
to do something about it.
If it's fear, well you
wanna make the pain go away.
You wanna stop.
What that manifests itself
as during a market sell off
is a little bit of panic and people sell
because they're afraid they're
gonna lose their money.
The flip side of that is the greed button.
We're jealous, we're envious.
We wanna have not just money and wealth,
but we want to think of ourselves
as intelligent and successful.
And the way we do that
is by buying the stocks
that are going up the most.
And so when the market is rallying,
there is a tendency to stampede
into the best performers.
You know, the old joke is,
there's nothing more frustrating
than seeing the idiot
down the block become rich
when you are not.
And so FOMO, the fear of missing out,
is simply, "Why didn't I
buy Bitcoin at 50 cents?
Why aren't I in NVIDIA at $2?
Why didn't I buy gold at 500?"
On and on it goes.
The answer is there was no basis,
no rational, reasonable basis
for you to buy any of those
things at those prices.
Our emotions get in our way
because they're not part
of our long-term plan.
They're part of our evolutionary
wiring, our wetware.
Look at what took place
during the pandemic
with GameStop and Hertz and
all of these other companies
that skyrocketed in value
and then turned around and crashed.
These aren't investments,
these are speculative bets.
Hey, God bless anybody
who bought GameStop,
you know, at a buck and sold it, you know,
10 or 50 or a 100x higher.
I'm thrilled for people who do that.
The problem is most of us had no reason
to think that was any sort of investment.
It turned out to be a speculation.
Some people made money, a
lot of people lost money.
But the bottom line is,
that's not investing, that's speculation.
I am all in favor of
setting up a cowboy account
if you like that sort of thing.
Take 3, 4, 5% of your liquid net worth
and put it into a trading account.
Have at it.
Buy all the Bitcoin and GameStop
and stock options you want to trade with,
but understand two things.
If it works out, well, great.
It probably wouldn't have worked out
if it was all of your assets.
Imagine you have your
your stock allocation
and it's up 2x, 3x, 4x.
People start to panic
and say, "Hey, I gotta
protect these gains,"
instead of investing for the long run.
With 2, 3, 4%, you could let that run
and it doesn't really matter.
It's not gonna cause that sort of fear
of losing all your money.
On the other hand, if
it crashes and burns,
if it goes to zero, well
thank goodness it was 3%
and not your entire portfolio.
The advantage of a personal
account, a cowboy account,
is it doesn't matter how high
it goes or how low it goes,
if it scratches that itch from me,
it forces my big dumb lizard brain
to leave the rest of my money alone.
Another bias you should be
aware of is narrative fallacy.
Look, humans are storytelling animals.
We haven't had a written
language for most of our history.
In fact, it's only over
the past few hundred years
that most of us know
how to read and write.
And so telling compelling stories
was a really important way
to share information person to person,
generation to generation.
But the problem with that
is compelling stories
sometimes walk right past data
warning against danger,
warning against problems.
We've seen all sorts of different things
come out that attract our attention.
Different trading apps, NFTs, SPACs,
all these different investing products,
these financial products, they
have their moment in the sun,
they catch our attention.
Some people who are in
there early do well.
Everybody else who plows in late,
they're the suckers at the poker table,
they're left holding the bag.
And so we've seen all sorts of companies
with a great narrative tale around it
fail to see the data
supporting that narrative.
The numbers matter just as much,
if not more, than the narrative.
There's a tendency for
us to look at something
and say, "Hey, how hard can it be?"
Not realizing that most complex endeavors
involve practice and expertise and study
to become even marginally good at it.
In fact, there's an entire field
of study called the Dunning-Kruger effect
that the ability to
evaluate our own skillset,
also known as metacognition,
is in and of itself a discrete skill.
And so very often people
who lack a particular skill
are unaware that they
don't have that skill.
And you could see this in sports
and we see it in investing.
Newbies have a tendency to
not only be overconfident,
but also to have no set of awareness
of how lacking they are in skills.
And so this is why we
should make fewer decisions
and try and make less unforced errors.
So let's talk about confirmation bias.
The world is not black and white.
It's full of nuance and shades of gray.
No matter what position you're taking
about this stock or this sector
or whatever it is you want
to put your money into,
it's not that hard to find arguments
either in favor of that investment
or against that investment.
Confirmation is a problem
when we're thinking
about deploying capital
into a specific asset
and then go out seeking information
that just supports our view.
We're not doing research,
we're just making ourselves
feel better about buying this.
That's what confirmation bias is.
What we've learned is
that when we wanna buy
a particular stock or bond or asset,
we shouldn't seek confirming information.
We should seek disconfirming information,
meaning, "All right, I want to buy this.
Let me go out and find all the reasons
why I shouldn't buy this.
What are the risks? What are the dangers?
What else should I be
looking at instead of this?"
When we go out and try and
disconfirm our beliefs,
it's a more objective, fair
approach to doing research.
If we turn around and say,
"Hey, I can't find a compelling
reason not to buy this,"
after you've done your
disconfirming research,
that's a better decision
than just sifting through all
the stuff that's out there
and only reading the things
that agree with your point of view.
We all have this tendency
to live in our happy little bubble,
our happy little confirmation-bias bubble.
We watch the same TV channels,
we read the same things.
We look for information that tells us,
"You're smart, you're right.
You're doing this the correct way."
That's not the best way,
that's not the most effective
way to sift through news.
You should be able to make
the argument, pro or con,
on every investment in your portfolio.
If you can't argue for and against it,
you really haven't done the research.
When I was a kid,
I used to watch "Mutual
of Omaha's Wild Kingdom,"
and the show would open with this panorama
of the African savanna
and there'd be wildebeests
and all sorts of creatures
and zebras and gazelle's.
There was always that one gazelle
on the outside of the
pack, outside of the herd.
And you knew what was gonna happen.
There's safety in numbers.
There's safety in the herd.
When you're by yourself,
you eventually become somebody's lunch.
Humans evolved as social creatures.
You know, a human alone in the jungle
doesn't survive very long.
We don't have fangs or claws or armor.
By ourself we're very vulnerable.
But as part of a tribe,
as part as a troop,
we can be cooperative and
help ourselves get along.
That's why we have a bias
towards trusting other people,
towards believing other people.
Being a cooperative social primate,
it's really been enormously
beneficial to us.
Where that starts to hurt us in the market
is when the crowd is starting to sell,
when people start to panic,
the hardest thing in the world to do
is to go in the other direction.
And so people talk about,
"Let's buy low and sell high."
Buying low means buying
when most of your fellow
you people are selling
and your instinct is
to go along with them,
not lean against it.
It's really, really hard to do.
So loss aversion
is this interesting
evolutionary development
that we feel losses
just about twice as
intensely as we enjoy gains.
And when you think about what that means,
when the markets begin to
wobble, when they sell off,
it sends our bodies aflame.
It makes us concerned that
we're gonna lose our money,
we're gonna lose our investments.
And so loss aversion often leads us
to make bad spontaneous decisions
because, "Hey, we're down
5%, we better do something,
or we're gonna be down 10%."
What we really need to
learn is that markets
are down 5%, you know,
two, three times a year,
they're down 10% just about
two out of every three years.
Markets go up and down.
Risk and reward are two
sides of the same coin.
And if you wanna be in
it for the long term
to garner the reward, you
have to go through the risk,
through the drawdown, through
the difficult periods.
And that's where getting
your loss aversion,
at least understanding it,
you may never be able
to get under control,
but understanding it
and preventing it from
affecting your decision making
becomes really important.
So the way anchoring comes
up frequently in markets
is someone will buy a particular stock
and then turn around and
suddenly the stock is a loser.
It's below what they paid for it.
And I can't tell you how
many times I've heard this,
"Please just let me get back to break even
and I'll get back."
People get anchored on that price.
It affects how they look at the stock,
how they look at the asset.
We fixate on numbers and
allow them to affect us.
What you paid for a stock
has absolutely zero relevance
to where that price is gonna go.
The question you should ask yourself is,
"Hey, if I had fresh capital to invest,
would I buy this stock at this price?"
If the answer is no, it doesn't
matter what you paid for it,
then get out of that stock.
Perhaps the one that people pay
the least amount of attention to
but really should pay close attention to
are just something as simple as politics.
You know, we've seen
studies when we analyze
how a zip code has voted
in a presidential election
and then cross reference with that
with how their portfolios are invested.
This is all done anonymously
based on just zip codes.
Nobody's names are involved in this.
But it turns out that when your guy loses
in the presidential election
and most of your zip
code voted for that guy,
you have a tendency as a
group to get outta stocks.
And the reverse is true.
When your guy wins
and you're subsequently asked,
"How do you think the economy is doing?
How is the market doing?"
Suddenly your view of
the world goes way up.
It doesn't matter who wins
the presidential election.
If you're invested over the long haul,
you're gonna do better.
In fact, studies have shown
that whether a Democrat
is in the White House
or a Republican is in the White House,
it really makes no difference
to the long-term performance
of the stock market.
Presidents get way too much
credit for when things go well.
They get way too much blame
when things go poorly.
What really matters is the
ability to compound over decades.
And so that sort of tribalism,
that sort of rooting for
your team with your dollars
never seems to work out well.
The recency effect is one of my favorites.
Every month we get a data
point like nonfarm payrolls,
and month after month, year after year,
these come out in a string.
They're based on a model,
it's subject to revision,
it's kind of noisy.
More or less it gets it right.
Really, when you think about the data,
why do we spend so much
time paying attention
to the most recent nonfarm payroll?
Well, there's 330 million
people in America,
about 165 million people
in the labor force.
Each month, 3, 4 million
people leave their jobs.
Some quit, some retire,
some go on sabbatical or
maternity or paternity leave.
Some people just shuffle
off this mortal coil
and join the choir invisible.
At the same time, another 3 or
4 million people start work.
They graduate school, they switch jobs,
they return from maternity
leave or sabbatical.
And the difference
between those job quitters
and those job starters,
that's essentially the
nonfarm payroll report.
How many new bodies are in
the labor force and working
over what that number
looked like last month.
So when you think about
it, 50,000, 100,000,
200,000 people out of 165 million workers,
out of 330 million people,
it's a really tiny number.
And the model isn't perfect.
You know, the old joke
is all models are wrong,
but some are useful.
So when we get the Bureau
of Labor statistic data,
really what we wanna know
is, are we still on trend?
Are we still operating within the same,
more or less, parameters we've seen?
Most of the time, the answer is yes.
When we start to see things roll over,
when we start to see the
data change significantly
from prior months,
that's when you pay attention
and say, "All right,
this looks like something
significant is happening."
People live in the here and now,
we exist in this moment,
and what just happened very
much occupies our minds.
And so we have a tendency
to overemphasize whatever's
going on in the market
this day, this week.
We tend to ignore long-term trends.
We tend not to picture ourselves
10, 20 years in the future
and what our needs are gonna be.
This is just how we live.
This is just the nature
of of human beings.
Whenever I wanna figure out
the risk tolerance of
a particular investor,
I'm very cognizant that
if the market's going up,
they tend to say, "Oh, I'm okay with risk.
I'm a long-term investor. I'm aggressive."
If the market's been going
down for the past few weeks,
the same person will give
you a very different answer.
You know, "I'm a little conservative.
I'm a little averse to
volatility and risk."
They're not revealing their true nature.
They're essentially telling
you what's been happening.
We have a tendency to
overemphasize what's just happened
because that's the moment we live in.
We live in the here and now
and it affects how we interpret everything
that's going around us.
You know, we need to learn
to be long-term greedy,
to think about decades,
not short-term greedy,
thinking about the next 10 minutes.
- [Narrator] Chapter 2:
Investing is a loser's game.
Here's how to win it.
- So why do we even invest?
We wanna put our money to work
because 20, 30, 40 years from now,
we're gonna stop working and retire
and we're gonna need
something to pay our bills.
Most of us aren't gonna be able
to live on just social security.
And so we put our money to work
so that it'll compound faster
than the rate of inflation.
And really it's your job as an investor
to not interfere with
your portfolio's ability
to compound over that time.
The loser's game is a concept created
by Charlie Ellis in a paper
he wrote 30, 40 years ago.
Eventually it became a book
called "Winning the Loser's Game."
And Ellis, legendary guy,
chairman of the Yale Endowment,
on the Board of Directors
of the Vanguard Group.
Ellis noticed that investing and tennis
were both very similar in
that they're two games in one.
There's a winner's game
and a loser's game.
What does that mean?
Well, let's use tennis as Ellis's example.
There are two games in tennis,
the game the professionals
play, the top 0.01% of players,
and then there's the
game the rest of us play,
us 99.9% of the world who are amateurs.
How do the professionals play?
They play the winning game.
They win by scoring points.
They serve aces, they hit
with power and accuracy,
they kiss the line, they
do fancy drop shots,
lots of top spin.
They keep the ball away
from their opponent.
That's not how the loser's game is played.
That's not how the amateur plays.
How do us amateurs play?
We lose through unforced errors.
What sort of unforced errors?
We double fault 'cause we're
trying to serve too hard,
we hit the ball long, we hit it wide,
we hit it into the net, we
hit it right to our opponent.
Instead of trying to
play outside ourselves
beyond our own ability,
us amateur tennis players
just return the ball,
just keep it in play.
Don't try and kill it.
Don't try and hit the line.
You are not skillful enough to do that.
If you make fewer unforced errors
and you let your opponent
make those mistakes,
you will win the loser's
game by making less errors.
And so Ellis compared tennis to investing
and he found something really fascinating.
A handful of professionals,
a tiny number of people,
they can pick stocks and
know when to sell them.
They can identify which sector
or country to invest in.
They can time the markets.
That's the 0.01% of people.
And they're household names.
You know who Warren
Buffet or Peter Lynch is
because they're such outliers.
The rest of us, we're
playing the loser's game.
We're unfortunately underperforming
because we're making all of these errors.
We get emotional, we overtrade,
we don't pay attention to
costs, we ignore taxes.
We make all of these mistakes
that if only we avoided them,
we would do so much better.
That's why Ellis thought investing
and tennis were so similar.
Most of us are playing the loser's game
and playing it badly.
If we make fewer unforced errors,
we would just be so much better off.
So a number of academic studies
have found that a surprisingly
few percentage of stocks
are actually driving market returns.
Professor Hendrik Bessembinder
at Arizona State University
did a study and he found
that just 2% of stocks
are responsible for all the returns
that we've seen over the past 75 years.
Depending on the country you look at
maybe it's a little more, a little less,
but it averages around 2%.
How is that possible?
Well, some stocks are
up a little each year.
Some stocks are down a little each year.
Some stocks are flat. They
all kind of cancel out.
A handful of stocks are down a lot.
Some stocks get crushed and go to zero.
That leaves very few stocks
that are the giant winners
that drive returns.
In the context of the loser's game
where we wanna make fewer mistakes
every decision we make is
another opportunity for error.
And given how much the odds
are stacked against us,
if only 2% of stocks are
driving most of the returns,
what are the odds that we're gonna pick
that 1 in 50 stocks that's
gonna be a big winner?
First, you have to identify a company
that over the next 1, 3, 5, 10 years
is gonna grow its revenue and its profits.
That's hard to do.
Secondly, you have to buy
that stock at the right time
and at the right price.
Overpaying for a stock
isn't gonna help you at all.
Third, you have to be willing
to hold that through all the ups and downs
that company is gonna go through.
Economic cycles, missed
revenue expectations,
missed profits.
Stocks don't go up in a straight
line. They're up and down.
And sometimes when stocks pull back,
it's just a temporary setback
and eventually they recover.
Knowing when something is
just pulling back temporarily
or that its best days are behind it
and it's on the way down permanently,
that's a really difficult thing to do.
Emotionally we have all these
sunk costs in that stock.
We've researched it,
we've investigated it,
it's helped make us money.
We're loath to cut it loose
because, hey, we're tied up.
It's the endowment effect.
"I own it, therefore, it
has to be pretty good."
It's very, very difficult
to tell the difference between
a Microsoft and an Intel
both added to the Dow Jones
Industrial 25 years ago.
Microsoft has done exceedingly well.
Intel not so much.
How can you identify that in advance?
Being added to the Dow is
like, "Hey, you've made it."
This is the top group of stocks
as decided by the editors of Dow Jones.
And now when we look at the
performance of these two stocks,
they've gone in completely
different degrees.
The odds are stacked against you
being a successful stock picker.
And to put some numbers to that,
let's take a look at professional
mutual fund managers.
In any given year,
less than half of them
beat their benchmark,
meaning they're gonna do
better than the market.
So that's telling us fewer than 50%
are actually picking stocks better
than just a boring, cheap
index is performing.
You take that one year and
expand that out to five years,
it turns out 80% of them
fail to beat their benchmark.
You take that to 10 years
and it's over 90%, net of fees and taxes,
less than 1 in 10 mutual fund managers
beat their benchmark.
And over 20 years, it's virtually nobody.
And so understanding
how much the odds are stacked
against you as a stock picker
is why indexing has become
so popular these days.
People have figured out,
"I'm not gonna try and
pick the next NVIDIA,
I'm gonna buy all the stocks
and that way I'm guaranteed to own that."
And it prevents you from
allowing your behavioral errors
to interfere with your portfolio.
You are not selling a stock prematurely.
You're not timing the market.
If you do regular dollar cost average,
if you buy a chunk of stock,
you buy a specific index
every month, every paycheck,
you're guaranteed over the long haul
to do better than 99% of
your fellow investors.
So when you're thinking about
putting money in the market,
you need to have a plan.
And I try and lay out a number
of specific steps you can take
really to prevent yourself
from interfering with your money's ability
to compound in the market.
So first step is to automate the process.
Take the emotions out of it.
With your 401k or 403b
or whatever your
tax-deferred saving plan is,
you are making contributions
every paycheck.
If the market goes up, great.
It means what you bought before is higher.
If the market goes down, great.
You're buying more at a better price.
Over the fullness of time
that sort of dollar cost averaging,
every paycheck every month,
means that you are buying regardless
and the math tells us that's
the most effective way
to invest for the future.
Nobel Laureate Paul Samuelson
once said. "Investing should be boring.
It should be like watching
paint dry or grass grow.
If you wanna have some fun,
take $800 and go to Vegas and gamble.
Don't gamble with your portfolio."
Let's talk about diversification.
Investing is really a
very humbling exercise.
We all have to admit to ourselves
we don't know what stock, what commodity,
what sector, what
country, what asset class
is gonna do best this year.
You know, you get this quilt,
this patchwork showing year by year
what have been the best-performing
sectors in the market.
And it's completely
different year by year.
One year, REITs are at the
top of the league table.
The next year, it's tech stocks.
The next year, it's small cap value.
It's all but impossible to predict.
And so rather than throw
darts, rather than guess,
we own a broad diversified portfolio.
We own a little bit of everything.
And that means you're always participating
in the sector that's going up.
You probably wish you
had more of it this year,
and then next year when
it's not doing well,
you're happy that you didn't overload
that particular sector.
Diversification means
you're broadly participating
in every asset class
rather than speculating,
rather than guessing.
It's the best way to make sure
you own the best-performing assets.
You know, Jack Bogle,
founder of Vanguard Group, famously said,
"Instead of hunting for
a needle in a haystack,
just buy the whole haystack."
You have to be aware of costs.
That's just simple math.
The more you're paying for
a mutual funder and ETF,
the more that drags on your performance.
In fact, we've seen a number
of studies over the years
that over the course of 25, 30 years,
a high-cost portfolio,
everything else being equal,
will generate 20% less value
at the end of those 25, 30
years than a low-cost portfolio.
A study on the Bogle Effect,
Jack Bogle was the founder of Vanguard,
that specializes in very low-cost funds.
You could look at
BlackRock and State Street
are similarly low-cost
funds are known for that.
The Vanguard Effect has identified
that by 2016, Vanguard fee pressure
had essentially saved
investors $1 trillion
over the previous 30 years
since Vanguard launched in the mid 1970s.
Since 2016, over the next decade,
it's about another
trillion dollars in fees
that have been saved
by the Vanguard effect.
It's that much more money in portfolios,
it's that much more money
that's compound and that investors own.
And so fees matter a great deal.
Go back to the bad old
days of the 1960s and '70s,
mutual funds used to
cost one, one and a half,
2 % of your assets.
Some funds came with a
front end load of 5%.
In other words, you give
the fund company $100
and they invest $95 of it for you.
Think about what a drag
that is on returns.
And really the technology didn't exist
for us to understand this easily.
People just saw the markets
were going up from World War II
to, let's call it 1966,
was a really substantial gain in assets.
Nobody really focused on
what's driving these gains
and what are the headwinds
we're up against.
And then something similar took place
in the 1980s and '90s.
We had a big bull market.
Around the '70s and '80s
was when we first started
paying attention to the data
as to the drag fees put on performance.
So it's not just mutual
funds, it's transaction costs.
You know, it used to cost
3, 4, $500 to buy a stock.
It's free today.
We deregulated the
markets in the early '70s
and that allowed brokers
to compete on fees.
And we went from a few hundred
bucks to a hundred bucks.
I remember the commercials
for the various online trading
shops, $8 transactions.
Eventually that became free trading.
And so the cost structure of that is gone.
And then when we look
at what's taken place
with mutual funds and ETFs,
it used to be one, one and
a half, 2% to buy those.
They're well under half a percent today.
You could buy a broad
index like the S&P 500
or the Vanguard Total Market.
It's five bips.
The cost is practically nothing
and that just compounds in your favor.
The lower your cost, the more you keep
at the end of your investing life.
You know, back in the bad old days,
you would get a quarterly
update of your portfolio,
you'd get a statement
and it was a big deal.
Everybody sat around waiting
for their statements to arrive
and you would see how well you did.
And that was probably too
extreme in one direction.
Technology has given us the ability
to watch our portfolios second
by second, tick by tick.
That's too far in the other direction.
You should check your
portfolio occasionally
just to see how it's doing.
Monthly is probably plenty.
If you are concerned about
something in particular
and you start noticing
yourself checking your
portfolio more frequently,
sometimes that's a little bit of an alert
that, hey, maybe you have too much risk on
and you're too concerned
about your exposure,
or maybe we're entering a
period of market volatility
and that's gonna create an opportunity
for you to buy stocks at a cheaper price.
People talk about the
importance of rebalancing.
Let me give you a little context
of what rebalancing means
and how you should think about it.
The idea is that stocks
go up over the long run.
And so if you have a portfolio
that, let's say, is 70%
equities and 30% bonds,
in the event of a market sell off,
hey, maybe you end up 60%
equities and 40% bonds
because of how those two
asset classes have moved.
What we suggest to people
is that they rebalance into equities.
You sell a little bit of
the bonds that ran up,
you buy a little bit of
the equities that ran down.
And essentially what you're doing
is selling bonds high
and buying stocks low.
It's sort of counterintuitive.
The time to rebalance into equities
are when we have these deep
market corrections or drawdowns,
down 20, 30, 40%.
That's where you wanna engage that.
Most of the time you shouldn't really
be worrying too much about rebalancing.
I don't think it's that important
for the average investor's portfolio.
So, "Nobody knows anything,"
comes from William Goldman,
who was a screenwriter
in the '60s, '70s, '80s.
And he wrote a pretty scathing
confessional about Hollywood
and how bad executives in
the various studios were
at predicting which films would do well.
Almost all the studios
passed on "Star Wars,"
on "Raiders of the Lost Ark," on "E.T."
And it's only when one random person says,
"All right, let's give this a shot,"
that some of these movies go
on to become blockbusters,
despite most of Hollywood
not thinking there was anything there.
Taking that same concept
to the world of forecasts.
Forecasts are when a market
professional or expert
or talking head or pundit says,
"I believe this asset class
will be this price at this time."
Specific assets, specific
time and date, specific price.
And when we look back
through the history of expert forecasts,
it turns out that the experts
are no better than any of us.
Wharton professor Philip
Tetlock did a study on this.
He looked at thousands and
thousands of forecasts.
He found they were no better
than the average person's prediction.
And the average person's
prediction's pretty bad.
Just take a look at the past few years.
Heading into 2020,
nobody had a pandemic closing the economy.
Oh, and by the way, from March
till the end of the year,
the market's gonna rip up 69%.
That wasn't in anybody's forecast.
Nobody had the Russian
invasion of Ukraine in 2021.
2022, nobody had the Federal Reserve
raising interest rates 500 basis points,
sending stocks and bonds
down double digits.
That's a very rare occurrence
for stocks and bonds
to both be down that
much in the same year.
Hadn't happened for 40 years.
And so it turns out the future
is just so filled with random events
and unanticipated things occurring
that making forecasts out a year,
it's really a fool's errand.
And if we make our investments
based on these forecasts,
we're really destined to do poorly.
We have to be aware of our market timing
and becoming fearful
and emotional every time
the market has a pullback.
We look at the history of markets,
they're down 5% twice a year,
they're down 10% two out
of every three years,
and they're down 20% fairly regularly.
If you respond to every
time the market twitches,
you're gonna prevent your portfolio
from compounding over time.
We think we could time markets.
Here's the fascinating thing
about news and market timing.
Markets are pretty efficient.
You know, they're not
100% perfectly efficient,
but if you're seeing something
on a website, on TV, in a newspaper,
the odds are that every other person
with capital at risk in the markets
has not only seen it, but acted on that
and that news is already
reflected in stock prices.
So you see the cover of a magazine
or the headline in "The
Wall Street Journal,"
that information is already in the price.
To imagine that you're gonna read that
and then act on it
in a way that's gonna
be beneficial to you,
you're essentially trading
on old information.
I know we call it news, it's news to you,
but it's old to the market.
What studies have shown us
about people who sell
when markets make a low,
in other words, they
panic sell into a crash.
About 30% of these people
never return to equities ever again.
That's an amazing statistic.
Think about what happened
when people panic sold
January, February, March, 2009.
The market has had an incredible
run over the next 15 years,
and nearly a third of people
who sold into those lows
never got back into equities.
That's devastating to a
portfolio's performance.
Avoiding these unforced errors,
having a plan and sticking to it,
that's the secret of
winning the loser's game.
- [Narrator] Chapter
3: how financial media
sets investors up for failure.
- So the financial media business model,
people seem to think it's selling content,
selling news, selling analysis.
That's completely wrong.
The model is the media sells
an audience to advertisers.
In other words, they're
not selling content,
they're selling you.
You aggregate all these viewers,
readers, listeners, watchers,
and you sell them to a buying
audience of advertisers.
The problem with this model
is that it has been under
assault from technology
for 25, 30 years.
The brutal competition in the marketplace
has forced a lot of media
to become increasingly,
for lack of a better word, histrionic.
Very, very clickbait type headlines.
They know that they're now competing
with algorithms on social media.
It's become increasingly sensational
and not just in the way it
was sensational a century ago.
It's driven by algorithms.
We're checking multiple headlines
to see what gets the best response.
We know how TikTok and
Instagram's algos work.
They're constantly running
through millions and millions of users.
They're identifying what's
gonna keep them engaged longer.
And so it's not about
providing news or information,
it's about whatever holds your attention.
We are in the attention economy.
And what this means is we
think of media generally
as providing a service for us.
In reality, we are the service for them.
We are the crop that they
harvest and sell for advertisers.
What's so important and
so dangerous about this
to us as consumers
is that everything is presented
as an existential threat.
The one that I saw about 10, 15 years ago
started getting emails
over and over again,
"New York Stock Exchange margin debt
is at an all time high."
That makes me nervous.
And I don't know who
was spreading this news,
but after you get the third email
from a client saying,
"Hey, what do you guys think about this?"
Well, you go back and you research it.
What is margin debt?
Margin debt is the ability
to borrow against the value of your stock.
I'm not a big fan
of people borrowing
against their portfolios
to go spend their money elsewhere,
but it's a data point that
everybody seems to track.
As it turns out, that the
higher the stock market goes,
well, there's more value for
people to borrow against.
It doesn't give you any information
about what the market's
gonna do in the future.
Where are we gonna go?
The state of the economy.
high margin debt just
tells you stocks have risen
to the point where there's
more value to borrow against.
And so we have to be
able to put what happens
on a random Thursday in
2025 into context for,
"What does this mean if I'm
retiring in 2040 or 2050?"
Most of the time it's pretty meaningless.
But because it's such
a relentless fire hose
of noise and distractions,
they know how to push our buttons,
they know how to get you excited,
and we're wired for this.
Good news slips by, nobody
really pays attention.
My favorite example is
it took the newspapers
something like 15 years to
really talk about flying
after the Wright Brothers
first achieved heavier-than-air flight.
It's kind of an amazing thing.
Think about how flying
has changed the world.
Eh, it really didn't matter.
On the other hand,
every piece of bad news,
every terrifying statistic,
every potential war,
every threat to the economy,
it attacks us at a visceral way.
We are primed for bad news
and bad news primes us
towards our bias to action.
Most of the time, those
actions are contradictory
to our best interest in the markets.
You know, the old joke
on the trading desk was,
"Don't just do something, sit there."
Meaning don't follow every twitch,
every news story, every
TikTok, every Instagram,
don't interfere with your
portfolio's ability to compound.
Yet we're hardwired to make that mistake.
It's kept us alive on the
savanna for millions of years
and allowed us to become
the most successful species on the planet.
It just doesn't work very well
when you're trying to figure
out your asset allocation
or which municipal bond portfolio to buy.
So let's talk a little bit
about how the media abuses numbers.
Most of the time you'll
get a big scary number
and it'll be out of context.
There'll be no framing or context
to explain what that number is.
My favorite example is, "The
market was up 500 points today"
or, "The market dove 500 points."
Which market? Is that the S&P 500?
Well, that's a huge move.
That's a nearly 8% move.
That's very, very worrisome.
Is it the Dow Jones?
Well, if it's the Dow, it's less than 1%.
That's a normal trading range.
We see it in economic data all the time.
"This firm laid off 10,000 people."
Is that a lot or a little?
I can't answer that question
unless I know how many
people work for that firm.
If it's a regional manufacturer
with 25,000 employees,
well, 10,000 people laid off is giant.
If it's Walmart with
over 2 million employees,
that's like one person quitting
every fifth Walmart store.
Not very significant.
And so there's literally
a technical term for this.
It's called denominator blindness.
It's when you get the change in numbers
plus 5%, minus 100, whatever it is
but you don't get the context,
don't get the framing,
you don't get the denominator,
the bottom half of the fraction.
My favorite example
of big scary numbers wildly outta context
came along this summer.
It's the 50th anniversary
of the movie "Jaws."
I was a kid when "Jaws" came out.
People were terrified
to step in the ocean.
But when you look at
the dangers of sharks,
and the media certainly
played that up all summer,
it turns out that shark
attacks are exceedingly rare.
There were about 50 shark
attacks last year worldwide.
One fatality in 2024, 2 in 2023.
Most of the time there's a shark attack,
it's a surfer in a black wetsuit.
To a shark they look like a seal
and they're just taking a bite.
When it turns out that it
doesn't taste like a seal,
they tend to move on.
That gets reported everywhere.
What doesn't get reported?
It turns out in the United States,
more people died last
year falling out of bed
than were killed by sharks.
And you don't get that sort of context,
you don't get that sort
of data from the media.
They like things
that are big, exciting,
emotional, and scary.
Sharks were tailor-made for the media.
People dying rolling outta bed?
No one could be bothered with that.
It's not scary or exciting enough.
We want confident leaders
who are gonna tell us what's gonna happen,
and here's what we need to do to survive.
So when we flip on the
TV or open a website,
and there are two people debating
where the market's gonna go,
someone who's really specific and precise,
"Next year the Dow is gonna be 53,575,"
not only do we wanna believe
them, we tend to believe them.
The person who's more ambiguous,
"Well, a year is a really long time.
So many random events can happen.
Markets on average give us 10%.
Hey, if there isn't any
other geopolitical problems
or issues with inflation
or consumer spending,
maybe we're eight or 10% higher.
But who really knows?"
Everybody hates the honest
answer, "I don't know."
And they really like the specific answer.
Studies have shown us not only do we tend
to follow the person
who's being very specific,
that person tends to be
wrong much more frequently
than the person who says, "Really,
we don't know where the market's
gonna be a year from now.
But on average, 8, 10% seems
to be a reasonable forecast."
So I'm in an odd position
to be criticizing the media
because I'm both a producer
of news and content
and a consumer of news and content.
I've been writing publicly for 25 years.
My blog, The Big Picture,
is where I started.
I wrote a personal finance column
for "The Washington Post"
for a number of years.
And for the past decade, I've
been writing for "Bloomberg"
as well as hosting a podcast
"Masters in Business."
So I'm very conscious of
the content I produce.
I try not to engage in the sort
of recklessness that I see.
I don't wanna give a person a fish,
I want to give them the tools,
teach them to fish so they
can be better investors.
So that's a a little bit of a twist
that I'm on both sides of it.
As a consumer of news, I have
a set of rules that I follow.
It's not that I pay attention
to any one masthead,
publication, newspaper,
television show, et cetera.
I pay specific attention to the
people who have demonstrated
that they're worthy of my
attention, that they're value add.
And what those qualifications
are is, first, temperament.
I wanna follow someone
who's fairly cool and calm.
I want them to have a defendable,
repeatable process, right?
As opposed to someone
who just got lucky once.
I want them to have lived
through a few cycles.
Having lived through it a few times,
they have an expectation
of what's most likely to
happen over the long term.
And finally, I want them
to have an expertise
and to add value to a space
where I don't have an expertise.
I wanna learn from people who
understand market structure
or are experts in ETFs,
who understand real estate,
who've analyzed the economy or inflation
and bring some value to the table.
Not because I'm gonna change my portfolio
in response to these things,
just because it brings me a
little bit more understanding
of what's going on in the world.
The world is nuanced and
there are shades of gray.
It's not just everybody is terrible
and everything you see is awful
and just shut everything off.
That would be an easy solution.
What makes it challenging
is that so many people
that are in the media, on TV,
host a Substack or a YouTube channel,
have something valuable to offer.
You have to ask yourself
when you're paying
attention to these people,
"Is this a person that should
be on my all-star team?"
I always ask myself, "Who is this person?
What are they selling?
What conflicts of interest do they have?
And what's their track record like?"
And then their advice, I
always have to ask myself,
"Is this advice suitable for me?
This person doesn't know my
income, my savings, my tax rate.
Should I really be paying
attention to their advice?"
And always ask yourself, "What
are the opportunity costs
for tying up money in this investment
when I could just be following my plan
and that I have a high
degree of confidence
will work out over the long term?"
If you want to give them your money,
my suggestion is always make
sure they're a fiduciary.
Make sure they're legally obligated
to put your interests first.
So I've been critical of regular media,
but when you move towards
the realm of social media,
it's a whole nother level
of incompetency, bad
information, grifting,
and just simply dumb advice.
At least traditional media
has gatekeepers and editors
and someone saying, "Hey,
can we really say that?
That seems to be outrageous and wrong."
There's no such gatekeepers
on social media.
I find it really fascinating
to delve into some of the
worst aspects of this.
One of my favorite accounts on Twitter
is called TikTokInvestors.
And this person, who is an
anonymous investing professional,
goes out to TikTok and
Instagram and Facebook
and finds the dumbest,
worst advice they can find
and shares it on Twitter.
And some of the stuff is just hilarious.
The one I noticed most recently was,
"Here's how you turn a hundred dollars
into a million dollars.
All you need to do is follow my advice
and just make 1% a day.
1% a day compounded for 250 trading days
is $1 million and it
just costs you $2,000.
Sign up for my newsletter."
Stop and think about how
ridiculous the math is there.
The average return for a
professional mutual fund manager
or ETF manager underperforms the market,
which gives us about 10% a year.
More than half of professional
mutual fund managers
underperform their benchmark each year,
and that benchmark is about 10%.
To imagine that you're gonna compound
at 1% a day for 250
days is just ridiculous.
The tell is, "Subscribe to my
newsletter. It's only $2,000.
I'll share the secret."
The reality is, if you had a secret
of turning a hundred
dollars into a million,
why would you sell that to anyone?
Why wouldn't you just turn
a hundred into a million
and then a million into a hundred million?
If it's that effective, shut
up and deploy your own capital.
But the reality is, when people
are selling you something,
it's because they cannot
achieve what they're promising.
And the way they're gonna make money
is through your subscription dollars.
It's not just investing,
it's real estate advice,
it's career advice.
Tax advice is one of the
most outrageous things we see
on TikTok and elsewhere.
It's gotten so bad that the
Internal Revenue Service
had to produce a list of 47 pieces
of advice found on social
media that are wrong,
that will lead to interest, penalties,
and in some cases, jail time.
Know if you're in international waters
on a boat on April 15th,
that doesn't mean you don't owe taxes.
Some of the advice that's given
is just absurd, unsupported.
Nobody is vetting these people.
The fact that the IRS
had to put out a document
saying, "All this advice
is terrible and costly,"
tells you just how bad
the sort of Wild West
of social media can get.
So to sum up, you need
to have self-awareness.
You need to understand the
sort of errors we all make.
It's not that you're dumb,
It's not that you're a bad
investor, you are a human being
and you succumb to the
same cognitive errors,
the same mistakes, that all of us make.
And so you wanna prevent your
brain from getting in the way
of your portfolio's ability to compound.
And the way you do that is
you have a financial plan.
It's a diversified
portfolio of broad assets.
You allow it to compound over time.
You automate the investing process
and then you check it in frequently
and just stay out of your own way.
