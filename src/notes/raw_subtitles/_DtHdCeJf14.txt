All
 right.
 Hello
 everybody.
 Welcome
 back


to
 another
 episode
 of
 the
 market
 close.


We've
 got
 Netflix
 earnings
 on
 deck.
 This


will
 be
 officially
 starting
 off
 big
 tech


earnings.
 I
 am
 very
 excited
 for
 it.
 So,


we
 are
 going
 to
 see
 what
 Netflix
 can
 put


up.
 Netflix
 is
 up
 40%
 year
 to
 date.
 Uh,


but
 stock's
 been
 flat
 for
 the
 past
 three


months.
 So,
 today
 is
 going
 to
 be
 one
 of


those
 days
 where
 we
 see
 if
 Netflix
 can


put
 up
 some
 numbers
 that
 can
 get
 the


street
 excited.
 Maybe
 they
 finally


finally
 give
 us
 a
 stock
 split,
 which


would
 be
 very
 nice.
 Get
 this
 sucker
 down


to
 $120
 instead
 of
 $1,200.
 But,
 we're


going
 to
 see
 what
 ends
 up
 happening
 on


Netflix.
 Let
 me
 know
 if
 you
 own
 this


stock
 and
 we'll
 do
 the
 pump
 or
 dump


poll.
 Most
 of
 you
 guys
 said
 pump
 versus


dump
 in
 the
 morning.
 Uh
 we're
 going
 to


see
 what
 ends
 up
 happening
 with
 Netflix


today.
 On
 top
 of
 that,
 gold
 has
 its


worst
 day
 since
 April
 2013.


Gold
 is
 now
 basically
 at
 the
 intraday


lows.
 I
 think
 it
 got
 a
 little bit
 lower


than
 what
 it's
 at
 right
 now,
 but


essentially
 its
 first
 5%
 down
 day.
 That


is
 over
 one
 half
 trillion
 dollars
 of


market
 cap.
 That
 has
 left
 gold.
 Silver


down
 7.5%
 on
 the
 day.
 So
 obviously
 the


commodity
 trade
 has
 taken
 a
 bit
 of
 a


hiccup.
 We
 are
 going
 to
 discuss
 if
 this


is
 structural,
 if
 this
 is
 essentially


central
 banks
 liquidating,
 if
 more
 and


more
 people
 are
 getting
 too
 euphoric,
 so


the
 trade's
 getting
 overcrowded,
 but


whatever
 reason
 you
 want
 to
 give
 it,


today
 is
 one
 of
 those
 days
 where


commodities
 are
 taking
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 hit.


And
 then
 the
 sort
 of
 other
 big
 story


that
 we're
 seeing
 today
 is
 that
 the
 Dow


Jones
 is
 on
 track
 to
 potentially
 close


over
 47,000
 for
 the
 first
 time,
 which


would
 be
 quite
 crazy
 to
 see.
 Uh,
 sorry


to
 switch
 the
 camera,
 guys.
 I
 thought
 my


camera
 was
 charging
 for
 the
 past
 hour,


but
 it
 wasn't.
 So,
 camera
 is
 dead.
 It


should
 come
 back
 in
 about
 20
 minutes.


The
 S&P
 500
 though,
 pretty
 green
 for
 the


day.
 672.


672
 on
 the
 S&P
 500,
 which
 is
 not
 too


bad.
 Two
 bucks
 away
 from
 alltime
 highs.


At
 the
 same
 time,
 continuing
 with
 kind


of
 the
 trend
 we've
 been
 talking
 about


over
 the
 past
 couple
 of
 days.
 Uh,
 it's


not
 the
 prettiest
 for
 some
 of
 the


momentum
 names
 over
 the
 past
 week.
 As


you
 can
 see,
 Oaklo,
 DWave,
 Big
 Bear
 AI,


Regetti,
 INQ,
 SMR,
 Nanuclear,


MP,
 US.
 I
 didn't
 even
 know
 these
 stocks


were
 down
 this
 much
 over
 the
 past
 week,


but
 to
 make
 this
 post
 on
 Twitter,
 I
 had


to
 like
 look
 at
 their
 weak
 performances.


And
 yeah,
 it's
 not
 pretty.
 I
 mean,


ranging
 from
 15
 to
 30%
 across
 the
 board


in
 the
 actual
 market
 today,
 they
 also


took
 a
 bigger
 hit.
 Oaklo
 right
 here
 down


14%
 on
 the
 day.
 Dwave
 down
 7%
 on
 the


day.
 OQ
 down
 1%.
 Regetti
 was
 down
 I


believe
 about
 8.3%
 that
 loses
 40.
 SMR,


another
 nuclear
 name,
 that
 one
 was
 down


12%.
 Nanuclear
 that
 one's
 down
 today


8.3%
 even
 in
 AS
 which
 I
 think
 has
 a
 lot


more
 potential
 than
 the
 other
 names
 that


one
 is
 losing
 80
 down
 5%
 this
 morning.


So
 what
 is
 the
 takeaway
 from
 this?
 I


think
 the
 takeaway
 is
 that
 if
 the
 S&P
 is


able
 to
 hold
 on
 to
 basically
 alltime


highs
 I
 mean
 again
 674
 is
 the
 alltime


high.
 We're
 at
 672.
 If
 Nvidia
 is
 able
 to


hold
 on
 to
 180,
 if
 Tesla
 is
 able
 to
 hold


on
 to
 441,
 if
 Pound
 here
 is
 able
 to
 hold


on
 to
 180
 and
 all
 these
 other
 names
 are


not
 able
 to
 hold
 on
 to
 their
 momentum,


then
 maybe
 that
 momentum
 is
 fading
 and


maybe
 that
 momentum
 is
 rotating
 into


other
 names.
 I
 mean,
 take
 a
 look
 at
 Mr.


Amazon.
 Had
 one
 of
 the
 worst
 outages
 in


the
 past
 five
 years
 yesterday.
 Half
 the


internet
 shutdown.
 Stock
 hit
 223.
 It's


going
 to
 close
 above
 220,
 up
 2.23%


on
 the
 day.


So
 you
 got
 gold
 down,
 you
 got
 silver


down,
 you've
 got
 all
 the
 high
 momentum


plays
 down,
 not
 to
 mention
 Iran,
 which
 I


know
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 love
 that
 one


getting
 hit
 today,
 down
 7%,
 cipher
 down


10%,
 cleans
 down
 8%,
 Wolf
 down
 5%,
 Bit


Farms
 down
 9%.
 This
 thing
 was
 670
 or
 660


last
 Wednesday
 back
 down
 to
 450.


Marathon
 down
 4%.
 Ride
 down
 6%.
 The
 only


reason
 Galaxy
 is
 up
 is
 because
 they
 put


up
 good
 earnings
 and
 they
 put
 up


phenomenal
 earnings.
 They
 beat
 EPS
 by


200%.
 All
 these
 companies
 should
 be


forced
 to
 put
 up
 Galaxy
 types
 of
 results


to
 be
 able
 to
 get
 the
 premium
 and
 going


into
 earnings
 uh
 into
 the
 earning
 cycle


we're
 going
 to
 see
 what
 happens.
 But
 so


far
 they
 haven't
 done
 that.
 The
 rare


earth
 names
 the
 same
 thing.
 MP
 down
 10,


US
 down
 15,
 TMQ
 down
 nine,
 critical


metals
 down
 16,
 LAC
 down
 about
 1%.
 So
 I


think
 the
 real
 takeaway
 for
 this
 is
 the


fact
 that
 the
 S&P
 is
 almost
 at
 all
 time


highs.
 The
 fact
 that
 the
 Dow
 Jones
 might


close
 above
 40,000
 or
 47,000
 for
 the


first
 time
 ever
 in
 history.
 Yeah,
 it's


at
 46,9996.


That's
 not
 bearish.
 That
 is
 not
 bearish


by
 any
 sense
 of
 the
 imagination.
 That
 is


very
 bullish.
 It's
 just
 those
 high


momentum
 names
 are
 not
 able
 to
 hold
 on


to
 their
 momentum.
 And
 you
 know,
 we're


going
 to
 see
 if
 that
 momentum
 comes


back,
 if
 the
 earnings
 can
 change
 the


picture
 or
 if
 those
 names
 have


unfortunately
 created
 millions
 of
 bag


holders.
 But
 time
 will
 tell
 in
 terms
 of


how
 that
 plays
 out.
 Nvidia
 right
 there


181
 then
 the
 S&P
 500
 672.
 By
 the
 way,
 if


you
 bought
 that
 Google
 dip
 down
 to
 244,


you
 were
 rewarded.
 So,
 uh,
 OpenAI


released
 their
 browser.
 We
 saw
 what
 it


looks
 like.
 It's
 called
 Atlas.
 And


apparently
 once
 they
 announced
 that
 it


was
 called
 Atlas,
 everyone
 ended
 up


shrugging.
 So,
 you
 know,
 everyone


shrugged
 when
 they
 announced
 Atlas.
 But,


nonetheless,
 it
 is
 called
 Atlas.
 And
 I


mean,
 it
 looks
 kind
 of
 cool.
 It
 kind
 of


looks
 like
 Perplexity
 to
 be
 honest,
 but


uh,
 it's
 only
 available
 on
 Mac
 OS.
 Maybe


that's
 also
 a
 reason
 why
 Google
 got
 a


bit
 of
 a
 benefit
 because,
 uh,
 it's
 not


going
 to
 have
 widescale
 distribution.


But,
 there's
 the
 video
 that
 is
 on
 screen


and
 you
 can
 see


what's
 going
 on
 there?
 And
 uh
 look,
 it


looks
 like
 Google
 Chrome
 but
 with
 more


AI
 features.
 It
 looks
 like
 perplexity


with
 an
 AI
 assistant
 when
 you're
 asking


different
 questions.
 So,
 you
 know,
 I


mean,
 it
 it
 was
 not
 the
 most
 exciting.


That's
 why
 Google
 got
 back
 to
 252.


Google
 lost
 a
 100red
 billion
 in
 market


cap
 when
 OpenAI
 put
 out
 the
 tweet
 that


they're
 putting
 out
 a
 new
 browser.
 And


uh
 you
 know,
 a
 lot
 of
 that
 money
 seems


to
 have
 come
 back
 to
 Google
 because
 the


market
 doesn't
 care
 too
 much.
 So,
 dude,


I
 don't
 think
 this
 is
 a
 bare
 case
 for


Google.
 I
 mean,
 are
 we
 saying
 Google


Chrome's
 not
 going
 to
 add
 a
 little


chatbot
 on
 the
 side
 of
 whatever
 website


you
 are?
 Like,
 it
 has
 got
 to
 be
 a
 joke


to
 imagine
 that
 this
 is
 a
 massive


barecase
 for
 Chrome
 or
 for
 any
 of
 these


other
 browsers
 that
 already
 have
 a


monopoly
 because
 they
 can
 add
 all
 this


stuff
 anyway.
 So,
 I
 don't
 know.
 I'm
 not


super
 inspired
 by
 this.
 It
 looks
 cool.


I'm
 sure
 people
 will
 use
 it.
 I
 I
 just


don't
 think
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 that


differentiated
 from
 Chrome.
 And
 as
 a


result,
 I
 think
 that's
 why
 Google
 got
 a


bit
 of
 a
 benefit
 uh
 here.
 Thank
 you
 for


all
 those
 who
 recognize
 the
 Atlas


shrugged
 reference.
 Uh,
 I
 deeply
 deeply


appreciate
 it.
 I
 need
 to
 need
 to
 make


sure
 people
 people
 value
 some
 of my


jokes,
 even
 though
 it's
 not
 even
 an


original
 joke.
 I
 stole
 it
 from
 someone


else.
 Shout
 out
 to
 Douggee.
 I
 stole
 it


from
 Douggee.
 All
 right,
 so
 that's
 what


we
 got.
 Uh,
 in
 the
 context
 of
 Google.


Now,
 Beyond
 Meat,
 I
 don't
 know
 how
 to


explain
 this.
 Beyond
 Meat,
 quite


frankly,
 is
 beyond
 me.
 I
 don't
 know
 what


to
 say.
 372.
 It's
 up
 153%.
 At
 this


point,
 I
 think
 it's
 just
 getting


squeezed,
 and
 I
 don't
 think
 uh
 there's


any
 rationale
 behind
 it.
 They
 did


announce
 a
 Walmart
 partnership
 today.


Let
 me
 know
 in
 the
 chat
 if
 you
 made
 any


money
 on
 this
 one
 and
 if
 you
 uh
 if
 you


took
 any
 profits,
 if
 you
 sold
 any
 calls,


sold
 any
 puts,
 bought
 any
 puts
 on
 it.
 I


don't
 know
 what's
 going
 on.
 I
 mean,
 if


you
 bought
 puts
 on
 all
 the
 other
 high


momentum
 names
 that
 we
 talked
 about
 or


even
 the
 leverage
 short
 inverse
 ETFs,


you're
 having
 a
 great
 day.
 If
 you
 bought


puts
 on
 Beyond
 Meat,
 it's
 not
 having
 a


great
 day
 so
 far.
 Maybe
 this
 is
 the
 next


play
 to
 go
 down
 and
 this
 is
 a
 good


opportunity
 to
 buy
 puts
 on.
 But
 I
 also


don't
 understand
 why
 it's
 up
 in
 the


first
 place.
 152%
 on
 the
 day
 as
 it


continues
 to
 go
 green.
 Again,
 same
 thing


I've
 been
 saying
 for
 the
 past
 couple


weeks
 with
 a
 lot
 of the
 high
 momentum


names
 in
 the
 in
 the
 short
 term,
 it


really
 feels
 annoying
 when
 you're
 in
 a


stock
 like
 an
 Amazon
 or
 a
 Grab
 that's


not
 doing
 anything
 and
 Oaklo
 is
 going
 to


190.
 But
 then
 you
 kind
 of
 remember
 when


things
 come
 back
 down
 to
 reality,
 that's


the
 reason
 you
 don't
 take
 some
 of
 those


risks.
 So
 with
 Beyond
 Meat,
 you
 got
 to


be
 very
 careful
 trading
 this.
 But
 if


there
 was
 something
 legit,
 I
 would
 love


to
 know.
 I
 just
 don't
 see
 anything
 legit


outside
 of
 this
 Walmart
 partnership,


which
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 that's
 enough
 to


increase
 the
 market
 cap
 by
 about
 150%.


But
 that
 is
 green
 on
 the
 day.
 A
 couple


of
 you
 guys
 saying
 I
 made
 some
 money
 on


it.
 Yeah,
 I
 mean
 look,
 if
 you
 made
 some


money,
 you
 traded
 it,
 not
 too
 bad.
 It
 is


shorted
 more
 than
 50%.
 So,
 it
 looks
 like


that
 is
 the
 reason
 for
 the
 squeeze.
 It's


just
 a
 question
 is
 on
 if
 on
 if
 there's


actually
 going
 to
 be
 earnings
 to
 kind
 of


back
 up
 the
 nature
 of
 the
 squeeze
 that's


happening
 right
 now.
 Nabius,
 Nabius


getting
 hit.
 So,
 again,
 I
 did
 sell
 puts


at
 $98.
 Uh
 maybe
 I
 end
 up
 getting


assigned.
 Who
 knows?
 I've
 already
 told


you
 guys
 I
 started
 doing
 a
 deep
 dive
 on


Nebius.
 Uh
 I
 do
 want
 it
 below
 100.
 If
 I


end
 up
 getting
 at
 98,
 I
 will
 happily
 be


assigned
 on
 those
 shares.
 But
 uh
 this


one
 also
 took
 a
 breather
 today.
 Now
 I


don't
 think
 Nebis
 is
 like
 the
 other
 high


momentum
 names
 outside
 of
 the
 fact
 that


it
 ran
 up
 like
 crazy,
 but
 it
 ran
 up
 like


crazy
 with
 a
 story
 that
 was
 backed
 by


actual
 revenue
 and
 earnings,
 aka
 that


$19
 billion
 Microsoft
 deal
 that
 it
 got.


A
 lot of
 those
 other
 companies
 that
 ran


up,
 they
 didn't
 have
 that
 associated


with
 it.
 But
 again,
 at
 140,
 did
 it
 make


sense
 to
 go
 from
 60
 to
 140
 in
 two


months?
 Probably
 not.
 And
 it's
 taken
 a


breather.
 So
 it's
 still
 up
 250%
 year-to-


date.
 Just
 like
 Hood
 back
 down
 to
 130,


up
 from
 150,
 still
 up
 230%
 year
 to
 date.


I
 don't
 think
 anyone
 can
 complain
 about


that,
 but
 uh
 those
 names
 are
 a
 lot
 more


attractive
 than
 they
 were
 a
 couple
 weeks


ago.
 And
 it's
 not
 that
 crazy
 to
 see
 that


they're
 taking
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 uh
 of
 a


breather
 right
 here.
 So,
 that
 is
 what


you've
 got.
 Again,
 Beyond
 Meat
 is
 up
 on


that
 150%
 year-to-
 date.
 SoFi
 or
 or
 not


year
 to
 date,
 but
 on
 the
 date.
 Beyond


Me's
 actually
 down
 year
 to
 date
 with


this
 150%
 move
 for
 the
 year,
 which
 is


kind
 of
 crazy.
 SoFi
 2876
 trying
 to
 get


back
 up
 to
 29.
 Google
 again
 at
 250.
 Grab


at
 562.
 SMCI
 that's
 flat
 on
 the
 day.


Apple
 that
 is
 up.
 Apple
 did
 hit
 all-time


highs
 at
 one
 point
 at
 265.
 ELF
 is
 green.


PayPal's
 green.
 Salesforce
 is
 also


green.
 PayPal,
 Salesforce,
 Adobe,


Lululemon.
 And
 these
 are
 some
 of
 the


names
 that
 you
 had
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a


rotation
 outside
 of
 the
 uh
 the
 momentum


frothy
 names.
 And
 I
 don't
 think
 that's


too
 crazy.
 As
 you
 can
 see
 right
 here,


Service
 Now,
 Salesforce,
 Adobe,
 in
 it,


all
 those
 names
 that
 have
 really
 been


lagging
 over
 the
 past
 couple
 weeks.


Seems
 like
 people
 took
 their
 profits
 on


the
 other
 names
 and
 they
 rotated
 which


is
 very
 reasonable
 to
 see
 to
 see
 that


happen.
 Amit
 why
 didn't
 Galaxy
 pump?


Galaxy
 did
 pump.
 It
 was
 up
 12%
 at
 one


point
 and
 now
 it's
 going
 to
 close
 up
 7%


on
 the
 day.
 This
 stock
 is
 still
 up
 a
 lot


for
 the
 year
 as
 well.
 So
 I
 mean
 if
 you


expected
 a
 20%
 pump,
 yeah,
 you
 didn't


get
 that.
 But
 8%
 after
 earnings,
 I
 think


anyone
 would
 be
 happy
 to
 see
 it
 get
 some


of
 that
 momentum.
 The
 puts
 are
 for


Friday.
 The
 puts
 are
 for
 Friday.
 They


expire
 Friday.
 So,
 if
 it's
 below
 98
 on


Friday,
 I
 will
 be
 assigned
 some
 of
 those


shares.
 Uh,
 let
 me
 pull
 up
 this
 clip


right
 here.
 We
 got
 about
 four
 minutes


until
 the
 market
 closes.
 Uh,
 let's
 take


a
 look
 at
 the
 Netflix
 pump
 or
 dump.
 And


what
 do
 we
 have?
 62%
 of
 people
 saying


it'll
 pump.
 I'm
 gonna
 go
 with
 pump


because
 I
 think
 it's
 been
 plat
 past


three
 months
 and
 I
 think
 any
 level
 of


growth
 or
 guidance
 growth,
 we're
 not


going
 to
 get
 subscribers,
 but
 anything


in
 their
 advertising
 repertoire
 or
 what


they've
 been
 able
 to
 show
 in
 regards
 to


new
 forms
 of
 content
 going
 into
 the


holiday
 season,
 that
 could
 be
 bullish.


Here's
 what
 Tom
 Lee
 had
 to
 say
 about
 the


broader
 market
 and
 then
 we
 will
 get
 into


this
 market
 close.


>> We'll
 we'll
 add
 uh
 fun
 they
 fall
 back
 on


the
 former
 which
 is
 why
 they
 believe


that
 this
 move
 isn't
 over.


I'm
 I'm
 in
 that
 camp
 too,
 Scott.
 I
 think


that,
 you
 know,
 we're
 entering
 the
 sort


of
 critical
 last
 10
 weeks
 of
 the
 year
 at


a
 time
 when
 not
 only
 earnings
 are
 good,


uh,
 but
 we
 have
 a
 Fed
 that's
 going
 to


be,
 uh,
 in
 an
 easing
 cycle.
 Um,
 I
 think


they're
 going
 to
 there's
 going
 to
 be


some
 good
 news
 eventually
 on
 the


shutdown.
 And
 then
 we
 know
 that
 there


was
 already
 a
 bit
 of
 deleveraging
 that


took
 place
 about
 10
 days
 ago
 because
 of


that
 VIX
 spike
 and
 the
 headlines.
 And
 so


there's
 going
 to
 be,
 I
 think,
 a
 setup


for
 a
 chase
 into
 year
 end.
 So
 I
 think


all
 of
 this
 means
 that
 the
 S&P
 can
 close


at
 least
 at
 7,000.
 I
 I
 actually
 think


that's
 a
 low
 number
 um
 by
 the
 end
 of
 the


year.


>> You
 still
 do.
 So


>> all
 right.
 So
 you
 got
 Tom
 Lee
 continuing


to
 be
 bullish
 and
 his
 argument
 also


continue
 is
 continuing
 around
 this
 idea


that
 earnings
 growth
 is
 not
 going
 away.


By
 the
 way,
 it's
 not
 just
 Netflix.
 I'm


just
 realizing
 we
 got
 a
 bunch
 of
 other


companies.
 So,
 we
 have
 Netflix,
 we
 have


Intuitive
 Surgical
 uh
 robotics
 company,


we
 have
 Chub
 Limited,
 Buffett's
 in
 that


one.
 We
 have
 um
 uh
 Texas
 Instruments,


and
 we
 have
 Capital
 One.


Uh
 so,
 this
 is
 the
 watch
 list
 right


here.
 And
 we
 also
 have
 Capital
 One.
 So,


we
 have
 five
 companies.
 Jason
 will
 be
 on


in
 about
 25
 minutes.
 And
 guys,
 we're
 not


going
 to
 do
 a
 full
 technical
 Tuesday


today
 for
 two
 reasons.
 Number
 one,
 uh
 I


have
 to
 I
 have
 to
 leave
 at
 six
 o'clock,


so
 we're
 going to
 have
 to
 cut
 a
 little


bit
 short.
 But
 number
 two,
 uh
 we
 just


can't
 do
 a
 ton
 of
 TA
 before
 earnings


because
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 TA
 is
 irrelevant


going
 into
 earnings.
 So
 we're
 going
 to


do
 a
 bunch
 of
 stocks.
 We're
 not
 going
 to


do
 like
 50
 stocks
 like
 we
 usually
 do,


but
 uh
 we'll
 try
 to
 get
 some
 setups


discussed
 going
 into
 the
 earning
 cycle,


and
 he
 will
 be
 on
 in
 about
 30
 minutes.


But
 those
 are
 the
 companies
 we've
 got.


Netflix
 should
 be
 immediately
 after
 the


bell.
 So
 let's
 see
 what
 we've
 got
 going


on.
 Got
 about
 30
 seconds
 until
 this


market
 closes
 again.
 Thank
 you
 everybody


for
 being
 here.
 The
 majority
 of
 people


say
 pump.
 The
 majority
 of
 people
 say


pump.
 We
 should
 get
 Netflix
 results
 by


405
 latest


and
 then
 we're
 gonna
 see
 how
 this
 ends


up
 playing
 out.
 A
 couple
 people
 say
 they


own
 Chub
 ISRG.
 All
 right,
 so
 we
 got
 a


bunch
 of
 earnings.
 We
 are
 officially


back
 into
 tech
 earning
 season,
 folks.
 By


the
 way,
 The
 Street
 wants
 697
 a
 share


for
 Netflix.
 They
 want
 11.5
 billion
 in


revenue.
 They
 want
 697
 a
 share.
 EPS
 11.9


billion
 in
 revenue.
 Not
 sure
 why
 Tesla's


getting
 a
 red
 candle
 at
 the
 close.
 There


might
 be
 some
 news
 right
 there.
 We'll


cover
 it
 as
 soon
 as
 we
 get
 into
 the


close.
 But
 here
 we
 go.
 Tuesday,
 October


21st.
 Thank
 you
 everybody
 for
 being


here.
 4
 p.m.
 The
 stock
 market
 is
 now


closed.


All
 right,
 we
 are
 done
 for
 the
 day.
 S&P


500
 at
 671.
 The
 Dow
 Jones
 closed
 just


below
 47,000.


Almost
 hit
 that
 47,000
 level,
 but


46,928.


Not
 too
 bad
 for
 the
 Dow
 Jones
 and
 the


S&P
 maintaining
 some
 of
 this
 momentum.


Not
 sure
 what
 sent
 Tesla
 down


immediately
 as
 soon
 as
 we
 got
 into
 the


close.
 I'll
 try
 to
 see
 if
 there's
 any


headline.
 Um,
 but
 Netflix
 is
 going
 to
 be


the
 one
 that
 we
 look
 for.
 SoFi
 ended
 at


2874,
 AMD
 238,
 Tesla
 443,
 Nvidia
 181,


Pounder
 flat
 on
 the
 day
 at
 18161,
 Robin


Hood
 down
 about
 3%
 at
 131,
 Google
 at


2.36%
 down
 on
 the
 day,
 Grab
 was
 down


about
 1%.
 Amazon
 nice
 close
 above
 222,


2.58%.
 Salesforce
 up
 4%.
 Meta
 was


relatively
 flat.
 PayPal
 was
 up
 1.3.


Apple
 hit
 new
 all-time
 highs.
 Bitcoin,


by
 the
 way,
 we
 did
 get
 to
 114,
 came
 back


to
 111,
 but
 it's
 nice
 to
 see
 Bitcoin


gain
 3
 4%
 and
 gold
 lose
 four
 or
 five


percent.
 Maybe
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 rotation


that's
 happening
 right
 there.
 Ethereum


at
 4,000
 as
 well.
 Uh,
 as
 we
 get
 into


this
 market
 close,
 BMR,
 did
 we
 get
 a
 52


close?
 51.89
 on
 BMR.
 All right,
 Netflix.


Let's
 see
 what
 we've
 got.
 Oh,
 it's


dumping.
 It's
 dumping.
 That's
 a
 red


candle.


That
 is
 a
 red
 candle.
 We
 are
 down
 2.67%.


2.67%.


I
 will
 get
 you
 guys
 the
 numbers
 in
 just


one
 second.
 Let
 me
 pull
 this
 up.


Um,


let's
 see
 what
 we
 have
 on
 Netflix.
 All


right,
 so
 those
 who
 said
 dump
 so
 far
 are


correct
 based
 on
 what
 we're
 looking
 at


here.


Uh,
 don't
 have
 it
 yet.
 No
 one
 has
 the


numbers.
 Let
 me
 see
 if
 their
 website
 has


it.
 Usually
 Netflix
 is
 really
 good
 about


posting
 it
 immediately.
 Uh,
 we
 are
 also


not
 going
 to
 be
 watching
 the
 Netflix


call.
 Let
 me
 just
 say
 that
 right
 now.


We're
 not
 watching
 the
 Netflix
 call.
 If


you
 guys
 want
 to
 watch
 it,
 they
 do
 it
 on


their
 YouTube
 channel,
 but
 we
 are
 just


going
 to
 be
 going
 through
 the
 earnings


and
 then
 we'll
 keep
 going
 from
 there.


Okay,
 I
 think
 we
 have
 their
 letter
 to


shareholders.
 Cool.
 We
 got
 it.
 I
 don't


have
 the
 topline
 numbers,
 though.
 Let
 me


see
 if
 I
 can
 get
 these
 topline
 numbers.


Oh,
 here
 we
 go.
 All
 right.
 3Q
 revenue


11.5
 versus
 11.52.
 They
 missed
 on


revenue.
 Uh
 EPS.


Is
 that
 true?
 587
 versus
 694.


Dude,
 that's
 a
 that's
 a
 bad
 miss.
 That's


not
 a
 simple
 miss.
 Hold
 on.
 Netflix.


Yeah,
 they
 missed
 by
 16%.


587
 versus
 597.
 Revenue
 came
 in


relatively
 in
 line.
 Wow,
 I
 didn't
 expect


them
 to
 miss,
 bro.
 I
 did
 not
 expect
 them


to
 miss.
 EPS
 is
 up
 9%
 year-over-year.


Revenue
 is
 up
 17%.


Why
 did
 they
 miss
 that
 bad?
 7%
 down.


Oh
 boy.


Oh,
 that's
 ugly.
 1151.
 It's
 down
 80


bucks.
 1151.
 It's
 because
 of
 Elon.
 Is


this
 because
 of
 Elon?
 Oh,
 this
 might
 be


because
 of
 Elon.
 Maybe
 they
 spend
 too


much
 on
 content.
 Maybe.
 Dude,
 why
 the


Netflix
 is
 not
 a
 company
 that
 misses
 on


earnings,
 guys.
 If
 they
 miss,
 it's
 like


a
 one
 or
 two
 percent
 and
 maybe
 there's


some
 accounting
 thing
 that
 they
 like


it's
 not
 it's
 not
 supposed
 to
 miss
 by


17%.


That
 is
 weird.
 But
 as
 you
 can
 see
 right


there,
 the
 stock's
 getting
 hit.
 Maybe


this
 ends
 up
 being
 an
 opportunity
 for


people
 that
 come
 in.
 You
 got
 a
 little


bit
 of
 a
 bounce
 on
 1150
 back
 to
 1160,


but
 still
 the
 immediate
 reaction
 is


ugly.
 Uh,
 let
 me
 go
 to
 some
 of
 the
 other


companies
 and
 then
 we'll
 get
 into
 the


numbers.
 So,
 Intuitive
 Surgical,
 they


are
 green.
 Look
 at
 that.
 You
 got
 a
 nice


green
 candle
 right
 there,
 2%.
 Chubs
 is


up
 a
 little bit.
 Texas
 Instruments
 is


also
 down
 by
 about
 2%.
 And
 Capital
 One,


that's
 up
 just
 a
 little
 after
 hours.


Netflix
 is
 the
 real
 one
 that's
 getting


hit


pretty
 bad.


Wow.
 Did
 not
 expect
 that.
 Did
 not
 expect


that
 one.
 All right,
 here's
 their


shareholder
 letter.
 Let's
 read
 through
 a


little
 bit
 and
 see
 what
 they
 say.


Revenue
 in
 Q3
 grew
 17%
 in
 line
 with
 our


forecast.
 Operating
 margin
 of
 28%
 was


below
 our
 guidance
 of
 31.5%
 due
 to
 an


expense
 related
 to
 an
 ongoing
 dispute


with
 Brazilian
 tax
 authorities
 that
 was


not
 in
 our
 forecast.


Look
 at
 Netflix
 blaming
 the
 Brazilians.


Blaming
 the
 Brazilians.
 Engagement


remains
 healthy.
 We
 hit
 our
 highest


quarterly
 view
 share
 ever
 in
 the
 US
 and


the
 UK,
 which
 has
 grown
 15%
 and
 22%.


Then
 they
 talk
 about
 Canelo
 and
 Crawford


Wednesday.
 Uh,
 Happy
 Gilmore.
 This
 K-pop


Demon
 Hunters
 apparently
 was
 the
 biggest


thing
 in
 Q3
 for
 them.
 I
 don't
 even
 know


what
 K-pop
 Demon
 Hunters
 is,
 but
 that


became
 a
 big
 part
 of
 their
 story.
 11.5


billion
 in
 revenue.
 Operating
 income
 3.2


billion.
 Margin,
 look
 at
 that.
 Down
 6%


quarter
 over-arter.
 That's
 why
 the


freaking
 uh
 net
 income
 got
 hit
 as
 bad.


2.5
 versus
 3.1
 last
 quarter.
 Uh,
 and


then
 diluted
 EPS
 587
 versus
 690.
 the


major
 cancellations,
 but
 a
 lot
 of
 the


cancellations
 also
 happened
 in
 October,


right?
 Which
 is
 in
 Q4.
 So
 maybe
 that


whole
 woke
 uh
 protest
 maybe
 that
 started


near
 the
 end
 of
 September.
 If
 it
 did,


then
 that
 could
 have
 potentially


affected
 them,
 but
 maybe
 it
 was
 more
 so


in
 October.
 Um,
 okay.
 Guidance
 for
 next


quarter.


What
 do
 we
 have?
 Do
 we
 have
 any
 guidance


here?
 They
 don't
 give
 subscriber


guidance.


I
 don't
 know
 if
 they
 give
 actual
 regular


guidance.
 Let's
 see
 if
 we
 can
 get
 some


other
 coverage.


on
 Netflix,
 but
 these
 are


some
 of
 the
 core
 results
 that
 we
 have


right
 now.


>> Uh,
 yeah,
 that's
 right.
 Revenues
 right


in
 line
 with
 expectations
 at
 11.51


billion,
 but
 earnings
 a
 big
 miss.
 The


company
 reporting
 five
 $587
 in
 in


earnings
 in
 EPS.
 The
 estimate
 was
 for


$6.97.


The
 company
 explaining
 this
 saying
 that


our
 operating
 margin
 of
 28.2%
 2%
 was


versus
 the
 31.7%


uh
 street
 account
 estimate
 saying
 that


was
 below
 the
 guidance
 of
 31
 a.5%
 due
 to


an
 expense
 related
 to
 an
 ongoing
 dispute


with
 Brazilian
 tax
 authorities
 that
 was


not
 in
 our
 forecast.
 So
 explaining
 that


lower
 than
 anticipated
 operating
 margin


as
 a
 result
 of
 that
 Brazilian
 tax
 issue.


Um,
 and
 then
 one
 just
 little
 hint
 here.


The
 company
 does
 guide
 to
 Q4
 revenues


ahead
 of
 estimates
 and
 EPS
 a
 penny
 ahead


of
 the
 street
 account
 estimate.
 I'll
 be


back
 with
 more.
 Back
 over
 to
 you.


>> All
 right,
 Julia
 Borston,
 thanks.
 Shares


are
 down
 six.


>> Okay,
 so
 Netflix,
 we
 don't
 have
 any


other
 future
 guidance
 for
 Q4
 yet,
 but


those
 operating
 margins
 got
 hit
 pretty


bad.
 Netflix
 still
 down
 5%.
 Texas


Instruments,
 this
 one's
 getting
 hit
 as


well.
 Capital
 One's
 okay.
 Intuitive


Surgical,
 that
 one's
 getting
 a
 big


boost.


That
 one
 after
 hours
 is
 up
 9%
 as
 you
 can


see
 right
 there.
 So,
 looks
 like
 earnings


are
 pretty
 good
 there.
 Let
 me
 get
 those


numbers
 real
 quick.
 And
 there's
 some


other
 stocks
 that
 are
 getting
 hit.
 ESTs,


why
 is
 that
 down
 5%.
 Did
 they
 dilute?


They
 were
 already
 down
 5%
 intraday.
 So,


this
 is
 an
 11%
 move
 on
 as


uh
 there
 might
 be
 some
 dilution
 there.


There
 might
 be
 something
 else.
 Mattel,


why
 is
 Mattel
 down
 20%.


Bro,
 what
 is
 going
 on
 after
 hours
 here?


Uh,
 it
 is
 down
 14%,
 not
 20%.


What
 the
 hell
 is
 going
 on?
 What
 is
 going


on?
 Intuitive
 Surgical,
 they
 do
 have


their
 earnings.
 That
 was
 way
 better
 than


expected.
 Let
 me
 pull
 those
 up.
 But
 the


rest
 is
 getting
 hit.
 So,
 Capital
 One,


they
 beat
 by
 36%.
 595
 versus
 436.
 They


beat
 on
 revenue
 by
 2%.
 EPS
 is
 up
 32%


year-over-year.
 And
 revenue
 is
 up
 53%


year-over-year.
 So,
 Capital
 One
 not


doing
 too
 bad.
 Intuitive
 Surge
 beat
 by


21%
 on
 EPS.
 Not
 bad.
 240
 versus
 199.
 Uh


revenue
 beat
 by
 4%.
 Revenue
 is
 up
 23%.


EPS
 is
 up
 30%.
 They're
 growing
 like
 a


tech
 company
 even
 though
 they're
 not


necessarily
 a
 tech
 company.
 More
 in


robotics,
 but
 there
 is
 a
 lot
 of
 tech


involved
 in
 that.
 And
 that
 one
 is


putting
 up
 some
 good
 numbers.
 So
 ISRG
 up


now
 12%,
 Netflix
 still
 down
 five.
 Chubs


is
 flat.
 Texas
 Instruments
 that's
 down.


Mattel
 and
 ESTS.


Those
 are
 getting
 hit.
 Um,
 I'll
 try
 to


see
 what's
 going
 on
 with
 AS,


but
 I
 don't
 see
 it
 right
 now.


Dude,
 ugly
 way
 to
 start
 off
 big
 tech


earnings.
 That's
 not
 what
 you
 want
 to


see.
 Not
 a
 miss
 by
 Netflix.
 Now,


granted,
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 every
 big
 tech


company
 is
 going
 to
 have
 to
 deal
 with


Brazilian
 tax
 authorities,


but
 still.
 ESTs
 announces
 repurchase
 of


50
 million
 of
 convertible
 senior
 notes.


There
 it
 is.
 That'll
 do
 it.


That
 will
 do
 it.
 Now,
 granted,
 I
 don't


know
 if
 I
 mean,
 look,
 the
 stock
 ran
 up


to
 100.
 I
 mean,
 it
 was
 at
 36.
 I
 mean,


like,
 it's
 probably
 was
 due
 for
 a


breather.
 It's
 just
 you're
 getting
 it


with
 some
 catalyst
 that
 historically
 in


any
 stock
 when
 you
 try
 to
 do
 something


like
 this,
 especially
 after
 hours,
 it


tends
 to
 dump.
 And
 that's
 what
 you're


getting
 on
 AS.
 Now,
 here's
 the
 question,


right?
 Where
 are
 the
 dip
 buyers
 for
 an


AS?
 Where
 are
 the
 dip
 buyers
 for
 all


these
 high
 momentum
 names
 that
 are
 now


losing
 their
 momentum?
 A
 lot
 of
 times,


the
 dip
 buyers
 leave
 because
 they're


scared
 because
 they
 don't
 want
 to
 be


stuck
 bag
 holding.
 And
 so,
 this
 is
 where


it
 gets
 a
 little
 dicey
 on
 a
 lot
 of
 other


names
 that
 you
 see.
 Uh,
 let
 me
 pull
 up


some
 more
 stuff
 by
 Netflix


and
 see
 if
 we
 can
 get
 a
 little
 bit
 more.


Okay,
 so
 Netflix
 says,
 "As
 a
 reminder,


the
 guidance
 we
 provide
 is
 our
 actual


internal
 forecast
 at
 the
 time
 we
 report


in
 Q425."
 Here
 it
 is.
 We
 expect
 revenue


growth
 of
 17%
 driven
 by
 growth
 in


members
 pricing
 and
 ad
 revenue.
 We


project
 an
 op
 what
 23.9%


operating
 margins.
 That's
 better


year-over-year,
 but
 that's
 horrible


quarter
 over
 quarter.


That
 is
 a
 5%
 decline
 in
 Q4.
 Now,
 again,


it's
 better
 than
 Q4
 2024,
 which
 is
 what


the
 street
 cares
 about.
 But
 my
 goodness,


that
 is
 that's
 not
 exciting
 earnings
 for


a
 Netflix
 going
 into
 Q4.
 Let
 me
 say
 it's


not
 exciting
 guidance
 going
 into
 a
 Q4.


Not
 exciting
 guidance
 at
 all.
 Um,


and
 that
 is
 lower
 a
 little
 bit
 more


based
 on
 this
 Brazilian
 FX
 stuff
 that


they're
 also
 talking
 about.


All
 right,
 that's
 what
 you
 got
 on


Netflix.
 Admit
 they
 can't
 raise
 their


subscriptions
 anymore
 on
 the
 consumer.


That's
 why
 it's
 bad.
 Look,
 that's
 a
 good


point.
 I
 mean,
 this
 is
 a
 consumer-driven


company,
 obviously.
 Uh,
 stock
 is
 still


up
 40%
 year
 to
 date.
 Now,
 it's
 up,
 you


know,
 35%
 with
 a
 5%
 drop.
 But
 if
 people


are
 not
 willing
 to
 pay
 as
 much,
 maybe


that's
 also
 why
 the
 rumors
 came
 out
 this


morning
 about
 Netflix
 potentially


thinking
 of
 buying
 out
 Warner
 Brothers


because
 they
 need
 more
 content
 to
 get


people
 to
 subscribe
 and
 Warner
 Brothers


up
 13%
 on
 that
 news
 that
 Netflix
 or


Comcast
 might
 be
 thinking
 of
 buying


them.
 S&P
 down
 a
 little
 bit
 on
 this


Netflix
 earnings.
 Beyond
 Meat
 in
 the


after
 hours
 is
 pushing
 $4
 while
 Netflix


is
 dropping


30
 billion
 in
 market
 cap.
 Quite


incredible
 to
 see.


And


this
 is
 what
 you're
 seeing
 in
 terms
 of


the
 broader
 cycle
 for
 some
 of these
 big


tech
 earnings
 that
 are
 starting
 out.


Looks
 like
 ISRG
 was
 the
 best
 one.


Intuitive
 surgical
 520
 after
 hours.


Netflix
 the
 one
 taking
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 hit.


Let's
 get
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 coverage
 here


on
 Netflix
 and
 see
 what
 some
 of
 the


suits
 think
 and
 then
 we'll
 keep
 going


from
 there.


>> Talk
 with
 you.
 I
 think
 it's
 it's
 some
 of


each.
 I
 mean,
 I
 think
 we
 see
 it
 with


with
 smaller
 investors
 certainly.
 Um,


but
 I,
 you
 know,
 I
 I
 don't
 like
 to


classify
 active
 traders
 as
 strictly


retail.
 We're
 seeing
 them
 of
 all
 stripes


from
 large
 to
 small.
 Uh,
 but
 they
 are


just
 sort
 of
 jumping
 in.
 I
 I
 think
 you


know
 the
 the
 thing
 that
 we
 see
 at
 the


opening
 bell
 is
 just
 is
 the
 way
 they're


essentially
 reacting
 to
 the
 order
 flow


that
 does
 come
 in
 from
 smaller
 traders


who
 are
 putting
 in
 uh
 their
 orders


overnight
 for
 the
 open.
 But
 u
 you
 know


another
 bell
 that
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of


traders
 are
 reacting
 to
 is
 the
 alarm


clock
 because
 we
 often
 see
 futures
 uh


taking
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 lift
 higher
 somewhere


between
 6
 and
 7
 a.m.
 Eastern
 time.
 And


>> okay,
 they're
 talking
 about
 trading


versus
 Netflix.
 Uh,
 but
 I
 think
 they're


talking
 about
 that
 topic
 with
 the
 CBOE


potentially
 increasing
 the
 uh
 the


options
 trading
 window
 by
 2
 hours
 in
 the


morning
 and
 15
 minutes
 in
 the
 afternoon.


Um,
 and
 I
 guess
 that'll
 allow
 more


people
 to
 trade
 things
 like
 Netflix


early
 on
 in
 the
 day.
 But
 goodness,
 still


getting
 hit
 right
 here.
 Here
 are
 the


Texas
 Instruments
 as
 well.
 Where
 is
 HMS


by
 the
 way?
 We
 didn't
 look
 at
 that.
 Hims


after
 hours.
 Oh
 boy,
 it
 lost
 50.
 Hims


lost
 50.
 Closed
 right
 below
 50.
 4915.


This
 is
 another
 name
 had
 a
 lot
 of


momentum
 and
 that
 one's
 losing
 a
 bit
 of


it
 as
 well.


>> We
 are
 seeing
 a
 mixed
 report
 EPS
 of


a$148.
 So
 that's
 a
 penny
 light
 of
 what


the
 street
 anticipated.
 Revenues
 was
 a


beat
 $4.74
 billion.
 Uh
 that
 was
 7%


sequential
 growth.
 The
 company
 and
 their


press
 release
 saying
 they're
 seeing


growth
 across
 all
 markets.
 So
 that
 would


include
 auto.
 But
 you're
 seeing
 shares


down
 almost
 5%.
 Why
 guidance?
 Q4
 EPS


guidance
 uh
 came
 in
 light
 huge
 range


$1.113
 to
 a$149
 so
 really
 you
 know


hedging
 all
 bets
 over
 there
 big
 range


over
 there
 and
 that's
 less
 than
 expected


with
 Q4
 revenue
 guidance
 also
 a
 range


that
 was
 mostly
 below
 what
 analysts
 were


expecting
 and
 so
 that's
 adding
 to
 the


the
 share
 drop
 guys


>> all
 right
 Texas
 Instruments
 down
 Netflix


down
 ISRG
 up
 folks
 we
 got
 some
 breaking


news
 on
 DraftKings
 they
 just
 acquired
 a


prediction
 markets
 company
 DraftKings
 up


4%
 %
 these
 guys
 acquired


um


Railbird.
 I
 have
 never
 heard
 of
 Railbird


before,
 but
 that
 is
 a
 predictions


platform
 competing
 with
 KHI
 and
 Poly


Market.


I
 don't
 know,
 bro.
 So,
 I
 know
 the


stock's
 up
 here,
 but
 the
 fact
 that


DraftKings
 has
 to
 acquire
 a
 predictions


market
 company
 to
 compete,


I
 mean,
 it's
 going
 to
 show
 how
 or
 it
 is


at least
 emblematic
 of
 how
 much
 of
 the


market
 share
 in
 the
 betting
 ecosystem
 is


leaving
 a
 traditional
 company
 like


DraftKings
 and
 is
 going
 to
 a
 Robin
 Hood,


a
 Kali
 or
 a
 Poly
 Market.
 I
 mean,
 like


this
 acquisition
 is
 not
 the
 most
 bullish


to
 me.
 It
 is
 good
 for
 the
 company


because
 they
 have
 to
 compete,
 but
 it


also
 it's
 them
 admitting,
 hey,
 we
 need


some
 help
 because
 we're
 losing
 a
 lot
 of


the
 people
 that
 bet
 to
 other
 platforms.


DraftKings,
 though,
 is
 up
 5%
 after


hours.


So,
 you
 are
 Has
 anyone
 used
 Railbird


before?
 I've
 never
 heard
 of
 this


company.


Railbird?


Yeah.
 And
 it'll
 make
 all
 prediction


markets
 more
 competitive?
 But
 again,


rather
 than
 them
 build
 it
 on
 their
 own


or
 try
 to
 compete,
 they're
 just
 saying


we're
 going to
 have
 to
 acquire
 companies


to
 stay
 relevant
 in
 this
 uh
 ecosystem
 of


prediction
 markets.
 S&P
 500
 right
 there


670.79


that
 is
 still
 down
 a
 bit
 after
 hours


uh
 based
 on
 this
 Netflix
 number
 Netflix


right
 here
 1179
 all
 right
 so
 some
 people


are
 stepping
 in
 around
 that
 1150
 level


gold
 still
 down
 5%
 after
 hours


continuing
 to
 get
 hit


and
 Netflix
 is
 the
 one
 taking
 hit
 why
 is


Tesla
 down
 1%
 I
 don't
 see
 a
 reason
 for


that
 as
 getting
 demolished
 on
 this


offering
 unfortunately
 guys
 as
 wow
 12%


down
 after
 it
 was
 already
 down
 5%
 during


the
 day.


So
 there
 you
 go.
 AS
 7240


and
 then
 HIMS
 below
 50.
 AMD
 down
 one,


Grab
 down
 one,
 Reddit
 up
 one,
 and
 then


Amazon
 up
 2.4.
 Now
 look,
 I
 don't
 think


the
 Netflix
 thing
 is
 the
 most
 bearish.


It's
 just
 not
 fun
 to
 see
 big
 tech


earnings
 start
 off
 with
 a
 company


missing
 on
 EPS
 by
 17%.


But
 it
 also
 might
 be
 specific
 to
 Netflix


instead.


Uh
 Tesla
 did
 have
 massive
 put
 buying.


That
 is
 correct.
 The
 440
 put
 if
 I'm
 not


wrong
 for
 Friday.


Um
 I
 think
 it
 was
 close
 to
 like
 5
 10


million
 in
 premium
 that
 one
 got.
 So
 you


did
 have
 a
 lot
 more
 of
 the
 options


traders
 coming
 into
 Tesla.
 Uh
 let's
 see


what
 other
 earnings
 do
 we
 have
 if
 we
 had


any
 of
 them.
 Chubs
 looked
 like
 they
 put


up
 some
 decent
 results.
 So
 outside
 of


Netflix
 and
 Texas
 Instruments,
 the
 rest


of
 these
 companies
 were
 strong.
 Chub


right
 here
 up
 22%
 on
 EPS
 749
 versus
 615.


And
 they
 beat
 by
 15%
 14.8
 versus
 12.9.


They
 beat
 by
 a
 billion
 on
 revenue.
 Beat


by
 almost
 a
 dollar
 20
 on
 EPS.
 So
 that's


not
 a
 bad
 beat.
 This
 is
 for
 an
 insurance


company.
 It's
 not
 a
 super
 volatile


stock.
 Birkshire
 is
 heavy
 in
 this.
 Chubs


right
 there
 up
 2%


after
 hours.
 No
 stock
 split
 news.
 No


stock
 split
 news
 on
 on
 AS.
 Is
 Rocket
 Lab


getting
 hit
 because
 of
 that?
 Rocket
 Lab


down
 a
 little
 bit,
 but
 Rocket
 Lab
 did


not
 do
 an
 offering.
 Now,
 the
 offering
 is


relatively
 small
 at
 50
 million.
 I
 mean,


this
 is
 a
 $30
 billion
 company
 to
 so
 28


billion.
 So,
 I
 I
 guess
 people
 just
 don't


like
 the
 fact
 that
 they're
 doing
 an


offering.
 Seems
 a
 little
 bit
 knee-jerk,


but
 it's
 not
 some
 aggressive
 aggressive


massive
 offering
 that
 we're
 getting.
 Is


IN
 still
 dumping
 after
 hours?
 Wow.
 I


still
 getting
 hit
 5411.
 Where's
 Oaklow


after
 hours?
 138.
 A
 little
 bit
 of
 a


bounce
 on
 136.


Uh,
 and
 then
 D-Wave
 QBTS
 3240
 still
 down


5%
 on
 the
 day.


All right,
 that's
 what
 you
 got.
 For


those
 that
 said
 dump
 on
 Netflix,
 you


were
 correct.
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 this
 is
 a


good
 enough
 earnings
 for
 this
 thing
 to


move
 higher
 tomorrow.
 We're
 going
 to


have
 to
 really
 see
 if
 this
 one
 can


actually
 make
 a
 move.
 Here's
 the


coverage
 on
 Mattel
 and
 what's
 going
 on


with
 that.
 Oh,
 Mattel
 had
 earnings.


Okay,
 so
 Mattel
 had
 earnings.
 That's
 why


that
 stock


was
 getting
 hit.


If
 they're
 going
 to
 mention
 that
 though,


Kate
 Rogers
 has
 the
 numbers.
 Kate,


>> uh,
 they
 kind
 of
 mentioned
 it.
 Not


quite.
 Let's
 get
 through
 the
 numbers,


John.
 So,
 the
 stock
 uh,
 was
 down,
 you


can
 see
 9%.
 It
 was
 down
 as
 much
 as
 22%


on
 these
 Q3
 results,
 which
 are


disappointing.
 EPS
 89
 cents
 adjusted,


lower
 than
 the$1.7
 cents
 analysts
 were


looking
 for.
 Revenues
 1.74
 billion,
 also


lower
 uh,
 than
 the
 1.83
 billion
 analysts


were
 looking
 for.
 So,
 miss
 on
 the
 top


and
 bottom
 line.
 Uh
 there
 it
 does
 see


its
 fullear
 revenues
 in
 a
 range
 of


between
 1
 to
 3%
 uh
 versus
 1.2%


estimates.
 Also
 sees
 fullear
 adjusted


EPS
 in
 a
 range
 of
 $154
 to
 $166
 uh
 versus


161
 estimated.
 Uh
 also
 its
 adjusted


thirdarter
 gross
 margin
 was
 at
 50.2%


uh
 lower
 than
 the
 53.1%


it
 was
 a
 year
 ago.
 Uh
 a
 quote
 from
 the


CEO
 here.
 It
 says,
 "While
 our
 US


business
 was
 challenged
 in
 the
 third


quarter
 by
 industry-wide
 shifts
 in


retailer
 ordering
 patterns,
 the


fundamentals
 of
 our
 business
 are
 strong


with
 growth
 in
 consumer
 demand
 for
 our


products
 across
 every
 region
 since
 the


beginning
 of
 the
 fourth
 quarter.
 Orders


from
 retailers
 in
 the
 US
 have


accelerated
 significantly
 and
 our
 POS
 is


growing.
 Looking
 into
 the
 balance
 of
 the


year,
 we
 expect
 a
 good
 holiday
 season


for
 Mattel.
 Strong
 topline
 growth
 in
 the


fourth
 quarter.
 We
 are
 reiterating
 our


full
 year
 2025
 guidance
 and
 as
 you


mentioned
 advancing
 our
 strategy
 to
 grow


our
 IP
 driven
 toy
 business
 and
 expand


our
 entertainment
 offering
 which
 gets
 at


the
 K-pop
 demon
 hunters
 uh
 deal
 that


Netflix
 has
 with


>> Mattel
 still
 down
 based
 on
 those


numbers.
 I
 mean
 the
 fact
 that
 they're


reiterating
 their
 guidance
 at least
 is


not
 the
 worst
 in
 the
 world.
 That
 one


getting
 a
 bit
 of
 recovery
 but
 it
 was


getting
 hit
 before
 uh
 when
 the
 results


just
 came
 out.
 Beyond
 Meat
 again,
 there


you
 go.
 417.
 I
 mean
 it's
 obviously


taking
 a
 life
 of
 its
 own
 at
 this
 point.


Over
 1.8
 8
 billion
 shares
 have
 been


traded
 today
 on
 Beyond
 Meat.


I
 don't
 know
 if
 there's
 enough
 to


explain
 why,
 but
 uh
 yeah,
 we
 are
 looking


at
 that
 happen
 in
 front
 of
 us.
 I
 It
 was


shorted
 a
 good
 amount.
 So,
 I
 just
 don't


get
 the
 Walmart
 partnership
 is
 enough
 to


do
 this.
 Like,
 it's
 not
 OpenAI.
 Yeah,
 it


was
 shorted
 63%,
 guys.
 So,
 obviously


there's
 a
 squeeze
 that's
 happening
 right


here.
 But
 Walmart
 was
 enough
 to
 squeeze


this
 thing.
 not
 an
 AI
 company.


There
 definitely
 could
 have
 been
 a
 press


release
 they
 put
 out
 with
 OpenAI.


They're
 de
 like
 we're
 using
 LLM
 to


figure
 out
 how
 we
 can
 have
 better


manufacturing
 processes
 within
 our


supply
 chains
 and
 logistics.
 Like
 they


there's
 definitely
 something
 they
 could


have
 said
 with
 Open
 AI,
 but
 they
 picked


Walmart
 and
 there
 you
 go.
 It's


definitely
 Yeah,
 I
 agree.
 It's
 probably


FOMO
 as
 well.


Netflix
 down
 5%,
 Beyond
 Meat
 After
 Hours


up
 another
 20%
 after
 being
 up
 170%
 on


the
 day.
 Pretty
 incredible.
 Aid,
 can
 you


talk
 more
 about
 Hood?
 Hood
 is
 down


because
 crypto
 has
 taken
 a
 little
 bit
 of


a
 beating.
 The
 market's
 taking
 a
 little


bit
 of
 a
 beating.
 And
 quite
 frankly,


I've
 said
 this
 for
 the
 past
 two
 weeks.
 I


will
 reiterate
 it
 again.
 Hood
 did
 not


necessarily
 deserve
 to
 go
 from
 120
 to


150
 in
 5
 days.
 That
 probably
 didn't


deserve
 to
 happen.
 And
 as
 a
 result,
 it's


taking
 a
 breather,
 which
 is
 okay.
 Same


thing
 with
 Nebius
 going
 from
 95
 to
 140


in
 less
 than
 a
 month.
 Like
 that.
 It's


not
 normal
 for
 those
 stocks
 to
 just
 go


parabolic
 like
 that.
 if
 there's
 no


catalyst.
 And
 yes,
 the
 S&P
 500
 was
 a


catalyst,
 but
 Robin,
 it
 was
 trading
 at


$97.
 I
 remember
 because
 I
 bought
 it
 at


$97
 the
 day
 of
 the
 S&P
 announcement.


It's
 at
 130.
 That's
 $33
 of
 movement.
 I


mean,
 that's
 definitely
 a
 move.
 Does
 it


have
 to
 be
 $55
 of
 movement?
 No,
 it


doesn't
 have
 to.
 And
 so,
 I
 don't
 think


there's
 anything
 structural
 about
 it


outside
 of
 the
 fact
 that
 it
 got


overheated.
 And
 I
 think
 it's
 quite


healthy
 that
 it's
 taken
 a
 bit
 of
 a


breather.
 And
 people
 are
 probably
 seeing


a
 little
 bit
 more
 value
 in
 names
 like


Amazon
 that
 have
 been
 stuck
 for
 a
 while.


And
 as
 a
 result,
 that
 one's
 getting
 2.3%


on
 a
 move.
 Groper
 says
 it's
 not
 really


anything
 fundamental
 or
 Walmart.
 It's
 a


beaten
 down
 stock,
 heavily
 shorted.


Recent
 release
 of
 a
 lot
 of
 shares,
 which


I
 thought
 would
 reduce
 the
 share,


squeezes
 the
 chances,
 but
 apparently


not.


Yeah,
 I
 mean
 that
 also
 could
 be
 very


very
 fair
 on
 what's
 going
 on
 right
 here.


Mattel
 was
 down
 20%
 and
 now
 it's
 down


3%.
 So
 anyone
 who
 bought
 the
 dip
 right


there,
 now
 it's
 almost
 recovering.
 Now


it's
 barely
 down
 1%
 which
 is
 not
 too


crazy.
 Netflix,
 are
 we
 still
 getting


hit?
 Netflix
 still
 down
 about
 4.5%.


Here's
 Mark
 Mahaney.
 He's
 one
 of
 my


favorite
 analysts
 on
 some
 of
 these
 large


cap
 tech
 stocks.
 Here's
 his
 take
 on


what's
 going
 on
 with
 Netflix.


>> 67%
 the
 street
 for
 operating
 income
 and


it
 probably


>> of
 course
 I
 click
 on
 him
 and
 he
 says


67%.
 Of
 course
 I
 click
 on
 him
 and
 he


says
 67%.


Whatever
 meme
 that
 thing
 is
 is
 becoming


univer
 it's
 like
 it
 is
 like
 like
 it's


undeniable
 at
 this
 point.
 It
 is


undeniable
 what
 that
 thing
 is.
 would


have
 done
 I
 don't know
 $7.30
 something


like
 that.
 So
 you
 would
 have
 had
 your


kind
 of
 typical
 beat.
 Having
 said
 all


that
 I
 think
 the
 street
 would
 have


looking
 for
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 revenue


upside.
 Now
 this
 is
 a
 subscription


business
 a
 very
 large
 subscription


business.
 It's
 hard
 for
 any
 one
 kind
 of


spurt
 in
 consumer
 growth
 or
 active


customer
 growth
 reduction
 in
 retention


to
 really
 move
 the
 needles
 much
 in
 any


one
 quarter.
 But
 still
 in
 what
 is
 the


really
 the
 strongest
 content
 slate
 the


company's
 probably
 ever
 had
 in
 the
 back


half
 this
 year.
 you
 would
 expect
 just
 a


little
 bit
 more
 kind
 of
 revenue
 flow


through.
 It
 may
 well
 be
 that
 that


happens
 going
 into
 next
 year
 and
 which
 I


think
 is
 actually
 what's
 going
 to


happen.
 But
 but
 that
 I
 think
 that's
 the


real
 context
 behind
 this
 which
 is


everybody
 knew
 they
 had
 a
 really
 strong


content
 slate.
 Let's
 show
 a
 little
 bit


of
 revenue
 up
 revenue
 upside
 and
 I
 think


the
 stocks
 already
 starting
 to
 come
 back


uh
 uh
 up
 because
 people
 realize
 this
 is


all
 one
 timeish
 that
 the
 Brazilian


charge
 and
 they
 actually
 would
 have
 beat


uh
 earnings
 handly
 if
 you'd
 adjusted
 for


that.


>> Okay.
 Okay.
 So,
 uh,
 six,
 seven%
 you
 say,


uh,
 I
 I
 I
 can't
 let
 that
 go.
 But
 at


>> I
 cannot
 believe
 this
 is
 real
 life.
 I


cannot
 believe
 this
 is
 real
 life.


>> At
 the
 same
 time,
 this
 is
 a
 period
 that


we're
 moving
 into
 where
 Netflix
 is
 not


reporting
 subscriber
 growth.
 Is
 there


more
 volatility
 in
 the
 stock
 and
 perhaps


more
 exposure
 to
 bad
 news,
 even
 if
 it's


a
 one-off,
 because
 of
 that
 lack
 of


signal
 that
 investors
 might
 be
 used
 to?


>> Okay.
 Okay.
 Well,
 one,
 I
 wasn't
 planning


I
 wasn't
 intending
 to
 accept
 seven


reference,
 but
 thank
 you.
 It's


>> and
 then
 uh
 and
 then
 secondly,
 um
 uh
 I


actually
 think
 it's
 probably
 less


volatile
 not
 disclosing
 subs.
 I
 just


think
 it
 is.
 And
 I
 just,
 you
 know,
 like


a
 massive
 subscription
 business
 that


beats
 its
 subs
 or
 misses
 its
 subs
 by,


you
 know,
 u
 you
 know,
 a
 couple
 hundred


thousand,
 like
 it's
 less
 than
 a
 well


under
 a
 percent
 and
 the
 VOVA
 stock
 would


really
 aggressively
 react
 to
 that


number.
 So,
 I
 think
 it
 actually
 reduces


volatility
 to
 no
 longer
 disclose
 subs.
 I


think
 they
 should
 disclose
 subs
 though.


Don't
 be,
 you
 know,
 I'm
 going
 to
 be


clear
 about
 that.
 But
 but
 I
 don't
 think


it's
 I
 I
 think
 reducing
 it
 probably
 does


to
 some
 level
 reduce
 volatility.
 Now,


what
 we're
 going
 to
 need
 to
 hear,
 John,


on
 this
 call
 is
 let's
 talk
 about
 Warner.


I
 I
 don't
 think
 I'd
 be
 surprised
 if


Netflix
 really
 made
 a
 push
 for
 this,
 but


let's
 let's
 talk
 about
 I'm
 sure
 they


won't
 talk
 about
 directly,
 but
 let's


let's
 talk
 about
 it.
 And
 then
 let's
 talk


about
 live
 events
 and
 let's
 talk
 about


advertising
 and
 engagement.
 Three
 areas


we
 want
 to
 focus
 on
 this
 call.


>> Yeah,
 you
 took
 the
 words
 right
 out
 of
 my


mouth,
 Mark,
 and
 that
 is
 M&A.
 Is
 Netflix


in
 the
 market
 as
 a
 buyer
 potentially?


whether
 it
 is
 Warner
 Brothers
 Discovery


or
 something
 else.


>> I
 don't
 think
 so.
 But
 I
 think
 they're
 in


the
 market
 as
 a
 bidder.
 Um,
 you
 know,


the
 the
 the
 reports
 about
 them
 bidding


on
 UEIFA,
 the
 European
 League
 Soccer


football
 uh
 rights,
 like
 I
 think
 that's


the
 next
 leg
 of
 growth.
 I
 think
 there's


two
 major
 new
 legs
 of
 growth
 for
 for
 uh


for
 Netflix.
 One
 is
 ramping
 up
 that
 ad


revenue
 and
 when
 they
 had
 that
 ABNB
 uh


deal
 uh
 you
 know
 in
 recorder
 like
 you


get
 one
 of the
 top
 20
 global
 brand


advertisers
 on
 Netflix,
 more
 are
 coming.


The
 second
 one
 is
 getting
 more
 live


events
 and
 sports
 content
 on
 on
 the


site.
 Look
 at
 Netflix
 is
 fin
 you
 know


fantastically
 popular
 in
 North
 America


and
 in
 other
 markets
 70%
 of
 the


population
 whatever
 but
 you
 layer
 in
 a


lot
 of
 popular
 live
 sports
 that'll
 go
 to


80
 85%.
 I
 think
 it's
 a
 real
 legitimate


leg
 of
 growth
 and
 I
 think
 every
 year


they
 get
 more
 and
 more
 cash
 they
 get


more
 and
 more
 firepower
 to
 go
 and
 and


economically
 bid
 for
 those
 sports


rights.
 So
 I
 I
 think
 investors
 want
 to


see
 some
 of
 those
 deals
 come
 through.


What
 do
 you
 think,
 and
 maybe
 this
 is


over
 the
 medium
 to
 longer
 term,
 what
 do


you
 think
 happens
 to
 content
 spend
 at


Netflix
 and
 others,
 especially
 given
 the


comments
 they
 made
 about
 generative
 AI


and
 this
 idea
 of
 empowering
 creators?


>> Well,
 I
 think
 content
 spend
 at
 Netflix,


I
 think
 they've
 got
 a
 really
 wellworn


formula
 that's
 worked
 for
 them.
 Keep


increasing
 it
 every
 year,
 but
 just


increase
 it
 by
 less
 than
 revenue
 grows.


And,
 you
 know,
 going
 to
 up
 it
 by
 a


billion
 a
 year.
 I
 think
 in
 5
 years,


we'll
 be
 talking
 about
 the
 25
 billion
 a


year
 that
 uh
 that
 Netflix
 spends
 on


content.
 I
 think
 that's
 the
 right


strategy
 and
 uh
 and
 it
 allow
 also
 just


gives
 you
 more
 cover
 with
 which
 to
 buy


um
 you
 know
 different
 types
 of
 uh
 rights


uh
 and
 that
 is
 you
 know
 live
 sports
 live


live
 events
 and
 then
 on
 AI
 look
 I'm
 in
 a


camp
 I
 don't
 think
 AI
 is
 disruptive
 to


Netflix
 I
 think
 it's
 actually
 a
 huge
 win


and
 I
 just
 throw
 simple
 economics
 by


people
 which
 is
 because
 I've
 had
 this


debate
 with
 a
 lot
 of
 investors
 or


discussion
 with
 a
 lot
 of
 investors
 if


you
 get
 more
 content
 created
 by
 AI
 you


get
 more
 AI
 content
 creators
 it
 just


you're
 increasing
 the
 supply
 of
 people


who
 are
 trying
 to
 monetize
 great


content.
 How
 do
 you
 monetize
 great


content?
 You
 sell
 it
 to
 the
 platform,


the
 network
 that's
 writing
 the
 biggest


checks,
 and
 that's
 Netflix.
 So,
 I


actually
 think
 it's
 you
 diversify
 your


supply
 base,
 basic
 economics.
 It's


better
 for
 the
 the
 network
 in
 the


middle,
 the
 the
 video
 entertainment


network
 in
 the
 middle,
 and
 that's
 that's


Netflix.
 I
 think
 it's
 a
 beneficial
 trend


for
 them.


>> All
 right,
 Mark
 M.


>> That's
 what
 you
 got
 on
 Netflix.
 Now,


look,
 by
 the
 way,
 Beyond
 Meat
 450.
 This


thing
 is
 uh
 it's
 trying
 to
 go
 to
 five


and
 you
 got
 a
 lot
 of
 traders
 probably


jumping
 in
 and
 out
 of
 it.
 Look
 at
 that.


456.


It's
 just
 going
 higher.
 It's
 just
 going


higher.
 Um
 look,
 let
 me
 be
 clear.
 The


Netflix
 earnings
 is
 not
 bearish.
 It
 is


short-term
 just
 not
 up
 to
 the
 street


expectations.
 As
 Mark
 Mahaney
 said,


Netflix
 has
 massive
 opportunities,


massive
 growth
 catalysts,
 massive


different
 ways
 they
 can
 acquire
 and
 get


into
 sports
 and
 all
 that
 stuff.
 So,
 if


you're
 a
 long-term
 shareholder
 of


Netflix,
 so
 you
 look
 at
 this
 quarter
 and


like,
 "All
 right,
 whatever."
 down
 5%,


who
 cares?
 Uh,
 but
 if
 you
 were
 trading


this
 quarter
 or
 if
 you
 thought,
 hey,
 you


know,
 I
 think
 Netflix
 is
 going
 to


definitively
 beat,
 it
 absolutely
 came


below
 expectations
 for
 something
 that,


you
 know,
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 probably


didn't
 anticipate.
 This
 is
 why
 the
 stock


market
 is
 so
 ruthless.
 I
 mean,
 there


there's
 probably
 not
 a
 ton
 of
 people


that
 knew
 that
 they
 were
 having
 issues


with
 Brazilian
 tax
 authorities
 that
 led


to
 a
 7%
 decline
 in
 operating
 margins,


leading
 them
 to
 miss
 EPS
 by
 20%.
 Like,


you
 just
 don't
 know
 some
 of
 this
 stuff.


And
 as
 a
 result,
 Netflix
 taking
 that
 hit


after
 hours,
 but
 long-term
 shouldn't
 be


the
 worst
 thing
 in
 the
 world
 for
 them.


S&P
 500
 recovering
 a
 little
 bit
 after


hours
 671,
 Beyond
 Meat
 470.


That
 one
 not
 slowing
 down.


That
 one
 not
 slowing
 down.
 Yeah,
 dude.


The
 Beyond
 Meat
 story
 is
 so
 funny
 for
 me


because
 I'
 I've
 told
 you
 guys
 this
 story


before,
 but
 some
 of
 you
 guys
 remember
 it


right
 here.
 I
 I
 was
 I
 was
 on
 a
 a
 date


with
 a
 girl
 and
 she
 was
 like,
 I
 want
 to


invest
 in
 uh
 ethical
 companies.
 And
 I


told
 her
 Tesla
 and
 she
 was
 like,
 "No,


Elon
 Musk
 is
 a
 fascist."
 And
 I
 was
 like,


"Okay,
 what
 is
 what
 is
 your


interpretation
 of
 ethical
 companies?"


And
 she
 was
 like,
 "Well,
 Beyond
 Meat."


I
 was
 like,
 "All
 right,
 good
 luck."


Well,
 Beyond
 Meat,
 I
 mean,
 I
 don't
 know


what
 her
 average
 is
 if
 she
 ever
 made
 the


investment,
 but
 you
 know,
 definitely


Tesla's
 not
 up
 220%
 after
 hours,
 but


Beyond
 Meat
 is
 No
 way.
 She
 said
 that,


dude.
 She
 said
 that.
 I
 promise
 you.


She's
 She's
 like
 into
 this
 whole


environmental
 vegan
 stuff,
 or
 she
 was
 at


the
 time.
 I
 don't
 know
 anymore,
 but
 she


said,
 "No,
 Elon's
 a
 fascist
 and
 Beyond


Meat
 is
 more
 ethical
 for
 the


environment."
 I
 was
 like, "Okay,
 that's


that's
 fine."
 S&P
 500
 right
 there,
 671.


All right,
 let
 me
 give
 you
 guys
 a
 couple


of
 headlines
 and
 then
 we
 will
 get
 into


technical
 Tuesday
 and
 we'll
 we'll
 keep


going
 from
 there.
 First
 of
 all,
 remember


when
 Broadcom
 said
 we
 have
 a
 mystery10


billion
 comfort
 uh
 10
 mill$10
 billion


company?
 Uh
 Mazuo
 thinks
 it
 is


anthropic.
 Misuho
 thinks
 it
 is


anthropic.
 So
 Mizuo,
 a
 lot
 of
 people


thought
 it
 was
 OpenAI.
 OpenAI
 ended
 up


send
 basically
 signing
 like
 a
 hundred


billion
 dollar
 deal
 with
 with
 Broadcom.


Instead,
 Mizuo
 came
 out
 today
 and
 said,


"Hey,
 it's
 probably
 Enthropic."
 Now,


Enthropic
 was
 also
 revealed
 potentially


to
 be
 paying
 $2.6
 billion
 to
 AWS
 over


the
 past
 nine
 months
 along
 with
 tripling


their
 revenue
 forecast
 for
 2026.
 So


obviously
 Broadcom
 has
 the
 money
 to


afford
 it.
 They
 are
 not
 profitable,
 but


the
 fact
 that
 they
 are
 getting
 a
 bed


with
 Broadcom
 to
 make
 a
 custom
 ASIC
 is


quite
 incredible
 to
 see
 how
 that's


playing
 out.
 Another
 headline
 that
 I


thought
 was
 really
 important
 today,


Black
 Rockck
 ETFs
 have
 bought
 over
 three


billion
 worth
 of
 bonds
 backing
 Meta's


massive
 27
 billion
 data
 center
 project


in
 Louisiana.
 This
 was
 the
 data
 center


project
 that
 um
 Zucks
 was
 bragging
 about


with
 Trump
 in
 the
 White
 House
 when
 when


Trump
 was
 saying,
 "How
 much
 are
 you


spending?"
 And
 Zux
 was
 like
 throwing
 out


all
 these
 numbers.
 Apparently
 80%
 of


this
 is
 owned
 by
 Blue
 Owl.
 20%
 is
 by


Meta.
 And
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 bonds
 have
 been


bought
 up
 by
 the
 Black
 Rockck
 ETFs.


Black
 Rockck,
 Larry
 Frink
 has
 talked


about
 the
 $4.5
 trillion
 opportunity
 over


the
 next
 decade
 to
 attack
 data
 centers.


So,
 it
 makes
 sense
 that
 Larry
 Frink
 is


going
 after
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 different


corporate
 bonds
 that
 are
 building
 out


all
 these
 data
 centers,
 but
 Meta
 is
 one


of
 those
 companies
 that
 is
 getting
 a
 bit


of
 that
 momentum
 as
 well.
 And
 you're


seeing
 that
 here
 today.
 Uh,
 two
 more


stats.
 Of
 the
 60
 S&P
 500
 companies
 that


have
 reported
 so
 far,
 nearly
 85%
 of
 them


have
 beaten
 estimates.
 Nearly
 85%
 of


them
 have
 beaten
 estimates.
 So


unfortunately
 Netflix
 is
 going
 to
 take


that
 percentage
 down
 because
 they
 did


not
 beat
 estimates.
 But
 of
 the
 60
 that


have
 reported
 so
 far,
 I
 mean
 85%
 beating


estimates
 is
 very
 similar
 to
 the
 growth


rate
 of
 uh
 percentage
 beats
 that
 you
 had


in
 Q2.
 So
 if
 that
 continues
 and
 Netflix


is
 in
 isolation
 not
 the
 best
 company


that
 has
 done
 well,
 then
 you
 should


hopefully
 see
 some
 more
 momentum.
 And


then
 final
 stat
 for
 everybody,
 China's


rare
 earth
 exports
 dropped
 31%
 month


overmonth,
 the
 lowest
 since
 February.


Now
 why
 does
 this
 matter?
 Well,
 Trump


was
 talking
 about
 this
 two
 weeks
 ago


that
 China
 is
 sending
 out
 all
 these


letters
 to
 different
 countries
 creating


all
 these
 export
 controls
 making
 it


harder
 for
 them
 to
 import
 rare
 earth


metals
 and
 minerals.
 And
 maybe
 he
 was


accurate
 about
 that
 because
 for
 it
 to


decline
 31%
 month
 over
 month
 in


September
 likely
 means
 that
 China
 is
 not


exporting
 as
 much
 as
 they
 were
 before.


Now
 the
 exports
 are
 up
 13%


year-over-year,
 but
 in
 September,
 uh


this
 is
 where
 you've
 seen
 an
 issue.
 I


would
 think
 the
 rare
 earth
 stocks
 would


potentially
 rally
 when
 news
 like
 this


comes
 out
 but
 I
 think
 the
 rare
 earth


stocks
 have
 rallied
 so
 much
 that
 now
 you


know
 they
 are
 taking
 a
 breather.
 I
 mean


MP
 is
 still
 up
 350%
 year
 to
 date.
 And


again
 the
 most
 important
 thing
 to


understand
 about
 what's
 been
 happening


in
 these
 momentum
 plays
 is
 all
 of
 them


almost
 all
 of
 them
 are
 up
 two
 to
 3x


literally
 even
 after
 this
 30%
 decline


that
 they've
 taken
 over
 the
 past
 couple


of
 weeks.
 Like
 Iren
 is
 still
 up
 450%


even
 though
 Iran
 is
 down
 25%
 over
 the


past
 week.
 So
 these
 names
 theoretically


could
 go
 down
 another
 20
 30%
 and
 still


be
 up
 double
 for
 the
 year.
 And
 you
 know


long-term
 shareholders
 can't
 complain.


You
 got
 to
 double
 in
 a
 year.
 The
 S&P
 is


barely
 up
 15%.
 I
 mean
 like
 you've
 won


when
 it
 comes
 to
 beating
 the
 S&P.
 But


the
 people
 that
 are
 going
 to
 be


complaining
 obviously
 are
 the
 people


that
 bought
 when
 it
 was
 up
 500%
 year
 to


date.
 And
 we
 have
 to
 keep
 an
 eye
 on


seeing
 if
 any
 of
 these
 names
 can
 regain


some
 of
 the
 momentum
 that
 they
 lost.


But
 nonetheless,
 until
 they
 put
 up
 the


earnings,
 we're
 not
 gonna
 see
 if
 that


momentum
 can
 come
 back.
 A
 lot
 of
 the


earnings,
 I
 think,
 will
 help
 fix
 it.


Intuitive
 Surgical,
 they
 put
 up
 the


earnings,
 and
 that's
 why
 they're
 going


green.
 24%
 on
 the
 day
 for
 ISRG


after
 a
 pretty
 incredible
 earnings,
 and


that's
 why
 that
 stock
 continues
 to


maintain
 its
 momentum
 as
 well.


It's
 Beyond
 Meat
 at
 50
 or
 at
 five.


Beyond
 Meat's
 at
 440.
 All right.
 Little


bit
 of
 a
 red
 candle
 that
 we
 got
 right


there.


All
 right,
 that
 is
 what
 we
 got.
 We
 are


going
 to
 move
 on
 to
 technical
 Tuesday.


This
 one's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 little
 bit
 more


of
 a
 condensed
 version
 because
 I
 have
 to


be
 out
 at
 6
 PM,
 but
 also
 we
 can't
 do


every
 single
 stock
 because
 we
 have a
 lot


of
 stocks
 that
 have
 earnings.
 So,
 we're


still
 going
 to
 try
 to
 get
 through
 some


of
 the
 main
 ones
 coming
 up
 over
 the
 next


couple
 weeks.
 Um,
 but
 that's
 pretty
 much


what
 we
 got
 for
 those
 that
 are
 going
 to


leave
 right
 now.
 Tesla
 tomorrow,
 it's


going
 to
 be
 a
 big
 earnings.
 I'll
 be


live.
 I'll
 have
 some
 guests
 with
 me
 on


the
 market
 close.
 That
 is
 going
 to
 be


the
 official
 official
 start
 of
 at least


Mac
 7
 earnings.
 Netflix
 quite
 frankly


didn't
 give
 us
 the
 best
 numbers,
 but


hopefully
 Tesla
 can
 give
 us
 something


better
 and
 then
 we
 can
 start
 off
 these


earnings.


All right,
 having
 said
 that,
 thank
 you


everybody
 for
 being
 here.
 It
 is
 time
 for


technical
 Tuesday
 which
 means


let's
 roll
 the
 intro.


[Music]


>> What's
 up?


>> What's
 up,
 man?
 Happy
 Tuesday.


>> Soy
 milk
 Steve.
 Huh?


>> It's
 an
 upgraded
 version
 with
 a
 side
 of


bubble
 tea.


>> You
 know,


>> I've
 got
 to
 I've
 definitely
 got
 to
 let


him
 know
 you
 are
 soy.
 What
 is
 he
 then?


If
 you're
 soy
 milk,
 is
 he
 whole
 milk?


>> Well,
 no.
 I'm
 just
 more
 purified.
 Less


of
 the
 extra
 stuff,
 you
 know,


plant-based
 version.


>> Oh,
 you're
 the
 Beyond
 Meat
 milk.
 That's


That's
 what
 you
 are.
 There
 you
 go.


>> We're
 gonna
 roll
 with
 that.


>> What
 a
 Tuesday,
 bro.
 What
 a
 Tuesday.


>> We'll
 see.
 We
 shall
 see.
 It's
 a
 wild


It's
 a
 wild
 day
 for
 sure,
 but
 you
 know,


very
 close
 to
 the
 highs.
 Like
 to
 see
 it


push
 a
 little
 bit
 more.
 It's
 a
 little
 uh


you
 know,
 coming
 into
 earnings,
 it
 gets


a
 raw.


Oh
 god.


>> Raw
 milk
 steep.
 There
 you
 go.
 There
 you


go.


>> Yeah.


>> All
 right.
 So,
 let's
 get
 into
 it
 again.


>> But
 there
 it
 is.


Um
 but
 anyways,
 yeah,
 I
 I
 guess
 coming


into
 earning
 season
 it
 tends
 to
 get
 a


little
 choppy,
 a
 little
 rocky.
 Anyways,


so
 um
 yeah,
 you
 mentioned
 uh
 you
 not


being
 able
 to
 trade
 a
 lot
 of
 stuff,
 can


I
 pre
 is
 it
 okay
 if
 I
 preface
 before
 we


get
 into
 any
 charts?


>> Go
 ahead.
 as
 we
 look
 as
 we
 look
 at


certain
 tickers
 and
 things
 like
 that,


technicals
 are
 great
 and
 you
 know
 as
 a


technician
 I
 I'll
 be
 the
 first
 one
 to


tell
 you
 that
 fundamentals
 are
 greater


than
 technicals.
 So
 they
 will
 supersede


your
 chart.
 Same
 with
 sentiment.
 So
 like


that's
 you
 know
 if
 we
 have
 things
 like
 a


a
 Trump
 tweet
 or
 some
 breaking
 news
 it


might
 throw
 off
 some
 TA
 for
 a
 little
 bit


because
 people
 get
 a
 little
 emotion


emotional
 from
 a
 sentiment
 perspective


and
 from
 a
 fundamental
 perspective
 TA
 is


just
 going
 to
 it's
 just
 going
 to
 tell


you
 what
 the
 story
 is
 today
 but


fundamentals
 will
 change
 the
 story
 the


prevailing
 story
 uh
 overall
 so
 um
 if
 as


we
 look
 at
 things
 it
 we
 can
 look
 at
 them


up
 to
 an
 earnings
 report,
 but
 the
 second


these
 earnings
 reports
 hit,
 you
 kind
 of


have
 to
 slightly
 reset
 and
 then
 let
 the


charts
 digest
 and
 then
 and
 then


technicals
 will
 come
 back
 in.


>> Yeah,
 100%.
 100%.
 So,
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 uh
 TT


that
 we're
 going
 to
 be
 doing
 today,


guys,
 technical
 analysis,
 uh
 yeah,
 you


got
 to
 take
 with
 a
 grain
 of
 salt
 because


whatever
 analysis
 you
 do
 on
 Netflix,
 at


the
 end
 of
 the
 day,
 when
 they
 report
 a


Brazilian
 authority
 charge,
 you
 know,


it's
 stuff
 you
 just
 can't
 predict.


Brazilian
 authorities,


>> tax
 authorities,
 whatever.


>> I
 mean,


>> it's
 a
 good
 little
 legal
 battle
 they're


in.
 All right,
 so
 let's
 get
 started.
 And


uh
 I
 think
 let's
 start
 off
 with,
 you


know
 what,
 let's
 just
 start
 off
 with


Tesla
 because
 we
 got
 Tesla
 earnings


tomorrow.
 We'll
 see
 how
 those
 numbers


affect
 the
 charts,


>> but
 we'll
 get
 through
 some
 of
 the
 bigger


names
 and
 then
 we'll
 keep
 going
 from


there.


>> So
 Tesla,


of
 course,
 this
 is
 one
 I
 don't
 have
 the


uh
 the
 old
 the
 old
 charts
 on.
 Shoot.
 So,


I
 got
 the
 timer


first
 of
 all.
 Um,


we're
 through
 the
 bare
 zone


and
 I'm
 going
 to
 try
 and
 do
 I
 got


two
 mice.
 All right,
 that
 should
 be


better.
 Ready?
 So,
 I
 we
 got
 the
 timer,


too.
 So,
 I'm
 going
 to
 do
 five
 minutes


and
 we're
 going
 to
 start
 now.


So,
 this
 is
 Tesla.
 I
 for
 me
 the
 there's


a
 lot
 of
 lines
 on
 here,
 so
 apologies


there.
 I
 don't
 have
 to
 give
 you
 the


whole
 backstory
 as
 to
 where
 we
 are
 on


it.
 Um,
 but
 from
 the
 20-day,
 so
 we
 are


we
 are
 very
 close
 to
 the
 prior
 highs


which
 are
 going
 to
 be


right
 about
 here
 450
 451.
 And
 this


little
 area
 is
 where


seller
 some
 some
 liquidity
 some
 sellers


might
 be
 a
 little
 trapped
 from
 this


consolidation
 in
 here.
 I
 would
 say
 it's


a
 little
 I
 mean
 it's
 it's
 okay
 but
 it's


a
 little
 shaky.
 So
 we're
 still
 in


consolidation.
 We're
 not
 out
 of
 this


box.
 I
 think
 450
 is
 the
 top
 uh
 for
 now


of
 this
 box
 and
 and
 then
 with
 earnings


coming
 in.
 I
 don't
 expect
 it
 to
 do


anything
 other
 than
 that.
 So
 we're


essentially
 in
 this
 box
 between
 450
 and


415
 or
 416
 which
 was
 this
 major
 level


here.
 And
 that
 was
 the
 last
 that
 was
 the


last
 kind
 of
 pivot
 that
 we
 talked
 about


on
 uh
 on
 this
 show.
 415
 being
 like
 a


major
 support
 area
 that
 we
 kind
 of


wanted
 to
 hold.
 So
 that
 said,
 as
 we


approach
 earnings,
 I
 don't
 think
 we're


going
 to
 break
 this
 uh
 unless
 it's
 going


to
 be
 break
 below
 415
 unless
 it's
 going


to
 be
 um
 an
 earnings
 kind
 of
 like


fundamental
 change,
 which
 it's
 possible.


And
 if
 if
 that
 does
 happen,
 then
 the


biggest
 concern
 is
 this
 kind
 of
 low


volume
 pocket
 that
 we
 outlined
 before


and
 we've
 been
 toying
 with
 this
 area


here.
 Just
 make
 sure
 that
 you
 guys
 can


see.
 Uh
 if
 you
 can't
 see
 my
 charts,
 just


let
 me
 know.
 I
 think
 this
 is
 okay.


Um


>> in
 general,
 is
 the
 chart
 screaming
 a


little
 bit
 more
 bearish
 or
 bullish
 going


into
 tomorrow?
 I
 know
 you
 don't
 have
 the


results
 obviously,
 but


>> you
 have
 to
 buy
 If
 you
 have
 to
 buy
 puts


or
 buy
 calls,
 what
 would
 you
 do
 for


tomorrow?


>> I
 would
 be
 long
 the
 stock
 and
 I
 would


buy
 some
 protective
 puts
 somewhere


around
 um
 Tesla
 doesn't
 tend
 to
 move
 a


whole
 lot
 on
 earnings
 just
 because
 they


because
 they
 report
 um
 monthly
 delivery


numbers.
 So,
 it's
 like
 it's
 like
 Costco.


Costco
 doesn't
 report
 a
 whole
 lot
 uh


doesn't
 move
 a
 whole
 lot
 on
 earnings


either
 because
 they
 they
 give
 a
 lot
 of


updates.
 of
 frequently.
 Um
 I
 would
 be


looking
 near-term
 probably
 in
 this
 390


area
 for
 some
 kind
 of
 a
 pullback
 and


that's
 going
 to
 be
 right
 in
 here
 to


retest
 this
 zone.
 And
 and
 honestly
 that


would
 be
 ideal
 for
 Tesla
 the
 chart
 to


have
 some
 kind
 of
 sideways
 action
 and


get
 stuck
 still
 in
 here.
 So
 that
 would


be
 right
 around
 390
 at
 the
 low
 end.
 If


we
 don't
 if
 we
 just
 go
 to
 the
 upside,


you
 know,
 I
 do
 have
 this
 600
 something


still,
 which
 is
 up
 here.
 Uh,
 but
 just


this
 more
 recent
 consolidation.
 What


I'll
 do


is
 reset
 this
 and
 just
 get
 this
 is
 this


is
 still
 in
 the
 520s
 to
 the
 upside.
 So,


either


I'm
 looking
 at
 380s
 or
 320s
 from
 the


chart
 perspective.
 I'm
 not
 sure
 how
 much


Tesla
 typically
 moves
 on
 earnings.


And
 then
 tomorrow,


>> well,
 so
 looks
 like
 they
 have
 about


>> Yeah,
 looks
 like
 they
 have
 about
 a
 $30


implied
 move
 one
 way
 or
 the
 other


already.
 Just
 looking
 at
 the
 options


chain,


which
 is


$30
 is
 about
 408


415
 pretty
 much
 right
 at
 that
 415
 level


to
 the
 downside.
 It's
 pretty
 small


for
 Tesla.


>> The
 sense
 I'm
 getting
 from
 you
 is
 you


don't
 uh
 you
 don't
 you
 don't
 think


there's
 some
 explosive
 move
 coming
 that


could
 send
 the
 stock
 to
 all
 time
 highs


tomorrow.


>> There's
 I
 do
 not
 the
 the
 chart
 is
 not


telling
 me
 that
 there's
 going
 to
 be
 an


explosive
 move
 tomorrow.
 It's
 possible.


But
 when
 I
 when
 you
 define
 explosive,


I'm
 like,
 okay,
 well,
 explosive
 is
 the


current
 trajectory
 because
 it's
 not
 a


short
 right
 now.
 The
 current
 trajectory


is
 just
 to
 like
 480s,


but
 that's
 with
 no


>> alltime
 high
 is
 at
 488.
 So,


>> right
 48
 and
 and
 the
 like
 I
 said,
 the


current
 trajectory
 is
 into
 this
 520


area,
 which
 for
 Tesla,
 it's
 a
 it's
 a


it's
 a
 good
 percentage.
 Um
 I
 guess
 it's


just
 how
 do
 you
 trade
 that?
 I'm
 already


you
 got
 to
 understand
 I'm
 already
 in


this
 trade
 from
 down
 here
 actually
 sorry


from
 like
 from
 down
 here
 300s
 recently.


>> Um
 so
 I'm
 I'm
 I'm
 just
 kind
 of
 like


cruising
 along
 personally


and
 if
 you're
 looking
 for
 new
 money
 long


I
 this
 is
 not
 a
 good
 riskreward
 spot


which
 is
 the
 moral
 of
 the
 story
 right


now.
 It's
 very
 high.
 It
 is
 tight.
 It


looks
 bullish,
 but
 I'm
 not
 trying
 to


take
 you're
 at
 you're
 also
 at


resistance.
 So,
 um
 taking
 an
 upside
 bet


at
 resistance
 is
 you
 usually
 want
 to
 go


long
 at
 support,
 which
 would
 be


415
 or
 lower.


>> Okay,
 that's
 fair.
 Uh
 Nebius,
 really


curious
 your
 thoughts
 on
 this
 one.
 This


one's
 pulled
 back
 from
 140
 to
 100.
 Uh
 I


don't
 know
 how
 much
 you
 know
 about
 the


fundamentals
 of
 this,
 but
 does
 this
 look


attractive
 at
 all
 to
 you
 here?
 It
 it


definitely
 looks
 interesting
 to
 me
 for


sure.
 Um


I
 think
 from
 from
 the


>> we
 got
 to
 set
 the
 timer


>> latest
 deal


from
 the
 latest
 deal
 that
 was
 at
 61.


This
 is
 about
 50%
 from
 here
 to
 here


which
 is
 what
 this
 is
 and
 it's
 also
 like


right
 at
 at
 a
 prior
 top.
 So,
 so
 that


said
 on
 Nebius,


the
 parabolic
 trend,
 when
 I
 say


parabolic,
 the
 the
 channel
 that
 it
 was


in
 is
 gone.
 So,
 that's
 this
 right
 here.


That
 channel
 is
 just
 kind
 of
 like
 that


broke
 at
 126,
 needed
 to
 hold
 and
 stay
 in


that
 upside
 channel.
 That's
 broken.
 And


so,
 when
 that
 breaks,
 you
 kind
 of
 have


to
 say,
 all
 right,
 well,
 we're
 going
 to


have
 a
 pullback.
 Where
 do
 we
 pull
 back


to?
 It's
 about
 120,
 possibly
 93.
 If
 I'm


measuring
 from
 here,


from
 here
 all
 the
 way
 to
 there,
 if


that's
 the
 first
 move,
 this
 area


is
 going
 to
 be
 just
 about
 the
 50-day


simple
 moving
 average,
 which
 is
 about


91.
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 see
 it
 any
 lower


than
 that.
 So,
 like
 90.


If
 it
 loses
 this
 $90
 level,


that's
 not
 going
 to
 be
 good.
 Um
 because


then
 you're
 you're
 actually
 gonna
 you're


actually
 gonna
 fill
 in
 that
 whole
 thing


all
 the
 way
 to
 75


like
 high
 probability.
 Very
 high


probability.
 But
 for
 now
 we're
 not


>> if
 it
 goes
 to
 75
 that
 would
 be
 erasing
 a


majority
 of
 the
 runup
 after
 Microsoft.


Exactly.
 If
 not
 all
 of
 it.


>> Yeah.
 That'd
 be
 ugly.
 That
 would
 be
 ugly


for
 sure.


>> Yeah.
 Even
 if
 I
 go,
 let's
 see
 if
 I
 went


from
 this
 entire
 move


when
 Nebius
 was
 like
 pre
 whatever.
 Yeah,


75
 would
 be


a
 lot
 of
 confluence,
 but
 that
 would
 be


really


that's
 like
 25%
 down
 from
 here.


>> I
 mean,


yeah.
 So
 at
 90,
 if
 if
 I'm
 if
 I
 see


Nebius
 trading
 below
 90,
 like
 I
 don't


want
 to
 buy
 it
 at
 90,
 I
 don't
 think


that's
 a
 good
 I
 don't
 think
 that's
 a


good
 value.
 It's
 either


like
 or
 sorry
 below
 90
 it's
 it's
 it's


going
 to
 75s
 give
 or
 take
 as
 close
 to
 75


as
 you
 can.
 Um,


>> and
 and
 that's
 because
 the
 the
 whole


trend
 is
 broken
 at
 that
 point.
 And
 then


you're
 having
 a
 full
 retracement
 of
 this


of
 this
 thing,
 which
 again,
 if
 you
 lose


75,


the
 probability
 of
 getting
 to
 a
 a
 60


number
 is
 is
 just
 as
 high,
 which
 is
 why


I
 don't
 really
 want
 to
 mess
 with
 it


below
 90
 because
 it
 it
 depends
 on
 your


time
 frame,
 I
 guess,
 how
 long
 you
 plan


on
 holding
 this.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 And
 I
 I
 personally
 think


>> value
 trading


>> this
 would
 be
 a
 more
 attractive
 buy
 the


dip
 because
 unlike
 some
 of
 the
 other


momentum
 names
 they
 actually
 have


revenue.
 So


>> no
 I
 I I
 I
 actually
 agree
 like
 I


actually
 bought
 the
 dip
 here.
 Um
 and
 I
 I


think
 it
 could
 go
 a
 little
 bit
 lower


because
 I
 already
 owned
 a
 little
 bit
 so


I
 just
 averaged
 up
 before.
 It's
 not


going
 to
 be
 like
 a
 hood
 position
 but


this
 is
 that
 91
 area
 right
 here
 where


they
 last
 broke
 out
 of.
 So,
 it's
 this


it's
 basically
 this
 box
 that
 we're


getting
 very
 close
 to
 testing


essentially.
 We
 tested
 this
 morning.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 so
 that's
 that's
 what
 I'm
 saying.


Like
 I'll
 buy
 the
 dip
 here


literally
 here
 is
 close
 to
 100,
 but
 the


probability
 of
 if
 but
 if
 we
 don't
 get
 a


bounce
 like
 real
 soon,
 I
 know
 that
 it's


probably
 coming
 lower.


Okay.
 Uh,
 Oaklo,
 what
 are
 you
 thinking


on
 this
 one?
 That
 took
 a
 10%


>> Oaklo.
 I
 mean,
 a
 lot
 of the
 steam
 just


came
 out.
 Um,
 so
 you
 have
 this
 kind
 of


like
 parabolic
 high,
 if
 you
 will.
 I
 say


parabolic.
 Parabolic.
 All
 that
 means
 is


just
 like
 really
 intense
 when
 I'm


talking
 about
 the
 charts
 right
 now.
 Um,


let
 me
 go
 reset.
 And
 it's
 it's
 similar


in
 terms
 of
 like
 okay
 well
 you
 have
 your


your
 channel
 that
 it
 had
 been
 in
 and


yesterday
 it
 was
 losing
 this
 channel.
 So


below
 160


and
 when
 I
 looked
 at
 this
 I'm
 going
 to


drop
 down
 to
 a
 smaller
 time
 frame.
 I'm


on
 a
 4
 hour
 chart
 right
 now
 but
 I'll


just
 drop
 down
 a
 little
 bit
 smaller.
 Um


this
 is
 today
 but
 this
 is
 yesterday.
 So,


if
 I'm
 just
 going
 to
 highlight


yesterday's
 trading
 session,
 when
 you


make
 the
 highs
 early
 and
 then
 you
 close


towards
 the
 lows,
 which
 when
 I
 looked
 at


it,


this
 last
 where
 it
 closed
 below
 164


before
 or
 above
 164,
 that
 was
 kind
 of


like
 the
 center
 line
 and
 where
 some


people
 had
 stepped
 in
 previously


and
 really
 kind
 of
 tried
 to
 make


some
 kind
 of
 a
 stance.
 So
 164
 was


actually
 a
 pretty
 big
 near-term
 pivot
 at


that
 point.
 I
 was
 like,
 "All
 right,
 this


is
 coming
 down
 to
 probably
 break
 this


channel
 and
 at least
 test
 the
 20-day."


Um,
 but
 I
 was
 watching
 it
 today
 cuz
 I


was


again
 watching
 this
 today.
 I
 didn't
 see


any
 buyers
 show
 up
 on
 Oaklo
 today
 like


at
 all.
 And
 just
 it
 just
 kept
 getting


uglier
 and
 uglier.
 So,
 I
 think
 there's


some
 fat
 fatigue
 fatigue
 here.
 Um,


and
 not
 to
 get
 crazy.


So,
 this
 145
 would
 have
 been
 the
 last


kind
 of


if
 you
 were
 going
 to
 be
 bullish,
 you


would
 have
 wanted
 to
 see
 Oaklo
 bounce
 at


that
 145
 and
 hold.
 And
 this
 morning,
 as


it
 was
 doing
 that,
 or
 as
 it
 was


attempting
 to,


>> it
 got
 hit


>> basically
 right
 here.


We
 could
 have
 done
 this
 live.


>> You
 You
 could
 see
 like
 all
 the
 orders


just
 kind
 of
 waterfall
 and
 stop
 stop.


Basically,
 you
 got
 you
 got
 a
 stop
 run
 is


what
 I
 would
 call
 it.
 Like
 where
 people


that
 were
 getting
 long
 here.
 We're
 we're


hoping
 that
 Oaklo
 finds
 some
 kind
 of
 145


support
 for
 this
 retest.


Um


they
 just
 kind
 of
 gave
 up
 intraday.


Do
 you
 think
 this
 was
 momentum
 drawd


down?
 Like
 what
 how
 do
 you
 explain
 the


velocity
 of
 the
 move?
 Like
 people
 just


gave
 up
 on
 the
 on
 the
 trade
 today.


>> It's
 pretty
 like
 this
 channel
 is
 pretty


simple.
 This
 green
 and
 red,
 it's
 pretty


simple
 to
 draw
 and
 I
 think
 you'll
 see
 a


lot
 of
 people
 it
 I
 mean
 it's
 it's


actually
 mostly
 automated.


So
 the
 point
 is
 that
 when
 you
 have
 a


stock
 that's
 that's
 doing
 this,


maybe
 we
 could
 look
 at
 hood
 too
 cuz
 it's


kind
 of
 towards
 the
 bottom
 of
 the


channel.
 Um,
 you
 know,
 and
 it's
 and
 it's


pretty
 straightforward


in
 terms
 of
 like
 here's
 the
 trend
 that


Oklahoma
 needed
 to
 hold


and
 it
 was
 broken
 this
 morning.
 All


right.
 Well,
 it
 can
 pull
 back
 a
 little


bit,
 but
 then
 you'd
 want
 to
 see
 it
 pop


right
 here.
 At
 this
 point,


anybody
 that
 was
 looking
 for
 that
 from
 a


technical
 perspective,
 um,
 kind
 of
 has


to
 throw
 in
 the
 towel
 because,
 you
 know,


it's
 you
 would
 know
 that
 it's
 going to


go
 lower.
 And
 that
 throwing
 in
 the


towel,
 so
 to
 speak,
 is
 just
 people


hitting
 their
 stop
 loss.
 Any
 any
 ear
 any


late
 longs
 uh
 essentially
 exiting
 stage


left.
 Um,
 and
 we're
 at
 we're
 at
 another


little
 point
 here,
 say
 like
 137.
 I
 just


don't
 think
 it's
 a
 very
 strong
 one.
 And


then
 sentiment.
 So,
 we
 talked
 about


sentiment
 being
 a
 big
 thing.


I
 just
 the
 sentiment
 on


like
 broadcast
 television


I
 just
 think
 has
 turned
 on
 Oaklow


near-term
 at
 least.
 You
 know,
 a
 lot
 a


lot
 of
 chatter.
 Oh,
 it's
 it's
 uh
 you


know,
 no
 revenue.
 They
 have
 earnings


coming.
 What
 are
 they
 going
 to
 say?
 It's


up
 so
 much
 to
 that
 point
 to
 your
 point.


Um,


>> yeah.
 Yeah,


>> I
 think
 it's
 a
 lot
 of
 that
 kind
 of


scared


money.


>> So,
 so
 let
 me
 let
 me
 ask
 you
 this.
 When


technicals,
 as
 Benny
 says
 right
 here,


get
 bad
 on
 a
 stock
 that
 already
 doesn't


have
 fundamentals,


in
 your
 experience,
 does
 that
 get
 really


ugly
 or
 what
 kind
 of
 plays
 out?


>> It
 it
 gets
 really
 ugly


like
 really
 ugly
 because
 you
 just
 you


just
 it
 becomes
 a
 momentum
 stock.
 Um,
 so


you
 just
 lose
 the
 momentum.
 What
 I
 would


say
 here
 now
 is
 that
 if
 you
 like
 it,
 you


know,
 you
 can
 like
 it.
 It's
 fine.


There's
 nothing
 wrong
 with
 liking
 it.


But
 um


but
 it's
 a
 spot
 to
 and
 I
 and
 I
 I
 also


wouldn't
 say
 sell
 calls
 on
 a
 Oaklo


necessarily


because
 if
 this
 starts
 to
 go
 down


um


the
 volatility
 is
 just
 going
 to


increase.
 So
 it'd
 be
 better
 to
 be
 I
 just


ran
 out
 of
 time.
 It
 would
 be
 better
 to


actually
 be
 long
 puts
 on
 a
 Oaklo.
 Uh


because
 also,
 you
 know,
 we
 don't
 know


that
 maybe
 something
 happens
 and
 there's


a
 headline
 that
 changes
 sentiment
 here


and
 just
 goes
 straight
 back
 to
 the
 highs


because
 this
 is
 still
 I
 mean
 this
 is
 a


pretty
 big
 move
 to
 the
 downside


what
 is
 this
 in
 the
 last
 I
 mean
 it
 was


down
 like
 30%.
 So
 this
 is
 30%
 down
 and


you
 are
 technically
 testing
 um
 a


medium-term
 support.
 So,
 it's
 possible


that
 um
 some
 people
 step
 in
 and
 try
 to


pick
 at
 this
 tomorrow
 now
 that
 it's
 had


a
 big
 move,
 but
 I
 would
 be
 very
 cautious


back
 to
 that
 160
 level
 cuz
 at
 that
 160


level,


uh
 the
 bears
 are
 going
 to
 be
 waiting.


Like,


they're
 definitely
 going
 to
 be
 waiting


anywhere
 up
 in
 here.


>> Okay.
 Um,
 SoFi,
 what
 are
 you
 thinking


about
 this
 going
 into
 earnings?
 Also,


real
 quick
 before
 you
 start
 on
 SoFi,


just
 like
 30
 seconds.
 Your
 thoughts
 on


Beyond
 Meat?
 What?
 Like
 after
 hours?
 You


think
 it's
 just
 people
 yoloing?


>> Uh,
 dude,
 I
 think
 it's
 Well,
 it's
 like


uh
 Wolf,
 right?
 Weren't
 they
 uh
 It's


short
 covering,
 that's
 all.


>> Okay.
 So,
 you
 think
 it's
 a
 squeeze?


Definitely.


>> Oh,
 no.
 Definitely.
 I
 mean,


yeah.
 Yeah,
 it's
 for
 sure
 a
 squeeze
 to


me.
 Um,


I
 can
 see
 this.
 Oh,
 you're
 you're
 coming


in.
 So,
 you
 don't
 know
 what
 they're


going
 to
 report,
 but


this
 is
 a


This
 squeezes
 a
 lot
 at
 418.
 Let
 me
 go


after
 hours.
 Oh,
 we're
 there.


>> Was
 at
 470
 10
 minutes
 ago.


>> Yeah,
 sorry.
 So,


>> really
 what
 you
 do
 is
 you
 just
 kind
 of


like
 I
 turned
 my
 after
 hours
 on
 just


now.
 you
 look
 at
 this
 last
 relative
 high


and
 see
 where
 we're
 going
 to
 be.
 Um,


what
 I
 just
 did,
 I
 guess
 we're
 doing


beyond
 me
 right
 now.
 Um,


what
 I
 just
 did
 was


>> Okay,
 it's
 fine.
 Was
 I
 just
 grabbed
 this


kind
 of
 like
 this
 looks
 like
 an
 after


hours
 wick.
 So,
 and
 I'm
 going
 to
 zoom
 in


one
 more
 time


to
 kind
 of
 refine
 this
 so
 I
 can
 actually


get
 this
 486.
 Did
 it
 get
 to
 486?


No,
 not
 after
 hours.


>> Okay.
 So,
 there's
 a
 little
 trap


liquidity
 up
 to
 486


and
 then
 um


so
 from
 this
 perspective,
 a
 squeeze


perspective
 if
 you
 get
 and
 the
 top
 of


that
 is
 524.


Wild.
 I
 wasn't
 even
 looking
 that
 but


that
 looks
 to
 like
 to
 the
 penny
 480


which
 is
 so
 you
 have
 just
 uh
 I
 wasn't


even
 looking.
 That's
 crazy.
 Um,
 so
 it


looks
 like
 he
 just
 filled
 a
 liquidity


pocket,
 low
 volume
 pocket,
 like
 some


trapped
 liquidity
 up
 here,
 meaning
 like


trapped
 buyers,
 anybody
 that
 bought
 at


the
 absolute
 highs.


And
 um,
 you're
 going
 to
 find
 out
 real


quick
 if
 they
 if
 they
 like
 it
 still
 or


not.
 Net
 net
 over
 five
 and
 a
 quarter,


it's
 going
 probably
 significantly


higher.


Well,
 significantly
 would
 be
 in
 the


sixes,


>> right?
 Which
 would
 be
 a
 big
 move.


>> Yeah.
 Is
 is
 this
 But
 this
 was
 one
 where


it
 was
 like
 we're
 going
 to
 file
 for


bankruptcy
 and
 then
 we're
 not
 kind
 of


thing.


>> Yes.
 Exactly.
 Exactly.


>> Yeah.
 So,
 so
 it
 price
 for
 bankruptcy
 now


now
 not.
 So,
 I
 think
 it
 could
 do
 that.


And
 I
 mean
 just
 to
 note
 squeezes
 are
 not


beyond
 beyond
 me.
 This
 is
 a
 regular


occurrence
 in
 general.


>> This
 last
 one
 is
 to
 50.


>> All right.
 So,
 what
 are
 we
 thinking?
 It


got
 close
 to
 29.


Do
 you
 see
 a
 run
 up
 potentially
 to
 30
 if


it
 can
 have
 a
 good
 earnings?


I
 would


>> so
 each
 stock
 as
 we
 go
 to
 this
 as
 we
 go


through
 this
 we
 you'll
 have
 uh
 pre
 what


we
 call
 pre-earnings
 runups
 and
 uh
 SoFi


in
 particular


tends
 to
 have
 some
 pretty
 aggressive


pre-earnings
 runups.


>> Yeah.
 Meaning
 what
 that
 what
 that
 means


is
 it's
 going
 to
 get
 there
 before


earnings
 and
 by
 the
 time
 earnings


actually
 happens
 well
 then
 it's
 a
 show


me
 story.
 So
 this
 is
 October
 28th.


That's
 like
 a
 week.


>> That
 is
 literally
 in
 seven
 days.
 Yep.


>> Did
 you
 take
 this
 today?
 So
 this
 is
 our


chart.


This
 was
 like
 2850.


>> I
 was
 looking
 for
 2650
 but
 it
 ran
 away


yesterday
 from
 me.


>> Oh
 yeah.
 Well,
 so
 if
 it
 holds
 over
 2850,


this
 is
 pretty
 bullish.
 So
 this
 this


area
 here
 is
 kind
 of
 like
 what
 I
 would


call
 a
 bearish
 retracement
 from
 this


swing
 high
 to
 this
 swing
 low.
 We
 just


it's
 just
 called
 this
 recent
 high
 to


this
 recent
 low.
 That's
 swing
 high,


swing
 low.
 That's
 all
 that
 means.
 Um


but
 this
 this
 kind
 of
 gray
 box
 I
 just


made,
 that
 is
 the
 that
 is
 a
 bearish


retracement.


Um,


and
 if
 it
 does
 hold
 over
 that,
 then
 that


means
 that
 the
 bears
 have
 more
 likely


given
 more
 likely
 than
 not
 given
 up.


>> So
 that
 would
 be
 bullish.


>> The
 thing
 that's
 weird
 about
 it
 is
 is
 is


that
 the
 banks
 crushed
 and
 so
 I
 feel


like
 everything
 fundamentally,
 whether


it's
 rate
 cuts,
 banks,
 overall
 topline


growth,
 it's
 going
 to
 smash.
 I
 just


wonder
 if
 the
 charts
 are
 enough
 for
 it


to
 get
 to
 that
 I
 guess
 price
 discovery


zone
 right
 above
 30
 bucks
 where
 it's


never
 seen.


>> All right,
 so
 let
 me
 just
 So
 it's
 2875.


It
 it
 looks
 pretty
 bullish
 right
 now,


dude.
 Um
 and
 again,
 same
 kind
 of


exercise
 that
 would
 take
 you
 to
 that
 20


2979
 which
 happens
 to
 have
 already
 hit.


Um,
 so
 because
 of
 that
 already
 filling,


I
 would
 say
 that
 this
 area
 isn't
 really


a
 big
 uh
 it
 would
 normally
 be
 a
 big


traffic
 zone,


but
 I
 don't
 think
 it
 is
 in
 this
 case.
 So


this


33,


this
 is
 an
 extension.
 So
 let's
 say


essentially
 the
 pathing
 would
 be
 up


through


up
 and
 out.


like
 that,
 which
 I'm
 pretty
 sure
 is


going
 to
 line
 you
 up
 anyways
 with
 the


prior
 channel,


top
 of
 that
 channel.
 Yep.
 This
 channel,


which
 we'd
 been
 kind
 of
 highlighting
 and


watching
 this
 for
 what
 what
 would
 you


say
 now?
 3
 weeks,


maybe
 three
 weeks.


Um,


and
 that
 could
 all
 happen
 that
 can


legitimately
 happen
 before
 earnings,


which
 is
 a
 not
 a
 cool
 setup
 for


earnings,
 which
 set
 which
 sets
 up
 SoFi


for
 the
 double
 beat
 double
 ski.
 Um,


>> well,
 this
 this
 happened
 in
 January.
 It


pumped
 up
 to$,850.


>> Yeah.


>> From
 like
 from
 like
 what
 1570
 and
 then


it
 dumped
 to
 13
 on
 earnings.


>> Yeah.
 So,
 that's
 what
 I'm
 saying.
 So,


this
 can
 be
 valid
 up
 to
 the
 actual


earnings
 call.
 The
 second
 that
 the


earnings
 call
 happens,
 all
 bets
 are
 off.


That's
 my
 point.
 Um,
 and
 and
 like,
 can


it
 come
 down
 here?
 For
 sure.
 It
 really


can


instantly.
 Uh,
 or
 at
 least
 back
 to
 where


it
 where
 it
 started,
 which
 is
 exactly


what
 Netflix
 kind
 of
 done.
 Netflix
 had


good
 TA
 coming
 into
 earnings.
 It
 did
 did


the
 pre-
 earning.
 Can
 we
 look
 at


Netflix?


>> Yeah,
 let's
 do
 Netflix


>> just
 to
 just
 so
 that
 people
 know
 what
 it


looks
 like
 if
 they're
 not
 familiar.
 They


might
 be
 familiar


>> real
 quick
 before
 you
 do
 Netflix.
 You


can
 pause
 the
 timer
 real
 quick.
 So,


three
 things
 guys
 real
 quick.
 First
 of


all,
 please
 follow
 Jason
 on
 X.
 He
 is
 uh


doing
 this
 for
 us
 for
 free
 every


Tuesday.
 So,
 deeply
 deeply
 appreciate


that.
 You
 can
 follow
 him
 there.
 Second


of
 all,
 following
 Knife,
 thank
 you
 for


the
 $200
 super
 chat.
 Appreciate
 you.
 If


you
 have
 a
 ticker
 in
 mind,
 please
 let
 us


know
 for
 a
 TT.
 But
 thank
 you
 for
 that


$200
 super
 chat.
 And
 then
 third


announcement,
 Skrey
 is
 short
 beyond
 meat


officially.
 He
 said
 I
 started


>> right
 there,


>> right
 at
 the
 level.


>> He
 said
 I
 started
 a
 tiny
 short
 after


seeing
 negative
 gross
 margins.


So
 there.


>> All
 right,
 Netflix,
 what
 do
 we
 got?
 So


coming
 into
 earnings
 and
 I
 think
 this


was
 my
 my
 point
 was
 that
 it
 could
 all


look
 super
 bullish.
 This
 is
 your
 chart


coming
 into
 earnings
 and
 we
 had
 outlined


um
 this
 little
 double
 bottom
 right
 here


way
 before
 earnings
 uh
 1139.


And
 what
 happens
 is
 this
 entire
 move


from
 here
 to
 here
 is
 what
 we
 would
 call


pre-earnings
 move.
 Kind
 of
 like
 your


anticipation
 of
 earnings.
 Uh
 it's
 a
 it's


it's
 a
 real
 move
 from
 a
 chart


perspective,
 but
 it's
 a
 it's
 a
 fake
 move


in
 terms
 of
 like
 it's
 not
 going
 to
 hold


if
 the
 fundamentals
 change
 or
 the


fundamentals
 don't
 support
 it.


And
 if
 they
 don't
 support
 it,
 where


would
 it
 go
 back
 down
 to?
 Uh,
 and
 if


they
 did,
 where
 would
 it
 go
 up
 to?
 If


they
 if
 it
 did
 get
 if
 it
 was
 supported,


well,
 we
 know
 that
 this
 was
 going
 to
 be


into
 the
 14s
 kind
 of
 area.
 And
 Netflix


is
 typically
 a
 a
 big
 earnings
 mover.
 It


would
 have
 been
 like
 this.


You
 would
 have
 to
 deal
 with
 that
 1338


first,
 which
 still,
 by
 the
 way,
 can


happen.
 Um,
 and
 then
 I'll
 move
 this


forward
 to
 now.
 you
 get
 earnings
 and
 it


just
 literally
 just
 changes
 the
 story.


But
 here
 now,
 if
 you
 look
 at
 this,
 if


you
 look
 at
 this,
 it
 it's
 basically
 just


gone
 back
 to
 where
 it
 came.


One
 thing
 I
 would
 say
 about
 Netflix
 to


preface
 this
 is
 that
 it's
 a
 midcap


stock.
 Med
 What
 is
 the
 market
 cap
 on


this?
 500
 billion,
 something
 like
 that.


I
 don't
 know.


>> 430
 I
 think.


>> 530.
 Yeah,
 430
 maybe.


um
 which
 has
 had
 by
 the
 way
 a
 massive


run


in
 the
 last
 uh
 year
 or
 so.
 So
 few
 years


from
 from
 165
 all
 the
 way
 up
 here.
 So
 as


much
 as
 I
 do
 like
 Netflix
 all
 of
 this
 by


the
 way
 this
 is
 a
 huge
 return
 and
 I
 mean


giant
 return.


So
 can
 it
 go
 sideways
 at
 least
 for
 a


while?
 I
 think
 that
 you
 understanding


where
 it's
 coming
 from.
 Um
 I
 think
 that


if
 you
 don't
 expect
 a
 sideways
 some
 kind


of
 sideways
 price
 action
 to
 digest
 that


level
 of
 a
 move,


you
 might
 be
 doing
 a
 little
 wrong,
 but


um


but
 it
 it
 deserves
 some
 digestion.
 Do
 we


like
 it?
 I
 love
 it.
 Um
 but
 so
 I'm
 from


an
 investment,
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 sell
 it.


Um,
 that
 said,
 this
 line,
 that
 last


double
 bottom
 is
 11:44.


Let's
 just
 make
 it
 right
 there.


And
 so
 now
 that
 earnings
 have
 come
 and


gone,
 we
 can
 do
 TA.


It's
 literally
 that
 fast.
 We
 just
 needed


to
 wait
 for
 the
 call.


So
 1139.
 What
 what's
 happening
 right
 now


is
 this
 chart
 is
 not
 broken


definitively.
 There's
 nothing
 wrong
 with


this
 chart.
 It
 just
 didn't
 make
 the
 move


to
 the
 upside,
 but
 it
 has
 not
 broken


support.
 Support
 is
 at
 114140.


If
 for
 whatever
 reason
 uh
 Netflix
 does


this,


that
 is
 what
 you
 would
 expect.
 And
 that


breakdown
 would
 be
 at
 1140
 from
 that


prior
 double
 bottom
 and
 it
 would
 not


hold.
 And
 that
 would
 probably
 take
 you


one
 to
 1077
 first.
 It's
 not
 going to
 be


a
 straight
 line
 like
 this.
 It
 might
 be


more
 um
 you
 know
 it
 might
 be
 choppy


goodness
 like
 choppy
 like
 might
 chop


chop
 chop
 chop
 and
 then
 probably
 start


to
 recover
 like
 that.
 So
 um
 but
 even


this
 look
 when
 I
 zoom
 out
 all
 this
 is
 is


from
 is
 a
 measured
 move
 from
 here
 to


here
 that's
 50%
 of
 April
 2025


to
 June
 2025


move
 from
 this
 to
 here.
 This
 is
 a


bullish
 retracement
 of
 that
 move
 right


in
 here.


So
 I
 would
 um
 I
 would
 say
 that
 that
 is


your
 better
 value.
 That's
 that's


actually
 just
 under
 it's
 just
 under
 a


grand


which
 makes
 a
 lot
 of
 sense.
 And
 then


something
 like
 this
 when
 you
 zoom
 that


out
 and
 you
 look
 at
 it
 you're
 like
 even


even
 if
 it
 gets
 there
 and
 then
 even
 if


this
 goes
 sideways
 for
 a
 while
 and
 not


up.


This
 should
 make
 sense
 to
 somebody


looking
 at
 this
 after
 that
 kind
 of
 a


move.


That
 would
 definitely
 be
 um
 in
 the


cards.


Looks
 like
 this
 is


Yeah.


>> Okay.
 Cool.
 that
 kind
 of
 prevailing


channel.


>> I
 don't
 hate
 that.


>> Are
 we
 buying
 Netflix
 when
 we
 get
 there?


>> Dude,
 I've
 been
 bearish
 on
 Netflix
 for


so
 long
 that


>> only
 because
 you
 you
 just
 missed
 the


ride
 from
 100
 something.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah,
 exactly.
 I
 missed
 the
 ride.


I'm
 not
 buying
 it
 500
 million.
 Like,
 no.


Like,
 I'd
 buy
 more
 Google
 over
 Netflix


any
 day
 of
 the
 week.
 But,
 um,
 can
 we
 do


Amazon?
 And
 do
 you
 think
 there's


potentially
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 breakout


happening
 here?


Um,
 well,
 I,
 you
 know,
 I
 I
 was
 making


fun
 of
 Amazon
 Bears
 for
 a
 little
 while


at
 this
 uh,
 what
 was
 it
 right
 here?
 Oh,


I
 don't
 even
 know
 how
 I
 just
 did
 that.


Oh,
 new
 toy.
 That's
 cool.


>> Trading
 View.
 Got
 new
 toy.


>> Was
 that
 training?
 Yeah,


>> I
 think
 it
 was
 Trading
 View.


>> I
 don't
 even
 know.


uh
 cuz
 they
 had
 tried
 to
 break
 this
 down


1,
 two,
 three
 times.


And
 at
 this
 point,
 I
 was
 like,
 I
 know


that
 it's
 going
 to
 225.
 I
 needed
 to
 hold


this
 level,
 this
 223


and
 really
 over
 228
 to
 be
 fully
 out
 of


the
 range.
 So
 I
 at
 that
 point,
 look,


they
 couldn't
 get
 it
 down.
 So
 it
 did
 it


did
 go
 higher.
 Unfortunately,
 it
 went


higher
 to
 get
 more
 sellers.
 Uh,
 which
 is


what
 happened
 at
 228.


And
 so,
 what
 what
 we're
 what
 we're


toying
 with
 right
 now


is
 is
 another
 key
 level.
 So,
 I
 I
 wanted


110
 or
 210
 is
 what
 I
 wanted
 and
 I
 ended


up
 getting
 it
 right
 here.


There's
 my
 210


or
 just
 just
 close
 to


which
 ends
 up
 which
 which
 comes
 from
 the


bottom


right
 here.
 So,
 by
 the
 way,
 this
 is
 an


earnings
 move
 all
 the
 way
 breakout


earnings,
 gave
 it
 all
 back
 and
 then


some.
 And
 so
 at
 211
 essentially,
 we


priced
 Amazon
 at
 the
 exact
 lows
 of
 July


31st.
 And
 zooming
 out
 looking
 left,
 I


like
 this
 whole
 kind
 of
 setup.
 Um


that
 said,
 I
 think
 this
 needs
 some
 time.


I
 think
 you
 need
 to
 be
 patient
 with


Amazon.
 It
 it
 does
 move
 on
 earnings.


But
 where
 this
 where
 this
 goes
 from


here,
 I
 think
 it's
 one
 step
 at
 a
 time.


223


is
 this
 next
 bar
 right
 here.
 So
 very


large
 time
 frame
 chart
 that
 I'm
 looking


at.
 I'm
 covering
 a
 lot
 of
 time.
 This
 is


probably
 like
 two
 years
 worth
 of
 chart.


Um,
 yeah,
 2024.
 I'm
 bringing
 2024
 levels


in.
 We're
 We're
 dealing
 with
 this
 area


right
 here.
 And
 that
 red
 line
 is
 22384.


I
 think
 we're
 going
 to
 possibly
 chop
 a


little
 bit.
 And
 if
 this
 does
 that,


sure.
 then
 that
 213
 or
 215
 area
 should


hold
 um


with
 earnings
 coming
 around
 the
 corner.


Oops.


As
 they
 should


assuming
 there's
 no
 like
 breaking
 news


October
 30th.


It
 probably
 is
 not
 going
 to
 need
 that


much
 time.
 I
 think
 you
 you
 make
 the


trajectory.
 So
 we're
 in
 we
 we
 are
 in
 the


pre-earnings
 runup.
 That's
 what
 this
 is.


So,
 this
 is
 all
 real
 but
 fake
 moves


because
 people
 are
 anticipating
 good


earnings.


And
 so,
 we
 can
 get
 to
 here
 and
 I
 think


240
 235
 240
 is
 where
 we're
 going
 to
 at


best
 at
 best
 where
 you
 would
 hit
 your


head.
 um
 possibly
 just
 under
 230


before


before
 earnings.


And
 then
 on
 earnings
 again,
 all
 bets
 are


off
 because
 whatever
 happens
 on
 the
 call


is
 going
 to
 make
 or
 break
 the
 chart.
 To


the
 upside,
 um
 to
 the
 upside,


the
 extension
 here,
 I
 think,
 was


uh
 255s.


Yep.


Do
 do
 you
 think
 it's
 a
 bit
 of
 more
 of
 a


safety
 trade
 right
 now?


>> I
 mean,
 I
 think
 that
 the
 market
 is
 is


taking
 turns
 looking
 across
 of
 uh
 you


know,
 we
 went
 through
 this
 late
 July,


June,
 July,
 late
 July
 of
 who
 deserves


what
 multiple
 when.
 at
 a
 certain
 point,


you
 know,
 well,
 the
 the
 the
 nucleers
 and


what
 have
 you,
 the
 market
 wanted
 to
 give


them
 the
 premium
 and
 AWS
 or
 Amazon


rather
 just
 wasn't
 that
 interesting


even
 with
 the
 Did
 you
 Did
 you
 Did
 you


think
 Amazon
 was
 going
 to
 get
 hit
 after


the
 outage?


>> I
 I I
 thought
 it
 was
 going to
 be
 a
 crowd


strike
 mode.
 I
 thought
 we
 would
 get
 a


20%
 Dude,
 it
 was
 bad,
 bro.
 Like,


>> it
 was
 it
 was
 actually
 really
 bad.
 It


was
 bad.
 But


>> I
 didn't
 get
 my
 hood
 back
 until
 3
 PM
 in


the
 day.
 It
 was
 gone
 for
 the
 whole
 day.


Like
 imagine
 if
 I
 needed
 to
 sell


something
 or
 buy
 like
 like


>> Yeah,


>> it
 screwed
 a
 lot
 of
 people


unfortunately.


>> No,
 I
 couldn't
 even
 stream.
 Reream
 was


just


>> Thank
 goodness.
 Streamyard.


>> Yeah.


>> Yeah.
 Reream
 was
 just
 dead.
 Um,


you
 know,
 we
 we
 still
 might
 get
 some
 of


that,
 but
 I
 think
 that's
 going
 to
 be
 the


chop
 because
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day,


look,
 this
 is
 your
 this
 is
 your
 largest


cloud
 provider.
 I
 don't
 think
 anybody


wants
 to
 short
 it
 here
 ahead
 of
 earnings


even
 with
 an
 outage.
 Plus,
 Crowd
 Strike


already
 happened
 once
 and
 I
 think
 people


remember
 that
 as
 a
 buying
 opportunity.


>> Correct.
 Correct.
 Yeah.
 Okay.
 Um,
 Irene,


can
 we
 look
 at
 this
 one
 and
 what
 are
 you


thinking
 the
 charts
 say
 here?


>> This
 not
 look
 good.


Does
 not
 look
 good,
 my
 friend.
 Let's


see.
 We
 need
 uh
 we
 need
 to
 find
 out


where
 is
 this
 pullback
 going
 to
 be.
 So


we
 have
 lost
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 Momo.
 Well,
 we


were
 a
 little
 bit
 blowoff
 top.
 So


>> I
 mean
 this
 one's
 still
 up
 450%
 this


year,
 bro.


>> Uhhuh.
 You're
 going
 to
 go
 50?
 I
 hope


it's
 not
 I
 like
 uh
 the
 idea
 of
 IN
 just


because
 it
 was
 probably
 like
 the
 first


but
 I
 hope
 it's
 not
 like
 MSTR


where
 you
 know


>> we
 got
 a
 timer


>> we're
 like
 MSTR
 remember
 it
 was
 the


first
 Bitcoin
 treasury
 and
 then


everybody
 started
 to
 copy
 them


and
 then
 and
 then
 MSTR
 like
 lost
 its


mojo.


I
 remember
 I
 remember


>> Ian
 is
 the
 first


>> you're
 saying
 Iran
 could
 have
 started


the
 Bitcoin
 miner
 to
 data
 center
 pivot


and
 that
 could
 also
 be
 bad
 for
 a
 lot
 of


them
 but
 the
 only
 difference
 here
 is


that


>> which
 makes
 them
 they're
 not
 special


anymore


>> but
 they
 are
 still
 getting
 demand


>> like


>> from
 the
 hypers
 so


>> so
 to
 that
 point
 like
 I
 would
 still
 I


would
 still


so
 so
 to
 your
 point
 part
 of
 me
 wants
 to


like
 them.


But
 like
 the
 chart
 is
 um


the
 chart
 says
 I
 got
 to
 chillax
 here.


At
 least
 52


52
 needs
 to
 be
 it


because
 if
 it's
 not
 um


then
 it's
 42


which
 which
 goes
 all
 the
 way
 back
 to


>> from
 a
 fundamental
 perspective.
 I
 have


not
 looked
 at
 anything
 on
 this
 stock.
 I


don't
 know
 if
 at
 52
 you're
 getting
 a


bargain
 or
 not,
 but
 you're
 saying
 from


the
 chart
 if
 it
 loses
 52,


it's
 head
 of


>> Yeah.
 No,
 it's
 no
 good
 cuz
 that's
 your


that's
 your
 last


retracement.


And
 so
 when
 I
 say
 lose,
 I
 don't
 mean


like
 intraday
 little
 wick.
 Like
 do
 you


don't
 want
 to
 do
 that?
 Like
 I
 mean
 like


multiple
 days
 closing
 below


like
 that.


That
 would
 be
 no
 good.
 And
 that
 that


takes
 you
 down
 to
 this
 42.
 But
 if
 you


just
 if
 you
 were
 to
 just
 get
 a
 little


wick
 but
 then
 it
 closes
 above
 that's


that's
 more
 bullish.


That
 said,
 even
 if
 you
 get
 that,
 you


have
 to
 be
 really
 cautious
 at
 57
 because


at
 57


uh
 here
 here's
 the
 deal.
 So
 like
 we
 have


you
 have
 a
 legitimate
 like
 a
 legitimate


head
 and
 shoulders.


You
 know
 people
 like
 this
 pattern


because
 um
 you
 know
 when
 it
 when
 it
 does


fire
 it'll
 hit
 its
 target.


I
 think
 the
 stat
 is
 well
 the
 the
 stat
 I


don't
 know
 if
 you
 know
 stats.
 So


technicals


uh
 technical
 analysis
 is
 about


statistics
 and
 probabilities
 uh
 and
 just


finding
 your
 edge.
 So
 the
 stat
 on
 this


is
 uh
 it
 hits
 its
 target
 83%
 of
 the


time.


A
 close
 below
 57
 triggers
 that
 kind
 of


move.
 Um,
 and
 the
 extension
 is
 to


possibly
 39,


>> which
 actually
 would
 be


>> I
 mean,
 and
 if
 it
 went
 to
 39,
 this
 thing


was
 freaking
 $3
 in
 January.
 So,
 like


>> Yeah.
 So,
 what
 what
 this
 is
 is
 like


right
 now,


>> I
 should
 say
 $10
 in
 January,
 but
 it
 it


would
 it
 would
 it
 would
 annoy
 the
 people


buying
 it
 at
 52.
 I
 I
 imagine
 I
 hope
 it


would
 annoy
 the
 people
 buying
 it
 at
 10


bucks,
 right?


>> Yeah.
 It's
 simply
 a
 measured
 move.


Meaning
 like
 if
 this
 was
 the
 the
 upper


consolidation,
 the
 measured
 move


doubling
 that
 is
 to
 39.


>> Huh.


>> And
 that's
 it.
 Like
 done.
 Um
 pattern


would
 be
 complete.


>> That's
 a
 that's
 a
 more
 than
 50%
 drop


from
 the
 highs.
 That's


>> Yeah.
 I
 I
 would
 say
 just
 to
 be
 a
 little


cautious.
 I
 don't
 know
 that
 I
 would
 go


that
 far,
 but
 I
 would
 say,
 you
 know,
 the


reason
 I
 am
 not
 a
 pattern,
 so
 I
 trade
 I


know
 patterns.
 You
 have
 to
 know
 the


patterns.
 People
 make
 fun
 of
 me
 like,


uh,
 I
 constantly
 say
 I'm
 not
 a
 pattern


trader.
 But
 what
 that
 means
 is
 what
 that


means
 is
 I
 don't
 take
 a
 trade
 based
 on
 a


pattern.
 Like
 I
 know
 them.


It
 doesn't
 initiate
 a
 trade
 for
 me


because
 because
 they
 fail.
 They
 fail


more
 often
 than
 not.
 meaning
 you
 know


could
 this
 could
 this
 instantly
 pop
 back


up
 and
 then
 reclaim
 this.
 So
 over
 57


this
 pattern


is
 actually
 null
 and
 void
 like
 voided


and
 that
 becomes
 really
 bearish
 over
 57.


So
 I
 mean
 really
 bullish.
 So
 there's


nothing
 more
 bullish
 than
 a
 than
 a


failed
 head
 and
 shoulders.
 I'll
 just


tell
 you
 that
 much
 right
 now
 cuz


everybody
 in
 their
 mother's
 kind
 of


looking
 at
 this.
 Um


uh
 they
 could
 be


but
 a
 failed
 a
 failed
 bearish
 pattern
 is


is
 pretty
 bullish.
 So
 that
 said,
 I
 think


if
 you
 if
 the
 next
 move
 to
 be
 safer


would
 be
 below
 that
 52,


then
 you
 then
 you
 should
 know
 that
 you


should
 definitively
 expect
 some
 kind
 of


$45


pullback.
 And
 it's
 probably
 not
 done


yet.
 It'll
 probably
 start
 to
 go


sideways.
 You
 might
 even
 get,
 you
 know,


a
 little
 excited,
 but
 don't
 be
 because


you're
 probably
 going
 to
 get
 some
 kind


of
 wick
 out,


which
 probably
 happens
 in
 in
 the


aftermarket
 or
 after
 hours.


And
 the
 only
 thing
 that
 invalidates
 this


is
 clear
 clearing
 57,


which
 is
 a
 is
 a
 big
 bullish
 scenario.


>> Can
 we
 look
 at
 this
 one
 real
 quick?
 We


don't
 have
 to
 spend
 too
 much
 time
 on
 it,


but
 on
 DOSs,
 I
 just
 realized
 this
 stock,


this
 drone
 thing
 is
 down
 35%
 over
 the


past
 week.


>> What's
 happening?


>> Almost.


>> What'
 you
 say?


>> What's
 happening?
 We
 were
 just
 looking


at
 these
 and
 they
 were


>> they
 were
 so
 green.
 You
 remember
 giving


me
 a
 hard
 time?


>> Oh,
 no.
 You


>> I
 know
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 gave
 you
 a
 hard


time
 last
 week.
 I
 think
 all
 of
 them
 are


just
 getting
 flushed
 out
 and
 we
 don't


know
 yet.
 I
 mean,
 I'm
 curious
 your
 your


take.
 Do
 you
 think
 the
 momentum
 is
 being


lost
 and
 it's
 never
 coming
 back
 or
 do


you
 think
 it's
 too
 early
 to
 say?
 Because


if
 it's
 never
 coming
 back,
 that
 means


there's
 a
 problem
 with
 these
 types
 of


names.
 The
 Quantums,
 the
 nuclers,
 the


drones,
 all
 the
 speculative
 names
 that


have
 run
 up.
 If
 it's
 not
 coming
 back
 and


and
 the
 S&P
 is
 going
 back
 to
 alltime


highs,
 which
 is
 it's
 $2
 away,
 that's
 a


massive
 divergence
 between
 one
 section


of
 the
 market
 and
 then
 the
 broader
 S&P


500.


>> I
 mean,
 it's
 it's
 it's
 hard
 to
 say
 like


if
 they're
 never
 coming
 back.
 They're


coming
 back.
 I
 will
 say
 definitively


that
 they're
 coming
 back,


but
 between
 now
 and
 when
 they
 come
 back,


are
 they
 like
 significantly
 lower?


Like
 possibly


because
 they're
 momentum
 names,
 you


know?
 That's
 that's
 that's
 how
 it
 is.


Like,
 does
 does
 And
 come
 back
 at
 $2?


It's
 possible.
 Meaning,
 like,
 do
 you
 get


do
 you
 get
 a
 full
 a
 full-blown


retracement
 all
 the
 way
 back
 to
 $2?
 And


then
 we're
 back,
 baby.
 Like,
 yeah.
 Yeah.


I'm
 I'm
 not
 joking.
 That
 And
 that,
 by


the
 way,
 it
 wouldn't
 be
 the
 first
 time.


If
 you
 look
 at
 history,
 that's
 that's


very
 much


how
 it
 goes,
 right?
 You
 go
 from
 80
 to


$3.30


and
 then
 all
 the
 way
 back.


But
 that's
 kind
 of
 why
 we
 have
 um
 you


know
 the
 the
 funny
 patterns
 like
 the


triceratops
 patterns
 or
 whatever
 that


that
 like
 I
 laugh
 about
 because
 like


here's
 my
 triceratops
 but
 like
 you
 ride


the
 bony
 frill
 to
 the
 upside
 but
 then


you
 you
 got
 to
 know
 it
 you
 take
 the


downside
 too
 cuz
 it
 it
 doesn't
 always


hold.
 Um,
 so
 yeah,
 I
 don't
 without


knowing
 this,


all
 I
 would
 say
 is
 you
 have
 the
 50-day


coming
 in
 hot
 at
 680
 in
 change.


>> Yeah,


>> you
 are
 coming
 into
 support.
 So,
 it's


it's
 better
 here
 now.
 The
 only
 thing


it's
 sentiment.
 You
 have
 to
 be
 very
 you


have
 to
 pay
 very
 close
 attention
 to
 to


sentiment
 overall
 because
 that's
 how


these
 are
 going
 to
 move.
 The
 the
 market,


you
 know,
 appetite
 for
 these
 type
 of


names.
 And
 if
 the
 if
 the
 appetite's
 not


there
 because
 say
 earning
 season
 shifts


the
 focus,
 then
 they're
 not
 going
 to


really
 move
 that
 much.
 All
 I
 did,
 by
 the


way,
 here
 was
 take
 this
 last
 kind
 of


breakout


from
 about
 $2,


which
 is
 like
 right
 here.
 And
 I
 measured


from
 this
 breakout
 level
 all
 the
 way
 up


to
 the
 peak
 11.
 50%
 is
 about
 685.
 So,


the
 way
 this
 works
 is
 if
 you
 lose
 685,


which
 is
 going
 to
 be
 your
 50-day
 simple


moving
 average,
 you
 have
 about
 a
 68
 pro


68
 something%
 probability
 of
 seeing
 540.


>> Okay.
 Um,
 BMR


>> BMR.
 Oh,
 man.
 I'm
 getting
 I'm
 I'm


watching
 I'm
 watching
 I'm
 watching
 cuz


uh
 you
 know
 options
 trader
 I
 uh


the
 juice
 is
 coming
 out
 of
 these
 options


and
 they're
 getting
 to
 a
 somewhat


reasonable
 place
 where
 I'm
 I'm
 kind
 of


I'm
 kind
 of
 starting
 to
 watch.
 So
 I've


earmarked


some
 Are
 we
 going
 to
 do
 meeps?
 Can
 we
 do


meeps?
 The
 the
 micro
 the
 mini
 leaps.
 I


mean,
 do
 you
 think
 they're
 attract


attractively
 priced
 for
 micro
 leaps?


>> Um,
 17
 percentile.
 Yes.


>> So,
 they
 can
 get
 lower
 17th.
 So,
 when


you
 when
 you
 look
 at
 options,
 it's
 you


always
 measure
 it
 against
 its
 itself


relative.
 I
 don't
 care
 about
 IV
 or
 any


of
 that
 stuff.
 It
 just
 relative
 to


itself.


Um,
 they're
 coming
 down.
 Can
 they
 get


cheaper?
 They
 can.
 Uh
 I
 think
 you
 know


this
 was
 that
 prior
 consolidation


didn't
 really
 like
 to
 see
 this


um
 morning's
 move.
 I
 thought
 you
 know


hope
 I
 was
 thinking
 hopefully
 we
 could


actually
 push
 through
 and
 recapture
 that


consolidation
 on
 BMR
 but
 we're
 we're


right
 at
 the
 peak
 of
 it.
 So
 I
 have
 a


little
 what
 I'll
 call
 session
 gap
 from
 I


think
 the
 weekend.


Ethereum
 looks
 constructive


right
 now.
 constructive.


Um,


and
 if
 I
 want
 to
 load
 something
 here,
 I


want
 through


April,
 May
 because
 I
 want
 to
 capture
 all


of
 Q4
 and
 at least
 half
 of
 Q1.
 Um,
 so
 I


got
 my
 eyes
 on
 some
 contracts.
 I'll
 just


watching
 them.
 I
 might
 I
 might
 I
 might


watch
 them
 for
 a
 long
 time.
 But,
 um,
 but


I
 don't
 hate
 this.


Um,


what
 I
 had
 on
 this
 was
 from
 the
 gap


I
 think
 this
 is


>> ETH
 by
 the
 way
 guys
 just
 under
 4,000


right
 now


>> which
 is
 probably
 why
 BMR
 is
 down
 after


hours


>> possibly.


So
 this
 is
 a
 this
 is
 a
 gap
 system


essentially.
 Um,
 so
 from
 the
 session


gap,


yeah,
 this
 looks
 like
 it's
 going
 to
 fill


the
 gap
 at
 50


only
 cuz
 it
 if
 we
 call
 it
 a
 half
 gap.
 So


this
 is
 what's
 this
 is
 called
 a
 half
 gap


right
 here
 5 51.
 Had
 it
 closed
 over


that,
 that
 would
 have
 been
 super


bullish.
 Um,
 but
 tomorrow
 if
 we
 pull


back,
 I
 think
 you
 see
 that
 50
 again.


Um,


but
 that
 should
 be
 it.


That
 should
 be
 it.
 And
 then
 I'm
 thinking


that


um


>> Well,
 what
 strike
 are
 you
 thinking?
 75s.


Is
 that
 what
 you're
 looking
 for?


>> No.
 70.


>> 70.
 Okay.


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 the
 70
 Jan
 calls
 I've
 seen


a
 lot
 more
 people
 get
 excited.


>> I
 don't
 really
 want
 January.
 Yeah.
 I
 I


want
 because
 I
 want
 past
 January.


>> Okay.
 Um,


and
 there's
 going
 to
 be
 too
 much
 time


decay.
 We
 call
 it
 delta
 decay
 in
 January


because
 that's
 like
 I
 want
 like
 April,


May,


which
 could
 be
 planned
 to
 be
 held
 into


January,
 but
 not
 much
 further
 after
 than


that
 because
 you
 still
 have
 to
 deal
 with


decay
 like
 big
 time.


>> Um,
 it's
 but
 I
 I
 just
 put
 that
 stuff
 on


a
 watch
 watch
 list,
 if
 you
 will,
 and


then
 I'll
 I'll
 see
 how
 it
 trades


and
 I've
 like
 and
 you
 scout
 it.
 or
 was


the
 low
 of
 the
 contract
 from
 this
 whole


situation.
 It's
 actually
 pretty
 close
 to


it.


Anyways,
 um
 if
 this
 is
 up
 over
 53,
 which


was
 my
 level,
 53
 before,
 we're
 over
 the


50-day
 and
 this
 is
 probably
 good.
 Uh


until
 then,
 I
 think
 this
 is
 it's
 still


possible
 that
 we
 get
 these
 little
 wicks


down,
 but
 that
 should
 hold
 below
 50.


Below
 50
 though
 it
 gets
 a
 little
 uh
 it


gets
 pretty
 shaky.
 So
 below
 50
 this
 this


whole
 kind
 of
 like
 thesis
 then
 is
 uh
 on


very
 shaky
 ground.
 And
 at
 that
 point
 we


might
 see
 uh
 like
 significantly
 lower.


>> Okay.


>> Just
 to
 be
 completely
 fair.
 Yeah.
 Which


would
 which
 would
 be
 back
 to
 not


significantly
 back
 to
 that
 45
 44
 type


area.
 So
 it's
 like
 now
 or
 never,
 dude.


shittering
 off
 the
 pot.
 I'm
 sorry.
 Um


for
 Ethan
 BMR,
 which
 is
 why
 I
 don't
 mind


taking
 the
 shot,


>> right?


>> One
 shot.
 See
 if
 it
 can
 go
 for
 the
 kill.


I
 haven't
 traded
 any
 kind
 of
 like
 actual


options
 on
 this
 because
 these
 things


have
 been
 so
 expensive.


>> Uh
 let's
 let's
 do
 Hood.
 But
 before
 that,


real
 quick,
 we
 do
 have
 some
 quotes
 from


Trump.
 Some
 weird
 quotes.
 Market's
 not


reacting
 too
 crazy.
 But
 Trump
 said
 as
 of


November
 1st,
 tariffs
 on
 China
 will
 be


155%.


Higher
 tariffs
 on
 China
 won't
 be


sustainable
 for
 them.
 So
 he's
 not


claiming
 that
 he
 will
 raise
 tariffs
 by


155.
 He's
 kind
 of
 insinuating,
 if
 you


read
 between
 the
 lines,
 if
 we
 don't
 get


a
 deal
 done,
 tariffs
 will
 be
 155,
 which


is
 why
 I
 think,
 you
 know,
 the
 market's


not
 tanking
 on
 this
 news.
 But


hopefully
 we
 get
 a
 deal
 done
 and
 we


don't
 have
 150%
 tariffs.
 All
 right,


hoodie.
 What
 do
 we
 got?
 If
 we
 do
 that,


like
 can
 we
 get
 like
 can
 we
 like
 numb
 to


the
 to
 the


>> I
 think
 so.
 I
 think
 so.


>> Yeah.
 To
 the
 tariff
 nonsense.
 Like
 I


wouldn't
 I
 wouldn't
 hate
 that.


All
 right.
 So,
 hoodie
 filled
 the
 gap


today
 or
 literally
 right
 now.
 There
 was


a
 little
 weekend
 gap
 or
 Monday
 gap.
 Um


what
 happened?
 By
 the
 way,
 this
 is
 the


20-day
 simple
 moving
 average.
 So,
 I
 know


this
 is
 a
 30-minute
 chart,
 but
 all
 of
 my


SMAs,
 if
 you
 don't
 know,
 um,
 are
 always


on
 the
 20-day
 locked
 on
 the
 daily.
 So,


this
 is
 a
 daily
 simple
 moving
 average.


This
 is
 a
 50-day
 50
 50
 day
 simple
 moving


average.


Um,
 so


for
 now,


I
 think
 this
 goes
 into


a
 bit
 of
 a
 stall.


I
 don't
 know
 if
 you
 get
 your
 22


122


for
 sure
 or
 not.
 I
 don't
 think
 so.


>> We
 had
 it
 last
 Friday
 for
 like
 an
 hour.


>> Oh
 yeah,
 we
 had
 it
 right
 here.
 That
 was


my
 from
 the
 last
 TT
 that
 we
 did.
 I
 had


120s
 and
 I
 was
 a
 little
 shy.
 I
 mean,
 it


was
 123.


That
 122
 is
 the
 50-day
 and
 it
 would
 have


been
 a
 a
 retest
 of
 this
 area


on
 the
 right
 hand
 side
 of
 my
 screen.


This
 is
 a
 volume
 profile.
 You
 guys
 can


kind
 of
 see
 like
 it
 gets
 bigger,
 meaning


that
 there's
 more
 support.
 How
 you
 read


this
 is
 that
 there's
 a
 lot
 more
 support


down
 here
 at
 117


than
 there
 is
 at
 122.
 But
 122,
 see
 that


little
 peak?
 It's
 like
 we
 we
 call
 it


trading
 like
 peak
 to
 peak.
 If
 this
 is
 a


mountain
 range,
 uh
 like
 here's
 your
 your


your
 mountain
 range.


That's
 how
 you
 validate
 kind
 of
 like


your
 support
 like
 so
 from
 the
 peak
 here


to
 the
 peak
 there.
 And
 we've
 essentially


gone
 from
 this
 peak


there,


which
 happens
 to
 be
 all
 the
 way
 over


here
 to
 this
 peak
 122.
 So


we're
 we're
 also
 stuck
 between
 a
 20
 and


a
 50-day
 simple
 moving
 average.
 Simple


moving
 average.
 So,
 I
 think
 this
 can


chop
 in
 this
 area
 and
 usually
 it
 gets


something
 like
 your
 your
 equities
 will


end
 up
 getting
 stuck
 in
 between


significant
 moving
 averages
 for
 a
 while


sometimes
 while
 um
 while
 you
 wait
 for


those
 lines
 to
 compress,
 meaning
 you


want
 you
 want
 that
 the
 distance
 between


the
 two
 SMAs
 to
 compress
 before
 it's


ready
 to
 to
 actually
 take
 off
 again.
 So,


this
 being
 pretty
 far
 away,


I
 think
 you
 just
 kind
 of
 need
 to
 like


let
 it
 chill,
 catch
 up
 to
 the
 50-day
 and


this
 maybe
 go
 sideways
 and
 then
 once
 the


price
 is
 back
 over


130s,


that's
 that's
 what
 I
 would
 expect.
 Um,


and
 also
 I
 guess
 to
 your
 point,
 you


know,
 I
 think
 it
 deserves
 to
 be
 at
 150.


That's
 just
 me.
 I
 think
 that
 whole
 run


was
 deservedly
 so.
 I
 think
 it
 deserved


it.


But
 um
 but
 there's
 gonna
 be


>> Why
 do
 you
 Why
 do
 you
 think
 it
 deserve


that
 much
 of
 a
 premium?


>> Because
 of
 the
 event
 contracts


>> and
 like
 a
 whole
 another
 line
 of


business
 and
 people
 trying
 to
 figure
 out


what
 it's
 worth
 from
 that
 from
 that


perspective
 at
 105
 to


>> I
 think
 150
 was
 probably
 the
 correct


price


from
 here
 to
 there.


>> I
 don't
 know if
 a
 vend
 contracts
 is


enough
 revenue
 or
 earnings
 to
 jump.


>> Yeah.
 you
 don't
 have
 to
 argue
 about
 it,


but
 like
 I
 I
 do,
 right?
 Right,
 wrong,
 or


indifferent.
 Um,
 but
 now
 it's
 like


discounted
 and
 does
 the
 street
 really


care,
 right?
 Cuz
 we
 are
 we
 are


overheated
 for
 sure.
 Um,


but
 that
 said,
 just
 to
 stay
 with
 the
 TA,


here's
 the
 support
 trend.
 I
 think
 that


this
 could
 go
 sideways
 and
 you
 want
 120.


I
 think


That's
 very
 possible
 to
 get
 in
 there.


And
 it's
 totally
 possible
 that
 the


street


doesn't
 think
 that
 it
 was
 ever
 going
 to


be
 worth
 this
 and
 and
 that
 I'm
 totally


wrong
 and
 it
 goes
 to
 115.
 All
 possible,


right?
 I
 think
 to
 be
 fair.
 Um


>> No,
 it's
 very
 possible.
 Very
 possible.


>> Yeah.


>> But
 at
 which


>> I
 feel
 like
 this
 is
 actually
 the
 perfect


spot.
 I
 feel
 like
 after
 S&P
 97
 to
 130
 is


pretty
 reasonable
 and
 baking
 in
 a


premium.
 I
 think
 they
 need
 to
 put
 up
 a


monster
 Q3
 for
 us
 to
 get
 back
 to


all-time
 highs.
 But
 I
 feel
 like
 right


around
 here
 125
 to
 130.
 That
 is
 that
 is


a
 accurate
 uh
 movement
 in
 my
 opinion
 for


getting
 into
 the
 S&P
 500
 which
 is
 really


what
 I
 think
 is
 what's
 caused
 this
 run


right


>> for
 for
 that.
 Yeah,
 I
 think
 that's


that's
 fair.
 So
 there's
 a
 lot
 like
 we


could
 prognosticate
 all
 day
 long
 like


why
 something
 does
 something
 you
 know


but
 it
 doesn't
 really
 matter
 at
 the
 end


of the
 day
 because
 it's
 doing
 what
 it's


doing
 and
 so
 at
 least
 from
 a
 technical


perspective
 we
 just
 have
 to
 follow
 a


technician
 just
 has
 to
 follow
 the
 charts


and
 um
 for
 right
 now
 this
 is
 at
 least
 to


go
 sideways
 until
 it's
 back
 over
 that


138.


I
 mean
 it
 was
 it
 was
 way
 high
 yesterday.


That
 was
 a
 huge
 bounce
 by
 the
 way


yesterday.
 Yeah.


>> Um
 and
 we


>> especially
 on
 a
 day
 where
 it
 wasn't


working
 either,
 right?
 The
 app.


>> So
 maybe
 tomorrow.


>> Yeah.
 So
 um


>> what
 what
 this
 is
 here,
 these
 little


green
 lines,
 this
 is
 a
 bullish


retracement
 of
 that
 overnight
 gap.
 So


from
 122


to
 yesterday's
 high,
 this
 is
 a
 we
 call


like
 a
 Fibonacci
 retracement.
 That's
 why


I'm
 pass
 the
 time.
 But
 literally
 right


here,
 right
 now,


are
 we
 buying
 it
 right
 now?
 Literally


right
 here,
 right
 now
 is
 is
 the
 is
 where


you
 would
 want
 it
 to
 hold
 as
 a
 bull.
 Um,


and
 one
 last
 note,
 if
 you
 want


confirmation,


it
 still
 needs
 to
 get
 over
 132
 for
 the


rest
 of
 the
 week.
 And
 so
 that
 comes
 from


this
 area
 right
 here,
 this
 little,
 we


call
 this
 order
 block.
 So
 if
 this
 was


the
 last
 low,
 if
 this
 was
 the
 last
 low,


I
 want
 to
 look
 at
 the
 low
 right
 before


the
 last
 low,
 which
 is
 here
 at
 132.
 And


so
 if
 Hood
 does
 this
 kind
 of
 trajectory


tomorrow
 or
 later
 on
 next
 week
 or


whenever
 at
 any
 point
 even
 if
 this
 does


this
 for
 like
 a
 month
 and
 then
 uh


eventually
 comes
 back
 up
 over
 it's
 still


going
 to
 be
 the
 same
 thing
 at
 the
 same


exact
 level
 from
 here.
 So,
 this
 13
 uh


one
 and
 a
 half
 becomes
 a
 key
 pivot
 on


Robin
 Hood


to
 reclaim
 that
 uptrend


because
 it's
 it's
 definitively
 in


consolidation.
 Not
 broken
 trend
 yet.
 Um


but
 definitely
 consolidation.


>> Okay,
 AMD.


242.


>> Oh,
 yesterday.


Oh,
 this
 is
 tough.
 Um,


so
 trade
 location
 if
 you
 want
 to
 be


bullish.


It's
 a
 little
 sideways.
 Maybe
 one
 more


dip


and
 then
 let
 it
 consolidate.
 That's
 what


I
 have
 on
 my
 chart.
 Um,


bad
 looks
 like


>> we
 got
 a
 we
 got
 a
 new
 timer.


>> I'm
 sorry.
 Bad
 looks
 like
 uh
 we'll
 do


half
 on
 this.


230


227.


I
 mean,
 I
 wouldn't
 even
 say
 there's
 a


little
 session
 gap
 right
 here.


This
 sets
 up
 for
 um


>> little
 exhaustion.


>> Yeah,


>> this
 earnings
 is
 also
 not
 going
 to
 be


like
 phenomenal.
 Everything
 that
 OpenAI


all
 that
 that's
 next
 year,
 you
 know,
 so


I
 feel
 like
 if
 there
 is
 any


disappointment,
 which
 AMD
 is


disappointed
 for
 the
 past
 three,
 four


quarters,
 does
 this
 get
 to
 hold


>> rain
 on
 the
 parade,
 man?


>> It's
 not
 even
 raining
 on
 the
 parade.


It's
 just
 like
 it
 might
 not
 be
 that
 as


you
 said
 with
 SoFi,
 if
 it
 gets
 to
 35


before
 earnings,
 it
 takes
 away
 a
 lot
 of


the
 upside.


>> Yeah.


>> Or
 is
 AMD
 going
 to
 300
 on
 earnings?
 I


mean,
 for
 what?


>> Well,
 I'm
 gonna
 find
 out%
 data
 center


growth.


>> Not
 265.


Um,


well,


oh,
 good
 night.
 I
 need
 to
 get
 this.


Oh,
 there's
 your
 300
 number.
 Is
 that
 Did


is
 that
 what
 you
 had
 it
 from?


>> I
 just
 threw
 it
 out
 there.
 I'm
 like
 I
 I


don't
 know
 what
 the
 company
 can
 say
 to


actually
 make
 a
 move
 that's
 bigger
 than


240s
 unless
 data
 center
 growth


meaningfully
 accelerates
 but
 why
 would


it
 like
 in
 Q26


>> it's
 a
 it's
 forecast
 right
 so
 uh


interesting
 spot
 so
 23
 what
 is
 this
 227


I'm
 just
 going
 to
 anchor
 this
 real
 quick


22730


is
 that
 prior
 all-time
 high


looks
 like
 it
 bounced
 off
 right
 there.


This
 is
 interesting,
 man.


I
 didn't
 notice
 this
 before,
 so


thankfully
 technicals
 use
 it.
 But
 227
 is


that
 prior
 all-time
 high.


We've
 got
 some
 closes
 above
 it,


but
 that's
 going
 to
 be
 your
 that's


that's
 to
 me
 for
 sure
 going
 to
 be
 your


key
 pivot.
 227.


And
 I
 remember
 222
 being
 a
 pivot,
 too.


So,
 I
 think
 you
 could
 let
 this


consolidate
 a
 little
 bit
 and
 probably
 go


sideways,


but
 earnings
 is
 going
 to
 come


and
 it
 it
 might
 be
 more
 like
 a
 pullback


and
 then
 bounce
 because
 your
 20
 days
 not


till
 200
 and
 I
 had
 185.


>> Am
 I
 good
 on
 time?


>> I
 don't
 know if
 we
 I
 don't
 know if
 we


get
 below
 200.
 I
 feel
 like
 that's
 just


>> I
 mean
 203
 that's
 the
 20-day
 simple
 best


case
 scenario
 this
 goes
 sideways
 for
 a


while


>> or
 at least
 to
 earnings
 but
 with
 that


kind
 of
 a
 move


and
 earnings
 coming
 I'm
 just
 wouldn't


people
 want
 to
 start
 taking
 profits


before
 the
 actual
 earnings
 announcement


is
 is
 that's
 the
 only
 thing
 in
 my
 head


right
 now


>> my
 point
 dude
 they
 did
 14%
 data
 center


growth
 last
 quarter
 if
 if
 Q3
 is
 not


substantially
 above
 that
 what
 is
 the


streak
 going
 to
 get
 excited
 for?
 Now,
 if


they
 bump
 up
 the
 guidance
 like
 crazy,


which
 they
 should,
 that
 could
 be
 a


change.
 But
 then
 again,
 this
 OpenAI


stuff
 is
 not
 confirmed.
 They've
 got
 to


build
 the
 data
 centers
 before
 they
 buy


all
 the
 MIA450s.
 So,
 can
 they
 actually


put
 in
 their
 guy
 that
 OpenAI
 is
 going
 to


be
 buying10
 billion
 worth
 of
 stuff
 next


year?
 That's
 why
 I'm
 saying
 I
 I
 I
 really


don't
 know
 how
 to
 think
 of
 this
 going


into
 earnings
 given
 a
 lot
 is
 priced
 in.


One
 could
 argue.


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 all
 I
 can
 tell
 you
 right
 now


is
 that
 this
 227
 is
 your
 key
 pivot
 from


that
 prior
 all-time
 high.
 It's
 this
 is


what
 we
 call
 high
 and
 tight.
 So,
 it's


it's
 trying
 to
 continue
 on
 this
 bearish


or
 bullish
 structure.
 And
 if
 it
 does,


then
 265


is
 your
 next
 stop
 uh
 if
 this
 breaks
 out.


And
 if
 it
 doesn't,
 then


203
 to
 190
 is
 your
 bullish
 retracement.


Um


yeah,
 that
 is
 a
 that
 is
 a
 bullish


retracement


and
 then
 300
 I
 guess.
 Um


but
 I
 we
 have
 to
 one
 stop
 at
 a
 time
 265


possibly
 270
 and
 plus
 you
 know
 it's
 AMD


sometimes
 it's
 up
 this
 thing
 I
 bet
 you


AMD
 I
 mean
 could
 you
 could
 open
 up
 one


day
 one
 morning
 and
 it'll
 be
 down
 10%.


This
 is
 how
 AMD
 is
 always
 traded.
 You're


down


down
 10%
 one
 day,
 up
 up
 7%
 the
 next


three
 days
 in
 a
 row
 like
 like
 or
 just


like
 up
 7%
 three
 days
 in
 a
 row,
 down
 15%


four
 days
 in
 a
 row.
 That's
 how
 AMD
 used


to
 be.


>> It
 is
 and
 it's
 a
 phenomenal
 company.


Also,
 by
 the
 way,
 Nvidia's
 got
 the
 same


issue.
 What
 is
 Nvidia?
 Nvidia
 doesn't


have
 China
 revenue.
 They
 don't
 have


Middle
 East
 revenue.
 What
 could
 they


possibly
 say
 going
 into
 Q3
 that's
 going


to
 be
 like,
 "Oh
 my
 goodness,
 this


deserves
 to
 go
 to
 5
 trillion."
 Like
 I


unless
 they
 massively
 raise
 guidance,


but
 where
 are
 they
 going
 to
 get
 that


data
 center
 spend
 from
 if
 they're
 not


getting
 China?
 So,
 so,
 so
 I
 mean
 like


Nvidia
 would
 have
 to
 meaningfully
 say


that
 Google's
 buying
 a
 lot
 more
 chips


than
 we
 expected.
 Microsoft's
 buying
 a


lot
 more
 chips.


>> Same
 thing
 with
 AMD.
 They're
 going
 to


have
 to
 say
 we
 had
 way
 more
 demand,
 aka


we
 had
 a
 big
 beat
 on
 earnings.
 But
 if


both
 of
 those
 companies
 don't
 say
 that,


>> I
 mean,
 I
 think
 they
 will,
 but
 that's


just
 my
 that's
 how
 I
 feel,
 right?
 it


doesn't
 it's
 not
 necessarily
 the
 it's


not
 necessarily
 what's
 going
 to
 happen


right
 so
 we
 have
 to
 be
 and
 I
 think
 all


we're
 seeing
 right
 now
 in
 the
 charts
 is


a
 little
 trepidation
 of
 like
 are
 we


super
 bulled
 up
 you
 know
 is
 it
 uh


are
 we
 a
 little
 over
 over
 like
 overly


bullish


I
 think
 that's
 the
 question


>> this
 one
 has
 lost
 a
 lot
 of
 excitement
 um


>> what's
 the
 short
 float
 dude


>> 35%


Okay.
 At
 40%
 short.


Oh,
 my
 buddy's
 with
 Dan
 right
 now.


>> I
 I
 was
 I
 was
 giving
 Nate
 so
 much
 [ __ ]


about
 this.
 I
 was
 like,
 Nate,
 it's
 a


good
 thing
 you
 uh


>> Oh,
 Dan's
 on
 the
 show.
 That's
 awesome.


>> Yeah.
 Uh
 oh,
 what
 just
 happened?


Sorry.


>> That's
 awesome.
 That's
 cool
 that
 you
 got


Dan.


>> Oh,
 I
 think
 that
 that's
 live.


Um,
 so


hims
 40%
 short,
 dude,
 is
 a
 lot
 of


shorts.


>> And
 it's
 a
 it's
 a
 growing
 company
 that's


profitable.
 So
 the
 short
 float
 to
 me
 is


weird.
 But
 I
 think
 the
 shorts
 just
 hate


him
 as
 a
 company.


But
 that
 I
 think
 that
 also
 sets
 it
 up


for
 these
 massive
 days
 where
 it
 jumps
 to


65
 like
 it
 did
 last.


>> Oh,
 no
 question.
 I
 would
 have
 thought
 I


would
 have
 thought
 that
 that
 the
 tootses


by
 now
 or
 how
 whoever
 you
 want
 to
 call


them
 um
 are


like
 are
 savvy
 enough
 not
 to
 mess
 with


that


because
 um
 you
 know
 GME
 was
 around
 40


when
 it
 started
 getting
 a
 little
 hot,
 a


little
 heavy
 at
 100%
 you're
 like
 yo
 this


is
 not
 right
 and
 then
 140%
 short
 at
 the


at
 the
 peak,
 but
 a
 40%
 short
 float
 with


the
 breaking
 structure
 to
 the
 upside.


That's
 that's
 uh
 or
 short
 shorted.


That's
 how
 you
 get
 this
 kind
 of
 a
 move


in
 instantly
 25%
 intraday
 just
 like


that.
 So
 100%


that's
 still
 very
 possible


because
 of
 that.
 Um


40%
 is
 just
 massive.


Just
 I
 don't
 know
 why
 a
 stock
 is
 at
 40%


shortage
 still
 after
 that.
 Don't
 they


know
 that
 retail's
 like
 super
 strong?


>> Dude,
 I
 still
 I
 think
 they
 think
 of
 it


as
 like
 the
 dick
 pill
 company
 and
 like


it
 gets
 that
 but
 it's
 it's
 it's
 much


more
 than
 that
 and
 I
 don't
 think
 the


shorts
 care


>> that
 it's
 turning
 into
 a
 ecosystem
 of


health
 problems.


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 I
 wouldn't
 go
 into
 this


because
 of
 the
 short.
 Like,
 you
 just
 got


to
 be
 really
 cautious
 uh
 when
 you
 own
 a


stock
 that
 is
 shorted
 that
 much.
 I'm


pulling
 this
 back
 a
 little
 bit
 more.


Um


so,
 I
 have
 two
 kind
 of
 prevailing


downtrends.
 50
 $50
 is
 that
 where's
 that


last
 pivot?
 Um,


are
 you
 going
 to
 buy
 it
 back
 again
 if


you
 see
 40?
 I
 think
 that's
 the
 first


question.


>> I
 think
 you
 take
 a
 nibble
 if
 you
 see
 40.


That's


>> Yeah,
 I'm
 kind
 of
 with
 you,
 dude.


>> Right.
 Like
 40
 is


>> 42.
 It's
 not
 even
 40.


So
 this
 prior,
 so
 if
 this
 is
 the
 last


low,
 the
 double
 bottom
 where
 you
 bought


it
 last
 and
 then
 the
 low
 right
 before


that,
 this
 can
 honestly
 come
 down
 all


the
 way
 down
 to
 that
 42
 and
 still
 be
 in


in
 what
 what
 I
 would
 say
 consolidation


cuz
 that's
 your
 this
 is
 your


consolidation
 box


because
 let's
 just
 to
 be
 just
 to
 be


clear
 here,
 there's
 no
 trend
 on
 this


chart.
 It's
 just
 squeeziness.
 So,
 it's


it's
 consolidation
 is
 what
 it
 is.
 You're


you're
 in
 this
 box.
 So,
 trade
 location.


As
 much
 as
 I
 would
 love
 to
 give
 you


trend
 lines
 and
 stuff,
 trend
 lines
 are


not
 really
 going
 to
 be
 your
 greatest


friend
 here.
 Um,


>> Jason,
 can
 we
 can
 we
 pause
 real
 quick?


We
 do
 have
 some
 breaking
 news.
 Anthropic


is
 in
 talks
 with
 Google
 for
 a
 cloud
 deal


worth
 tens
 of
 billions.


As
 a
 result,
 Google's
 pumping
 and
 Amazon


is
 dumping.


>> I
 knew
 we
 were
 going
 to
 get
 that


pullback.


>> Hilarious.


>> Yeah.
 Did
 you
 see
 that?


>> Did
 you
 see
 the
 headline
 today
 on


Google?
 What
 was
 it?
 Open
 AI
 browser


mode.


>> OpenI
 browser.
 Yeah,
 Open
 AI
 browser


thing.


>> And
 then
 it
 went
 straight
 back.
 Straight


back.
 Right.


>> And
 then
 it
 went
 straight
 back.
 And
 the


weird
 thing
 about
 Amazon
 dumping
 right


here
 is
 Amazon
 owns
 a
 good
 chunk
 of


Anthropic
 and
 they
 get
 paid
 based
 on


some
 reporting
 that
 we
 looked
 at


yesterday
 almost
 three
 billion
 a
 year


from
 Anthropic
 on
 AWS.
 So
 I
 guess
 it's


kind
 of
 bearish
 Amazon
 if
 this
 is


correct
 and
 Anthropic
 is
 moving
 to


Google.
 Uh
 but
 I
 also
 think
 it's
 kind
 of


just
 anthropic
 needs


>> they
 want
 more
 diversified
 vendors
 right


which
 is
 a
 lot
 of the
 hyper
 a
 lot
 of the


foundation
 models
 are
 doing
 that


>> like
 open
 eye
 is
 using
 all
 these
 guys
 so


>> also
 these
 numbers
 that
 we're
 hearing
 in


the
 headlines
 dude
 they're
 just
 getting


bigger
 and
 bigger
 and
 bigger
 every
 day


>> tens
 of
 billions
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 this
 is


inflation


or
 what


>> I
 just
 hope
 this
 money
 is
 there.
 It's


like
 re
 I
 just
 hope
 one
 day
 we
 can
 touch


this
 money.
 That's
 like
 Oracle
 300


billion
 in
 remaining
 performance


obligate.
 Well,
 I
 hope
 300
 billion
 is


coming
 from
 somewhere.
 I
 really
 do.


>> Yeah,
 for
 real.
 Cuz
 I
 mean
 these
 I'm


just
 these
 numbers
 are
 just
 bigger
 every


time.
 Tens
 of
 billions.
 This
 last
 this


last
 month
 and
 a
 half
 or
 so,
 the


headlines
 have
 all
 been
 over
 10
 billion,


right?
 It
 was
 from
 Nebius
 to
 Meta
 uh


Meta
 and
 whoever
 else
 like
 every
 one
 of


those
 headlines
 Cororeweave
 back
 to
 back


to
 back
 10
 13
 billion
 10
 13
 billion
 103


billion
 now
 we're
 getting
 multiples
 of


10.
 So


>> yeah
 and
 guys
 I
 don't
 I
 don't
 mean


dumping
 but
 I
 read
 the
 chat
 and
 whenever


you
 guys
 say
 dumping
 I
 end
 up
 using
 the


same
 terminology
 but
 yes
 1.5%
 down
 on


Amazon
 is
 not
 a
 dump.
 However,
 it
 is


very
 similar
 to
 what
 happened
 to
 Google


in
 the
 morning.
 headline
 comes
 out,


stock
 takes


>> was
 down
 3%
 intraday.


>> Yeah.
 Four
 almost
 4.3
 is
 what
 I
 saw.
 And


then
 it
 reverses
 when
 the
 street
 wakes


up
 and
 it's
 like
 why
 are
 we
 selling


this?
 You
 know,
 like
 what's
 the
 reason


for
 that?


>> So
 great.
 Okay,
 let's
 finish
 him
 and


then
 then
 we'll
 do
 Google.


>> Oh
 no,
 I
 think
 he
 is
 like


40%
 short
 float
 is


crazy.
 Um,
 so
 somebody's
 playing
 with


fire.
 Not
 saying
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 a


short
 squeeze,
 but
 it
 it
 it's
 posturing


for
 a
 squeeze.
 Um,
 and
 it's
 it
 is
 in


consolidation.
 So,
 um,
 earnings
 are


coming


on
 the
 on
 the
 3rd
 of
 November.


Quite
 frankly,
 any
 shorts
 that
 I
 I
 I


like
 this,
 dude.
 any
 shorts
 that
 added


up
 here
 at
 the
 highs.
 This
 this
 by
 the


way
 is
 where
 they
 should
 be
 adding
 their


shorts
 trade
 location
 and
 they
 should
 be


covering
 in
 this
 bottom
 half
 down
 here.


That
 that's
 how
 they
 should
 be
 doing


especially
 as
 as
 we
 approach
 earnings
 at


the
 beginning
 of
 next
 month.


I
 like
 this
 area
 below
 50.
 Let's
 say


some,
 you
 know,
 I
 can't
 give
 you
 a


specific
 number
 on
 on
 hands
 because
 it's


can
 be
 so
 volatile
 that
 I
 could
 say
 48,


but
 within
 one
 or
 two
 minutes
 it
 can
 go


from
 48
 to
 40
 and
 then
 back
 to
 48.
 So


somewhere
 somewhere
 along
 this
 kind
 of


trajectory,
 45ish.


>> Okay,
 makes
 sense.


Um,
 I
 guess
 let's
 do
 Google
 then.
 And


what
 do
 you
 think
 the
 charts
 are
 kind
 of


saying
 here?
 It
 did
 defend
 250
 nicely


after
 the
 opening
 eye
 headline.


>> Yeah,
 it
 did.
 Google
 this
 morning
 was
 a


little
 exhausted.
 I
 actually
 had
 this
 on


on
 um
 like
 day
 trade
 watch,
 but
 uh
 it


had
 already
 it's
 it
 had
 already
 kind
 of


hit
 like
 where
 it
 was.
 So,
 we
 open
 at


the
 highs.
 You
 get
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a


look
 above
 and
 fail.


uh
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 look
 above
 and
 fail,


but
 saved
 at
 the
 20-day
 simple
 moving


average,
 which
 also
 happens
 to
 be
 that


245,
 248
 kind
 of
 level,
 which
 is
 all
 I


had
 for
 the
 day,
 pullback,
 retest.
 Um,


even
 with
 the
 news
 headlines


that
 248
 to
 potentially,


it
 would
 have
 been
 245
 to
 the
 downside.


that
 actually
 all
 happened
 in
 the
 in
 a


matter
 of
 minutes.
 Uh
 locks
 in
 a
 higher


low.


So
 higher
 high,
 higher
 low.
 This
 looks


better
 now.
 Just
 need
 a
 little
 sustained


momentum.


Um
 and
 after


Yeah.
 245
 after
 um


a
 bit
 of
 an
 extended


consolidation
 end
 of
 the
 month
 you
 could


get
 that
 dude
 are
 we
 doing
 this
 I


too
 much
 so
 tomorrow
 if
 it's
 over
 256


with
 strength


yeah


The
 trajectory
 trajectory


is
 268


just
 underneath
 270
 for
 the
 next
 move
 on


just
 this
 consolidation
 here.
 And
 that


pullback
 today


was


pretty
 good
 pre-market
 pullback
 245
 and


then
 higher
 low
 intraday.
 Yeah,


I
 mean
 it
 looks
 it
 looks
 decent,
 man.


Are
 you
 gonna
 reload?


>> I
 don't
 know.
 I've
 been
 think
 I've
 been


thinking
 about
 buying
 more,
 but
 it's


also
 like
 it's
 it's
 made
 its
 big
 move


from
 150.
 I
 kind
 of
 want
 to
 wait
 till


earnings,
 but
 earnings
 might
 be
 275
 and


you
 know,
 it's
 like


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 you
 know,


you
 let
 your
 winners
 run.


>> Yeah,
 that
 is
 true.
 That
 is
 true.
 Um,


okay.
 So,
 we
 got
 two
 more
 left,
 guys,


and
 then
 we'll
 be
 ending
 early
 today.


Number
 one,
 because
 I
 got
 to
 leave


early.
 Number
 two,
 because
 we
 have


earnings
 and
 we
 kind
 of
 got
 to
 get
 the


earnings
 before
 we
 do
 TA.
 So,
 last
 two.


Uh,
 first
 one
 let's
 do
 is
 pounder.
 This


one
 feels
 like
 it's
 coiling
 up


aggressively
 for
 a
 move
 either
 up
 or


down.


>> Oh,
 look
 at
 the
 squiggles
 I
 had.
 Uh,
 I


think
 this
 is
 from
 our
 last
 um,


so
 it
 is
 aggressive.
 This
 is
 our
 last


TT.
 Um
 but
 we
 are
 not
 there
 yet.
 This
 is


the
 consolidation
 box.
 That
 breakout
 is


over.


Yeah.
 190.
 So
 190
 is
 where
 it's


technically
 hitting
 it.
 It's
 going
 to


hit
 its
 head.
 Um
 you
 have
 to
 wait
 for


that
 to
 base
 and
 break
 it.


I
 don't
 know,
 dude.
 Um
 it
 looks
 okay.


This


I
 think
 you
 need
 to
 react
 and
 not


anticipate
 on
 this.


>> I
 feel
 like
 it's
 going
 to
 200,
 bro.


That's
 just
 that's
 my
 that's
 my
 take.
 I


could
 be
 wrong.


>> My
 my
 only
 my
 only
 thing
 about
 that
 is


like
 what
 if
 it
 pulls
 to
 158
 first


before
 it
 goes
 to
 200?


But
 but
 wouldn't
 it
 need
 a
 a
 more


fundamental
 catalyst
 to
 like
 a
 crappy


earnings
 to
 get
 there?
 Oh


>> just
 sentiment,
 some
 kind
 of
 headline.


>> Yeah.
 I
 I
 feel
 like
 I
 feel
 like
 if
 it


was
 going
 to
 go
 back
 to
 those
 levels


like
 while
 you've
 had
 all
 these
 high


beta
 names
 pull
 back,
 the
 worst
 pounder


saw
 was
 171
 and
 that
 was
 off
 a
 Reuters


article.


>> Yeah.


>> It
 got
 it
 had
 142
 when
 the
 whole
 uh


Citron
 thing,
 but
 that
 was
 three
 months


ago.
 So
 it's
 been
 in
 a
 tight
 170
 to
 180


range
 for
 almost
 two
 months.


>> It's
 very
 tight.
 We
 just
 need
 to
 get
 so


this
 is
 that
 170
 box
 that
 you're
 talking


about
 right
 here


and
 the
 center
 line
 is
 like
 178
 and
 then


you
 have
 uh
 like
 remember
 so
 the
 volume


shelf
 like
 this
 is
 a
 we
 call
 this
 a


volume
 node
 so
 like
 if
 you
 lose
 the
 peak


that's
 why
 I
 said
 157s
 um


but


it's
 what
 I
 what
 I
 mean
 technicals


technical
 analysis
 is
 It's
 reactive
 like


I
 can
 forecast
 but
 it's
 the
 way
 it
 works


the
 way
 TA
 works
 is
 it's
 it's
 if
 this


then
 that.
 So
 something
 has
 to
 happen


first
 for
 me
 to
 react
 and
 we
 don't
 want


to
 anticipate
 right.
 So
 what
 has
 to


happen
 for
 me
 to
 react
 is
 that
 this
 has


to
 hold
 over
 190.
 And
 when
 when
 it
 holds


over
 190,
 then
 the
 technicals
 will
 say


this
 is
 this
 is
 like


extreme
 high
 probability
 that
 that's


going
 to
 happen.
 But
 until
 then,
 it's


more
 of
 just
 a
 watch
 cuz
 I
 just
 to
 take


it
 here
 now
 from
 a
 tactical
 perspective.


This
 is
 anticipating


um
 which
 is
 what
 you're
 not
 supposed
 to


do
 from
 a
 TA
 perspective


like
 just
 to
 be
 a
 trader
 for
 a
 second.


Um


so
 it's
 it's
 very
 much
 on
 a
 heavy
 watch


but
 if
 uh
 but
 again
 if
 it
 if
 it
 loses


that
 50-day
 in
 strength
 then
 the
 better


buy
 is
 is
 in
 that
 17
 157
 which
 might


just
 might
 just
 be
 that
 kind
 of


launching
 pad
 to
 do
 this
 but
 even
 then


you
 still
 need
 this
 reaction
 level.
 So,


it's
 if
 this,
 then
 that.
 Um,


if
 it's
 over
 190,
 then
 we're
 going
 to


215.


That's
 the
 if
 this,
 then.
 Cool.


All right,
 last
 one.
 Again,
 guys,
 we


weren't
 able
 to
 do
 a
 lot
 of
 stocks


today,
 but
 this
 is
 not
 one
 of
 those
 days


to
 take
 a
 ton
 of
 requests
 because
 we


have
 earnings
 coming
 up.
 Um,
 well,
 this


is
 a
 two-parter.


>> And
 And
 he's
 got
 his
 date
 tonight.


>> I
 I
 don't
 have


>> It's
 a
 pre-birth
 dinner


>> with
 the
 dentist.


>> A
 pre-
 birthday
 dinner.
 Uh,
 there's
 two


of
 them.
 So,
 so
 you
 you
 can
 spend
 the


last
 two
 days.


>> Wow.


>> Not
 too
 uh
 Nvidia
 and
 gold.
 Nvidia
 and


gold.


>> A
 little
 bit
 and
 then
 gold.


>> Well,
 177
 was
 that
 level
 that
 we
 talked


about
 that
 I
 talked
 about
 last
 week
 or


last
 last
 couple
 times.
 And
 that
 was


that
 um
 in
 here.
 This
 is
 that
 what
 we


call
 point
 of
 control.
 I
 mean,
 dude,


it's
 right
 there.


So,
 it
 is
 a
 bullish
 hold.


The
 only
 issue
 here
 177
 I
 mean
 that
 that


that
 there
 it
 is.
 Um


that's
 the
 bullish
 hold.
 We're
 still


toying
 with
 this
 20
 and
 50
 day
 simple


moving
 averages.
 So
 you
 see
 how
 we're


stuck
 in
 between
 that
 white
 and
 blue


line.
 That's
 what
 I
 mean.
 We
 we
 call


this
 moving
 average
 like
 ping
 pong.
 You


pingpong
 in
 between
 them.
 Ping
 pong
 ping


pong
 ping
 pong
 ping
 pong
 till
 you


finally
 get
 out
 which
 would
 be
 into
 the


190s.
 Um,
 and
 until
 then
 that
 might
 mean


that
 we
 have
 to
 that
 I
 say
 we
 I'm
 log
 in


I
 have
 Nvidia
 but
 like
 you
 would
 have
 to


you'd
 have
 to
 you
 it's
 building
 this


base.
 I
 just
 don't
 think
 that
 uh


so
 as
 we
 approach
 earning
 season,


here's
 the
 deal
 to
 me
 is
 that
 um


everybody's
 going
 to
 start
 to
 report
 and


if
 you
 don't
 remember
 how
 this
 goes
 um


it's
 going
 to
 be
 Microsoft,
 Meta,


Amazon,
 Google,
 and
 everybody's
 going
 to


be
 talking
 about
 what


AI
 GPUs
 and
 the
 closer
 that
 we
 get
 to


that
 I
 don't
 think
 that
 you
 want
 to
 be


not
 long
 cuz
 this
 pre-
 earnings
 runup


for
 Nvidia
 happens
 which
 by
 the
 way
 does


not
 till
 like
 December
 happens
 in
 the


midst
 of
 everybody
 talking
 about
 what


their
 spend
 is
 going
 to
 be


>> right
 and
 and
 increasing
 their
 spend


guidance
 yeah


>> yeah


or
 not
 right
 but
 but
 from
 what
 I
 can


tell
 I
 mean
 you
 want
 to
 read
 the
 market


the
 numbers
 just
 I
 just
 said
 it
 10


seconds
 or
 a
 minute
 ago
 the
 numbers
 keep


getting
 bigger.
 The
 numbers
 that
 we
 keep


hearing
 about
 are
 just
 getting
 bigger


and
 bigger.
 Whether
 or
 not
 you
 believe


in
 this
 uh
 situation,
 I
 just
 don't
 I
 I


think
 this
 is
 the
 this
 is
 where
 you


would
 accumulate.


>> Okay.
 I
 I
 agree
 with
 you.
 I
 think
 it's


consolidating.
 Well,
 gold
 had
 the
 April


the
 the
 lowest
 the
 highest
 draw
 down


since
 April
 2013.
 Do
 you
 think
 that
 is


scary


or
 do
 you
 think
 the
 trade
 is
 exhausted?


I
 mean,
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 you're
 playing


gold,
 but
 how
 would
 you
 how
 would
 you


think
 of
 it?


>> Um,


they
 lost
 trillion.


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 I
 mean,
 gold's
 been
 making


this
 move.
 I
 mean,
 on
 gold's
 been


carrying
 this
 move.


multiple
 central
 banks
 getting
 long
 gold


due
 to
 the
 dollar
 weakness
 as
 a
 whole


>> hedging
 against
 the
 dollar
 and
 um
 and


geopolitical
 risks.
 So


the
 more
 that
 we
 talk
 about
 trade
 talks


and
 yeah
 so
 we
 had
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a


double
 top
 here.


I
 don't
 know


>> that
 a
 little
 bit
 that
 looks
 like
 a


full-on
 double
 right
 that
 looks


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Full
 on


double
 top.
 I
 didn't
 even
 see
 the
 chart


look
 like
 that
 today.
 That
 is
 Yeah.


>> Yeah,
 that's
 daily.
 So,
 that's
 the


double
 top.
 Um


I
 think
 tomorrow
 would
 tell


if
 I
 were
 to
 say,
 hey,
 look,
 how
 does
 a


double
 top
 play
 out?
 Same
 kind
 of
 thing.


You
 you
 really
 take
 from
 the
 low
 to


here.
 Here's
 your
 here's
 your
 here's


your
 consolidation
 level.
 You
 have
 a


break
 through
 here.
 It's
 a
 measured
 move


essentially
 to
 the
 20-day
 which
 is
 39


just
 under
 4K.


And
 I
 think
 you
 get
 long
 again,
 dude.
 I


do
 not
 think
 that
 you
 want
 I
 don't
 think


>> Oh,
 you're
 bullish.
 You're
 bullish.


>> Yeah,
 I
 don't
 think
 you
 fight
 this.
 Um


>> Huh.


No,


I
 mean
 just
 look
 at
 the
 dollar.
 So
 the


dollar


I
 don't
 know
 unless
 the
 dollar
 like


climbs
 up
 which
 is
 which
 is
 kind
 of
 like


the
 one
 canary
 in
 the
 current
 coal
 mine


um


>> or
 in
 the
 gold


>> which
 would
 be
 here.


>> Yeah,
 this
 is
 the
 this
 is
 DXY


like
 the
 the
 dollar
 basket
 dollar
 index


basket.
 It's
 possible
 it
 does
 this.
 This


is
 starting
 to
 look
 bouncy.
 Um,
 this
 is


your
 first
 thing.
 And
 then
 just
 general


geopolitical
 headlines.


Um,


>> but
 what
 what
 if
 we
 get
 geopolitical


stability?
 What
 if
 Russia
 Ukraine
 ends


up


>> that
 that
 that
 would
 be
 the
 that
 would


be
 the
 reason
 that
 the
 story
 would


change?


Um,


and
 I
 think
 that
 as
 we
 got
 a
 little


closer
 to
 that
 to
 that
 happening
 between


Trump
 scheduling
 um,
 Halloween
 talks


with
 Putin
 and
 um,
 and
 and
 this
 upcoming


coming
 she
 meeting
 she
 meeting.
 I
 think


that's
 how
 this
 evolves.
 I
 think


literally
 those
 things
 the
 the
 possible


like
 loosening
 like
 the
 possible


alleviation
 of
 some
 geopolitical
 risks


risks
 and
 um
 and
 the
 dollar
 Dixie
 DXY


possibly
 kind
 of
 like


coming
 back
 up.
 It's
 a
 hedge
 against


dollar.
 It's
 a
 hedge
 against
 the
 dollar.


It's
 not
 really
 rates
 or
 anything
 like


that.
 It's
 just
 the
 dollar.
 Um,


and
 if
 those
 two
 things
 aren't
 really


needed
 at
 the
 moment,
 then
 then
 yeah,


this
 can
 this
 can
 lose
 a
 little
 bit
 of


steam.


But
 this
 is
 just
 from
 this
 last


consolidation.
 Let
 me
 see.
 I
 mean,
 I
 I


will
 say
 that
 all
 of
 my
 levels
 Oh,
 there


all
 of
 my
 levels
 had
 hit.
 I
 had
 4261
 on


golds
 um
 from
 this
 prior
 consolidation.


So
 I
 I
 could
 easily
 see
 this
 just
 coming


back


38.
 So
 the
 way
 this
 is
 going
 to
 work
 is


that
 if
 it
 loses
 the
 20-day,
 which
 is


about
 with
 just
 under
 that
 4K,


it's
 basically
 going
 to
 be
 like
 this.


It's
 probably
 going
 to
 go
 sideways


and
 then
 it'll
 be
 here.


like
 that


and
 then
 you're
 still
 in
 you're
 still
 in


the
 box
 and
 that
 box
 could
 be
 extended


for
 I
 don't
 know
 a
 year.


>> Dude,
 I
 just
 like
 because
 it's
 a
 $30


trillion
 market
 cap.
 When
 I
 saw
 it
 was


down
 almost
 two
 trillion
 today,
 I'm


like,
 bro,
 that's
 a
 But
 then
 again,
 it's


up
 freaking
 14
 trillion
 this
 year
 or


something.
 So


>> yeah,


>> it
 is
 just
 wild
 to
 be
 living
 through


seeing
 these
 types
 of
 moves.


>> Yeah,
 I
 I
 mean
 I
 will
 say
 like
 this
 is


measured
 if
 it
 if
 it's
 holding
 that


4,000
 number.


Anybody
 go
 to
 Costco
 today?


>> Sold
 a
 trip
 to
 Costco
 to
 buy
 the
 dip.


I'm
 not
 saying
 sell
 gold.


>> I
 would
 say
 I
 don't
 think
 anyone's


saying
 sell
 gold.
 It's
 just
 it's
 just
 a


is
 this
 uh
 is
 this
 a
 breather
 or
 is
 this


the
 top?
 That's
 the
 question.


>> Yeah,
 I
 think
 it's
 probably
 a
 breather.


It
 could
 it
 be
 could
 it
 be
 an
 extended


breather
 like
 six
 months?
 It
 it
 very


easily
 could
 be.
 We
 call
 this
 a
 kill


candle.
 Um


you
 know,


>> okay,
 but
 bro,
 but
 here
 here's
 the


thing.
 Gold
 if
 gold
 is
 sideways
 for
 the


next
 six
 months,
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 the


euphoria
 of
 people
 that
 got
 excited
 for


it,
 I
 think
 that
 dies
 out
 pretty
 quick,


right?
 Like
 if
 it's
 flat
 for
 six
 months,


who's
 who's
 buying
 up
 gold
 on
 the
 Robin


Hood?


>> That's
 not
 why
 gold's
 going
 up.


>> That's
 not
 That
 has
 nothing
 to
 do
 with


how
 I
 I
 I
 would
 challenge


>> You
 think
 it's
 all
 central
 banks?


>> You
 think
 it's
 all
 central
 banks?


>> Yeah.


>> Okay.
 So,
 why
 do
 you
 think
 it's
 going


off
 today?
 Central
 banks.


>> Uh
 well,
 we
 just
 talked
 about
 it


literally
 like
 the
 the
 meetings
 if
 if


geopolitical
 risks
 are
 not
 a
 thing
 and


then
 the
 dollar
 starts
 to
 strengthen


again


a
 little
 bit.
 Um,
 it's


>> Oh,
 China.
 China,
 too.
 China
 could
 be.


Yeah,


>> it's
 China.
 It's
 India.
 Um,
 who
 else
 is


it?


Uh,


>> there's
 a
 lot
 of
 countries
 that
 have


been
 loading
 up
 on
 it.
 They
 might
 just


be
 taking
 profits
 over
 there.


>> Maybe
 retail
 profits.
 Maybe
 retail


shorting.
 I
 would
 say
 look
 if
 you
 if
 you


if
 you
 are
 concerned
 about
 it
 there
 is
 a


um
 there's
 an
 ETF
 called
 uh
 GDXD


which
 is
 the
 inverse
 gold
 miners
 ETF.


This
 thing
 is
 like
 89
 cents
 85
 cents.


You
 could
 pick
 some
 of
 this
 up
 as
 a


hedger.
 It's
 probably
 not
 going
 to
 move


a
 whole
 lot
 but
 um


this
 is
 another
 one
 where
 uh
 you
 know


what
 GVZ
 I
 need
 to
 do
 this.
 So,
 this


will
 tell
 me.
 Yikes.


>> That's
 the
 gold
 volatility
 index.


Goodness.


>> You
 know what
 this
 is?
 How
 do
 you
 even


know
 what
 this
 is?


>> Who
 taught
 you
 that?


>> I
 just
 read
 it
 in
 the
 background.
 That's


I
 should
 have
 played
 it
 off
 like,
 bro,
 I


trade
 this
 all
 the
 time.
 Of
 course
 I


>> No,
 this
 is
 secret.
 Um,
 so
 the
 way
 that


the
 gold
 volatility
 index
 works,
 tickers


GVZ,


um,
 is
 is
 like


>> it's
 like
 the
 VIX
 for
 gold.


>> It
 is
 the
 VIX
 for
 gold.
 Not
 literally


the
 way
 that
 gold
 works
 and
 and
 and
 the


volatility
 around
 gold
 is
 that


volatility
 goes
 up
 when
 gold
 goes
 up.


When
 gold
 goes
 down,
 volatility
 does
 not


go
 up.
 It's
 like
 it's
 kind
 of
 inverse.


So
 this
 whole
 move
 um


I
 I
 was
 looking
 I
 should
 have
 taken


this.
 Damn
 it.
 Whatever.
 Um
 so
 we
 have


kind
 of
 peaked
 at
 this
 gold
 volatility


index.


This
 is
 the
 prior
 highs.
 This
 is
 this
 is


peakish
 for
 sure.
 Um,


but
 if
 you
 want
 a
 secret
 squirrel
 kind


of
 way
 to
 know
 whether
 or
 not
 gold's


going
 up
 or
 down,
 um,
 I
 would
 put
 this


on
 your
 radar.
 And
 if
 this
 gold


volatility
 index
 starts
 to
 climb
 back


up,
 meaning
 this
 starts
 to
 do
 a
 little


something
 like
 that,
 she's
 probably


going
 higher.


That's
 just
 how
 gold
 works.


>> As
 they
 buy,
 this
 thing
 cranks
 to
 the


upside.


>> Clearly.


>> Yeah.


>> This
 information
 is
 Yeah.


>> Yeah.
 Literally.


>> Literally.


So,
 big
 day
 tomorrow,
 Tessy
 and
 Mit's


got
 his
 dates,
 two
 dates
 apparently,


lined
 up.


I
 don't
 know.
 I
 did
 not
 Grinder
 invite


all
 day
 yesterday.
 I
 couldn't
 get
 onto


his
 Grinder
 profile.
 I
 was
 shut
 down.


Like,
 yeah.


>> He
 texted
 me.
 He's
 like,
 "Bro,
 heard


there
 was
 an
 AWS
 outage.
 Have
 you
 been


able
 to
 post
 on
 Grinder?"
 And
 I'm
 like,


"Bro,


you
 so
 much."


>> Yeah.
 You
 know,


>> all
 right,
 guys.


>> That
 is
 it.
 Jason's
 Twitter.
 Please
 make


sure
 to
 follow
 him.
 His
 private
 links
 as


well
 are
 here
 on
 his
 Twitter,
 Discord,


all
 that
 stuff


>> to
 interact
 more
 with
 him.
 Again,


We
 didn't
 do
 a
 lot
 of
 names
 today


because
 we
 have
 earnings
 coming
 up.
 So,


quite
 frankly,
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 TA
 is
 not


going
 to
 matter
 over
 the
 next
 two
 weeks


until
 we
 get
 these
 earnings.
 But,
 we


will
 be
 back
 next
 week
 and
 um
 Tesla's


the
 big
 one
 tomorrow
 and
 then
 we'll
 go


from
 there.


>> We're
 on
 for
 next
 week.


>> Are
 we
 What's
 next
 Tuesday?
 We
 might


not.


>> 28th


>> 28th.


Yeah,
 I
 think
 we
 I
 mean
 it's
 Visa,


Cheesecake
 Factory,
 and
 Nphase.
 We
 could


look
 at
 earnings
 for
 20
 minutes.


>> Cheesecake
 Factory.
 Maybe
 that's
 a
 good


one.


>> Yeah,
 we
 can
 do
 I'm
 down.


>> All right,
 there
 you
 go.
 Thank
 you,
 Mr.


Jason.
 Appreciate
 it.
 Again,
 there's
 his


Twitter
 and
 YouTube
 in
 the
 chat.
 Uh
 the


daily
 recap
 will
 be
 out
 in
 a
 couple


hours,
 so
 that'll
 be
 posted
 today
 and


I'll
 be
 back
 tomorrow
 for
 the
 market


open.


>> All right,
 see
 you
 later,
 guys.
 Adios.


Thank
 everybody.
 See
 you
 guys
 tomorrow.


Bye
 everyone.
