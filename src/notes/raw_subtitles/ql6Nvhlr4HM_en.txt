Well,
 let's
 get
 to
 someone
 who's


definitely
 a
 triple
 threat.
 We're


talking
 about
 Mark
 Duplass.
 He
 is


award-winning
 actor,
 filmmaker,
 and


producer.
 His
 company
 Duplass
 Brothers


Productions
 um
 joins
 us
 here
 live
 at


Screen
 Time.
 How
 are
 you?


I'm
 great.
 How
 are
 you
 guys


doing?
 Okay.
 Doing
 okay.
 I'm
 a
 big
 fan


of
 The
 Morning
 Show,
 but
 you
 do
 it
 all.


Is
 there
 one
 that
 I'm
 sure
 you
 get
 this


a
 million
 times
 that
 you
 like
 more
 than


most
 in
 terms
 of
 doing
 producing,


directing,
 or
 do
 you
 love
 how
 everything


kind
 of
 helps
 the
 other
 thing?


I
 do
 like
 the
 blending
 of
 all
 the
 things


and
 I
 come
 from
 the
 independent
 sector.


You
 know,
 I
 I
 came
 into
 this
 business


making
 $3
 movies
 in
 my
 kitchen
 with
 my


brother
 on
 our
 parents'
 video
 camera.


So,
 I
 I'm
 no
 stranger
 to
 doing
 it
 all.


But
 that
 said,
 I
 think
 that
 uh
 as
 I've


been
 fortunate
 enough
 to
 do
 both
 indie


projects
 and
 also
 be
 on
 a
 show
 like
 the


morning
 show,
 which
 you
 know,
 one
 day's


catering
 on
 that
 show
 is
 more
 expensive


than
 most
 of
 the
 work
 I
 make.
 Uh
 I
 like


the
 I
 like
 the
 balance.
 You
 know,
 I
 like


hanging
 lights
 with
 my
 friends
 and


sweating
 on
 my
 indie
 projects,
 but
 then


I
 like
 when
 my
 burrito
 is
 brought
 to
 me


in
 the
 trailer
 of
 the
 morning
 show
 and


I'm
 taken
 care
 of.
 So
 these
 are
 the


things
 someone
 who
 likes
 when
 his


burrito
 is
 brought
 to
 you.


Yeah.
 Who
 doesn't
 like
 a
 burrito


delivery?
 Also
 a
 trailer.
 Pretty
 nice.


Yeah.
 I
 I'm
 I'm
 wondering
 about
 if
 you


were
 getting
 into
 the
 business
 right
 now


and
 how
 that
 would
 be
 different.
 It's


like
 you're
 you're
 be
 making
 movies
 in


your
 kitchen
 with
 your
 brother,
 but


maybe
 you'd
 be
 using
 an
 iPhone.
 You'd
 be


editing
 it
 using
 AI.


I
 think
 the
 headline
 is
 the
 the


democratization
 of
 the
 technology
 has


made
 it
 so
 wonderful
 that
 you
 can
 make


anything
 you
 want
 now
 so
 much
 more


cheaply
 than
 than
 I
 had
 it.
 So
 you
 have


it
 a
 lot
 better
 than
 me
 on
 that
 front,


but
 you
 have
 it
 way
 worse
 than
 I
 had
 it


in
 2005
 when
 I
 came
 in
 because
 the


talk
 about
 that.
 But
 the
 distribution


channels
 are
 not
 there,
 right?
 Um,
 and


so
 we're
 now
 experiencing
 sort
 of
 the


death
 of
 the
 hyperbolic
 television


movement,
 right?
 And
 we
 we
 staffed
 up


and
 we
 got
 all
 ready
 for
 it
 and
 and
 here


we
 are
 and
 then
 it
 just
 dried
 up
 on
 us.


Um,
 so
 now
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 start


hacking
 a
 new
 road
 um
 of
 direct
 to


consumer
 distribution.
 You
 know,
 we're


working
 in
 so
 many
 different
 models
 now.


making
 television
 series
 completely


independently
 and
 taking
 them
 out
 and


selling
 them
 afterwards
 because
 it
 is


the
 wild
 west.


Well,
 you
 know,
 it's
 funny
 that
 you
 say


that
 because
 I
 think
 about
 something


like
 YouTube
 and
 how
 much
 I
 watch


YouTube
 and
 specific
 channels
 and
 like


anybody
 can
 put
 anything
 up
 there
 when


you
 think
 about
 distri
 distribution


channels
 or
 what
 what
 seems
 to
 provide


the
 most
 opportunities
 for
 you,


especially
 since
 you
 say


you
 play
 a
 little bit
 more
 in
 the
 indie


world.


Yeah.
 Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 look,
 I'm
 very
 very


fortunate
 and
 that
 I've
 been
 doing
 this


for
 20
 years.
 So,
 you
 know,
 I
 at least


have
 somewhat
 of
 a
 name
 that
 people
 are


interested
 in
 working
 with
 us.
 But
 I


think
 YouTube
 is
 certainly
 exciting


because
 you
 can
 put
 it
 up,
 it
 can
 catch


fire,
 but
 the
 monetization
 of
 that
 and


the
 sustainability
 is
 really


questionable
 in
 my
 opinion.
 But
 then
 you


have
 these
 smaller
 substreamer
 services


like
 you
 look
 at
 Dropout
 TV
 and
 what


they're
 doing
 in
 comedy.
 And
 you
 look
 at


um
 Shutter,
 you
 know,
 they've
 become
 the


home
 of
 horror
 fans
 as
 a
 subsidiary


under
 AMC,
 you
 know,
 and
 they're
 doing


things
 in
 a
 lowcost
 model.
 So,
 I
 think


the
 future
 here
 is
 going
 to
 be
 figuring


out
 how
 to
 make
 things
 relatively


cheaply,
 cutting
 your
 big
 producer
 fees,


cutting
 a
 lot
 of
 everybody's
 fee
 across


the
 board,
 and
 then
 when
 you're
 in
 a


position
 to
 be
 on
 top
 and
 power,
 really


share
 that
 back
 end
 with
 people.
 And


that's
 how
 I
 came
 up
 in
 independent


film.
 We
 would
 make
 movies
 for
 $150,000.


Everybody
 would
 make
 a hundred
 bucks
 a


day.
 It
 was
 creative
 communism.
 And
 then


you
 get
 points.
 We
 could
 take
 them
 to


Sundance
 and
 sell
 them
 for
 a
 couple


million
 bucks.
 And
 the
 sound
 guy
 would


make
 $50,000
 and
 buy
 a
 home.
 It
 was
 a


beautiful
 time.


It's
 not
 quite
 that
 easy
 anymore,
 but


there's
 something
 in
 that
 model
 that


will
 still
 work.


I
 talked
 to
 somebody
 who
 lives
 out
 here.


He's
 in
 the
 industry.
 He's
 been
 doing


this
 for
 30
 years.
 And
 he
 was
 like,


I've
 got
 award-winning
 casting
 directors


walking
 dogs
 on
 Rover
 to
 make
 ends
 meet.


No,
 it's
 real.


Is
 it
 that
 bad?
 I
 mean
 I
 live
 in
 the


valley
 which
 is
 you
 know
 the
 place
 where


basically
 below
 the
 line
 union
 heads


were
 able
 to
 buy
 their
 homes
 you
 know


and
 and
 that
 was
 under
 the
 sort
 of


unspoken
 promise
 that
 this
 industry


would
 continue
 to
 boom
 strikes
 fires
 but


not
 just
 that
 the
 death
 of
 the
 streaming


wars
 which
 were
 unsustainable
 from
 the


that
 was
 just
 an
 arms
 race
 to
 see


Netflix
 who
 could
 choke
 somebody
 out


right


Netflix
 and
 Apple
 are
 the
 winners


I
 mean
 TVD
 because
 we
 could
 see
 a
 merger


happen
 in
 five
 minutes
 after
 this
 that


changes
 everything.
 Um
 and
 there
 are
 I


won't
 I
 won't
 go
 that
 far,
 but
 yes,


there
 there
 are
 certain
 people
 that
 have


interest
 in
 those
 mergers
 and
 don't
 have


interest
 in
 them.


So
 So
 does
 do
 you
 see
 the
 industry


getting
 better?


Um
 I
 think
 the
 industry
 is
 going
 to


change.
 Look,
 I've
 been
 in
 this
 for
 20


years.
 I
 know
 people
 who
 are
 been
 in


this
 for
 much
 longer
 than
 me
 and
 we


there
 are
 times
 when
 oh
 my
 god,
 it
 was


the
 1980s.
 If
 you
 had
 a
 movie
 that
 had,


you
 know,
 a
 gun
 and
 blood
 and
 some


fighting
 in
 it,
 you
 could
 take
 it
 to
 VHS


and
 you'd
 make
 your
 money
 and
 it
 was
 a


killer.
 In
 the
 '9s,
 it
 was
 that
 for


DVDs.
 In
 the
 2000s,
 the
 streamers
 came


in
 and
 I
 got
 to
 make
 all
 these
 cool


movies
 for
 Netflix
 and
 TV.
 But
 it's


going
 to
 change.
 We
 don't
 know
 which
 way


it's
 going,
 but
 we
 got
 to
 be
 vigilant.


You
 know,
 it's
 we've
 seen
 it
 in
 the


media
 industry
 and
 we
 still
 like
 being


in
 it.
 It's
 incredible
 to
 be
 30
 seconds.


You're
 still
 having
 fun.
 You
 like
 it.


I
 love
 it.
 I
 don't
 say
 I'm
 having
 fun


all
 the
 time.
 I
 feel
 a
 deep


responsibility
 for
 like
 my
 brothers
 and


sisters
 in
 LA
 and
 in
 New
 York
 and


everywhere
 who
 are
 just
 getting
 choked


out
 by
 this
 business.
 So,
 I'm
 trying
 to


find
 what
 is
 that
 thin
 lane
 that
 I
 still


want
 to
 make
 outlier
 interesting
 content


but
 at
 the
 right
 price
 that
 makes
 sense


and
 sustains
 us
 and
 I
 I
 don't
 have
 all


the
 answers
 for
 that.


So,
 appreciate
 uh
 you
 joining
 us.
 I
 know


you're
 going
 up
 on
 a
 panel.
 Um
 looking


forward
 to
 hearing
 that
 as
 well.
 Mark,


thank
 you
 so
 much.


Cheers,
 guys.


Yeah,
 take
 care.
