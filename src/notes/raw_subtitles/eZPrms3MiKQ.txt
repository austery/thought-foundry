Hello everyone, I am Anthony
Welcome to my channel
Today's show
Let’s continue to explore
Chinese society's self-deprecating online subculture
In the previous video
We talked about
Diaosi literature was popular on the Chinese Internet in the early years
That is, individuals use negative,
Derogatory or even insulting name
As a symbol of self-referentiality and self-naming
And through constant self-deprecation on the Internet
Catharsis and carnival
After more than ten years of development
The Diaosi narrative is not only not dead
Instead, in the workplace, education,
Various sub-areas such as original family
A more refined differentiation
For example, words like test-taker, worker, ox-horse, etc.
As China's social involution intensifies
This kind of self-deprecation, self-surrender
Mental Failure Method
and the mad literature associated with it,
Abstract culture, etc.
Gradually becoming mainstream
This also confirms that young people play an important role in social structure.
The growing sense of powerlessness
However
Our resistance to this online subculture
and critical
Don't overestimate
Although it expresses
A certain dissatisfaction and resentment towards the social structure
But the strength and depth of this dissatisfaction and structure
It is actually very limited
Not only that
These self-deprecating orgies are in another dimension
It is precisely to consolidate and maintain
Reproduction of the hierarchical order
If we must say what this culture really deconstructs
So
It is the transcendence and subjectivity of the self
Deconstructed
As for social order and mainstream ideology
It is motionless.
This is also destined
It hardly points to a meaningful action.
Today's video
Let’s explore this further.
These words
How is it cryptically
Reproduction of the hierarchical order
One more thing before we start
If you are interested in today's video
Interested or
Do you have any topic you want to discuss with me?
You can contact my email to make an appointment
Let's get back to our topic today.
First, let’s talk about individual participation
This collective self-mockery
Why does it bring pleasure?
I believe everyone still remembers
In this video on January 4th
We mentioned Althusser's view
That is
The manipulation of people by various ideologies in modern society
Often not through direct and violent
and naked orders
Tell people
You have to obey your own subjectivity
You have to obey yourself
However, this subjectivity
It is not necessarily the true subjectivity of the individual
It is induced by ideology.
Subjectivity is the result of individual misrecognition
coercive state apparatus
and the ideological state apparatus
The difference between the two is
Coercive state apparatus
Mainly through violence and coercion
To play a functional
Such as the army, police, courts, prisons, etc.
The ideological state apparatus
Mainly through ideological means
To control people
Such as schools, religions, media, cultural industries, etc.
therefore
Compared to direct violence
Ideological manipulation
To be more subtle and concealed
That is, interpellation
In French, the word "call" means to call someone.
For example, in the military
The officer called your name.
You will answer subconsciously
In school
The teacher calls your name
You will subconsciously sit up straight and raise your head
This is because
Ideology in the Army and Schools
Assigning the identity of "good soldier" or "good student" to individuals
and issue orders in the name of an individual
For example, you are not obeying your superiors and teachers.
You are becoming a better version of yourself
However, this kind of identity recognition and identity construction
Often it is not the result of individual choice.
But once an individual chooses to accept this identity
It is no longer an individual in the natural sense.
It will gradually internalize the ideological standards
for example
A student realized
"Good students should work hard to get high scores"
Because "grades represent ability
It represents the intrinsic value of my whole being.”
then
When the student violates school discipline
Even if no teacher criticized him
Or no one noticed him.
He still feels guilty and miserable.
Even if the teacher praises him
It can't offset his self-blame.
Because he felt he had violated himself.
This is
The manifestation of individuals internalizing school ideology
in this case
Individuals do not just follow some external rules
Rather, the individual and the evaluation rules are completely unified
Fully internalized the authority of the school evaluation system
and uniqueness
Generally speaking
This close integration
Only when you encounter some major setbacks and frustrations
Only then can gaps be created
Ideology
It also guides mutual recognition between individuals
Since all individuals are referred to as "students"
Even without the supervision of school ideology
After the students left the school
It will still be based on grades and rankings.
Or judging each other by academic qualifications or other standards
Reproducing school ideology
For example, if you see someone go to a top university
It was also successful later
I subconsciously think
He must have been admitted to this university.
That's what gave him such strong abilities.
Seeing someone didn't get into college
I subconsciously think
The other party will most likely fail in the future.
Although this judgment is often in line with reality
for example
Someone who dropped out of college because of depression
After entering the society
I also encountered many setbacks and hardships.
However
The explanations for this phenomenon can be quite different.
for example
His failure and frustration were not because he dropped out of school
Rather, it is the whole society's recognition of the school's ideology.
Constantly giving him negative and pessimistic psychological hints
Make him feel like a loser
This caused him to lose confidence in learning.
That is to say
If he could live in a country that is very tolerant of dropping out of school
In an environment that respects individual values ​​and potential
Even if he dropped out of school
He may also develop outstanding abilities
Dropping out of school itself is not a decisive factor
The reproduction function of ideology is also reflected in
Those ideological rebels
Often they have not really escaped from the original system.
for example
A student hates the school rules and regulations
He put all his energy into
Violating school rules, skipping classes, dyeing hair
For him
There's no particular value in doing this.
Just because
These behaviors are defined as rebellion by the school.
However
His life still revolves around school.
if
He really has a deep reflection on the school ideology
He should focus his energy directly
Focus on accumulating more important abilities
Do what you really want to do
Don't care at all
or
Just pay minimal attention to the school rules.
Because of his rebellious and
Not built on a solid foundation
Therefore, his personality is also extremely fragile.
For example, after he entered society
Once you hit a wall, it's easy to regret
Maybe even teach your children in the future
“You can have personality
But you still have to study hard
Don’t be like me.”
In addition, ideology
It also has strong self-repair capabilities
Even if someone wants to criticize ideology
There will also be strong resistance from ideology.
for example
We have previously introduced
The educational system criticized by Bourdieu
How does it reproduce social inequality?
Then a wise teacher might say to his students
Bourdieu's criticism of education is profound.
Correct
But everyone should pay attention
Bourdieu
Louis-le-Grand Lycée
Graduated from École Normale Supérieure
If this were in China
is equivalent to
The super-successful student who has been studying at TOPS in Haidian District since childhood
so
You should first get into a key high school and a key university.
The teacher's rebuttal is very clever.
Most students shut up when they get here.
This reflects
A powerful reproduction of ideology
and self-healing capabilities
It can be done in a seemingly enlightened way
Selectively absorb those who criticize you
and convert it into
Another argument for its own legitimacy
It makes the individual feel
Reflection and criticism are a luxury in themselves
The winner in the system
An advanced activity that only
You want to criticize and challenge the system
Must obey the system first
Accept the harm of the system
But in this process
You have already unconsciously
Transformed and domesticated by ideology
Eventually lost critical
Through the above discussion
We can find
Ideology is not only everywhere
And has tenacious vitality
When individuals accept ideology
The identity given to oneself
It is inevitable
To accept the ideal subject set by ideology
and failed subjects
For example, the ideology after the reform and opening up
This is the concept of struggle:
In the field of education
emphasize
The College Entrance Examination as the Most Important Mechanism for Class Mobility
The ideal subject being called
Through hard study
Intellectual elites who change personal destiny
In the economic field
Refusal to acknowledge any structural problems
Emphasize that personal worldly achievements are the only value of human beings
The ideal subject being questioned
Consumers with strong shopping desires
However
Many people have found
Not only did I not pass the knowledge
Truly change your personal destiny
They do not have strong spending power.
Instead, I feel
The gap between oneself and one's ideal self is widening
That is to say
I am gradually becoming
Losers defined by ideology
This descent is slow, anxious, and painful.
So individuals devalue themselves
Even degraded myself
A level that is seriously unrealistic
For example, losers, test-takers, etc.
this
Instead, it can play a role in satirizing ideology.
Exposing the absurdity of ideology
Thus, he temporarily escaped the call of ideology.
Since I can't succeed
Then I will fail.
Even more unsuccessful than you thought
This makes the success narrative ridiculous.
This kind of mental failure
It is also the fundamental driving force of the Diaosi narrative in Chinese society.
For example, a white-collar worker working in an office
Making fun of myself online every day
I am just a bricklayer.
This can play a role in satirizing workplace ideology
If he is really a bricklayer on a construction site
So
This kind of self-mockery lacks the ironic tension at all.
It's a statement of reality.
Of course there is no pleasure at all.
Another Key to the Mental Failure Method
Turning passivity into initiative
This reduces the shame of being humiliated and judged.
That is to say, instead of waiting for authority and evaluation system
Suddenly give me a negative label in the future
I'd rather humiliate myself first.
Taunt
That way I have nothing to lose.
No more anxiety
This is similar to
In SM games
Being abused is painful in itself.
However, when the masochist actively chooses to be masochistic
Turning passivity into initiative
On the contrary, psychologically
Gained a subtle sense of control
As if I could control the pain.
On what occasion
When does it happen?
A victory over pain
This way the parties can feel
Pain doesn't come suddenly.
I had arranged it in advance.
It happened according to my plan.
It's the result of my choice
So I eliminated
Anxiety caused by passivity and uncertainty
Of course, the SM game itself
It is based on the knowledge and consent of both parties.
Therefore, this kind of role-playing is understandable.
But people who participate in online self-deprecation
To a large extent
I got into this game unconsciously.
In fact, we can find
This self-mockery that seems to deconstruct ideology
On the surface, it touches on the issue of class
In fact, in another obscure way
Realized the reproduction of a certain old order
For example, the original meaning of the "Xing Gong Zhuan" stalk is:
"Wake up, the foreman is calling you to get up and move bricks"
Many people use this joke
Expressing some dissatisfaction with the boss and workplace oppression
But as we said before
The person who played this joke
They are basically white-collar workers working in offices.
Self-deprecation with moving bricks
Precisely because
Their work is different from real brick-moving work
Have enough distance
This sense of distance
Making brick-moving a symbol of humor
It does not threaten their identity.
result
This kind of self-mockery not only did not touch any class barriers
Instead, through the appropriation of symbols
Strengthened the invisible concept that "moving bricks equals low-level labor"
The same is true for the “working people” stalk.
This makes
Real manual laborer
Even moving bricks and working
The right to use these symbols does not
This actually exacerbated their cultural and public opinion
Further exclusion and marginalization
They are not only not the main body of failure
Even the qualifications to enter the main coding system
None
It has become what Zizek calls the "real world"
That is, a blind spot that cannot enter the symbolic world.
For example, I once saw an employee of a large factory
Complaining about working too much overtime online
Finally asked:
Is this an Internet company?
Or an assembly line electronics factory?
This obviously implies this
Electronics factory workers deserve to have no human rights
This is just a moment
The universality and justice of one's rights protection
Completely dissolved
This is the case with many things in China.
The resistance of the oppressed
It may also support another kind of oppression
For example
There is a popular self-deprecating trend among Chinese college students.
For your own school
Give it a name similar to a specialty
For example, Tsinghua University is located in Wudaokou, Haidian District.
So it's called Wudaokou Vocational and Technical College
Shanghai Jiaotong University is located in Minhang District
Known as Minhang Institute of Technology
Or Dongchuan Road Vocational and Technical College
Another example is Southeast University, located in Nanjing.
But many students call their school "Fujian University Third Class"
etc.
This is of course also a similar kind of self-mockery and self-deprecation.
Lowering society's expectations of you
Thus alleviating the problem of not meeting social expectations
The anxiety caused
But it is similar to the jokes about working and moving bricks.
Although it superficially attempts to deconstruct school ideology
The pressure on individuals
But in fact
It is through the direct occupation of college or three-year symbols
To convey a secret sense of superiority
This just consolidates the school's ideology.
Because this kind of ridicule itself
It is also built on some kind of barrier.
At least a 211 or higher university
Only then can I play this kind of joke
If a student from a second-tier university
I also joked that my school is a junior college.
You will lose that contrast and tension.
Because the boundary between the second-tier college and the junior college
It's actually quite blurry.
So self-deprecating
On the contrary, it is more likely to strengthen the outside world's prejudice against them.
In China, the original meaning of self-deprecation is
Perhaps it includes the deconstruction of social hierarchy
But in practice
However, it often exacerbates the marginalization of vulnerable groups.
and anonymization
Students from junior colleges or third-tier universities
They also became a group that could not enter the symbolic realm.
The concepts of "junior college" and "three-year college"
Just like "working people" and "moving bricks"
It has gone beyond its own meaning
It has become a kind of derogatory energy value in a general sense.
These words
Both reflect China’s structural inequality.
Very severe
It's so serious that even if some people resist
This structure
It is still based on the existing order.
Implicit Identity
and reproduction
