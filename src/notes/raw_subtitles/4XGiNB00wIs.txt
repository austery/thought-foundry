[Music]


hi
 everybody
 and
 welcome
 to
 our
 podcast


in
 good
 company
 now
 today
 we
 have
 a


special
 guest
 with
 us
 aren
 mayor
 who
 is


one
 of
 the
 world's
 leading
 Specialists


on
 crosscultural
 management
 and
 a
 good


thing
 she's
 written
 one
 of
 my
 favorite


books
 called
 culture
 map
 so
 arene
 um


what
 inspire
 you
 to
 to
 write
 this
 book


yeah
 hey
 so
 nice
 to
 be
 here
 with
 you


today
 um
 well
 so
 I
 was
 raised
 in


Minnesota
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 Norwegians
 in


Minnesota
 you
 might
 know
 which
 is
 in
 the


Midwest
 of
 the
 US
 and
 as
 a
 so
 it
 was
 a


very
 monocultural
 environment
 I
 was


really
 surrounded
 by
 people
 who
 had
 only


lived
 in
 the
 same
 culture
 as
 me
 uh
 and


then
 as
 a
 after
 graduating
 from


University
 I
 moved
 to
 Botswana
 to


Southern
 Africa
 and
 I
 was
 teaching


school
 there
 and
 I
 just
 saw
 how
 all
 of


the
 techniques
 that
 I
 had
 learned
 in
 the


US
 for
 how
 to
 motivate
 children
 and
 how


to
 create
 a
 good
 classroom
 environment


uh
 were
 totally
 falling
 flat
 and
 the


things
 that
 they
 were
 encouraging
 me
 to


do
 in
 the
 classroom
 were
 so
 different


than
 anything
 we
 would
 ever
 do
 in
 the
 US


so
 I
 became
 very
 interested
 in
 that
 time


to
 just
 see
 how
 in
 different
 cultures
 we


um
 not
 only
 that
 we
 motivate
 children


differently
 but
 that
 we
 motivate
 later


on
 in
 life
 our
 employees
 differently
 and


that
 we
 have
 a
 whole
 different


psychology
 about
 how
 to
 communicate
 and


how
 to
 build
 trust
 and
 be
 effective
 uh


so
 that
 was
 the
 first
 step
 on
 this


journey
 uh
 for
 starting
 to
 study
 how


different
 cultures
 interact
 in
 an


international
 environment
 which
 is
 what


I
 do
 now
 yeah
 great
 great
 so
 um
 you
 um


have
 kind
 of
 split
 culture
 into
 eight


different
 dimensions
 and
 if
 you
 don't


mind
 I'd
 just
 love
 to
 talk
 through
 some


of
 them
 because
 I
 think
 it's
 so


interesting
 and
 me
 it
 really
 it
 really


made
 me
 think
 about
 how
 we
 run
 you
 know


our
 fund
 uh
 when
 we
 are
 in
 in
 several


different
 countries
 you
 know
 we
 are
 in


in
 Norway
 London
 we
 in
 New
 York


Singapore
 yet
 we
 kind
 of
 treat
 it
 as
 as


as
 one
 culture
 and
 of
 course
 it
 isn't


but
 you
 you
 kick
 off
 with
 communication


and
 you
 uh
 have
 this
 differential


between
 low
 and
 high
 context


communication
 cultures
 what
 does
 that


mean
 yeah
 so
 maybe
 I'll
 just
 take
 a


moment
 to
 explain
 the
 framework
 and
 then


I'll
 jump
 into
 low
 and
 high
 so
 I
 have
 a


methodology
 that
 breaks
 culture
 down


into
 eight
 behavioral
 scales
 so
 we
 look


at
 things
 like
 how
 do
 we
 build
 trust


differently
 in
 different
 cultures
 or
 how


do
 we
 make
 decisions
 differently
 in


different
 parts
 of
 the
 world
 and
 then


through
 about
 180,000
 interviews
 that


we've
 conducted
 in
 about
 62
 countries
 we


have
 these
 countries
 that
 are
 positioned


up
 and
 down
 the
 scale
 so
 you
 can
 compare


one
 culture
 to
 another
 in
 order
 to
 think


about
 um
 both
 the
 similarities
 and


differences
 and
 how
 to
 be
 more
 strategic


and
 empathic
 and
 of
 course
 you've
 just


highlighted
 one
 of
 my
 favorite


Dimensions
 it's
 the
 the
 one
 I
 write
 and


speak
 about
 the
 most
 which
 is
 one
 that


looks
 at
 what
 it
 means
 to
 be
 a
 good


communicator
 in
 different
 parts
 of
 the


world
 and
 what
 we
 have
 what
 we
 call
 low


context
 cultures
 these
 are
 cultures


where
 we're
 really
 trained
 to
 be
 very


explicit
 in
 the
 way
 that
 we
 communicate


so
 the
 US
 which
 is
 maybe
 the
 most
 uh
 low


context
 or
 explicit
 culture
 in
 the
 world


and
 I
 was
 like
 taught
 as
 a
 child
 uh
 to


tell
 them
 what
 I'm
 going
 to
 tell
 them


and
 then
 tell
 them
 and
 then
 tell
 them


what
 I've
 told
 them
 it's
 the
 very
 Focus


strong
 focus
 on
 like
 spelling
 things
 out


and
 what
 I've
 learned
 living
 in
 other


parts
 of
 the
 world
 I
 live
 in
 France


currently
 I've
 lived
 in
 France
 for
 the


last
 uh
 23
 years
 uh
 is
 that
 in
 many


other
 cultures
 like
 France
 for
 example


there's
 a
 lot
 more
 like
 a
 good


communicator
 is
 really
 passing
 a
 lot


more
 information
 between
 the
 lines
 and


picking
 up
 a
 lot
 of
 unspoken
 messages
 so


the
 sophistic
 uh
 the
 sophistication
 of


the
 of
 the
 communication
 is
 much
 higher


and
 I
 mean
 an
 example
 of
 that
 would
 be


just
 even
 in
 the
 French
 language
 like
 uh


we
 have
 this
 word
 in


French
 means
 don't
 listen
 to
 what
 I
 said


listen
 to
 what
 I
 meant
 right
 we
 don't


even
 have
 these
 words
 in
 English
 uh
 so
 I


think
 this
 is
 a
 great
 Dimension
 to
 help


us
 start
 thinking
 about
 how
 effective


communication
 is
 so
 different
 from
 one


part
 of
 the
 world
 to
 another
 so
 when
 I


go
 to
 uh
 New
 York
 how
 should
 I


communicate
 differently
 well
 I
 think
 I


mean
 in
 New
 York
 which
 is
 of
 course
 a


place
 of
 immigration
 right
 like
 when
 you


go
 to
 New
 York
 you've
 got
 people
 from


all
 over
 the
 world
 who
 are
 now
 living


together
 Under
 the
 Umbrella
 of
 the


American
 culture
 and
 in
 that
 highly


diverse
 culture
 we've
 learned
 that
 we


really
 have
 to
 spell
 things
 out
 so
 if


you
 don't
 say
 it
 it
 was
 uncommunicated


and
 maybe
 I'll
 just
 give
 like
 a
 brand


new
 example
 that
 I
 have
 just
 from
 last
 a


week
 but
 um
 like
 I
 had
 this
 this
 person


from
 Italy
 in
 my
 class
 who
 said
 to
 me


you
 know
 Erin
 in
 Italy
 like
 if
 you
 make


a
 joke
 and
 the
 other
 person
 thinks
 it's


funny
 they
 laugh
 but
 in
 the
 US
 if
 you


make
 a
 joke
 and
 the
 other
 person
 thinks


it's
 funny
 they
 say
 that's


funny
 and
 I
 like
 I
 had
 never
 thought


about
 this
 why
 do
 nobody
 ever
 say
 that


about
 my


jokes
 I
 it's
 all
 it's
 all
 between
 the


lines
 right
 um
 so
 in
 any
 case
 I
 mean
 at


the
 end
 of
 that
 that
 situation
 with
 the


with
 the
 uh
 the
 Italian
 was
 I
 never


thought
 about
 this
 so
 I
 said
 oh
 yeah


you're
 right
 we
 we
 laugh
 and
 we
 say


that's
 funny
 and
 he
 said
 no
 Erin
 I've


been
 observing
 this
 a
 lot
 in
 the
 US
 the


the
 laughter
 is
 optional
 do
 you
 think


the
 world
 is
 moving
 towards
 a
 more


American
 communication
 style
 more


punchlines
 shorter


sentences
 well
 I
 mean
 I
 do
 believe
 that


we
 have
 to
 be
 that
 we're
 we've
 become


perhaps
 shorter
 in
 our
 communication


which
 happens
 with
 being
 more
 and
 more


virtual
 but
 I
 want
 to
 give
 you
 an


example
 so
 I
 had
 an
 example
 just
 a


couple
 of
 of
 well
 maybe
 12
 months
 ago


where
 I
 was
 giving
 a
 presentation
 in


Japan
 and
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 presentation


I
 asked
 if
 there
 were
 any
 questions
 no


one
 raised
 their
 hand
 I
 went
 to
 sit
 down


so
 one
 of
 my
 colleagues
 this
 Japanese


guy
 who
 was
 traveling
 with
 me
 he
 came
 up


to
 me
 and
 he
 said
 Erin
 I
 think
 there


were
 some
 questions
 uh
 would
 you
 like
 me


to
 try
 and
 I
 said
 yes
 please
 so
 he
 stood


up
 in
 front
 of
 this
 group
 of
 Japanese


and
 he
 said
 you
 know
 uh
 Professor
 Meyer


has
 just
 spoken
 with
 you
 do
 you
 have
 any


questions
 no
 one
 raised
 their
 hand
 uh


but
 he
 he
 stopped
 and
 he
 he
 quietly


looked
 around
 the
 room
 and
 then
 after


several
 seconds
 of
 Silence
 he
 gestured


to
 someone
 who
 was
 sitting
 there
 from
 my


perspective
 motionless
 and
 he
 said
 you


know
 do
 you
 have
 a
 question
 and
 this


Japanese
 guy
 sat
 up
 straight
 and
 he
 said


thank
 you
 very
 much
 I
 do
 he
 gave
 a
 f
 he


asked
 a
 fascinating
 question
 so


afterwards
 and
 then
 my
 colleague
 did


that
 three
 more
 times
 so
 afterwards
 I


said
 to
 him
 but
 how
 did
 you
 know
 that


those
 people
 had


questions
 he
 said
 well
 um
 it
 had
 to
 do


with
 how
 bright
 Their
 Eyes


Were
 and
 I
 thought
 wow
 you
 know
 for
 me


coming
 from
 Minnesota
 like
 I
 do
 that's


very
 challenging
 but
 then
 he
 clarified


he
 said
 you
 know
 Erin
 in
 Japan
 we
 don't


make
 as
 much
 direct
 eye
 contact
 as
 you


do
 in
 the
 west
 so
 when
 you
 asked
 if


there
 were
 any
 questions
 most
 people


weren't
 looking
 right
 at
 you
 they
 were


kind
 of
 looking
 somewhere
 else
 but
 I


noticed
 that
 there
 were
 a
 couple
 of


people
 in
 the
 room
 who
 really
 were


looking
 right
 at
 you
 and
 their
 eyes
 were


bright
 you
 know
 suggesting
 they
 would
 be


happy
 to
 have
 you
 call
 on
 them
 if
 you


would
 like
 to
 that
 was
 such
 an
 important


learning
 experience
 for
 me
 and
 you
 might


think
 oh
 okay
 well
 that's
 Japan
 Japan
 is


really
 like
 different
 from
 the
 rest
 of


the
 world
 but
 I
 can
 tell
 you
 when
 I
 got


back
 to
 inad
 right
 so
 I'm
 a
 professor
 at


inad
 outside
 of
 Paris
 and
 I
 teach
 these


um
 these
 like
 hugely
 International


classrooms
 and
 when
 I
 got
 back
 to
 inad


with
 this
 kind
 of
 lesson
 about
 looking


for
 Bright
 Eyes
 in
 my
 classes
 I
 saw


there
 were
 all
 of
 these
 people
 who
 were


giving
 me
 this
 physical
 indication
 with


their
 faces
 that
 they
 wanted
 to
 speak


that
 I
 wasn't
 entirely
 missing
 because


in
 the
 US
 if
 you
 want
 to
 speak
 you


always
 raise
 your
 hand
 right
 what's
 the


key
 to
 this
 uh
 cultural
 sensitivity
 the


key
 to
 observe
 people
 in
 this
 astute
 way


is
 it
 do
 you
 have
 to
 live
 in
 a
 country


and
 train
 or
 do
 people
 just
 have
 better


antennas
 or
 what
 is
 it
 of
 course
 if
 you


go
 and
 you
 live
 in
 another
 country
 um


eventually
 you
 will
 really
 start
 kind
 of


like
 absorbing
 that
 culture
 in
 you
 you


have
 those
 experiences
 you
 learn
 to
 be


more
 humble
 you
 learn
 to
 be
 more
 curious


hopefully
 you
 learn
 to
 be
 more
 Curious


and
 more
 humble
 but
 I
 don't
 think
 you


have
 to
 I
 mean
 you
 don't
 have
 to
 devote


your
 life
 to
 developing
 these
 skills
 by


moving
 from
 country
 to
 Country
 I
 do


believe
 with
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 of


systematic
 understanding
 thinking
 about


you
 know
 how
 do
 different
 cultures


relate
 on
 this
 aspect
 that
 you
 can


become
 more
 effective
 can
 can
 I
 give
 you


another
 example
 sure
 well
 like
 let's


just
 think
 about
 feedback
 I
 mean


feedback
 is
 of
 course
 like
 something


that
 we
 do
 so
 differently
 in
 different


cultures
 and
 er
 this
 kind
 of
 ties
 in


with
 your
 with
 your
 second
 dimension


right
 evaluation
 and
 feedback
 yeah


that's
 it
 right
 yeah
 so
 that
 I
 mean
 that


is
 the
 second
 dimension
 the
 second


dimension
 looks
 at
 how
 we
 provide


feedback
 in
 different
 countries
 and
 I


think
 that
 that
 one
 is
 the
 most


sensitive
 and
 in
 some
 ways
 I
 mean
 the


communicating
 Dimension
 is
 perhaps
 the


most
 like
 kind
 of
 interesting
 one
 but
 if


you
 want
 to
 know
 if
 you
 want
 to
 if
 you


want
 if
 if
 you're
 going
 to
 cause
 offense


or
 you're
 going
 to
 break
 a
 relationship


it's
 because
 of
 the
 feedback
 Dimension


and
 maybe
 I'll
 just
 give
 you
 an
 example


so
 um
 of
 course
 as
 I
 already
 said
 I
 come


from
 the
 US
 and
 in
 the
 US
 we
 think
 of


ourselves
 as
 being
 a
 very
 direct
 culture


because
 we're
 so
 low
 context
 because


we're
 so
 explicit
 and
 we
 spell
 things


out
 but
 we
 actually
 have
 this
 tendency


in
 the
 US
 I
 I
 learned
 as
 a
 child
 to
 when


I
 give
 feedback
 to
 give
 three
 positives


with
 every
 negative
 or
 to
 catch
 people


doing
 things
 right
 and
 like
 if
 you're


from
 Norway
 where
 maybe
 you've
 learned


that
 you
 know
 you
 if
 you
 have
 something


that
 well
 I
 think
 in
 Norway
 often
 you


don't
 give
 the
 positive
 feedback
 the


positive
 feedback
 may
 be
 just
 kind
 of


assumed
 so
 then
 you're
 giving
 me


feedback
 and
 you
 start
 by
 telling
 me
 you


know
 what
 you
 think
 I
 I
 could
 do


differently
 I
 may
 really
 take
 that
 as
 a


sign
 of
 of
 disrespect
 right
 and
 then
 in


the
 other
 way
 it
 gets
 really
 confusing


so
 so
 okay
 you
 know
 I
 live
 in
 France
 and


I
 was
 working
 and
 in
 France
 positive


feedback
 is
 giv
 a
 lot
 less
 frequently


than
 in
 the
 US
 and
 negative
 or


corrective
 feedback
 is
 definitely
 giving


more
 strongly
 than
 in
 an
 American


context
 so
 I'm
 working
 with
 this
 French


woman
 oh
 here's
 someone
 from
 the
 from


the
 book
 the
 book
 this
 woman
 Sabine


right
 and
 she's
 um
 she's
 uh
 really


excited
 about
 this
 move
 that
 she's


making
 to
 Chicago
 so
 we
 spend
 a
 little


time
 she's
 she's
 all
 energized
 then
 she


moves
 to
 the
 US
 and
 after
 she's
 been
 in


Chicago
 for
 four
 months
 I
 do
 a


prescheduled
 follow-up
 call
 and
 before
 I


call
 her
 I
 call
 her
 new
 boss
 this
 this


American
 named
 John
 and
 I
 just
 say
 to


John
 you
 know
 how
 are
 things
 going
 for


Sabine
 and
 he
 says
 you
 know
 eron
 not


well
 it's
 so
 frustrating
 because
 I've


spoken
 with
 Sabine
 a
 bunch
 of
 times


about
 these
 things
 she
 really
 needs
 to


change
 if
 she's
 going
 to
 be
 successful


and
 she
 hasn't
 made
 any
 effort
 to
 make


these
 changes
 I
 I
 had
 my
 performance


review
 with
 Sabine
 last
 week
 still
 no


effort
 so
 then
 I
 call
 Sabine
 how
 are


things
 going
 in
 the
 US
 and
 she
 says
 you


know
 Erin
 they're
 going
 great
 you
 know
 I


just
 had
 this
 fabulous
 feedback
 from
 my


boss
 it
 was
 the
 best
 performance
 review


I've
 ever
 received
 so
 of
 course
 when
 her


American
 boss
 starts
 his
 feedback
 at
 his


performance
 review
 by
 saying
 you
 know


this
 was
 really
 this
 was
 really


fantastic
 and
 this
 part
 was
 really


thought
 out
 and
 I
 really
 think
 you're


making
 a
 huge
 impact
 here
 she's
 thinking


wow
 that's
 the
 best
 performance
 review


you
 know
 anyone
 has
 ever
 given
 me
 and
 by


the
 time
 he
 gets
 to
 the
 real
 message
 she


isn't
 even
 listening
 anymore
 what
 do
 you


think
 is
 the
 best
 way
 of
 doing
 it
 what's


the
 best
 way
 to
 give
 you
 back
 well
 I
 do


believe
 you
 asked
 me
 earlier
 whether
 you


should
 adapt
 your
 style
 to
 the
 culture


that
 you're
 working
 with
 I
 mean
 I
 do


think
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 feedback
 of


course
 it's
 important
 to
 to
 get
 the


message
 out
 there
 but
 if
 you
 give
 the


message
 in
 a
 way
 that's
 too
 direct
 for


the
 culture
 that
 you're
 working
 with
 you


may
 break
 the
 relationship
 and
 that's


not
 going
 to
 be
 good
 for
 your
 future
 and


if
 you
 give
 if
 you
 give
 the
 feedback
 in


a
 way
 that's
 too
 indirect
 for
 the


culture
 that
 you're
 working
 with
 then


they
 won't
 pick
 up
 the
 message
 and
 you


may
 find
 that
 you
 need
 to
 come
 back
 and


be
 clearer
 the
 next
 time
 it's
 just
 so


difficult
 to
 give
 to
 give
 and
 receive


feedback
 right
 and
 it's
 so
 easy
 to


defend
 people
 to
 offend
 people
 and
 it's


so
 easy
 to
 be
 offended
 and
 I've
 um
 uh


you
 know
 of
 course
 uh
 read
 your
 book
 and


one
 of
 the
 things
 you
 recommend
 is
 to


give
 uh
 you
 know
 positive
 and
 a
 negative


uh
 straight
 after
 the
 the
 action
 so
 I


tried
 this
 today
 I
 gave
 a
 presentation


together
 with
 two
 of
 my
 colleagues


straight
 after
 the
 presentation
 I
 said


hey
 you
 know
 what
 let's
 give
 each
 other


one
 one
 positive
 and
 one
 thing
 we
 need


to
 improve
 and
 it
 was
 just
 great
 you


know
 really
 low
 stress
 felt
 really


natural
 and
 easy
 to
 take
 aboard


yeah
 thank
 you
 so
 that's
 actually
 you're


now
 pulling
 from
 my
 other
 book
 right


from
 my
 no
 rules
 rules
 book
 where
 we


have
 a
 chapter
 on
 giving
 feedback
 in
 an


organization
 and
 how
 to
 create
 an


organizational
 culture
 around
 this
 so
 I


think
 the
 message
 is
 that
 if
 you're


working
 with
 people
 outside
 of
 your
 own


company
 or
 your
 own
 team
 I
 mean
 really


we
 want
 to
 just
 try
 to
 watch
 how
 other


people
 are
 doing
 it
 um
 try
 to
 be
 a


little
 bit
 less
 Direct
 in
 general


because
 we
 don't
 want
 to
 risk
 uh
 um
 we


don't
 want
 to
 risk
 breaking
 the
 Rel


relationship
 um
 and
 then
 gradually
 kind


of
 ease
 in
 to
 being
 a
 little
 bit
 more


direct
 but
 you
 made
 you
 made
 a
 framework


of
 um
 of
 four
 uh
 rules
 what
 what
 are


they
 they
 all
 happen
 to
 start
 with
 an
 A


okay
 okay
 yeah
 those
 are
 my
 Four
 A's
 I


do
 believe
 it's
 really
 a
 really
 good


strategy
 to
 say
 okay
 in
 this
 company


this
 is
 how
 we
 will
 give
 feedback
 which


is
 of
 course
 gives
 us
 a
 common
 platform


for
 how
 we
 work
 with
 one
 another
 and
 the


four
 a
 of
 feedback
 which
 you
 may


Implement
 throughout
 your
 organiz
 ation


are
 number
 one
 when
 you
 give
 feedback


you
 need
 to
 aim
 to
 uh
 aim
 let
 me


freaking
 remember
 you
 need
 need
 to
 aim


to
 help
 aim
 to
 assist
 right
 so
 that's
 of


course
 the
 first
 one
 meaning
 that
 I


don't
 give
 feedback
 just
 because
 I'm


frustrated
 or
 I'm
 angry
 or
 I
 need
 to
 get


get
 get
 something
 off
 my
 chest
 if
 that's


how
 you're
 feeling
 don't
 give
 the


feedback
 at
 all
 but
 if
 I
 see
 oh
 gosh
 you


know
 I
 think
 that
 Nikolai
 could
 be
 a


better
 interviewer
 or
 if
 he
 did
 X
 Y
 or
 Z


and
 I
 have
 an
 idea
 for
 how
 that
 could


help
 help
 you
 well
 in
 that
 case
 I
 have


feedback
 that
 I
 could
 give
 you
 with
 the


aim
 to
 to
 help
 you
 with
 the
 aim
 to


assist
 that's
 your
 first
 a
 the
 second
 a


is
 the
 feedback
 must
 be
 actionable
 and


that's
 of
 course
 critical
 because
 if
 I


have
 feedback
 for
 you
 but
 there
 isn't


anything
 you
 could
 do
 about
 it
 I
 mean


keep
 it
 to
 yourself
 then
 he
 kind
 of
 a


personal
 attack
 you
 know
 yeah
 I
 mean


then
 again
 I
 think
 we
 come
 back
 to
 like


what's
 even
 the
 point
 What's
 even
 the


point
 of
 giving
 the
 feedback
 if
 the


person
 can't
 act
 on
 it
 so
 those
 are
 the


two
 ways
 of
 giving
 feedback
 and
 then
 the


two
 ways
 of
 receiving
 feedback
 are


number
 one
 show
 appreciation
 so
 even
 if


you
 doesn't
 feel
 good
 to
 receive
 that


even
 if
 you
 disagree
 with
 the
 person


don't
 defend
 yourself
 just
 say
 you
 know


what
 I
 thank
 you
 very
 much
 thank
 you
 for


having
 given
 me
 that
 feedback
 I'm
 going


to
 think
 about
 it
 but
 if
 you
 really
 get


a
 feedback
 a
 culture
 of
 feedback
 going


in
 your


organization
 if
 you
 manage
 to
 get
 your


employees
 giving
 a
 lot
 of
 feedback
 to


one
 another
 which
 can
 be
 hugely


beneficial
 for
 the
 organization
 you're


going
 to
 need
 a
 fourth
 a
 also
 and
 that


fourth
 a
 is
 that
 each
 person
 can
 accept


or
 decline
 whatever
 feedback
 is
 given
 to


them
 I
 don't
 mean
 that
 I
 say
 explicitly


thank
 you
 but
 I
 decline
 your


feedback
 I
 mean
 that
 I
 um
 I
 think
 about


the
 feedback
 you
 give
 me
 and
 then
 I


decide
 what
 I'm
 going
 to
 take
 and
 what


I'm
 not
 going
 to
 take
 and
 we
 all
 know


that
 that's
 part
 of
 a
 principle
 of


culture
 of
 of
 uh
 developing
 a
 culture
 of


feedback
 so
 then
 that
 brings
 me
 to
 what


you've
 said
 earlier
 and
 I
 think
 that
 in


that
 case
 if
 you
 get
 that
 culture
 of


feedback
 going
 we
 can
 really
 do
 what
 you


suggested
 uh
 Nikolai
 which
 is
 that
 at


the
 end
 of
 a
 meeting
 we
 can
 say
 hey


let's
 just
 sit
 down
 and
 give
 one
 another


a
 little
 bit
 of
 feedback
 so
 that
 we
 can


be
 more
 successful
 the
 next
 time
 one
 one


thing
 I
 think
 you're
 doing
 you
 did
 well


one
 thing
 I
 think
 that
 you
 could
 do
 to


up
 your
 performance
 next
 time
 you
 give


me
 one
 thing
 you
 think
 I
 did
 well
 one


thing
 you
 think
 that
 I
 could
 do
 to
 up
 my


performance
 next
 time
 and
 in
 doing
 so


all
 that
 feedback
 starts
 to
 get
 out


there
 I
 guess
 the
 advantage
 of
 doing
 it


straight
 after
 a
 meeting
 is
 that
 you
 can


be
 pretty
 quick
 and
 it
 works
 it's
 a
 bit


like
 when
 you
 respond
 to
 an
 email
 if


you're
 really
 quick
 it
 can
 be
 one


sentence
 if
 you
 take
 a
 little
 time
 it


needs
 to
 be
 much
 longer
 so
 I
 guess
 you


save
 some
 time
 time
 as
 well
 but
 just


moving
 on
 here
 um
 so
 another
 dimension


you
 talk
 about
 is
 trust
 what's
 the
 how


do
 you
 build
 trust
 in
 different
 cultures


what's
 the
 what's
 the
 key
 here


yeah
 so
 I
 think
 that
 that's
 actually
 the


the
 the
 most
 foundational
 of
 all
 of
 the


dimensions
 so
 of
 course
 in
 every
 country


in
 the
 world
 we
 have
 to
 have
 trust
 in


order
 to
 get
 work
 done
 I
 mean
 that's


culturally
 Universal
 but
 when
 it
 comes


to
 how
 we
 feel
 trust
 for
 someone
 that's


quite
 different
 from
 one
 country
 to


another
 and
 we
 can
 just
 keep
 it
 simple


there's
 two
 kinds
 of
 trust
 so
 there's


cognitive
 trust
 that's
 like
 trust
 from


my
 brain
 that's
 like
 I
 see
 you
 you
 are


on
 time
 you
 do
 good
 work
 you're
 reliable


I
 trust
 you
 and
 then
 we
 have
 what
 we


call
 effective
 trust
 that's
 like
 trust


from
 my
 heart
 right
 that's
 like
 I
 feel


an
 emotional
 connection
 or
 a
 personal


bond
 with
 you
 I
 feel
 like
 I've
 seen
 who


you
 are
 at
 a
 at
 a
 beyond
 your


professional
 Persona
 and
 because
 I've


seen
 who
 you
 are
 inside
 I
 trust
 you
 now


if
 I
 ask
 you
 why
 you
 trust
 your
 mother


it
 doesn't
 matter
 where
 you
 come
 from


we'll
 talk
 in
 every
 country
 we'll
 talk


about
 effective
 Trust
 but
 if
 I
 ask
 you


why
 you
 trust
 a
 business
 partner
 we'll


see
 a
 lot
 more
 difference
 from
 one
 part


of
 the
 world
 to
 another
 I
 mean
 some


cultures
 like
 like
 my
 actually
 both
 of


our
 cultures
 right
 both
 the
 US
 and
 and


Norway
 which
 are
 both
 quite
 task


oriented
 cultures
 so
 in
 these
 cultures


we
 really
 try
 to
 separate
 like
 cognitive


trust
 for
 work
 and
 effective
 trust
 for


home
 and
 then
 in
 many
 other
 world


cultures
 for
 example
 every
 Emerging


Market
 country
 in
 the
 world
 just
 to
 get


us
 started
 we
 can
 really
 see
 that
 kind


of
 cognitive
 and
 effective
 trust
 all


woven
 together
 in
 a
 work
 environment
 so


the
 importance
 of
 whining
 and
 dining
 is


is
 bigger
 uh
 yeah
 I
 mean
 yes
 clearly
 but


I
 think
 that
 we
 could
 take
 it
 to
 a
 a


different
 level
 by
 saying
 the
 the
 the


goal
 in
 a
 task
 oriented
 Society
 is
 to
 be


friendly
 and
 enjoy
 working
 together
 but


to
 really
 minimize
 well
 minimize


distractions
 in
 order
 to
 stay
 focused
 on


getting
 as
 much
 done
 as
 we
 can
 in
 a


short
 period
 of
 Time
 Versus
 in
 a


relationship
 oriented
 culture
 we
 really


want
 our
 initial
 goal
 to
 be
 to
 do


whatever
 we
 can
 virtually
 if
 necessary


or
 if
 we
 can
 go
 there
 yeah
 I
 mean


whining
 and
 dining
 definitely
 but
 really


exposing
 who
 we
 are
 inside
 laughing


together
 um
 spending
 time
 developing


some
 kind
 of
 a
 friendship
 together
 and


then
 if
 we
 start
 like
 that
 we'll
 find


that
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 work
 will
 kind
 of


all
 fall
 into
 place
 at
 a
 later
 you
 know


as
 after
 we
 get
 that
 in
 place
 now
 um


what
 are
 the
 implications
 for
 uh


leadership
 so
 uh
 in
 particular
 the


difference
 between
 an
 egalitarian


society
 and
 a
 and
 a
 country
 with
 more


hierarchy
 so
 you
 know
 Norway
 totally


flat
 uh
 you
 know
 uh
 Society
 uh
 very


little
 hierarchy
 things
 are
 anchored


left
 right
 and
 Center
 uh
 so
 that


everybody
 participates
 in
 the
 decision-


making
 uh
 versus
 other
 countries
 where


that's
 different
 so
 you
 know
 how
 do
 you


how
 do
 you
 look
 at
 these
 different


things
 yeah
 so
 I
 think
 that
 leading


scale
 is
 quite
 an
 interesting
 one


because
 it's
 true
 like
 you
 come
 from
 one


of
 the
 most
 egalitarian
 cultures
 in
 the


world
 right
 so
 in
 your
 culture
 in
 Norway


there's
 this
 very
 like
 I
 think
 strong


belief
 that
 the
 best
 boss
 is
 almost
 like


a
 facilitator
 among
 equals
 so
 we
 like


our
 boss
 to
 like
 look
 like
 everybody


else
 and
 we
 want
 our
 boss
 um
 instead
 of


telling
 us
 what
 to
 do
 we
 want
 our
 boss


to
 be
 their
 kind
 of
 like
 facilitating


discussion
 and
 then
 of
 course
 in
 more


well
 we'll
 call
 it
 hierarchical
 but
 I


hesitate
 with
 hierarchical
 the
 word
 I


call
 it
 low
 power
 distance
 versus
 high


power
 distance
 because
 I
 know
 like
 in
 in


your
 and
 my
 country
 Norway
 and
 the
 us
 we


we
 think
 of
 the
 word
 hierarchy
 as


something
 negative
 but
 if
 you
 think


about
 this
 idea
 of
 power
 distance
 so


Norway
 a
 very
 low
 power
 distance
 culture


um
 very
 low
 um
 low
 respect
 shown
 to
 the


the
 status
 of
 the
 person
 that
 we're


working
 with
 versus
 in
 a
 higher
 power


distance
 culture
 maybe
 we're
 in
 India
 or


maybe
 we're
 in
 China
 um
 well
 you
 work
 in


Singapore
 clearly
 uh
 higher
 power


distance
 culture
 where
 people
 really


learn
 from
 a
 young
 age
 to
 show
 a
 lot


more
 respect
 for
 the
 position
 of
 the


person
 that
 they're
 working
 for
 and
 then


this
 gets
 I
 think
 really
 complicated
 as


a
 boss
 because
 it
 means
 we
 have
 to


really
 know
 how
 to
 kind
 of
 adapt
 our


leadership
 style
 to
 the
 position
 that
 to


the
 the
 culture
 that
 we're
 working
 with


but
 how
 do
 how
 do
 these
 differences


actually
 happen
 so
 you
 if
 you
 just
 move


from
 Denmark
 across
 the
 border
 to


Germany
 right
 very
 very
 different
 and


France
 very
 different
 just
 how
 does
 it


how
 do
 this
 it
 happen
 yeah
 well
 that


specific
 one
 I
 think
 is
 very
 interesting


because
 if
 we
 look
 at
 okay
 let's
 talk


about
 you
 well
 I
 mean
 in
 Denmark
 you


Denmark
 you
 Denmark
 on
 you
 are
 on
 your


first
 name
 with
 your
 boss
 right
 in


Germany
 you
 are
 you
 are
 on
 on
 on
 the


surname
 and
 you
 put
 a
 doctor
 in
 front


right
 yeah
 well
 that's
 actually
 it's


interesting
 because
 if
 you
 look
 at
 a


culture
 map
 like
 if
 we
 look
 at
 a
 culture


map
 of
 Denmark
 up
 to
 Germany
 in
 many


ways
 those
 cultures
 are
 quite
 similar


right
 on
 my
 on
 my
 on
 my
 culture
 map


right
 so
 like
 both
 of
 them
 are
 pretty


direct
 with
 with
 with
 negative
 feedback


Germans
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 direct
 but


both
 of
 them
 pretty
 direct
 um
 both
 of


those
 are
 rather
 task
 oriented
 societies


not
 very
 different
 on
 that
 scale
 but


when
 it
 comes
 both
 of
 them
 rather
 low


context
 although
 Denmark
 a
 little
 bit


more
 High
 context
 than
 than
 Germany
 but


when
 it
 comes
 to
 hierarchy
 that's
 where


you've
 got
 a
 big
 difference
 so
 Denmark


actually
 on
 my
 mapping
 in
 my
 research
 is


the
 the
 most
 egalitarian
 country
 in
 the


world
 and
 I
 know
 in
 Scandinavia
 you
 talk


a
 lot
 about
 Sweden
 I
 think
 maybe
 you
 say


swedes
 are
 more
 egalitarian
 but
 swedes


are
 more
 consensual
 right
 swedes
 are


clearly
 like
 a
 lot
 more
 consensual
 than


other
 Scandinavian
 cultures
 but
 um
 Dan's


the
 most
 egalitarian
 the
 the
 least


deference
 to
 Authority
 and
 of
 course
 in


Germany
 that
 deference
 to
 Authority
 is


in
 comparison
 to
 Denmark
 quite
 a
 bit


stronger
 and
 if
 you
 just
 like
 you
 asked


me
 why
 I
 don't
 so
 I'll
 get
 just
 do
 my


professorial
 thing
 for
 a
 moment
 but
 if


we
 think
 about
 um
 What's
 led
 to
 these


differences
 across
 Europe
 you
 can
 see


like
 in
 Scandinavia
 the
 cultures
 well


across
 Europe
 the
 cultures
 that
 fell


under
 the
 influence
 of
 the
 Vikings
 tend


to
 be
 some
 of
 the
 most
 egalitarian
 and


consensual
 cultures
 in
 the
 world
 and
 the


Vikings
 of
 course
 they
 led
 by
 by


consensus
 so
 there
 are
 all
 all
 of
 these


stories
 about
 southern
 Europeans


historically
 coming
 to
 Scandinavia
 to


negotiate
 and
 having
 to
 come
 home
 early


because
 they
 couldn't
 figure
 out
 who
 was


in


charge
 uh
 and
 then
 of
 course
 the


cultures
 that
 fell
 under
 the
 influence


of
 the
 Roman
 Empire
 tend
 to
 be
 a
 little


bit
 more
 hierarchical
 so
 you
 go
 to
 Italy


you
 go
 to
 Spain
 definitely
 of
 a
 a


stronger
 hierarchical
 structure
 in


comparison
 to
 Scandinavia
 and
 then
 I


think
 the
 most
 interesting
 one
 is


actually
 religion
 because
 the
 cultures


that
 well
 when
 the
 when
 the
 Protestant


religion
 came
 to
 Europe
 in
 a
 way
 in
 the


1600s
 in
 a
 way
 it
 removed
 the
 hierarchy


from
 the
 church
 so
 now
 I
 talk
 directly


to
 God
 instead
 of
 talking
 to
 the
 priest


the
 bishop
 the
 pope
 before
 speaking
 to


God
 and
 actually
 like
 even
 in
 the


Netherlands
 if
 you
 move
 from
 the


Protestant
 part
 of
 the
 Netherlands
 to


the
 Catholic
 part
 of
 the
 Netherlands
 you


can
 see
 a
 movement
 from
 a
 little
 bit


well
 from
 a
 super
 egalitarian
 to
 like


slightly
 less
 egalitarian
 As
 you
 move
 to


the
 the
 Catholic
 part
 so
 I
 mean
 I
 don't


talk
 too
 much
 about
 like
 history
 but
 I


do
 think
 it
 is
 interesting
 to
 think


about
 me
 I
 imagine
 Nikolai
 when
 you
 come


to
 work
 in
 the
 morning
 that
 you're
 not


thinking
 about
 the
 Vikings
 or
 the
 Roman


Empire
 maybe
 you
 maybe
 you
 should
 be


though
 I
 clearly
 should
 be
 but
 it's
 uh


it's
 really
 really
 interesting
 is
 there


a
 trend
 um
 you
 know
 there
 was
 a
 time
 um


a
 little
 while
 back
 where
 where
 there


seemed
 to
 be
 a
 trend
 towards
 more


Scandinavian
 leadership
 styles
 across


Europe
 certainly
 right
 so
 very
 important


companies
 in
 Switzerland
 uh
 in
 the
 UK


and
 so
 on
 had
 either
 CEOs
 or
 chair
 uh


people
 from
 chairpersons
 from
 uh
 you


know
 from
 scandy
 was
 is
 the
 still
 a


trend
 towards
 the
 Scandinavian


leadership
 style
 or
 not
 yeah
 so
 I
 do


believe
 in
 the
 world
 I
 mean
 we
 not
 we


can
 see
 with
 research
 that
 every
 country


in
 the
 world
 is
 generationally
 becoming


a
 little
 bit
 more
 egalitarian
 so
 in


India
 the
 younger
 generation
 is
 more


egalitarian
 than
 the
 older
 generation
 in


Korea
 the
 younger
 generation
 a
 little


more
 egalitarian
 than
 the
 older


generation
 and
 even
 in
 Norway
 the


younger
 generation
 a
 little
 more


egalitarian
 than
 the
 older
 generation


and
 I
 think
 that's
 happened
 actually


because
 of
 the
 internet
 right
 I
 mean


like
 when
 I
 was
 a
 child
 okay
 I'm
 52
 when


I
 was
 a
 child
 clearly
 there
 was
 no


internet
 which
 means
 that
 the
 people
 who


had
 more
 expertise
 and
 more
 experience


were
 the
 source
 of
 knowledge
 so
 what
 my


teacher
 tells
 me
 or
 my
 father
 tells
 me
 I


mean
 I
 have
 to
 put
 Faith
 in
 what
 in
 in


that
 in
 that
 experience
 but
 of
 course


with
 the
 internet
 we
 started
 uh
 let's


say
 an
 a
 galarian
 ISM
 of
 information
 so


now
 the
 young
 person
 can
 look
 something


up
 on
 the
 internet
 and
 whether
 I'm
 in


India
 or
 Korea
 or
 Norway
 I
 can
 say
 to


the
 teacher
 hey
 but
 I
 that's
 not
 what
 I


read
 on
 the
 internet
 yesterday


um
 or
 doctor
 hey
 I
 looked
 it
 up
 I
 don't


think
 you're
 right
 so
 I
 do
 believe
 that


that's
 um
 that
 created
 this
 kind
 of


notion
 of
 wow
 it's
 great
 that
 we
 can
 all


have
 the
 power
 but
 I
 want
 I
 think
 it's


important
 when
 you
 ask
 about
 this
 um


about
 this
 kind
 of
 leaning
 towards


Scandinavian
 leadership
 because
 we


talked
 about


egalitarianism
 but
 one
 of
 the
 other
 big


aspects
 that
 you
 have
 in
 Scandinavia
 is


this
 consensual
 decision
 making
 and


that's
 where
 I
 would
 say
 um


I
 mean
 people
 generally
 lump
 those
 two


things
 together
 like
 egalitarian
 means


consensual
 decision-making
 I
 have
 two


separate
 dimensions
 for
 those
 um
 because


like
 in
 the
 us
 where
 we
 are
 well
 okay


we're
 rather
 egalitarian
 although
 much


more
 hierarchical
 than
 you
 are
 in
 Norway


but
 the
 boss
 but
 the
 boss
 decides
 but


the
 boss
 decides
 right
 or
 at
 least
 the


individual
 decides
 and
 usually
 that's


the
 boss
 we
 don't
 really
 like
 this
 thing


that
 you
 tend
 to
 do
 in


Scandinavia
 which
 is
 like
 take
 a
 long


time
 to
 make
 decisions
 by
 groups
 right


um
 so
 I
 mean
 I
 like
 okay
 in
 Norway
 and


even
 more
 so
 in
 Sweden
 but
 clearly
 the


the
 tendency
 is
 that
 over
 a
 period
 of


time
 we
 we
 share
 our
 ideas
 we
 come
 to


some
 kind
 of
 group
 agreement
 and
 then


once
 we
 Implement
 that
 that
 um
 that
 idea


we
 don't
 go
 back
 easily
 because
 it
 took


us
 a
 long
 time
 to
 get
 to
 it
 so
 and
 what


I
 what
 I
 refer
 to
 as
 consensual
 cultures


decisions
 tend
 to
 be
 slow
 to
 make
 to
 be


made
 but
 then
 they're
 definitely
 as
 much


as
 possible
 fixed
 right
 and


interestingly
 like
 okay
 in
 Norway
 you


are
 egalitarian
 and
 consensual
 but
 we


talked
 about
 Japan
 earlier
 I
 mean
 Japan


is
 I
 think
 your
 listeners
 will
 know
 a


very
 hierarchical
 Society
 okay
 a
 lot
 of


deference
 to
 the
 position
 of
 the
 person


that
 you're
 working
 with
 but
 it's
 also


the
 most
 consensual
 culture
 in
 the
 world


which
 more
 so
 than
 Sweden
 which
 means


decisions
 are
 made
 Slowly
 by
 the
 group


um
 and
 then
 once
 they
 are
 made
 they
 are


fixed
 um
 so
 so
 I
 think
 it's
 just
 uh
 like


what's
 the
 let's
 say
 what's
 the
 most


modern
 approach
 I
 mean
 it
 depends
 on


what
 kind
 of
 work
 you're
 trying
 to
 do
 so


like
 Japanese
 people
 they're
 really
 good


at
 automobiles
 right
 okay
 well
 if
 you


are
 developing
 a
 product
 where
 you
 want


very
 little
 risk
 of
 um
 of
 a
 mistake
 then


a
 consensual
 decision-
 making
 is
 great


it's
 good
 to
 take
 a
 really
 long
 time
 to


make
 the
 decision
 and
 in
 those
 those


like
 let's
 say
 like
 a
 more
 manufacturing


environment
 uh
 hierarchical
 um


hierarchical
 leadership
 methods
 also
 can


be
 very
 fast
 uh
 but
 if
 we're
 in
 an
 agile


environment
 we
 need
 creativity


egalitarianism
 generally
 leads
 to
 a
 lot


of
 creativity
 throughout
 the


organization
 so
 you've
 seen
 all
 these


different
 companies
 and
 all
 these


different
 Copa
 culture
 so
 now
 we're


going
 to
 make
 a
 company
 here
 aren
 and


Nikolai
 Inc
 you
 know
 yeah
 what
 um
 what


do
 we
 want
 the
 culture
 to
 look
 like
 what


is
 the
 perfect
 culture
 if
 you
 can
 take
 a


little
 bit
 of
 each
 yeah
 what
 is
 what
 is


a
 great
 company
 okay
 so
 I
 mean
 as
 I
 said


it
 has
 to
 start
 with
 what
 you
 are
 going


to
 do
 are
 your
 listeners
 mostly


entrepreneurs
 is
 that
 right
 Nikolai


they're
 all
 over
 the
 place
 oh
 okay
 all


right
 so
 let's
 say
 but
 they're
 all
 but


they're
 all
 very
 very
 clever
 otherwise


they
 wouldn't
 have
 listened
 to
 the


program
 they're
 the
 smartest
 people


totally
 totally
 okay
 but
 let's
 say
 let's


say
 that
 you
 and
 I
 are
 doing
 an
 IT


startup
 okay
 right
 I
 mean
 if
 if
 we're


doing
 an
 IT
 startup
 then
 we
 want
 the


egalitarianism
 of
 Scandinavia
 right
 okay


so
 we
 want
 very
 low
 levels
 of
 hierarchy


throughout
 the
 organization
 but
 we
 want


super
 fast
 and
 flexible
 decisions
 like


in
 India
 okay
 we
 want
 decisions
 to
 be


made
 quickly
 and
 we
 want
 them
 to
 be
 able


to
 be
 changed
 quickly
 and
 that's
 because


of
 course
 in
 a
 startup
 environment
 I


mean
 everything's
 changing
 around
 us


like
 in
 India
 right
 everything
 changing


around
 and
 around
 us
 we
 may
 need
 to


change
 our
 product
 quickly
 we
 might
 need


to
 reinvent
 ourselves
 again
 and
 again
 so


often
 a
 more
 top
 down
 a
 decision-making


approach
 would
 be
 more
 effective
 and
 I


actually
 think
 in
 a
 startup
 environment


we
 want
 to
 be
 as
 direct
 as
 possible
 when


we're
 giving
 communication
 the
 most


direct
 cultures
 in
 the
 world
 the


Netherlands
 and
 Israel
 so
 let's
 be
 Dutch


or
 Israeli
 in
 the
 way
 that
 we
 give


feedback
 um
 but
 let's
 also
 invest
 time


in
 getting
 to
 know
 one
 another
 and
 I


actually
 think
 that's
 true
 across


industry
 and
 across
 work
 that
 you're


doing
 if
 you
 have
 any
 International


component
 in
 your
 work
 you
 want
 to
 spend


a
 lot
 more
 time
 in
 building
 personal


relationships
 because
 once
 we
 have
 that


fundamental
 trust
 then
 if
 you
 speak
 too


directly
 to
 me
 I
 will
 forgive
 you
 if
 we


don't
 have
 that
 trust
 and
 you
 speak
 too


directly
 to
 me
 that's
 really
 going
 to
 be


the
 the
 last
 time
 that
 I
 want
 to
 work


with
 you
 um
 so
 I
 think
 you
 can
 really


think
 about
 what's
 my
 goal
 uh
 what


industry
 am
 I
 working
 in
 what
 do
 I
 want


to
 accomplish
 and
 then
 you
 can
 kind
 of


map
 out
 like
 even
 which
 type
 of
 culture


uh
 which
 type
 of
 uh
 country
 would
 be


best
 for
 you
 for
 your
 organization
 I
 can


already
 see
 that
 this
 is
 going
 to
 be
 a


huge
 success
 this
 company
 of


ours
 we're
 on
 our
 way
 absolutely
 how


much
 time
 should
 this
 how
 much
 time
 uh


should
 a
 CEO
 spend
 on
 Copa
 culture
 I


want
 to
 just
 transition
 for
 a
 moment
 so


we
 were
 talking
 a
 lot
 about
 my
 culture


mapping
 book
 right
 but
 I
 wrote
 this
 this


second
 book
 is
 you
 know
 with
 uh
 with


Reed
 Hastings
 who's
 the
 the
 founder
 and


chairman
 of
 Netflix
 so
 what
 I
 saw
 with


with
 re
 with
 when
 I
 was
 doing
 this
 work


with
 Reed
 because
 he
 leads
 his
 team
 um
 I


mean
 he's
 really
 trying
 to
 move
 away


from
 this
 pyramid
 model
 where
 the
 the


leader
 is
 at
 the
 top
 of
 the
 at
 the
 top


of
 the
 pyramid
 and
 instead
 kind
 of
 put


the
 leader
 like
 a
 tree
 down
 at
 the
 roots


of
 the
 tree
 um
 and
 with
 a
 very


egalitarian
 carian
 structure
 so
 um
 what


I
 think
 we
 can
 think
 about
 that
 and
 is


an
 a
 traditional
 company
 uh
 the


decision-making
 model
 has
 the
 the


chairman
 at
 the
 top
 and
 the
 lower
 level


employees
 at
 the
 bottom
 of
 the
 pyramid


right
 and
 the
 lower
 level
 employees
 can


make
 small
 unimportant
 decisions
 but
 for


anything
 important
 or
 expensive
 we
 have


to
 push
 the
 decision-
 making
 up
 in
 the


organization
 and
 of
 course
 in
 a
 um
 in
 a


traditional
 like
 manufacturing


environment
 that's
 a
 great
 method
 but
 in


these
 like
 newer
 companies
 and
 to


today's
 agile
 world
 where
 we
 have
 to
 be


faster
 and
 more
 flexible
 and
 more


creative
 I
 do
 believe
 that
 the
 best


decision-making
 method
 is
 a
 lot
 more


like
 a
 tree
 and
 with
 that
 tree
 we've
 got


the
 leader
 okay
 who's
 down
 there
 in
 the


dirt
 at
 the
 roots
 of
 the
 tree
 not
 making


the
 big
 decisions
 but
 instead
 leading


with
 context
 not
 control
 or
 something


they
 say
 at
 Netflix
 that
 I
 love
 don't


seek
 to
 please
 your
 boss
 seek
 to
 do


what's
 best
 for
 the
 company
 and
 with


that
 model
 of
 course
 now
 I'm
 coming
 to


the
 answer
 to
 your
 question
 with
 that


model
 where
 the
 boss
 is
 not
 the
 chief


decision
 maker
 but
 instead
 setting
 all


of
 the
 context
 for
 the
 decision-making


throughout
 the
 organization
 and
 with


that
 model
 you
 have
 um
 the
 the
 lower


level
 employees
 that
 are
 often
 there
 at


the
 top
 of
 the
 tree
 making
 the
 often
 the


biggest
 most
 expensive
 decisions
 for
 the


organization
 and
 in
 that
 kind
 of
 model
 I


believe
 that
 a
 leader
 should
 be
 spending


50%
 of
 his
 or
 her
 time
 working
 with
 the


individuals
 in
 the
 company
 coaching
 them


on
 on
 how
 we
 make
 decisions
 in
 this


organization
 so
 what
 is
 our


organizational
 culture
 here
 um
 how
 do
 we


what
 kind
 of
 decision
 will
 we
 make
 in


the
 face
 of
 this
 dilemma
 um
 what
 is
 our


North
 Star
 and
 how
 are
 we
 running


towards
 that
 North
 Star
 and
 we
 become


more
 of
 a
 um
 more
 of
 a
 coach
 than
 a


decision
 maker
 or
 as
 you
 we
 could
 say
 a


little
 bit
 nor
 more
 Norwegian
 in
 the
 way


that
 we're
 leading
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 of


a
 facilitator
 among
 you
 well
 I
 think
 for


sure
 I'm
 Norwegian
 enough
 Erin
 we
 have


um
 um
 tens
 of
 thousands
 of
 young
 people


listening
 to
 the
 bcast
 and
 I'd
 love
 to


ask
 you
 what
 is
 your
 advice
 to
 young


people
 yeah
 so
 of
 course
 young
 people


today
 they
 wake
 up
 in
 the
 morning
 they


open
 up
 their
 computers
 they
 have
 people


from
 all
 over
 the
 world
 who
 are
 joining


them
 maybe
 you've
 got
 I
 don't
 know
 a


team
 you're
 working
 with
 in
 Brazil


someone
 else
 uh
 in
 uh
 uh
 uh
 Nigeria
 um


and
 it's
 very
 easy
 to
 underestimate
 the


impact
 of
 uh
 of
 culture
 on
 your


communication
 so
 I
 think
 an
 example
 a


great
 example
 of
 that
 would
 be
 that


maybe
 you
 notice
 that
 like
 uh
 these
 guys


from
 the
 US
 on
 your
 team
 they're
 talking


all
 the
 time
 and
 maybe
 you've
 got
 this


guy
 from
 China
 and
 he
 doesn't
 seem
 to


speak
 very
 much
 but
 you
 just
 think
 oh


well
 that
 guy
 from
 China
 he
 doesn't
 have


much
 to
 say
 and
 those
 guys
 from
 the
 US


they
 clearly
 have
 a
 lot
 that
 they'd
 like


to


contribute
 um
 but
 so
 it's
 easy
 to
 slip


into
 this
 kind
 of
 assumption
 that


culture
 isn't
 impacting
 us
 so
 the
 advice


to
 young
 people
 is
 don't


underestimate
 how
 much
 culture
 impacts


our
 communication
 even
 when
 we
 are


working
 in
 Virtual
 environments
 and
 even


when
 the
 people
 that
 we
 are


communicating
 with
 seem
 to
 be
 just
 like


us
 and
 then
 take
 some
 time
 to
 learn
 so


you
 know
 what
 I
 do
 with
 my
 culture


mapping
 methodology
 is
 I
 give
 people
 an


opportunity
 to
 kind
 of
 look
 at
 one


culture
 and
 say
 oh
 I
 see
 that
 culture
 is


a
 little
 bit
 more
 direct
 than
 mine
 so


maybe
 that
 guy
 wasn't
 angry
 with
 me


maybe
 he
 was
 just
 showing
 me
 respect
 and


in
 that
 culture
 they
 build
 trust
 in
 a


little
 bit
 more
 relationship
 oriented


way
 than
 they
 do
 in
 my
 culture
 so
 maybe


the
 reason
 that
 that
 guy
 didn't
 respond


to
 my
 email
 is
 because
 I
 dived
 right


into
 the
 material
 and
 I
 didn't
 really


give
 him
 I
 didn't
 really
 share
 anything


about
 myself
 or
 even
 share
 show
 interest


and
 getting
 to
 know
 him
 personally
 so


when
 I
 get
 him
 on
 the
 phone
 the
 next


time
 I'm
 going
 to
 take
 a
 different


approach
 and
 of
 course
 the
 mapping
 it
 it


doesn't
 give
 you
 a
 recipe
 we're
 all


individuals
 but
 it
 does
 help
 you
 to
 kind


of
 tease
 out
 like
 what's
 cultural
 and


what's
 personal
 so
 that
 we
 can
 be
 more


strategic
 and
 more


empathic
 really
 great
 advice
 I
 perhaps


want
 to
 add
 one
 thing
 spend
 all
 your


savings
 on
 traveling
 and
 backpacking
 and


see
 the
 world


that's
 right
 and
 of
 course
 the
 more
 we


see
 the
 world
 the
 more
 we
 recognize
 how


strange
 our
 own
 culture
 is
 and
 I
 think


that
 that
 own
 self
 that


self-reflection
 is
 one
 of
 the
 most


important
 types
 of
 of
 cultural
 learning


because
 otherwise
 we
 just
 think
 that


everyone
 else
 is
 strange
 and
 doing
 it


wrong
 when
 we
 act
 when
 we
 realize


actually
 huh
 seems
 that
 I'm
 just
 as


strange
 as
 everyone
 else
 absolutely
 I'm


definitely
 going
 to
 think
 more
 about
 um


how
 to
 adapt
 to
 to
 the
 various
 countries


where
 we
 have
 offices
 uh
 when
 it
 comes


to
 feedback
 and
 getting
 people
 on
 board


and
 so
 on
 it's
 been
 um
 just
 uh


tremendously
 uh
 uh
 interesting
 uh
 would


recommend
 everybody
 to
 read
 your
 book


the
 culture
 map
 it's
 been
 uh
 really


changing
 the
 way
 I
 look
 at
 culture
 so
 a


big
 thanks
 for
 being
 on
 here
 and
 good


luck
 with
 your
 work
 thank
 you
 such
 a


pleasure
 to
 be
 here
 with
 you
