[Music]


hi
 everybody
 we
 are
 thrilled
 to
 have
 Cal


Newport
 on
 the
 show
 today
 known
 for
 his


groundbreaking
 work
 on
 deep
 work
 and


digital
 minimalism
 Now
 cal
 has


revolutionized
 the
 way
 we
 approach


productivity
 and
 focus
 in
 the
 digital


age
 and
 basically
 you
 are
 what
 you
 focus


on
 and
 today
 we
 focus
 on
 you
 Cal
 and


your
 work
 so
 big
 welcome
 well
 thank
 you


for
 having
 me
 I've
 been
 looking
 forward


to
 this
 great
 now
 first
 of
 all
 what
 is


deep
 work
 well
 deep
 work
 is
 the
 the


state
 you're
 in
 in
 which
 you
 are
 giving


full
 concentration
 to
 a
 cognitively


demanding
 task
 so
 the
 two
 aspects
 to
 it


is
 what
 you're
 doing
 requires
 a
 lot
 of


concentration
 and
 you
 giving
 it


concentration
 without
 any
 distraction
 so


it's
 actually
 getting
 your
 full


attention
 those
 two
 things
 together


means
 you're
 doing
 deep
 work
 and
 why
 is


it
 important
 well
 this
 is
 the
 number
 one


way
 you
 produce
 valuable
 things
 using


the
 human
 brain
 like
 if
 your
 goal
 is
 I


want
 to
 create
 something
 valuable
 using


my
 brain
 the
 most
 promising
 cognitive


state
 for
 accomplishing
 this
 goal
 is
 one


of
 undistracted
 focus
 now
 in
 your
 in


your
 books
 you
 talk
 about
 the
 fact
 that


we've
 kind
 of
 forgotten
 to
 differentiate


between
 deep
 work
 and
 shallow
 work
 tell


us
 about
 it
 well
 I
 think
 what
 happened


is
 we
 got
 the
 front
 office
 it
 Revolution


so
 suddenly
 we
 have
 Network
 computers
 in


the
 office
 we
 have
 low
 friction
 digital


communication
 um
 it's
 easier
 than
 ever


before
 to
 move
 information
 back
 and


forth
 and
 we
 accidentally
 created
 a
 work


culture
 in
 which
 we
 were
 prioritizing


the
 communication
 but
 by
 doing
 so
 we


were
 fracturing
 time
 into
 fragments
 too


small
 to
 actually
 give
 sustained


concentration
 to
 anything
 we
 devalued


unbroken
 concentration
 as
 an
 activity


that
 mattered
 in
 knowledge
 work
 and
 by


doing
 so
 I
 think
 we're
 greatly
 reducing


the
 quality
 of
 what's
 being
 produced
 and


we're
 burning
 out
 the
 individuals
 trying


to
 do
 the
 production
 and
 how
 do
 you
 get


into
 that
 mindset
 that
 deep
 thinking


deep
 work
 mindset
 well
 it
 takes
 time


first
 of
 all
 right
 I
 think
 this
 is


important
 it's
 also
 easily
 subverted
 it


can
 take
 about
 10
 or
 15
 minutes
 to


really
 get
 a
 target
 of
 your
 attention


completely
 locked
 in
 you
 have
 to
 inhibit


certain
 neural
 networks
 you
 have
 to


activate
 other
 neural
 networks
 it's
 why


when
 you
 sit
 down
 to
 do
 something
 hard


it's
 hard
 for
 10
 or
 15
 minutes
 and
 then


you
 feel
 like
 a
 new
 gear
 kicks
 in
 like


oh
 now
 I'm
 actually
 starting
 to
 make


some
 progress
 that's
 because
 your
 brain


takes
 time
 to
 really
 lock
 in
 so
 what


happens
 then
 if
 you're
 trying
 to
 work
 on


something
 hard
 and
 you're
 also
 doing


quick
 checks
 of
 an
 email
 inbox
 or
 seeing


what's
 going
 on
 on
 your
 phone
 you're


breaking
 that
 hard
 one
 cognitive
 f
 FOC


State
 and
 so
 deep
 work
 really
 requires


that
 you
 remain
 focused
 on
 one
 thing


without
 trying
 to
 change
 your
 cognitive


context
 how
 do
 you
 build
 this
 into
 your


daily
 routine
 do
 you
 have
 different


types
 of
 different
 times
 during
 the
 day


when
 you
 do
 this
 well
 I
 mean
 there's


answers
 to
 this
 question
 at
 all


different
 levels
 depending
 on
 how


systemic
 you
 want
 to
 get
 at
 the
 lowest


level
 of
 just
 I'm
 thinking
 about
 my
 day


in
 front
 of
 me
 yeah
 you
 schedule
 time


for
 deep
 work
 and
 it's
 on
 your
 calendar


and
 you
 treat
 it
 like
 a
 meeting
 right


this
 is
 on
 my
 calendar
 I'm
 going
 to
 do


this
 thing
 I'm
 not
 available
 during
 that


time
 time
 and
 you
 make
 a
 deal
 with


yourself
 if
 I'm
 in
 a
 deep
 work
 session


that's
 what
 I'm
 doing
 I'm
 not
 going
 to


change
 my
 cognitive
 context
 while
 I'm


working
 on
 this
 when
 is
 when
 during
 the


day
 is
 the
 best
 time
 well
 it
 depends
 on


the
 person
 but
 most
 people
 earlier
 in


the
 day
 is
 better
 than
 later
 you
 still


have
 more
 cognitive
 energy
 you
 still


have
 less
 distractions
 that
 have
 been


introduced
 into
 your
 cognitive
 landscape


so
 far
 so
 your
 brain
 has
 an
 easier
 time


actually
 focusing
 hey
 I'm
 a
 proponent
 of


the
 idea
 that
 meeting
 should
 be


something
 that
 happens
 in
 the
 afternoons


now
 it
 might
 be
 too
 radical
 to
 make
 that


an
 an
 absolute


but
 as
 a
 thought
 experiment
 it's
 not
 a


bad
 one
 what's
 the
 best
 way
 to
 eliminate


distractions
 how
 do
 you
 do
 it
 well
 the


biggest
 source
 of
 distraction
 and


knowledge
 work
 is
 communication
 right
 so


what
 happens
 is
 we
 have
 a
 mode
 of


collaboration
 that
 we
 implicitly
 evolved


once
 we
 got
 the
 front
 office
 it


Revolution
 I
 call
 it
 the
 hyperactive


hvep
 mind
 where
 we
 work
 things
 out
 on


the
 fly
 with
 ad
 hoc
 back
 and
 forth


messaging
 that's
 the
 number
 one
 source


of
 distraction
 if
 I
 have
 seven
 different


projects
 I'm
 working
 on
 and
 each
 of
 them


have
 generated
 these
 sort
 of
 unscheduled


back
 and
 forth
 conversations
 that's


required
 for
 these
 projects
 to
 make


progress
 that
 seven
 projects
 generating


messages
 that
 need
 to
 be
 seen
 and


replied
 to
 relatively
 promptly
 that


creates
 an
 atmosphere
 in
 which
 I
 have
 to


continually
 check
 communication
 channels


and
 inboxes
 so
 if
 you
 want
 to
 solve
 this


problem
 of
 being
 distracted
 we
 actually


have
 to
 solve
 the
 problem
 of
 the


hyperactive
 hive
 mind
 we
 have
 to
 find


alternative
 ways
 to
 collaborate
 that


don't
 just
 depend
 on
 unscheduled


messages
 arriving
 that
 I
 have
 to
 see
 and


respond
 to
 throughout
 the
 day
 what
 is
 a


hyperactive
 Hive
 I
 mean
 this
 is
 the


collaboration
 style
 we
 use
 without
 use


without
 knowing
 it
 without
 naming
 it
 so


I
 named
 it
 like
 we
 just
 decided
 once


email
 arrived
 and
 followed
 by
 chat


services
 that
 we
 can
 all
 just
 figure


things
 out
 by
 talking
 to
 each
 other
 all


the
 time
 that's
 why
 I
 say
 it's
 a
 hive


mind
 oh
 just
 back
 and
 forth


communication
 with
 anyone
 the
 the
 whole


office
 is
 Interlink
 with
 just
 these


messages
 going
 back
 and
 forth
 and
 I
 call


it
 hyperactive
 because
 these
 are
 going


back
 and
 forth
 at
 a
 really
 high
 rate
 but


the
 problem
 is
 like
 this
 whole
 sort
 of


cybernetic
 noospheric
 we're
 all


connected
 and
 talking
 to
 each
 other
 all


day
 the
 problem
 is
 is
 the
 human
 brain


can't
 do
 it
 so
 can
 you're
 not
 a
 big
 fan


you're
 not
 a
 big
 fan
 of
 CC
 all
 I'm
 not
 a


big
 fan
 of
 CC
 all
 I'm
 not
 a
 big
 fan
 of


uh
 let
 me
 just
 immediately
 hit
 you
 up
 on


slack
 when
 I
 have
 a
 question
 and
 you


answer
 me
 right
 away
 that's
 useful
 to


you
 in
 the
 moment
 but
 it
 creates
 a


macrocognitive
 environment
 that
 is


intolerable
 for
 the
 human
 brain
 I
 can't


switch
 back
 and
 forth
 between
 servicing


seven
 different
 projects
 in
 a
 10-minute


period
 a
 crowded
 email
 inbox
 is
 like
 a


Minefield
 for
 the
 human
 brain
 it
 can't


do
 this
 well
 every
 message
 has
 a


entirely
 different
 context
 that
 the


brain
 has
 to
 load
 up
 just
 to
 answer
 but


we
 don't
 give
 our
 time
 enough
 time
 to
 do


that
 because
 we
 have
 to
 get
 through
 a


100
 messages
 uh
 it's
 exhausting
 it
 can


be
 deranging
 on
 paper
 it
 seems
 very


efficient
 but
 the
 reality
 of
 our
 human


neurological
 Hardware
 says
 this
 way
 of


working
 is
 not
 compatible
 with
 humans
 in


the
 way
 we
 actually
 think
 and
 exist


so
 so
 how
 should
 I
 work
 through
 my
 email


backlog
 we
 have
 because
 I
 have
 I
 have
 I


wake
 up
 in
 the
 morning
 I
 got
 loads
 of


stuff
 you
 know
 because
 we're
 a
 global


company
 and
 uh
 I
 get
 stuff
 from
 uh
 from


us
 from
 Singapore
 uh
 you
 know
 you
 know


you
 know
 what
 it's
 like
 what
 what
 do
 I


do
 well
 first
 of
 all
 we
 have
 to
 get
 to


this
 problem
 at
 the
 source
 right
 so
 so


wherever
 we
 have
 a
 source
 of
 email
 where


there's
 another
 way
 to
 do
 that


communication
 that
 doesn't
 require
 just


an
 unscheduled
 message
 arriving
 in


general
 inbox
 let's
 put
 those
 systems


into
 place
 let's
 get
 rid
 of
 the
 idea
 of


having
 a
 single
 email
 address
 associated


with
 each
 person
 now
 we
 maybe
 what
 we


should
 have
 is
 different
 communication


channels
 for
 different
 types
 of


communication
 so
 when
 it
 comes
 time
 for


me
 to
 uh
 deal
 with
 whatever
 supply
 chain


issues
 with
 International
 Distributors


there's
 like
 a
 place
 where
 all
 that


communication
 is
 and
 there's
 a
 time
 when


we
 look
 at
 that
 uh
 we
 don't
 want
 all
 of


this
 to
 arrive
 unscheduled
 all
 mixed


together
 into
 one
 big
 jumble
 that
 I
 then


have
 to
 sequentially
 move
 through
 so
 we


want
 to
 reduce
 the
 unscheduled
 messages


being
 uh
 generated
 in
 the
 first
 place


and
 then
 we
 want
 to
 pull
 apart
 having
 a


just
 generic
 everything
 mixed
 together


inbox
 and
 have
 more
 specialized


communication
 channels
 all
 this
 will
 be


better
 for
 the
 human
 brain
 well
 I
 mean


talking
 about
 being
 interrupted
 um


smartphones
 um
 even
 worse
 right
 I
 read


somewhere
 that
 on
 average
 people
 check


their
 phones
 every
 seven


minutes
 what
 what
 what
 do
 you
 think
 when


you
 hear
 that
 right
 they
 do
 and
 it
 was


not
 the
 original
 uh
 purpose
 of
 these


phones
 you
 know
 I
 wrote
 it
 this
 this


time
 op
 at
 a
 few
 years
 ago
 about
 Steve


Jobs
 original
 vision
 for
 the
 iPhone


which
 certainly
 was
 not
 this
 should
 be
 a


constant
 companion
 that
 you
 check
 every


seven
 minutes
 the
 cause
 of
 us
 checking


our
 phones
 all
 the
 time
 is
 actually


different
 than
 the
 cause
 of
 us
 checking


for
 example
 our
 email
 inbox
 all
 the
 time


uh
 the
 problem
 with
 phones
 in
 the


nonprofessional
 context
 of
 course
 is
 the


rise
 of
 the
 professional
 attention


economy
 when
 it
 was
 discovered
 around


2012
 oh
 if
 we
 make
 these
 apps
 sticky
 we


can
 get
 people
 to
 look
 at
 them
 all
 the


time
 and
 there's
 an
 incredible
 uh


attention
 resource
 we
 can
 mine
 here
 so


we
 look
 at
 our
 phones
 too
 much
 because


we
 put
 apps
 on
 the
 phones
 designed
 to


make
 us
 do
 that
 we
 look
 at
 our
 email


inbox
 too
 much
 because
 we
 have
 a
 mode
 of


collaboration
 that
 requires
 us
 to
 do
 so


similar
 sounding
 problems
 different


sources
 of
 the
 of
 the
 problem
 I
 read


somewhere
 that
 when
 you
 even
 if
 you
 hear


like
 Ping
 and
 you
 know
 that
 there
 is
 a


message
 on
 your
 phone
 when
 you
 then


solve
 a
 task
 you
 apply
 less
 IQ
 to
 it
 you


become
 basically
 less
 intelligent
 just


by
 knowing
 there
 is
 something
 on
 the


phone
 well
 we're
 we're
 a
 social
 species


and
 and
 so
 for
 good
 reason
 we
 take
 very


seriously
 for
 good
 evolutionarily


evolutionary
 reasons
 we
 take
 very


seriously
 someone
 in
 our
 tribe
 needs
 us


because
 we've
 learned
 through
 our
 long


history
 if
 someone
 in
 our
 tribe
 needs
 us


and
 we
 ignore
 them
 uh
 we
 might
 get
 a


spear
 in
 the
 back
 so
 like
 we
 really
 care


about
 this
 the
 problem
 is
 that
 same


brain
 that's
 been
 around
 for
 a
 couple


hundred
 thousand
 years
 has
 a
 hard
 time


then
 with
 the
 idea
 of
 an
 email
 inbox


because
 as
 far
 as
 it's
 concerned


messages
 in
 an
 email
 inbox
 is
 our
 tribe


members
 need
 us
 and
 we're
 and
 every


moment
 that
 we're
 not
 checking
 that


inbox
 and
 there's
 messages
 in
 there
 is


US
 ignoring
 our
 tribe
 members
 and
 this


is
 a
 dangerous
 thing
 to
 do
 alarm
 Bells


go
 off
 in
 our
 brain
 the
 social
 human


brain
 has
 a
 hard
 time
 with
 a
 modern


digital
 inbox
 now
 I'm
 going
 to
 ask
 you
 a


lame
 question
 given
 what
 you
 already


have
 said
 but


uh
 should
 we
 exclude
 telephones
 from


classrooms
 yes
 uh
 and
 in
 many
 places


they
 don't
 why
 uh
 tell
 me
 what
 your
 view


is
 on
 all
 this
 I
 think
 unrestricted


internet
 access
 so
 what
 you
 would
 get


for
 example
 if
 you
 just
 had
 your
 own


smartphone
 uh
 the
 research
 is
 becoming


increasingly
 clear
 that
 probably


16
 is
 the
 age
 when
 that
 begins
 to
 become


uh
 safe
 psychologically
 speaking
 post


puberty
 right
 you
 should
 not
 have


unrestricted
 email
 access
 until
 you
 have


basically
 gone
 through
 puberty
 16
 plus


it's
 very
 different
 than
 what
 we've


tried
 for
 the
 last
 10
 years
 the
 last
 10


years
 we
 experimented
 with
 let's
 just


give
 kids
 phon
 and
 sees
 what
 happened
 a


reasonable
 experiment
 I
 think
 the


results
 have
 come
 back
 terrible
 things


happen
 so
 we
 need
 to
 change
 the
 way
 we


think
 about
 this
 culturally
 I
 think


that's
 where
 we're
 going
 to
 be
 in
 two
 or


three
 years
 this
 idea
 that
 a
 12-year-old


or
 11y
 old
 be
 given
 a
 phone
 we're
 going


to
 think
 about
 that
 not
 too
 far
 in
 the


future
 the
 way
 we
 learn
 to
 think
 about


oh
 we
 shouldn't
 be
 giving
 cigarettes
 to


a
 teenager
 okay
 that
 they
 need
 to
 be


older
 before
 they
 can
 deal
 with
 it


that's
 where
 I
 think
 we
 are
 with
 phones


when
 you
 talk
 about
 deep
 work
 what
 are


the
 similarities
 to
 deliberate
 training


which
 Erikson
 is
 talking
 about
 the


10,000
 hours
 just
 what
 are
 the
 what
 are


the
 links
 between
 the
 two
 well
 you
 need


to
 be
 in
 a
 state
 of
 deep
 work
 to
 do


deliberate
 practice
 so
 it's
 it's
 one
 of


the
 things
 you
 can
 do
 if
 so
 so
 focus


without
 distraction
 is
 the
 cognitive


state
 required
 to
 do
 deliberate
 practice


and
 to
 get
 better
 so
 if
 you
 uh
 are


uncomfortable
 focusing
 or
 you
 never
 give


yourself
 time
 during
 your
 day
 to
 really


be
 focused
 on
 something
 you'll
 never
 be


able
 to
 fall
 into
 a
 state
 of
 deliberate


practice
 at
 the
 way
 that
 Ericson
 would


have
 talked
 about
 it
 which
 means
 you're


going
 to
 pick
 up
 new
 skills
 very
 slowly


you're
 going
 to
 learn
 things
 very
 slowly


not
 all
 deep
 workers
 deliver
 practice
 uh


a
 flow
 state
 which
 of
 course
 is
 very


different
 is
 also
 something
 you
 can't


fall
 into
 unless
 you're
 in
 a
 state
 of


deep
 work
 so
 deep
 work
 is
 like
 an


umbrella
 when
 you
 give
 something


unbroken
 concentration
 you
 get
 these


potentialities
 you
 get
 the
 potential
 of


deliberate
 practice
 getting
 good
 at
 hard


things
 fast
 you
 get
 the
 potential
 of


Flow
 State
 getting
 lost
 in
 your
 work
 and


having
 creative
 insights
 but
 all
 of


these
 are
 unified
 by
 the
 need
 to
 have


unbroken
 concentration
 K
 explain
 the
 the


the
 concept
 of
 flow
 which
 is
 uh
 kind
 of


invented
 by
 the
 guy
 with
 a
 very


difficult
 name
 um
 yes
 that's
 M
 CH
 sent


me
 high
 well
 there
 go
 so
 so
 I
 knew
 him


did
 I
 knew
 him
 and
 Anders
 yeah
 good
 what


um
 do
 you
 need
 uh
 to
 be
 in
 a
 kind
 of
 a


deep
 work
 situation
 in
 order
 to
 be
 in


the
 flow
 and
 and
 and
 what
 and
 what
 I'm


sorry
 and
 what
 is
 being
 in
 the
 flow
 I


mean
 flow
 State's
 the
 psychological


state
 that
 mahaley
 identified
 decades


ago
 in
 which
 uh
 you
 get
 lost
 in
 what


you're
 doing
 the
 task
 becomes


all-encompassing
 and
 you
 have
 this


sensation
 of
 you've
 you've
 lost
 track


you're
 not
 even
 thinking
 about
 the


passage
 of
 time
 so
 it's
 characterized
 so


it's
 like
 when
 you
 really
 get
 lost
 in


something
 it's
 athletes
 report
 this
 all


the
 time
 you're
 just
 you're
 lost
 in
 the


skiing
 down
 doing
 your
 ski
 run
 as
 an


Alpine
 skier
 and
 just
 it
 the
 activity


becomes
 your
 whole
 world
 artists
 get


into
 the
 state
 a
 lot
 uh
 I'm
 performing


on
 stage
 and
 I
 don't
 even
 I'm
 not
 even


aware
 my
 fingers
 are
 just
 doing
 what


they're
 doing
 and
 it's
 I'm
 just
 in
 the


music
 it
 it
 could
 be
 a
 very
 creative
 and


a
 very
 pleasurable
 State
 uh
 it
 requires


unbroken
 concentration
 you
 can't
 be
 in
 a


flow
 State
 while
 also
 keeping
 up
 with


your
 email
 inbox
 so
 deep
 work
 is
 a


prerequisite
 for
 a
 flow
 State
 how
 does


his
 tiin
 whe
 simultaneous
 capacity
 is


that
 then
 a
 fallacy
 that
 you
 can
 do
 two


things
 at
 the
 same
 time
 yeah
 we
 know


that's
 a
 fallacy
 right
 uh
 we've
 done


this
 since
 basically
 the
 early
 2000s


that
 there's
 you
 know
 Cliff
 Nas's


research
 on
 multitasking
 like
 we
 learned


pretty
 quick
 L
 okay
 when
 we
 literally


multitask
 like
 tell
 ourselves
 I'm
 doing


these
 two
 things
 concurrently
 um
 I'm


clearly
 just
 switching
 my
 attention
 back


and
 forth
 between
 them
 really
 quickly
 uh


so
 nothing
 is
 getting
 my
 full
 cognitive


attention
 and
 so
 we
 do
 both
 of
 them


worse
 I
 think
 there's
 something
 even


more
 Insidious
 than
 multitasking
 though


because
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 now
 have
 heard


that
 so
 they
 won't
 keep
 two
 windows
 open


at
 the
 same
 time
 they
 won't
 try
 to


answer
 emails
 concurrently
 with
 talking


on
 the
 phone
 but
 what
 we
 do
 instead


which
 I
 think
 can
 be
 almost
 as
 bad
 is


the
 a
 quick
 check
 so
 I'm
 I'm
 mainly
 just


trying
 to
 write
 this
 memo
 that's
 very


hard
 but
 every
 five
 minutes
 I
 just
 check


my
 email
 real
 quick
 because
 I'm
 waiting


for
 something
 and
 then
 I
 come
 back
 to
 it


and
 we
 Pat
 ourselves
 on
 the
 back
 and
 say


look
 I'm
 single
 tasking
 I'm
 not
 doing


two
 things
 concurrently
 but
 what
 we


leave
 out
 is
 that
 even
 the
 quick
 checks


have
 a
 huge
 p
 a
 huge
 price
 right
 so
 when


I
 glance
 at
 that
 inbox
 my
 brain
 sees
 all


of
 these
 emotionally
 Salient
 sort
 of


urgent
 Communications
 from
 my
 tribe


members
 even
 if
 I
 then
 turn
 my
 attention


immediately
 back
 to
 the
 memo
 it's
 too


late
 my
 brain
 started
 the
 process
 of


like
 uhoh
 all
 hands
 on
 deck
 we
 got
 to


like
 fire
 up
 what
 we
 need
 to
 deal
 with


these
 situations
 and
 so
 the
 the
 quick


checks
 gives
 us
 a
 situation
 almost
 as


bad
 as
 actual
 multitasking
 our
 brain


falls
 into
 what
 Linda
 Stone
 calls


partial
 continuous
 attention
 uh
 it
 never


is
 fully
 focused
 on
 any
 one
 thing
 it's


always
 halfway
 through
 changing
 from
 one


context
 to
 another
 this
 is
 the
 state


where
 most
 knowledge
 workers
 spend
 their


entire
 day
 uh
 it's
 exhausting
 and
 we're


producing
 at
 significantly
 reduced


cognitive
 capacity
 a
 ween
 better
 at


multitasking
 than
 men
 no
 human
 brain
 can


multitask
 every
 human
 brain
 needs
 10
 to


20
 minutes
 to
 really
 lock
 in
 on
 a
 on
 a


complicated
 cognitive
 context
 every


human
 brain
 no
 matter
 how
 long
 you've


been
 doing
 it
 is
 going
 to
 be
 befuddled


by
 checking
 an
 inbox
 every
 five
 minutes


or
 trying
 to
 do
 two
 things
 at
 once
 what


happens
 when
 you
 uh
 are
 in
 this
 state
 of


hyperactivity
 over
 a
 long
 period
 of
 time


what
 happens
 to
 your
 brain
 and
 to
 and
 to


your
 wellbeing
 well
 it's
 uh
 quite


literally
 exhausting
 right
 it's
 Why
 by


the
 time
 you
 get
 to
 the
 afternoon
 you


find
 yourself
 unable
 to
 really
 do


anything
 hard
 you
 find
 yourself
 unable


even
 really
 to
 deal
 with
 your
 inbox
 and


You
 Begin
 picking
 out
 just
 the
 messages


that
 are
 easy
 to
 respond
 that's


basically
 your
 brain
 crying
 Uncle
 like


okay
 I've
 had
 enough
 you've
 been
 trying


to
 do
 this
 unnatural
 thing
 you've
 been


switching
 me
 around
 uh
 I'm
 exhausted
 so


so
 there's
 a
 literal
 exhaustion
 to
 it
 we


have
 you
 can
 connect
 other
 negative
 AFF


effect
 like
 stress
 or
 anxiety
 to
 it
 as


well
 we
 just
 feel
 bad
 because
 again


we're
 doing
 something
 that
 we're
 we're


not
 wired
 to
 do
 and
 then
 there's
 the


psychological
 distress
 of
 saying
 I
 know


there's
 these
 important
 things
 I
 should


be
 doing
 that
 I
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 training


that
 I'm
 good
 at
 that
 I
 could
 be


strategizing
 or
 producing
 stuff
 that
 and


I'm
 not
 getting
 to
 it
 all
 I'm
 doing
 is


talking
 about
 work
 and
 and
 I
 can't
 keep


up
 with
 it
 so
 we
 have
 like
 neurological


discomfort
 plus
 this
 sort
 of


psychological
 distress
 of
 like
 this


can't
 possibly
 be
 the
 right
 way
 to
 work


those
 two
 things
 together
 is
 a
 recipe


for
 Burnout
 so
 as
 a
 reaction
 to
 this
 you


wrote
 another
 book
 slow
 productivity
 so


what
 is
 this
 about
 so
 I
 think
 right
 now


our
 implicit
 definition
 of
 productivity


and
 knowledge
 work
 is
 based
 on
 activity


I
 call
 it
 pseudo
 productivity
 it's
 this


notion
 of
 activity
 will
 be
 a
 proxy
 for


useful
 effort
 so
 the
 more
 I
 see
 you


doing
 stuff
 the
 better
 this
 does
 not


play
 well
 with
 a
 world
 of
 email
 and
 chat


where
 I
 can
 show
 you
 activity
 uh


incredibly
 frantically
 and
 in
 a
 very


fine
 grain
 scale
 slow
 productivity
 is
 a


different
 way
 of
 thinking
 about


productivity
 which
 is
 based
 much
 more
 on


results
 I
 want
 to
 produ
 produce
 good


stuff
 over
 time
 that
 really
 matters
 and


in
 order
 to
 do
 this
 uh
 I
 need
 to
 work
 on


less
 things
 at
 the
 same
 time
 I
 need
 to


be
 more
 realistic
 about
 my
 time
 frames


and
 I
 need
 to
 couple
 that
 with
 really


obsessing
 over
 the
 quality
 of
 what
 I
 do


that
 is
 like
 the
 much
 more
 natural
 from


a
 human
 perspective
 the
 much
 more


natural
 way
 of
 approaching
 cognitive


work
 less
 exhausting
 and
 ultimately
 much


more
 effective
 it's
 going
 to
 produce


much
 better
 stuff
 so
 we
 have
 to
 slow


down
 from
 this
 frantic
 activity
 do
 less


things
 at
 once
 but
 do
 these
 things


really
 well
 move
 through
 them
 at
 a


faster
 rate
 I
 think
 this
 is
 going
 to
 be


a
 much
 better
 uh
 this
 is
 the
 recipe
 at


least
 I'm
 pitching
 this
 book
 this
 going


to
 be
 much
 more
 sustainable
 for


knowledge
 workers
 is
 this
 science
 or
 is


it
 philosophy
 uh
 it's
 a
 combination
 of


all
 these
 things
 right
 I
 mean
 we
 we
 know


for
 examp
 some
 of
 this
 just
 common
 sense


right
 uh
 if
 we
 work
 on
 too
 many
 things


at
 the
 same
 time
 What
 Happens
 everything


we've
 agreed
 to
 is
 going
 to
 generate
 its


own
 administrative
 overhead
 every


project
 we're
 working
 on
 generates
 its


own
 emails
 and
 its
 own
 meetings
 so
 if
 I


say
 yes
 to
 10
 things
 I
 have
 10
 projects


worth
 of
 administrative
 overhead


squatting
 there
 in
 my
 day
 on
 my
 schedule


and
 the
 ability
 now
 to
 actually
 make


progress
 on
 any
 of
 these
 10
 things
 gets


greatly
 reduced
 if
 I
 instead
 say
 wait
 a


second
 uh
 I've
 agreed
 to
 do
 10
 things


but
 I'm
 only
 going
 to
 work
 on
 two
 at
 a


time
 now
 I
 only
 have
 the
 administrative


overhead
 of
 two
 projects
 on
 my
 schedule


at
 a
 time
 now
 I
 can
 spend
 a
 lot
 of
 time


working
 on
 these
 two
 things
 I
 can
 get


these
 things
 done
 fast
 I
 can
 get
 these


things
 done
 at
 a
 much
 higher
 level
 of


quality
 and
 then
 pull
 in
 the
 next
 thing


I
 mean
 so
 some
 of
 this
 is
 just
 common


sense
 some
 of
 this
 is
 science
 you
 know


how
 is
 the
 human
 brain
 wired
 what
 is
 our


relationship
 with
 work
 over
 the
 last


300,000
 years
 it's
 not
 8
 hour
 days
 full


intensity
 all
 year
 round
 we
 need
 more


variation
 and
 some
 of
 it's
 philosophical


humans
 want
 to
 produce
 stuff
 that's
 good


so
 reorienting
 work
 around
 quality
 in
 a


way
 just
 from
 activity
 is
 something


that's
 going
 to
 philosophically
 resonate


with
 the
 human
 Spirit
 Cal
 supposedly
 we


walk
 and
 talk
 10%
 faster
 than
 we
 did
 30


years
 ago
 and
 you
 indeed
 talk
 faster


than
 most
 I
 mean
 how
 do
 you
 react
 if


these
 slow
 dudes
 come
 along
 well
 you


mean
 here's
 the
 thing
 about
 the
 people


who
 are
 slowly
 productive
 right
 they


don't
 seem
 slower
 and
 in
 fact
 when
 you


zoom
 out
 you
 say
 wow
 this
 person's


producing
 you
 know
 I
 mean
 case
 after


case
 in
 this
 book
 is
 you
 you
 zoom
 out


and
 look
 at
 this
 person's
 last
 decade
 or


their
 career
 and
 like
 my
 God
 this
 is
 a


super
 productive
 person
 they
 did
 all
 of


these
 things
 these
 things
 are
 really


important
 but
 then
 you
 zoom
 in
 on
 a


particular
 day
 and
 it
 looks
 non-f


frantic
 right
 so
 like
 the
 interesting


thing
 about
 slow
 productivity
 is
 the


scale
 you
 look
 at
 matters
 if
 you
 zoom
 on


a
 particular
 hour
 you
 might
 say
 wow
 this


person
 is
 slow
 like
 they're
 they're
 just


working
 on
 something
 they're
 not
 running


back
 and
 forth
 and
 jumping
 on
 this
 call


or
 whatever
 but
 you
 zoom
 out
 to
 the


whole
 year
 like
 wow
 look
 at
 all
 this


stuff
 they
 got
 done
 like
 they're
 they're


really
 like
 delivering
 they're
 really


making
 a
 difference
 so
 you
 know
 that
 the


perception
 of
 slowness
 depends
 on
 what


time
 scale
 you're
 looking
 at
 and
 how
 do


you
 how
 do
 you
 structure
 that
 kind
 of


attitude
 in
 a
 company
 I
 think
 workload


management
 has
 to
 be
 transparent
 right
 I


mean
 this
 is
 like
 one
 of
 the
 number
 one


things
 a
 company
 can
 do
 is
 we
 have
 to


move
 away
 from
 this
 knowledge
 work
 ideal


of
 uh
 how
 you
 manage
 your
 work
 is
 up
 to


you
 like
 everyone
 is
 just
 autonomous


about
 it
 we
 have
 we
 have
 our
 kpis
 we


have
 our
 objectives
 but
 how
 you
 manage


your
 work
 how
 you
 that's
 all
 up
 to
 you


the
 problem
 about
 doing
 it
 that
 way


where
 it's
 fully
 just
 everyone
 does


their
 own
 thing
 is
 that
 workloads
 get


out
 of
 control
 it's
 like
 I
 don't
 know
 I


have
 to
 decide
 on
 every
 single
 thing


whether
 I
 should
 do
 it
 or
 not
 I
 have
 to


navigate
 to
 social
 dynamics
 I
 think


workload
 management
 should
 be
 much
 more


transparent
 I
 push
 a
 lot
 of
 examples


like
 this
 the
 book
 where
 okay
 here's


what
 we
 need
 to
 work
 on
 and
 we
 have
 it


listed
 right
 here
 you
 don't
 own
 it
 as
 a


person
 yet
 here's
 the
 things
 our
 team's


working
 on
 all
 right
 here's
 the
 specific


things
 from
 this
 list
 that
 you're


working
 on
 now
 here
 is
 specifically
 our


idea
 about
 how
 many
 things
 each
 person


should
 be
 working
 on
 at
 once
 it's
 two


but
 also
 I
 know
 exactly
 what
 you're


working
 on
 so
 did
 are
 you
 done
 with
 that


great
 let's
 get
 you
 a
 new
 thing
 we
 need


to
 be
 much
 more
 explicit
 about
 what


needs
 to
 be
 done
 who's
 working
 on
 what


how
 much
 should
 people
 be
 working
 on


what's
 the
 status
 of
 what
 they're


working
 on
 this
 should
 not
 just
 in
 uh


exist
 in
 internally
 to
 each
 person
 they


only
 they
 know
 what
 they're
 working
 on


it's
 all
 just
 sort
 of
 spread
 out
 over


various
 emails
 and
 things
 they've
 agreed


to
 on
 slack
 explicit
 workload
 management


is
 the
 foundation
 for
 having
 sustainable


workload
 management
 you
 you
 talk
 about


something
 called
 small
 seasonality
 what


is
 that
 well
 we
 need
 more
 variation
 in


intensity
 if
 we
 want
 work
 to
 be


sustainable
 so
 uh
 broad
 seasonality
 the


literal
 seasonality
 is
 seasons
 are


different
 right
 this
 is
 the
 Neolithic


Revolution
 the
 winter
 is
 quieter
 than


the
 fall
 small
 seasonality
 is
 saying


okay
 we
 can
 have
 variations
 in
 intensity


on
 smaller
 scales
 right
 it
 might
 be
 this


week
 we're
 sort
 of
 pulling
 back
 a
 little


bit
 to
 regroup
 after
 a
 hard
 month
 it


could
 be
 I'm
 not
 putting
 meetings
 on


Friday
 so
 like
 Friday
 is
 a
 day
 I
 can


sort
 of
 pull
 back
 and
 and
 think
 deeper


about
 bigger
 projects
 right
 so
 it's


putting
 variation
 of
 intensity
 into
 your


schedule
 not
 at
 the
 scale
 of
 whole


Seasons
 but
 at
 smaller
 time
 scales
 do


you
 think
 we
 should
 go
 to
 full
 day
 weeks


to
 me
 I
 think
 uh
 we
 need
 to
 get
 to
 the


actual
 problem
 before
 we
 just
 treat
 the


symptoms
 the
 problem
 is
 overload
 we're


working
 on
 too
 many
 things
 simply


reducing
 the
 number
 of
 days
 we
 work


doesn't
 solve
 that
 problem
 what
 solves


that
 problem
 is
 explicit
 workload


management
 we
 should
 be
 working
 on
 fewer


things
 at
 once
 to
 me
 that's
 way
 more
 we


can't
 solve
 that
 problem
 by
 just
 trying


to
 reduce
 the
 number
 of
 days
 we
 work
 we


need
 to
 actually
 reduce
 the
 number
 of


things
 we're
 working
 on
 um
 it's
 not
 a


superficial
 fix
 like
 let's
 just
 change


what
 days
 we
 work
 we
 actually
 have
 to


get
 down
 to
 how
 do
 we
 figure
 out
 who's


working
 on
 what
 how
 much
 should
 each


person
 be
 working
 on
 at
 a
 time
 so
 I
 I'm


a
 much
 bigger
 proponent
 of
 getting
 to


the
 actual
 systems
 by
 which


organizations
 run
 the
 way
 work
 is


assigned
 the
 way
 work
 is
 done
 how


collaboration
 happens
 that's
 where
 the


fixes
 need
 to
 be
 not
 let's
 change
 our


schedule
 let's
 make
 it
 hybrid
 versus
 not


hybrid
 that's
 just
 dealing
 with
 the


symptoms
 it's
 not
 getting
 to
 the


underlying
 disease
 let's
 um
 focus
 in
 on


Focus
 um
 now
 you
 say
 that
 we
 must
 TR
 we


must
 train
 our
 mind
 to
 be
 to
 be
 in
 Focus


just
 how
 do
 you
 how
 do
 you
 train
 your


mind
 to
 be
 in
 Focus
 well
 it
 has
 to
 get


used
 to
 it
 like
 the
 the
 state
 of


maintaining
 your
 mind's
 eye
 internally


on
 some
 sort
 of
 abstract
 symbolic
 Target


is
 not
 necessarily
 that
 natural
 for


humans
 it's
 just
 like
 reading
 we
 have
 to


hijack
 parts
 of
 our
 brain
 that
 evolve


for
 other
 purposes
 and
 teach
 them
 how
 to


interpret
 symbols
 into
 meaning
 like
 we


do
 when
 we
 read
 focusing
 on
 abstract


ideas
 a
 business
 strategy
 an
 idea
 that


we're
 going
 to
 write
 it's
 not
 natural
 we


have
 to
 practice
 it
 and
 the
 more
 you


practice
 it
 the
 more
 uh
 easy
 it
 is
 for


you
 to
 get
 in
 that
 state
 and
 the
 deeper


you
 can
 actually
 push
 your
 concentration


but
 if
 you
 don't
 practice
 it
 and
 then


you're
 like
 okay
 I'm
 gonna
 put
 aside


some
 time
 for
 deep
 work
 but
 you've
 never


really
 practiced
 this
 before
 it's
 not


going
 to
 go
 well
 right
 it's
 gonna
 I


can't
 keep
 my
 focus
 my
 mind's
 all
 over


the
 place
 like
 nothing's
 getting
 done


and
 so
 it's
 really
 important
 to
 remember


if
 it
 doesn't
 go
 well
 that
 doesn't
 mean


you're
 not
 wired
 to
 focus
 it
 just
 means


you
 haven't
 practiced
 it
 yet
 does


meditation
 help
 it
 could
 help
 right
 but


I
 to
 me
 the
 right
 practice
 is
 practice


the
 actual
 thing
 you
 want
 to
 get
 better


at
 right
 don't
 like
 meditation
 has
 some


muscles
 in
 it
 that's
 similar
 to
 what


it's
 like
 to
 actually
 focus
 on
 something


but
 why
 not
 just
 practice
 actually


focusing
 so
 the
 exercise
 I
 give
 to


people
 more
 often
 I
 call
 it
 productive


meditation
 and
 what
 I
 suggest
 they
 do
 is


you
 go
 for
 a
 walk
 uh
 this
 helps
 you
 with


the
 exercise
 because
 the
 walking


silences
 some
 of
 your
 neural
 circuits
 so


it's
 a
 little
 bit
 easier
 to
 concentrate


go
 for
 a
 walk
 have
 a
 single
 professional


problem
 that
 you're
 going
 to
 try
 to
 make


progress
 on
 just
 in
 your
 mind
 and
 just


like
 in
 mindfulness
 meditation
 if
 your


attention
 wanders
 from
 the
 problem
 which


it
 will
 you
 just
 notice
 that
 and
 bring


it
 back
 nope
 come
 back
 we're
 going
 to


try
 to
 solve
 this
 problem
 it
 wanders
 and


thinks
 about
 your
 email
 like
 no
 come


back
 we're
 just
 going
 to
 think
 on
 this


problem
 if
 you
 do
 productive
 meditation


on
 a
 regular
 basis
 you
 will
 actually
 get


much
 more
 Adept
 at
 sustaining
 internal


concentration
 on
 a
 Target
 so
 I'm
 a
 big


believer
 of
 let's
 just
 practice
 the


thing
 we
 want
 to
 get
 better
 at
 not


adjacent
 things
 let's
 just
 get
 cut
 right


to
 the
 chase
 of
 what
 we
 want
 to
 do


better
 I
 walk
 to
 work
 when
 I
 uh
 work


from
 uh
 when
 I
 work
 in
 London
 and
 New


York
 so
 I
 should
 uh
 establish
 one


problem
 before
 I
 kick
 off
 and
 then
 think


about
 it
 for
 an
 hour
 it's
 fantastic
 I


look
 I
 used
 to
 walk
 to
 work
 when
 I
 was
 a


postto
 at
 MIT
 and
 I
 did
 this
 every


single
 day
 wow
 I
 really
 could
 tell
 a


difference
 it
 really
 was
 like
 a


superpower
 it's
 just
 like
 when
 you're


exercising
 regularly
 you
 realize
 like
 oh


I'm
 feel
 I
 can
 lift
 heavy
 things
 or
 I


can
 run
 faster
 you
 can
 feel
 the
 same
 way


cognitively
 if
 you're
 doing
 this
 on
 a


regular
 basis
 what
 about
 um
 um
 well


somebody
 like
 Bill
 Gates
 for
 instance
 so


he
 uh
 spends
 a
 week
 a
 year


um
 reading
 right
 reading
 lots
 of


different
 types
 of
 research
 spend
 a
 week


away
 doing
 this
 what
 do
 you
 think
 about


those
 kind
 of
 activities
 yeah
 I
 think


think
 weeks
 are
 a
 good
 idea
 I
 mean
 I


even
 write
 about
 Bill
 Gates
 in
 that
 in


that
 book
 deep
 work
 uh
 he
 would
 do
 this


he
 would
 get
 a
 pile
 of
 books
 and
 go
 to


he
 had
 a
 cabin
 somewhere
 up
 there
 you


know
 outside
 in
 the
 countryside
 Beyond


Seattle
 I
 suppose
 though
 I
 did
 hear


recently
 from
 someone
 who
 knows
 him
 he's


changed
 the
 structure
 of
 his
 think
 weeks


I
 forgot
 exactly
 how
 he
 did
 it
 but
 he


still
 has
 a
 week
 where
 he
 gets
 away
 from


all
 stimulus
 from
 the
 outside
 so
 he
 can


let
 his
 mind
 just
 slowly
 develop


thoughts
 taking
 new
 information
 famously


it
 was
 in
 one
 of
 these
 think
 weeks
 in


the
 90s
 that
 Bill
 Gates
 said
 oh
 oh
 shoot


the
 internet
 the
 consumer
 internet
 is


going
 to
 be
 a
 really
 big
 thing
 and
 he


came
 back
 and
 wrote
 inter
 the
 internet


Title
 Wave
 memo
 that
 came
 out
 of
 a
 think


week
 just
 having
 that
 time
 for
 him
 to


sit
 back
 and
 think
 he
 suddenly
 realized


my
 God
 we're
 about
 to
 miss
 the
 most


important
 Trend
 in
 consumer
 digital


products
 of
 the
 last
 you
 know
 since
 the


personal
 computer
 the
 think
 week
 is


where
 he
 got
 the
 space
 to
 figure
 that


out
 is
 serious
 thinking
 and
 lost
 art
 you


know
 we're
 getting
 worse
 at
 it
 I
 would


say
 just
 as
 a
 populist
 because
 we
 are
 so


distracted
 all
 the
 time
 we're
 just
 out


of
 shape
 we're
 out
 of
 cognitive
 shape


there
 are
 still
 places
 where
 it's


preserved
 we
 Academia
 preserved
 in


certain
 Fields
 I
 mean
 I'm
 a
 theoretician


I
 I
 I
 wrote
 a
 New
 Yorker
 piece
 about


this
 recently
 about
 my
 time
 in
 the


theory
 group
 in
 the
 computer
 science
 lab


at
 MIT
 and
 how
 much
 I
 learned
 there


about
 just
 thinking
 about
 thinking
 as
 a


tier
 one
 skill
 you
 want
 to
 get
 better
 at


and
 care
 about
 there's
 still
 Pockets


like
 that
 around
 Sports
 has
 pockets
 of


this
 uh
 not
 surprisingly
 there's
 some


professional
 athletes
 who
 are
 big


Believers
 in
 my
 books
 uh
 we
 see
 that


especially
 in
 golf
 like
 Rory
 mikoy
 is
 a


big
 fan
 of
 deep
 work
 in
 digital


minimalism
 because
 that
 turns
 out
 to
 be


a
 game
 where
 the
 ability
 to
 focus
 is


everything
 you
 lose
 your
 focus
 that's
 it


you're
 out
 of
 the
 tournament
 uh
 the
 Arts


I
 think
 this
 is
 still
 preserved
 there's


a
 lot
 of
 Arts
 where
 you
 can't
 get
 better


at
 an
 instrument
 without
 giving
 it


intense
 Focus
 so
 this
 art
 still
 exists


but
 as
 a
 populace
 we're
 worse
 at


thinking
 probably
 than
 we've
 ever
 been


uh
 in
 the
 last
 50
 years
 or
 so
 and
 when


you
 meet
 people
 what
 distinguish
 people


who
 are
 into
 deep
 thinking
 from
 those


who


aren't
 uh
 the
 clarity
 and
 original
 of


their
 thoughts
 right
 this
 this
 ability


because
 when
 when
 you're
 practice
 that


deep
 thinking
 you
 can
 hold
 an
 idea
 in


your
 mind
 you
 can
 hold
 related
 ideas
 in


your
 mind
 you
 can
 look
 at
 them
 together


okay
 how
 does
 this
 relate
 to
 this
 they


they
 see
 things
 and
 patterns
 and
 systems


they
 find
 the
 interesting
 angles
 they


they
 they
 they
 what's
 what's
 really


going
 on
 here
 how
 do
 these
 pieces
 fit


together
 so
 originality
 and
 Clarity
 of


thinking
 that
 is
 the
 the
 Hallmark
 of


someone
 who
 is
 very
 comfortable
 just


maintain
 concentration
 in
 their
 Mind's


Eye
 that's
 very
 interesting
 so
 when
 you


sit
 next
 to
 somebody
 at
 a
 at
 a
 dinner


and
 if
 they
 have
 really
 interesting


clear
 different
 ideas
 that's
 probably


because
 they've
 done
 deep
 thinking
 on


their
 own
 so
 yes
 not
 sved
 by
 General


thinking
 yes
 this
 is
 probably
 someone


who
 does
 not
 spend
 a
 lot
 of
 time
 on
 Tik


Tok
 like
 I
 could
 just
 make
 that
 you


could
 usually
 pick
 that
 out
 that
 they're


yeah
 an
 originality
 of
 thought


definitely
 just
 they're
 not
 they're
 just


just
 sitting
 and
 thinking
 about
 things


and
 you
 come
 out
 of
 left
 field
 and
 you


have
 these
 interesting
 ideas
 you
 have


these
 know
 in
 Academia
 you
 could
 pick


this
 up
 right
 away
 like
 the
 deepest


thinkers
 it's
 very
 focused
 like
 if


you're
 a
 theoretician
 like
 me
 it's


originality
 and
 an
 algorithm
 design
 it's


the
 oh
 you
 took
 in
 what
 this
 person
 did


and
 what
 that
 person
 did
 and
 you
 saw


that
 they
 were
 really
 connected
 and
 here


was
 the
 thing
 that
 really
 mattered
 and


if
 we
 tweak
 it
 this
 way
 we
 can
 then
 do


that
 and
 now
 you
 have
 like
 a
 new
 result


that
 that's
 beating
 what
 anyone
 else


ever
 was
 able
 to
 do
 before
 so
 like
 in


academic
 circles
 if
 you're
 a
 physicist


if
 you're
 a
 theoretical
 computer


scientist
 if
 you're
 a
 mathematician
 the


signature
 of
 deep
 thinking
 is
 just


incredibly
 clear
 you
 see
 it
 right
 in
 the


work
 which
 aspects
 of
 Life
 can
 you


improve
 by
 doing
 this
 you
 think
 well


professionally
 speaking
 uh
 almost
 any


knowledge
 work
 job
 you're
 going
 to
 be


much
 better
 at
 like
 it
 knowledge
 work
 is


the
 human
 brain
 being


monetized
 right
 so
 if
 you
 are
 really


good
 at
 focusing
 that
 human
 brain
 you


are
 really
 valuable
 in
 that
 Marketplace


outside
 of
 work
 it's
 fantastic
 for


introspection
 for
 trying
 to
 understand


who
 you
 are
 and
 how
 you
 fit
 into
 a


larger
 understanding
 of
 the
 world


because
 you're
 able
 to
 take
 in


information
 build
 up
 this
 internal


schema
 about
 what
 matters
 what
 doesn't


value
 structures
 idea
 structures
 you
 can


understand
 your
 relationship
 to
 these


pieces
 so
 you're
 going
 to
 have
 a
 much


more
 sophisticated
 understanding
 of


yourself
 and
 your
 world
 so
 there's
 a


great
 uh
 introspective
 Advantage
 as
 well


enjoyment
 of
 Arts
 is
 another
 thing
 of


thing
 right
 I
 mean
 if
 you
 see
 like
 a


great
 filmmaker
 movie
 critic
 for
 example


you
 know
 that
 requires
 the
 ability
 to
 to


really
 concentrate
 on
 what's
 happening


in
 the
 art
 and
 understand
 what
 why
 these


pieces
 fit
 together
 why
 is
 this
 so


affecting
 well
 it's
 it's
 they're
 doing


this
 and
 that
 with
 the
 cinematography


but
 also
 with
 what
 they're
 doing
 with


the
 cuts
 you
 know
 so
 you
 can
 appreciate


Arts
 at
 a
 higher
 level
 as
 well
 so


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 areas
 where
 you
 know
 I


I
 say
 this
 in
 one
 of
 my
 books
 that
 the


sort
 of
 a
 a
 deep
 life
 is
 a
 good
 life


because
 I
 really
 believe
 and
 this
 goes


all
 the
 way
 back
 to
 Aristotle
 right
 this


is
 the
 nican
 ethics
 he
 talks
 about
 this


but
 humans
 are
 distinguished
 by
 this


ability
 to
 give
 sustained
 abstract


attention
 no
 one
 else
 no
 other
 animal


does
 and
 so
 it's
 our
 in
 our
 sort
 of


intrinsic
 nature
 that
 we
 should
 be
 doing


this
 what
 makes
 us
 most
 human
 we
 should


really
 embrace
 it
 does
 make
 our
 life
 I


think
 richer
 so
 you
 say
 a
 deep
 life
 is
 a


good
 life
 so
 what
 do
 you
 do
 when
 you


have
 a
 bad
 life
 uh
 when
 you
 are
 relaxing


and
 not
 going
 deep
 what
 do
 you
 how
 do


you
 relax
 what
 do
 I
 do
 personally
 yeah


all
 I
 do
 is
 sit
 around
 and
 do
 Focus


exercises
 um
 you
 know
 I
 have
 three
 kids


who
 are
 young
 so
 I
 this
 word
 relax
 you


speak
 of
 is
 odd
 to
 me


so
 we
 have
 we
 have
 a
 I
 have
 a
 lot
 going


on
 with
 my
 family
 life
 um
 I
 do
 like
 my


one
 hobby
 outside
 of
 just
 you
 know
 I


read
 a
 lot
 and
 WR
 a
 lot
 is
 I
 do
 like


movies
 and
 so
 so
 to
 me
 uh
 I
 love
 going


to
 the
 movies
 I
 love
 watching
 movies
 I


love
 reading
 about
 movies
 I
 I
 love
 that


it
 has
 nothing
 to
 do
 with
 what
 I
 do


professionally
 so
 I
 can
 just
 enjoy
 that


art
 without
 having
 to
 worry
 about
 all
 of


the
 stuff
 that
 goes
 behind
 the
 other


types
 of
 art
 I'm
 involved
 in
 but
 what


kind
 of
 state
 of
 mind
 are
 you
 in
 when


you
 watch
 a
 movie
 I'm
 really
 engaged
 I
 I


I
 mean
 I'm
 I'm
 really
 interested
 in
 I


mean
 I
 often
 have
 to
 it's
 my
 second


viewing
 of
 a
 movie
 is
 when
 I
 really


start
 to
 like
 a
 movie
 I
 really
 like
 the


second
 viewing
 I
 usually
 like
 a
 movie
 a


lot
 better
 uh
 the
 first
 viewing
 I'm


taking
 it
 in
 and
 noticing
 myself
 like


how
 am
 I
 reacting
 to
 this
 my
 second


viewing
 I'm
 looking
 at
 the
 film
 making


like
 what
 did
 the
 what
 did
 the
 director


do
 to
 generate
 this
 you
 and
 I
 begin
 to


notice
 you
 know
 it's
 just
 the
 the
 the


things
 that
 sort
 of
 matter
 like
 what
 are


they
 doing
 with
 the
 editing
 what
 are


they
 doing
 with
 the
 cinematography


um
 what
 are
 they
 doing
 with
 the
 acting


here
 what's
 happening
 in
 this
 screenplay


like
 why
 and
 I
 I
 I
 I
 really
 love
 like


interesting
 aitor
 voices
 and
 people
 who


take
 interesting
 chances
 um
 it
 just
 I


find
 it
 like
 creatively
 exhilarating
 to


see
 the
 creative
 risks
 and


experimentation
 that
 happen
 in
 that


field
 because
 we
 don't
 have
 as
 much
 of


that
 like
 I'm
 a
 non-fiction
 writer
 in


addition
 to
 being
 a
 professor
 like


non-fiction
 writing
 we
 don't
 have
 as


much
 experimentation
 to
 the
 way
 you


would
 see
 in
 like
 the
 movies
 like
 the


people
 do
 interesting
 stuff
 with
 a
 huge


amount
 of
 money
 on
 the
 line
 too
 I
 think


it's
 just
 a
 fascinating
 corner
 of
 the


Arts
 ke
 um
 we
 got
 tens
 of
 thousands
 of


uh
 young
 people
 listening
 to
 this
 so


you're
 a
 young


person
 how
 do
 you
 attack
 this
 this
 thing


what
 do
 you
 do
 well
 first
 of
 all
 I'd
 say


respect
 your
 attention
 right
 this
 is


like
 your
 most
 important
 resource
 in
 a


cognitive
 culture
 and
 economy
 like
 we


have
 now
 is
 your
 attention
 like
 what
 you


pay
 attention
 to
 what
 you
 do
 with
 that


attention
 respect
 your
 attention
 so


don't
 just
 rent
 it
 out
 to
 the
 first
 uh


company
 that
 comes
 along
 and
 says
 we


want
 to
 rent
 out
 your
 attention
 and


monetize
 it
 look
 at
 our
 video
 scroll


this
 thing
 here's
 a
 Tik
 Tok
 Instagram


Twitter
 uh
 have
 more
 respect
 for
 your


attention
 than
 that
 like
 what
 do
 I


really
 want
 to
 pay
 attention
 to
 I
 want


to
 like
 read
 something
 good
 I
 want
 to


watch
 something
 interesting
 I
 want
 to


connect
 deeply
 with
 a
 real
 person
 who's


in
 front
 of
 me
 I
 want
 to
 do
 this
 thing


in
 my
 job
 really
 well
 right
 so
 just
 just


treating
 your
 attention
 as
 something


that
 deserves
 your
 respect
 and
 not


something
 that
 can
 just
 be
 AMU
 abused


and
 monetized
 by
 everyone
 trying
 to
 make


a
 dime
 off
 of
 like
 minutes
 of
 your


active
 user
 minutes
 it's
 a
 completely


different
 way
 of
 living
 when
 you're
 not


just
 sort
 of
 constantly
 distracted
 I've


had
 readers
 tell
 me
 it's
 like
 your
 life


goes
 from
 black
 and
 white
 to
 Technicolor


you're
 noticing
 things
 you're


understanding
 things
 you're
 thinking


about
 things
 and
 so
 I
 don't
 know
 that's


how
 maybe
 that
 would
 be
 my
 my
 summary


for
 a
 young
 person
 if
 you
 respect
 your


attention
 it
 will
 do
 wonderful
 things


for
 you
 if
 you
 don't
 there
 is
 many


people
 many
 corporations
 many
 apps
 that


are
 looking
 to
 just
 take
 advantage
 of


your
 attention
 and
 your
 life
 is
 going
 to


be
 imp
 harage
 because
 of


it
 so
 be
 deliberate
 about
 how
 you
 spend


your
 time
 now
 one
 of
 the
 things
 you


should
 do
 is
 to
 read
 of
 course
 deep
 work


by
 Cal
 Newport
 fantastic
 book
 really


really
 important
 I
 absolutely
 loved
 it


and
 Cal
 it's
 been
 fantastic
 you
 have
 you


on
 big
 thanks
 well
 thank
 you
 I
 enjoyed


it
