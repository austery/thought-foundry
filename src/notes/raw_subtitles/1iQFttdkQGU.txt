Hi
 everybody.
 I'm
 Nicolola
 Tangen,
 the


CEO
 of
 the
 Norwegian
 Southern
 Wealth


Fund
 and
 today
 I'm
 in
 really
 really
 good


company
 in
 the
 fast
 lane
 actually
 with


the
 motorsport
 legends
 Stefano


Dominicali.
 Stefano
 is
 the
 president
 and


CEO
 of
 Formula
 1.
 Great
 and
 thanks
 for


joining
 us.
 Thank
 you.
 Thank
 you


Nikolai.
 And
 thanks
 to
 all
 our
 fans
 and


supporters
 and
 above
 all
 maybe
 new


people
 that
 they
 don't
 have
 a
 clue
 who
 I


am.
 That's
 great.
 So
 we
 can
 connect
 with


them.
 Absolutely.
 Now,
 uh,
 Stefano,


first
 of
 all,
 is
 Formula
 1
 a
 sport
 or
 a


TV
 show?
 Well,
 it's
 definitely
 a
 sport,


but
 of
 course,
 when
 you're
 talking
 about


TV
 show,
 I
 need
 to
 understand
 what
 you


think
 as
 a
 TV
 show
 is
 a
 negative


approach
 or
 or
 as
 a
 positive
 comment.
 I


would
 say
 what
 is
 definitely
 different


from
 the
 past
 is
 F1
 is
 listen
 what
 is


all
 around
 the
 world.
 So
 we
 definitely


need
 to
 understand
 what
 are
 the


ingredients
 to
 to
 be
 relevant
 in
 the


world
 of
 uh
 I
 said
 entertainment
 because


um
 sport
 is
 a
 part
 of
 what
 I
 believe
 a


bigger
 picture
 uh
 what
 an
 entertainment


platform
 should
 be
 and
 we
 are
 definitely


that
 is
 an
 entertainment
 platform
 where


we
 have
 at
 the
 center
 of
 course
 the


sporting
 challenge
 the
 sporting
 fight
 on


the
 track
 with
 the
 drivers
 who
 are
 for


us
 the
 jewel
 of
 our
 sport
 and
 the
 cars


uh
 which
 represent
 the
 technological


aspect
 of
 us.
 But
 today
 F1
 is
 not
 only


about
 it
 is
 about
 having
 people


gathering
 together,
 having
 people
 that


have
 the
 chance
 to
 have
 fun,
 enjoy
 and


given
 the
 chance
 to
 other
 opportunity


like
 business
 development
 for
 partners


or
 having
 the
 chance
 for
 everyone
 to


connect
 with
 what
 we
 can
 offer
 to
 make


sure
 that
 in
 a
 sort
 of
 uh
 situation


where
 I
 can
 choose
 a
 lot
 of
 things,
 you


can
 be
 attracted
 of
 our
 menu.
 M
 and
 you


have
 and
 your
 menu
 is
 is
 incredible
 just


now.
 So
 who's
 who's
 how
 has
 the
 fan
 base


changed?
 What's
 the
 fan
 base
 now?
 Well,


the
 fan
 base
 has
 changed
 definitely
 in


the
 last
 couple
 of
 years.
 The
 change
 the


fans
 base
 has
 changed
 because
 before
 we


were
 very
 avid
 fans
 uh
 male
 90%
 quite
 uh


old
 in
 term
 of
 age.
 Of
 course
 we
 have


worldwide
 so
 as
 to
 be
 a
 sort
 of
 average


of
 what
 we
 are
 talking
 about.
 Now
 we
 are


getting
 younger
 and
 younger
 which
 are


much
 uh
 diverse
 population.
 New
 market


for
 example
 we
 are
 40
 we
 40%
 women
 60%


men
 35
 years
 of
 age.
 So
 we
 are
 getting


in
 that
 landscape
 and
 as
 we
 said


different
 culture
 different


sensitivities
 different
 approach
 to
 the


sport
 but
 uh
 with
 one
 common
 ground
 you


know
 and
 that's
 where
 we
 need
 to
 make


sure
 that
 everyone
 is
 sitting
 in.
 How
 do


you
 when
 you
 look
 at
 your
 uh
 your


venues,
 you
 are
 now
 at
 24
 races
 a


season.
 Um
 how
 do
 you
 balance
 the
 kind


of
 the
 historic
 venues
 with
 the
 new
 with


the
 newer
 ones?
 Well,
 first
 of
 all
 uh


for
 me
 is
 is
 to
 be
 clear
 one
 thing


historical
 is
 a
 value
 if
 uh
 means
 that


there
 are
 great
 foundation
 related
 to


our
 sport.
 If
 historical
 mean
 old
 is
 not


anymore
 historical
 is
 is
 looking
 in
 the


past.
 And
 therefore
 what
 I
 think
 is


relative
 important
 for
 us
 is
 to
 make


sure
 that
 the
 races
 and
 the
 countries


that
 has
 been
 part
 of
 our
 history
 with


the
 will
 to
 keep
 investing
 in
 the
 future


will
 be
 vital
 to
 stay
 in
 our
 calendar


and
 this
 will
 happen
 and
 24
 is
 max
 24
 is


is
 a
 max
 number
 today.
 think
 it's
 a
 bit


high
 even
 or
 no
 I
 don't
 think
 so
 and
 and


and
 and
 I
 tell
 you
 why
 I
 mean
 uh
 there


are
 a
 lot
 of
 uh
 polarized
 position
 on


that
 uh
 first
 of
 all
 I
 go
 back
 to
 what


we
 need
 to
 be
 in
 term
 of


relevancy
 I
 said
 to
 my
 people
 we
 are
 not


here
 to
 compete
 against
 other
 sport


platform
 we
 are
 here
 to
 compete


with
 movies
 with
 with
 music
 with
 events


with
 other
 things
 that
 are
 in
 the
 agenda


of
 our
 fans.
 You
 know,
 our
 life
 is
 is


really
 is
 a
 sort
 of
 and
 this
 is
 very


close
 to
 F1
 approach
 in
 a
 sort
 of
 quick


speed
 action
 needs
 of
 seeing
 new
 things


otherwise
 you
 get
 old
 and
 not
 relevant.


Therefore,
 I
 go
 back
 to
 the
 fact
 that
 uh


we
 have
 not
 a
 lot
 of
 content.
 If
 you


think
 we
 have
 24
 races,
 20
 drivers,
 can


you
 imagine
 if
 you
 have
 to
 be


competitive
 in
 the
 world
 of
 creating
 the


right
 news
 with
 sport
 when
 they
 have
 100


games
 when
 sport
 with
 they
 have
 hundreds


of
 athletes,
 you
 know,
 we
 need
 to
 find


the
 right
 relevancy
 on
 that.
 Therefore,


is
 more
 complicated
 than
 ever.


Therefore,
 I
 don't
 think
 the
 24
 are
 are


do
 you
 think
 you
 drop
 some
 to
 introduce


some
 new
 countries?
 Well,
 uh
 yes,
 for


sure.
 Or
 we
 are
 thinking
 also
 to
 rotate


some
 places
 in
 a
 sort
 of
 possibility
 to


to
 give
 chances
 to
 to
 come
 and
 and
 go
 in


a
 sort
 what
 are
 some
 of
 the
 new
 places


you
 would
 love
 to
 do?
 Well,
 we
 are


thinking
 first
 of
 all
 let
 me
 do
 one


thing
 that
 is
 important
 to
 state
 it.
 We


have
 we
 are
 very
 healthy
 today
 because


we
 have
 a
 long-term
 agreement
 with
 a
 lot


of
 partners.
 Yeah.
 Therefore,
 the
 slot


to
 be
 able
 to
 jump
 into
 the
 calendar
 are


very
 minimal.
 Uh
 therefore
 I
 we
 need
 to


first
 of
 all
 keep
 the
 intensity


of
 you
 know
 pushing
 the
 actual
 one
 to


keep
 increasing
 the
 quality
 of
 the
 offer


that
 we
 want
 to
 give
 to
 our
 fans.
 In


term
 of
 new
 markets
 I
 would
 say
 that
 we


have
 done
 a
 big
 jump
 in
 US.
 We
 were
 one


races
 just
 three
 years
 ago.
 Now
 we
 are


three.
 I
 think
 that
 one
 relevant
 area
 to


control
 or
 to
 see
 if
 what
 we
 can
 do
 in


the
 future
 is
 the
 far
 east
 and
 and
 and


and
 of
 course
 one
 area
 that
 we
 want
 to


monitor
 uh
 is
 Africa
 because
 it's
 the


only
 continent
 that
 is
 not
 there
 in
 the


championship
 but
 before
 getting
 there
 we


need
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 you
 know
 there


are
 the
 right
 condition
 in
 a
 term
 in
 a


long-term
 uh
 structure.
 So
 these
 are
 the


places
 you
 know
 if
 you
 think


back
 you
 know
 we
 were
 we
 have
 been


always
 a
 world
 championship
 but
 we
 were


Europe
 Europeentric
 we
 were
 having
 the


majority
 races
 in
 Europe.
 Now
 we
 have


basically
 a
 very
 very
 clear
 way
 of


dividing
 our
 calendar
 in
 in
 in
 in
 zone


in
 in
 in
 in
 area
 where
 now
 we
 are
 really


balanced
 on
 that.
 But
 as
 I
 said
 the


focus
 is
 to


stay
 to
 to
 check
 if
 there
 are
 new


opportunity
 that
 are
 coming
 in.
 We
 have


options
 for
 sure.
 So
 we
 are
 in
 a
 sort
 of


qualitative
 situation
 where
 we
 can


choose
 and
 and
 make
 sure
 that
 the


decision
 is
 right.
 Is
 there
 a
 trade-off


between
 entertainment
 factor
 and
 safety


concerns
 in
 this
 sport?
 Well,
 safety
 has


been
 always
 the
 center.
 We
 don't
 want
 to


jeopardize
 or
 to
 minimize
 at
 all
 uh
 the


approach
 on
 safety.
 safety
 remain
 as
 a


sort
 of
 fundamental
 pillars
 of
 of
 a


sport
 that
 in
 any
 case
 as
 is
 written
 in


our
 passes
 motorsport
 is
 definitely


dangerous.
 But
 what
 I
 have
 to
 say
 that


uh
 uh
 the
 turning
 moment
 of
 what
 has


happened
 uh
 in
 the
 past
 has
 been
 the
 the


accident
 in
 94
 when
 Senna
 and
 other


drivers
 Ratenburgger
 died
 in
 a
 very


tragic
 event.
 From
 that
 moment,
 the
 FIA


did
 an
 imive
 step
 versus
 safety
 and
 we


need
 to
 be
 to
 recognize
 that
 because
 of


course
 we
 had
 other
 tragedies
 later
 on


but
 very
 minimal
 and
 our
 duty
 is
 not
 to


give
 any
 kind


of
 sort
 of
 excuses
 to
 that
 because
 that


will
 stay
 always
 at
 the
 center.
 M
 and


and
 by
 the
 way
 safety
 doesn't
 mean
 that


you
 cannot
 have
 a
 proper
 championship
 in


term
 of
 action
 in
 term
 of
 drama
 on
 the


track
 that
 is
 different
 story
 but
 that


will
 not
 be
 not
 negotiable.
 Now
 you
 have


uh
 some
 regulatory
 changes
 partly
 to


increase
 drama
 right
 or
 the
 competitive


uh
 spirit
 of
 it.
 Now
 how
 do
 you
 uh
 how


do
 you
 think
 these
 regulation
 changes


will
 will
 uh
 change
 the
 sport?
 Well,
 I


think
 that
 first
 of
 all
 there
 is
 always


the
 reason
 why
 there
 is
 a
 change
 on
 the


regulation
 and
 there
 is
 mainly
 the
 two


there
 are
 two
 factors.
 One
 is
 to
 stay


relevant
 in
 term
 of
 technological
 uh


opportunity
 that
 we
 as
 a
 sport
 need
 to


keep
 at
 the
 center
 of
 our
 project.


Secondly,
 of
 course,
 the
 other
 thing


that
 has
 been
 done
 in
 the
 past
 is
 to


make
 sure
 there
 was
 a
 sort
 of


reshuffleling
 in
 term
 of
 keeping
 the


sport
 at
 the
 interest.
 That
 is
 not
 the


case
 for
 this
 reaff
 of
 the
 teams
 and


technology.
 Correct.
 If
 you
 got
 like
 a


super
 car,
 you
 change
 regulations
 so


then
 that
 car
 is
 less
 good
 next
 season.


Well,
 could
 be
 that
 the
 other
 could
 have


a
 chance
 to
 recatch
 up.
 But
 that's
 not


the
 case
 of
 this
 year
 of
 next
 year,


sorry.
 Because
 if
 you
 think
 and
 if
 you


look
 today,
 the
 gaps
 between
 the
 cars
 is


so
 minimal,
 never
 been
 so
 so
 close
 that


the
 reason
 why
 there's
 been
 a
 change


decided
 couple
 of
 years
 ago
 is
 because


we
 want
 to
 keep
 the
 relevancy
 of
 the


sustainable
 fuel
 and
 the
 hybridization


at
 the
 center
 of
 the


technological
 package.
 So
 that's
 was
 the


reason
 why
 we
 have
 the
 change.


Therefore,
 what
 I'm
 expecting
 this
 year,


there
 will
 be
 for
 sure
 some
 something


that
 will
 have
 an
 effect
 on
 the
 fact


that
 some
 teams
 and
 or
 manufacturer
 has


been
 able
 to
 develop
 better
 than


regulation.
 If
 you
 compare
 with
 the


others,
 that
 means
 that
 we
 can
 have


bigger
 gaps,
 but
 the
 regulation
 is
 tied


up
 in
 a
 way
 that
 if
 this
 will
 be
 the


case,
 there
 will
 be
 less
 time
 for
 the


others
 to
 catch
 up.
 So
 that's
 very


important
 to
 keep
 it
 clear.
 So
 with
 the


regulations
 coming
 in
 for
 next
 year
 for


instance
 what
 do
 you
 think
 will
 be
 the


result
 in
 terms
 of
 the
 sport?
 The
 result


of
 the
 sport
 will
 be
 we
 will
 see
 west


develop
 better
 the
 their
 understanding


of
 the
 new
 regulation.
 I
 think
 that
 as


always
 because
 that's
 history
 that
 shows


that
 there
 will
 be
 things
 that
 will
 be


big
 stronger
 than
 others
 and
 and
 and
 the


only
 thing
 that
 is
 different
 is
 that
 we


have
 put
 in
 place
 a
 system
 that
 will


enable
 you
 know
 if
 this
 will
 be
 the
 case


for
 the
 others
 to
 catch
 up
 as
 quickly
 as


possible
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 we
 can
 have


as
 today
 a
 championship
 with
 the
 gaps


that
 are
 very
 very
 marginal
 and
 and
 a


fight
 between
 different
 teams
 and


different
 drivers.
 So
 closer
 racing


easier
 to
 overtake.
 Yes,
 that's
 that's


always
 the
 the
 principle
 of
 what
 we
 want


to
 do
 to
 achieve
 in
 a
 different
 way.
 But


that's
 of
 course
 uh
 very
 important
 for


us.
 What
 about
 the
 aerodynamic
 changes?


The
 dynamic
 changes
 are
 connected
 to
 the


different
 way
 of
 using
 the
 power
 unit


because
 a
 power
 unit
 will
 be
 50%


deployment
 electric
 power
 and
 50%
 deploy


of
 uh
 traditional
 and
 terminal
 power.


Therefore,
 in
 order
 to
 adjust
 the


complexity
 of
 this,
 the
 cars
 will
 be


different
 in
 term
 of
 aerodynamics,
 in


term
 of
 management
 of
 the
 different


surfaces
 that
 you
 can
 activate.
 And
 this


is
 something
 that
 will
 be
 incredible


because
 we
 will
 we
 will
 have
 given,
 you


know,
 as
 always
 the
 chance
 to
 the


engineers
 of
 a
 team
 that
 are
 the
 best
 in


the
 world
 to
 develop
 and
 to
 see
 what


they
 can
 come
 as
 a
 sort
 of
 solution
 to


be
 uh
 to
 allow
 that
 team
 to
 be
 faster


than
 the
 others.
 Historically,
 we've


seen
 a
 lot
 of the
 advances
 here
 moving


into
 the
 mess
 market
 eventually.
 What


are
 some
 of
 the
 things
 you
 are
 seeing


now
 which
 could
 could
 move
 into
 the nice


market?
 Well,
 definitely
 what
 is


relevant
 for
 for
 the
 future
 is
 the


sustainable
 fuel.
 You
 know,
 and
 this
 is


not
 really
 the
 place
 to
 talk
 about
 right


or
 wrong.
 It's
 clear
 that
 on
 the


mobility
 side
 has
 been
 a
 shift
 versus


full
 electrification
 that
 cannot
 be
 seen


as
 the
 only
 answer
 to
 the
 world
 of


mobility
 because
 it's
 too
 complicated,


too
 complex.
 Sustainable
 fuel
 that
 today


is
 very
 very
 expensive
 uh
 should
 and


would
 will
 to
 thanks
 to
 formal
 one


development
 be
 able
 to
 be
 another


solution
 on
 the
 portfolio
 of
 the
 offer


that
 the
 manufacturer
 will
 give
 to
 the


different
 customer
 around
 the
 world
 and


that's
 very
 very
 relevant
 but
 the
 fuel


is
 a
 small
 part
 of
 the
 carbon
 footprint


right
 absolutely
 and
 and
 you
 have
 some


goals
 here
 for
 formula
 1
 yes
 I
 mean
 the


fuel
 that
 we
 burn
 on
 the
 track
 is
 very


marginal
 We
 if
 you
 if
 you
 look
 we
 have


two
 main
 sources
 of
 our
 uh
 footprint
 of


of
 carbon
 emission.
 One
 is
 our
 logistics


because
 we
 are
 a
 world
 championship
 and


we
 cannot
 and
 know
 we
 cannot
 stop


traveling.
 Therefore
 for
 example
 already


this
 year
 we
 are
 working
 together
 with


our
 partners
 to
 use
 sustainable
 aviation


fuel
 that
 is
 very
 expensive
 but
 is


already
 a
 step
 in
 the
 right
 direction
 to


minimize
 it.
 our
 you
 know
 all
 our
 the


other
 logistics
 are
 already
 using
 system


of
 transport
 that
 are
 minimizing
 the


carbon
 footprint
 and
 then
 of
 course
 the


other
 big
 step
 that
 is
 we
 are
 working
 to


be
 even
 stronger
 uh
 is
 how
 we
 work
 with


the
 promoters
 you
 know
 well
 we
 are


hosting
 events
 with
 400,000
 people


gathering
 together
 you
 can
 imagine
 the


complexity
 of
 having
 the
 right
 energy


the
 right
 quality
 of
 material
 to
 be
 used


uh
 so
 it's
 a
 huge
 project
 that
 is


involved
 with
 all
 the
 ecosystem
 of
 for


to
 try
 uh
 to
 understand
 that
 this
 is
 not


a
 joke.
 This
 is
 a
 very
 important
 element


of
 our
 of
 our
 future
 and
 therefore


that's
 why
 we
 want
 to
 keep
 the
 target
 of


being
 carbon
 neutral
 within
 2030.
 It's
 a


big
 task.
 No
 other
 sport
 no
 other
 sport


in
 in
 in
 the
 world
 has
 taken
 as
 a


commitment
 with
 facts
 with
 the


independent
 auditing
 that
 is
 monitoring


what
 we're
 doing.
 So
 we
 have
 to
 say
 we


are
 very
 proud
 of
 what
 we're
 doing.


Moving
 on
 to
 the
 drivers.
 Uh
 now
 you
 got


uh
 20
 drivers.
 How
 good
 are
 the
 current


20
 drivers
 compared
 to
 history?


Difficult
 to
 compare
 because
 drivers
 has


to
 be
 put
 in
 the
 contest
 over
 the


period.
 But
 for
 sure
 the
 drivers
 today


are
 very
 very
 competitive,
 very
 very


professional.
 This
 year
 for
 the
 first


time
 we
 have
 five
 new
 young
 drivers
 that


are
 coming
 into
 form
 one.
 That
 shows


that
 and
 doing
 well
 right
 are
 doing
 very


very
 well
 and
 that
 why
 we
 are
 very
 happy


because
 that
 means
 that
 the
 pyramid


behind
 that
 is
 formal
 2
 form
 3
 are
 very


strong
 that
 means
 that
 we
 can
 have
 the


future
 and
 now
 as
 you
 have
 may
 have


noticed
 we
 have
 added
 into
 our
 pyramid


the
 F1
 academy
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 in
 our


diverse
 project
 that
 we
 want
 to
 an


inclusive
 project
 that
 we
 want
 to
 take


on
 also
 women
 to
 be
 in
 the
 future
 be


able
 to
 be
 part
 of
 of
 the
 F1
 idea
 that


is
 massive.
 So
 therefore
 I
 think
 that


the
 drivers
 are
 very
 very
 strong,
 very


very
 good
 uh
 different
 personality.
 We


don't
 want
 to
 have
 everyone
 the
 same.
 We


want
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 everyone
 is


different
 from
 uh
 from
 each
 other
 and


able
 through
 the
 way
 that
 we
 are
 able
 to


communicate
 our
 social
 media,
 our
 their


social
 media,
 the
 new
 platform
 of


communication
 that
 we
 are
 offering
 to
 be


a
 sort
 of
 role
 model
 that
 can
 inspire


other
 people
 or
 other
 you
 know
 lovers
 of


our
 sport
 to
 be
 attracted
 to
 to
 to
 to


what
 we're
 doing.
 What
 makes
 a
 good


driver?
 Makes
 a
 good
 driver
 for
 sure.
 No


no
 need
 to
 say
 that
 you
 have
 to
 be


quick.
 If
 you
 are
 not
 winning,
 you
 can


talk
 a
 lot
 of
 good
 things
 but
 you
 need


to
 win.
 Therefore,
 results
 are
 very


important.
 Of
 course,
 you
 need
 to


understand
 that
 there
 is
 a
 bigger


picture.
 Today
 is
 not
 only
 driving
 is


only
 is
 also
 understanding
 that
 F1
 today


is
 so
 big
 that
 you
 need
 to
 understand


your
 public
 role.
 Your
 committed
 with


the
 with
 the
 with
 the
 fans,
 with
 the


customers,
 with
 the
 partners,
 you
 have
 a


public
 face.
 You
 have
 to
 accept
 when
 you


are
 driving
 in
 a
 Formula
 One.
 Otherwise,


if
 you
 just
 want
 to
 drive
 without
 being


disrespectful,
 if
 you
 want
 to
 do
 only


mileage,
 you
 can
 be
 a
 great
 Uber
 driver.


But
 that's
 what
 what
 we
 don't
 need
 in


Forum
 One.
 Do
 you
 think
 there
 are
 faster


drivers
 out
 there
 who
 don't
 have
 because


they
 don't
 have
 a
 personal
 face?
 Uh,
 no.


I
 think
 that
 F1
 is
 is
 representative
 of


the
 real
 uh
 picture,
 always
 the
 fastest.


Of
 course,
 you
 you
 can
 be
 you
 cannot
 be


a
 champion
 without
 a
 proper
 car
 because


you
 can
 be
 the
 best
 and
 you
 don't
 have


the
 possibility
 to
 have
 it
 to
 have
 a


fast
 car.
 You're
 not
 showing
 the
 real


quality,
 but
 that's
 life.
 What's
 the


What
 does
 it
 take
 to
 be
 a
 really
 fast


driver?
 What
 what
 are
 the
 what
 are
 the


the
 skill?
 What's
 the
 the
 mental


capabilities,
 the
 motoric?
 Well,
 I
 think


that
 le
 let's
 assume
 that
 today
 when
 you


are
 in
 that
 arena
 of
 being
 a
 form
 one


driver,
 you
 given
 for
 granted
 the
 fact


that
 you
 are
 a
 very
 good
 professional,


you
 are
 very
 very
 well
 fit.
 You
 you


understand
 the
 needs
 of
 being
 an
 F1


driver.
 What
 makes
 the
 difference
 of
 a


really
 in
 my
 opinion
 of
 a
 pure


championship
 is
 to
 be
 able


to


defragmented
 the
 action
 that
 you
 are


doing
 and
 the
 car
 that
 and
 the
 action
 of


the
 car
 to
 maximize
 every
 single
 frame


of
 the
 performance.
 So
 on
 your
 side
 how


to
 maximize
 we're
 talking
 about
 the
 gaps


of
 millisecond.
 Can
 you
 imagine
 it's


nothing.
 So
 if
 you
 want
 to
 be
 the
 best,


you
 need
 to
 slow
 down
 everything
 to
 try


to
 see
 where
 you
 can
 improve
 and
 where


you
 want
 for
 your
 car
 to
 be
 faster.


That's
 the
 characteristic
 of
 the
 best


driver.
 Understanding
 that
 even
 if
 no


matter
 if
 you
 are
 running
 at
 300
 or


maybe
 more
 kilometers
 per
 hour,
 you're


able
 to
 to
 have
 everything
 under
 control


to
 maximize
 your
 performance,
 the


performance
 of
 your
 team,
 the


performance
 of
 your
 car.
 How
 important


is
 the
 car?
 Crucial.
 There's
 no
 doubt


about
 it.
 uh
 you
 know
 but
 how
 much
 is


actually
 if
 you
 put
 the
 best
 driver
 in


the
 worst
 car
 of
 the
 of
 the
 20
 what


would
 the
 results
 be?
 There
 would
 not
 be


the
 the
 leader
 of
 the
 championship
 for


sure.
 I
 mean
 he
 cannot
 make
 if
 the
 gap


of
 the
 car
 is
 too
 big
 he
 will
 not
 make


that
 jump.
 And
 how
 big
 is
 the
 gap?
 Well,


today
 there
 are
 some
 cars
 that
 you
 know


are
 behind
 for
 sure
 and
 the
 best
 driver


you
 see
 when
 the
 the
 gaps
 will
 become


marginal
 when
 when
 you
 have
 difficult


conditions
 when
 you
 understand
 really


what
 is
 able
 to
 make
 as
 a
 sort
 of
 call


on
 his
 side
 rather
 than
 the
 others
 are


doing
 other
 stuff.
 So,
 as
 always,
 the


good
 the
 good
 drivers
 you
 see
 in
 the
 in


the
 extreme
 condition,
 but
 it's
 it's


pretty
 clear
 that
 you
 can
 talk
 with
 all


the
 drivers
 in
 the
 world
 that
 if
 you


don't
 have
 a
 good
 car
 as
 a
 base,
 you


cannot
 be
 a
 champion.
 That's
 for
 sure.


And
 these
 uh
 the
 best
 drivers,
 are
 they


more
 like
 uh
 fighter
 pilots
 or
 are
 they


like
 downhill
 skiers
 or
 what?
 Uh
 I
 know


you
 are
 a
 good
 skier.
 I
 have
 heard
 some


rumors.


It's
 always
 relative,
 but
 it's
 okay.


What
 is
 it?
 What's
 the
 What
 is
 it
 most


similar
 to?
 Well,
 I
 think
 that
 is
 is
 a


combination
 of
 everything.
 In
 a
 way,
 if


you
 are
 a
 formula
 one
 driver,


uh
 you
 need
 to
 be
 scared
 about
 something


that
 is
 totally
 crazy,
 but
 in
 a
 way,
 you


are
 a
 little
 bit
 crazy
 because
 you
 would


never
 run
 in
 in
 the
 in
 the
 way
 that


they're
 running.
 But,
 uh
 you
 know,
 the


drivers
 of
 today
 are
 like
 the
 pilots
 of


today.
 Uh
 they
 are
 the
 ones
 that
 know


how
 to
 maximize
 their
 performance
 and


the
 performance
 of
 the
 of
 the
 vehicle


that
 they
 have
 under
 the
 their
 their


body.
 So
 uh
 they
 are
 great
 men.
 I
 mean


there
 are
 only
 20
 in
 the
 world
 and
 uh


everyone
 believes
 ah
 I
 can
 do
 that
 but


when
 you're
 there
 you
 you
 know
 you
 will


understand
 the
 reason
 why
 is
 not


everyone
 ready
 for
 for
 one.
 Uh
 how


important
 is
 physical
 fitness?
 It
 is


important
 no
 doubt
 but
 it's
 not
 like
 in


the
 past
 we
 have
 been
 able
 through
 the


development
 of
 the
 cars
 to
 put
 a
 lot
 of


put
 out
 a
 lot
 of
 limitation
 in
 term
 of


physical
 constraint.
 Therefore,
 if
 you


have
 a
 good
 athlete,
 of
 course,
 there


are
 muscles
 that
 are
 more
 important
 uh


that
 are
 neck
 that
 are
 the
 pressure
 that


you
 can
 apply
 on
 the
 feet.
 But
 for


example,
 today
 on
 the
 on
 the
 steering,


there
 is
 the
 power
 steering.
 It's
 not


anymore
 like
 in
 the
 old
 days
 where
 you


really
 have
 the
 big
 muscle
 or
 when
 you


have
 the
 gearbox
 in
 the
 old
 days
 that


you
 have
 people
 with
 the
 with
 the


blaster
 with
 what
 you
 call
 the
 the
 the


blister
 on
 your
 hands.
 So,
 that's


different.
 But
 uh
 I
 would
 say
 they
 are


all
 today
 great
 athletes
 but
 great


performance
 also
 when
 they
 train
 they


train
 every
 day
 like
 uh
 really
 uh


because
 they
 are
 a
 really
 sportman.
 And


how
 how
 hard
 do
 they
 work?
 They
 work


very
 hard.
 I
 would
 say
 what
 does
 a
 day


look
 like?
 I
 would
 I
 think
 that
 you
 see


what
 is
 different
 from
 the
 old
 days.


Yeah.
 You
 know
 in
 the
 old
 days
 you
 know


they
 were
 sort
 of
 a
 little
 bit
 romantic


approach
 on
 driving.
 uh
 but
 today
 they


are
 the
 morning
 is
 preparing
 themsel
 as


a
 physical
 attitude
 in
 term
 of


preparation
 then
 they
 work
 on
 the


simulator
 then
 they
 work
 with
 the


engineers
 then
 they
 they
 watch
 you
 know


the
 different
 uh
 video
 to
 improve


themsel
 to
 watch
 the
 others
 what
 they


are
 doing
 they
 prepare
 the
 new
 truck
 so


they
 are
 really
 professional
 today


there's
 no
 space
 for
 a
 lot
 of


oldfashioned
 approach
 of
 the
 drivers


where
 you
 know
 like
 a
 sort
 of
 playboy


and
 so
 on
 that
 may
 be
 another
 point
 that


is
 still
 there
 But
 is
 very
 marginal.
 Is


it
 fair
 that
 one
 company
 can
 have


multiple
 teams?
 Uh
 it
 is
 fair
 to
 say


that
 well
 actually
 in
 for
 one
 there
 is


one
 company
 has
 two
 teams
 but
 there
 is
 a


reason
 why
 and
 and
 and
 we
 need
 to
 always


remember
 the
 reason
 why
 and
 we
 need
 to


be
 thankful
 to
 Red
 Bull
 that
 has


invested
 a
 lot
 to
 develop
 the
 sport
 and


we
 need
 to
 recognize
 that.
 Now
 what's


your
 position
 to
 allowing
 new
 teams
 such


as
 Cadillac
 to
 join?
 Well
 my
 position
 is


very
 clear.
 We
 were
 in
 agreement
 to


allow
 one
 more
 team
 to
 to to
 to to
 be


part
 of
 the
 of
 the
 of
 the
 championship


because
 we
 had
 all
 the
 elements
 at
 the


end
 that
 we
 fulfilled
 what
 we
 believe
 is


relatively
 that
 is
 really
 important
 to


have
 in
 term
 of
 credibility
 in
 term
 of


what
 could
 be
 and
 will
 be
 the
 added


value
 to
 the
 sport
 and
 and
 and
 and


Cadillac
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 process


basically
 fulfilled
 this
 this
 criteria.


So
 we
 are
 very
 happy
 that
 now
 they
 will


be
 part
 starting
 from
 next
 year
 to
 be


part
 of
 the
 championship.
 It
 will
 not
 be


easy
 but
 I
 think
 that
 is
 a
 learning


curve
 that
 they
 need
 to
 consider
 but
 I


think
 there
 will
 be
 benefit
 the
 sport.


Now
 you
 have
 a
 regulatory
 body
 the
 uh


FIA
 um
 which
 very
 few
 sports
 have.


What's
 the
 relationship
 between
 the
 FIA


and
 the
 F1?
 Well,
 first
 of
 all,
 the


difference
 between
 our
 sport
 and
 other


sport
 is
 that
 we
 have
 two
 different
 uh


complimentary
 role
 to
 play
 together.


They
 are
 the
 regulator,
 we
 are
 the


commercial
 right
 holder
 in
 together
 we


need
 to
 develop
 the
 shape
 of
 our
 sport.


It
 is
 written
 in
 our
 agreement
 has
 been


done
 many
 many
 years
 ago
 and
 this
 is
 a


fundamental
 things
 that
 we
 need
 to


remember.
 Other
 sport
 have
 one


federation
 and
 they
 running
 everything.


We
 are
 not
 like
 that.
 So
 we
 need
 to
 make


sure
 that
 each
 of
 us
 is
 doing
 the
 right


thing
 for
 the
 benefit
 of
 the
 sport
 and


that's
 for
 sure
 the
 goal
 that
 we
 have


sharing
 you
 know
 despite
 we
 have


different
 people
 uh
 and
 hoping
 that
 our


decision
 are
 done
 for
 the
 best
 of
 our


sport.
 Now
 you're
 already
 at
 the
 max


number
 of
 uh
 of
 races
 you've
 been
 hugely


successful
 in
 developing
 a
 lot
 of


revenue
 streams
 just
 where
 how
 can
 how


how
 do
 you
 intend
 to
 grow
 the
 this
 the


revenues
 from
 here
 the
 sport
 from
 here?


Well,
 I
 remember
 when
 we
 had
 the
 first


earning
 calls
 a
 couple
 of
 years
 ago.
 Uh


because
 we
 are
 a
 public
 company
 as
 you


know.
 Uh
 and
 everyone
 will
 say
 how
 you


can
 do
 it.
 They
 say
 listen
 just
 work


hard
 and
 keep
 understanding
 that
 there


is
 always
 place
 to
 grow.
 If
 you're
 doing


a
 good
 job
 uh
 that's
 the
 way
 we
 are


going.
 I
 mean
 it
 just
 to
 think
 big
 to


understand
 is
 not
 only
 a
 sport
 today
 and


understanding
 that
 we
 have
 of
 course


mainstream
 that
 are
 media
 rights,


sponsorship,
 promoter
 fees
 but
 then
 we


have
 the
 possibility
 to
 go
 deeper
 in
 in


exploiting
 the
 value
 of
 them
 also


through
 the
 the
 access
 to
 the
 data
 of


our
 fans
 and
 that
 will
 enable
 us
 to
 do


another
 step
 in
 term
 of
 growth
 and
 the


business.
 How
 do
 you
 how
 can
 you
 use
 the


data?
 We
 can
 use
 it
 to
 to
 create


personalized
 content
 that
 we
 can
 offer


to
 our
 customer.
 We
 can
 prepare
 special


package
 to
 all
 of
 them.
 They
 are


millions
 around
 the
 world.
 Therefore,


it's
 just
 for
 us
 to
 be
 ready
 to
 do
 it.


And
 the
 more
 the
 system
 is
 solid,
 the


more
 this
 create
 value
 and
 the
 more
 this


value
 will
 be
 bring
 back
 to
 the
 value
 of


of
 the
 asset
 that
 we
 are
 investing
 in.


So
 if
 you
 just
 look
 for
 example
 couple


of
 years
 ago,
 we
 had
 four
 global


partners.
 Now
 we
 have
 uh
 much
 more.
 We


have
 to
 rationalize
 the
 differentiation


between
 global,
 regional,
 technical,


official.
 And
 that's
 a
 quality
 problem


because
 of
 course
 this
 this
 platform
 is


raising
 up
 the
 level
 and
 the
 bar
 because


everything
 is
 pushing
 in
 this
 direction.


So
 um
 the
 drive
 to
 survive
 on
 Netflix,


how
 important
 do
 you
 think
 that's
 been


to
 developing?
 Very
 important.
 Very


important.
 How
 did
 it
 come
 about?
 It


came
 back
 it
 came
 about
 from
 the
 fact


that
 you
 know
 the
 people
 that
 were


previously
 close
 in
 this
 position
 uh


with
 the
 Chase
 Kerry
 you
 know


understanding
 the
 the the
 the
 the


approach
 of
 having
 you
 know
 a
 different


way
 to
 communicate
 with
 the
 people


they're
 coming
 from
 American
 approach


and
 I
 would
 say
 try
 to
 survive
 were
 the


perfect
 example
 to
 that
 came
 also
 at
 the


right
 time
 with
 co
 for
 people
 to
 have


more
 time
 to
 to
 digest
 and
 see
 these


kind
 of
 of
 things
 that
 enable
 us
 to
 open


uh
 h
 new
 markets
 to
 people
 that
 didn't


have
 a
 clue
 who
 we
 were
 and
 therefore


that
 was
 very
 beneficial
 for
 us
 to
 get


into
 new
 dimension
 of
 fans
 and
 it
 was


good
 because
 it
 was
 opening
 the
 eyes
 to


people
 that
 do
 not
 see
 us
 because
 by
 the


way
 our
 drivers
 have
 gloves
 overall


helmets
 cars
 you
 don't
 see
 them.
 Uh
 so


we
 were
 able
 to
 open
 the
 window
 to
 a


different
 way
 of
 explaining
 our
 sport
 to


new
 fans.
 So
 that's
 was
 that
 was
 very


important.
 Not
 only
 that,
 of
 course,


then
 we
 had
 a
 new
 way
 of
 connecting
 with


with
 with
 our
 fans
 through
 social
 media,


much
 more
 open.
 I
 always
 used
 to
 say


that
 we
 are
 very
 inclusive
 in
 our


exclusive
 exclusive
 proposition.
 But


then
 of
 course
 we
 are
 not
 stopping
 what


we
 want
 to
 do.
 I
 mean
 uh
 we're
 going
 to


launch
 the
 movie
 F1
 this
 year.
 That's


another
 way
 to
 be
 on
 a
 different


landscape
 for
 for
 fans
 with
 Brad
 Pitt.


Yes.
 Correct.
 We're
 going
 to
 launch
 it


in
 in
 in
 in
 the
 middle
 of
 June.
 Do
 you


have a
 role
 in
 it?
 Uh,
 no.
 No,
 no,
 no.


I'm
 not
 a
 role.
 The
 the
 jewel
 as
 the


drivers
 and
 and
 and
 of
 course
 the
 the


story
 is
 is
 is
 is
 very
 nice
 and
 the


reason
 why
 we
 choose
 to
 be
 together
 is


because
 it's
 an
 authentic
 project
 uh


with
 a
 serious
 uh
 professional
 and


incredible
 people.
 Apple
 production,


Jerry
 Brookimer,
 Hollywood
 uh
 and
 and


Joe
 Kosinski
 as
 a
 director
 and
 as
 you


know
 it's
 it's
 a
 big
 big
 big
 things
 that


will
 be
 able
 we
 were
 able
 to
 do
 it


during
 the
 course
 of
 racing
 weekend


without
 touching
 the
 live
 sport.
 So
 it's


another
 way
 to
 show
 that
 we
 are


committed
 to
 think
 laterally
 and
 another


way
 to
 to
 say
 to
 commu
 to to
 communicate


with
 other
 people
 is
 for
 example
 you


know
 we
 created
 kids
 TV
 so
 using
 the


same
 kind
 of
 uh
 images
 but
 with
 the


commentators
 that
 are
 kids
 with
 the


graphics
 that
 are
 for
 kids
 music
 for


kids
 just
 to
 be
 relevant
 for
 different


audiences
 that's
 what
 we
 want
 to
 do.


Does
 uh
 drive
 to
 survive
 um
 amplify


rivalries?
 Yes,
 definitely.
 When
 you
 go


to
 the
 personal
 side
 of
 it,
 you
 know,


you
 create
 the
 rivalries
 that
 are
 good


for
 people
 to
 be
 attracted.
 Has
 to
 be


real,
 of
 course,
 but
 that
 definitely.


So,
 but
 is
 it
 real
 or
 are
 you


Absolutely.
 Oh.
 Oh,
 yeah.
 As
 But
 do
 you


think
 it
 exaggerates
 uh
 rivalries?
 To
 be


honest,
 I
 don't
 think
 so.
 Knowing
 the


truth.
 It
 may
 be
 explained
 in
 a


different
 languages,
 but
 the
 rivalry


behind
 the
 scene
 is
 there.
 I
 mean,
 this


is
 a
 sport.
 everyone's
 trying
 to
 compete


as
 at
 his
 best
 and
 certain
 dynamic
 are


part
 of
 our
 world.
 So
 I
 think
 that


overall
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day
 we
 know


that
 the
 context
 of
 that
 is
 also
 if
 I


may
 say


uh
 something
 that
 the
 true
 lovers
 of
 our


sport
 do
 not
 really
 appreciate
 but


that's
 not
 really
 so
 relevant.
 The


relevancy
 is
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 is
 as
 as


authentic
 as
 possible
 and
 then
 relevant


to
 the
 fact
 that
 we
 going
 to
 we
 have


increase
 the
 the
 awareness
 who
 we
 are


around
 the
 world.
 Moving
 on
 to
 uh
 to


leadership.
 So
 running
 Formula
 1
 is
 that


do
 you
 think
 that's
 the
 coolest
 job
 in


Italy
 or
 for
 an
 Italian
 to
 have?
 For


sure
 is
 something
 that
 uh
 there
 would
 be


a
 lot
 of
 people
 queuing
 up
 out
 of
 the


office
 to
 have
 it.
 But
 that's
 not
 my


problem.
 My
 problem
 is
 to
 make
 sure
 that


I
 take
 that
 as
 a
 big
 responsibility.
 I'm


very
 privileged.
 I
 know
 that.
 I'm
 very


proud
 of
 it.
 But
 it's
 not
 given
 for


granted
 because
 it's
 a
 big
 job.
 And
 of


course
 as
 an
 Italian
 that
 I
 was
 able
 to


do
 uh
 I
 would
 say
 almost
 30
 more
 than
 30


years
 in
 the
 world
 of


cars
 with
 Ferrari
 then
 SE
 of
 Lamborghini


then
 be
 here
 in
 for
 one.
 I
 know
 that
 it


seems
 to
 be
 a
 sort
 of
 a
 incredible
 story


but
 it
 is
 what
 it
 is.
 The
 only
 thing
 I


can
 guarantee
 to
 you
 that
 I
 have
 not


lose
 any
 any
 second
 of
 my
 energy
 because


I'm
 the
 first
 time
 I'm
 in
 the
 office.


I'm
 the
 last
 to
 leave.
 I
 travel
 all


around
 the
 world.
 So
 I
 don't
 feel
 that


pain
 at
 all.
 So
 it's
 it's
 a
 privilege.


What
 advantage
 did
 did
 it
 give
 you
 to


have
 been
 the
 sporting
 director
 of


Ferrari?
 kind
 of
 insights
 into
 the


advantage
 is
 that
 you
 know
 the
 mechanism


that
 are
 related
 to
 the
 team
 approach.


You
 know
 the
 ecosystem
 and
 and
 therefore


is
 important
 but
 uh
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the


day
 you
 need
 to
 be
 credible
 and
 reliable


to
 be
 effective
 in
 this
 business
 and
 and


what
 about
 the
 experience
 from


Lamborghini?
 very
 important
 to


understand
 that
 there
 is
 another
 world


not
 only
 on
 the
 motorsport
 side
 of
 it


but
 it
 was
 relevant
 to
 understand
 the


automotive
 industry
 better
 and
 also
 to


understand
 that
 uh
 you
 know
 sometimes
 we


as
 F1
 uh
 believe
 that
 the
 world
 is
 only


connected
 to
 formula
 one
 and
 is
 not
 the


case
 we
 have
 as
 I
 said
 before
 we
 are


very
 privileged
 but
 the
 world
 is
 very


big
 and
 therefore
 that
 experience
 helped


me
 also
 to
 move
 to
 Germany
 before


because
 I
 went
 to
 Audi
 and
 therefore
 for


understanding
 there
 are
 different
 way
 of


working
 different
 way
 of
 relating
 with


people
 that
 for
 me
 was
 relevant
 to


understand
 the
 mechanism
 and
 to
 manage


complexity
 cultural
 complexity
 that
 is


one
 of
 the
 things
 that
 you
 learn
 when


you
 are
 in
 this
 job
 what
 car
 do
 you


drive
 now
 don't
 laugh
 but
 I
 don't
 drive


because
 here
 in
 London
 I've
 got
 a
 I've


got
 a
 good
 driver
 but
 uh
 I
 love
 a


fiaento
 not
 such
 a
 a
 big
 car
 but
 500


right
 absolutely
 yeah
 we
 got
 one
 of


those
 they
 are
 very
 good
 um
 what
 Can
 uh


we
 as
 an
 investment
 organization
 learn


from
 Formula
 1
 you
 think?
 Well,
 I
 think


to
 think
 big
 uh
 you
 know
 investment
 uh


sometimes
 uh
 look
 at
 correctly
 are
 the


parameters
 that
 are
 very
 rational.
 uh
 we


try
 to
 give
 an
 emotional
 side
 of
 of
 of


that
 is
 not
 present
 in
 the
 rational


approach
 that
 I
 believe
 is
 is
 very


relevant
 and
 very
 important
 and
 uh
 I


think
 that
 our
 ecosystem
 is
 is
 quite


transversal
 because
 uh
 you
 know
 we
 have


partners
 that
 belongs
 to
 different
 area


of
 the
 business.
 Therefore
 I
 would
 say


if
 they
 are
 connected
 with
 that
 means


that
 we
 we
 we
 are
 relevant
 for
 them.


That
 means
 that
 in
 term
 of
 bigger


picture
 uh
 is
 there
 a
 way
 that
 we
 can
 in


that
 people
 can
 invest
 on?


What
 about
 what
 about
 the
 way
 you
 use


data?
 So
 not
 not
 necessarily
 for
 the


audience
 and
 so
 but
 just
 for
 the
 the


race
 itself.
 Well
 what
 do
 you
 think
 is


most
 fascinating
 way
 you
 use
 data?
 We


use
 that
 to
 explain
 uh
 the
 performance


of
 the
 car
 in
 a
 basic
 way
 and
 not
 too


complicated.
 That's
 always
 in
 life
 you


know
 the
 only
 way
 to
 be
 to
 be
 attract


attractive
 is
 to
 explain
 in
 an
 easy
 way.


So
 we
 create
 graphics
 from
 data
 analysis


in
 order
 to
 explain
 what
 we're
 doing
 in


order
 to
 give
 the
 chance
 to
 our
 fans
 to


understand
 better.
 That's
 really
 an


incredible
 asset
 that
 we
 are
 already


doing
 and
 we
 we
 need
 to
 improve
 even


stronger
 in
 the
 future.
 When
 you
 look
 at


the
 teams
 um
 what
 do
 the
 best
 teams
 do


differently
 in
 terms
 of
 the
 dynamics
 and


the
 way
 they
 work?
 Well,
 I
 think
 the


best
 teams
 have


a
 logically,
 you
 know,
 without
 getting


into
 the
 financial
 dimension
 of
 it
 are


the
 teams
 that
 have
 the
 best


organization,
 the
 best
 people
 in
 term
 of


quality
 and
 the
 best
 the
 best
 process.


Okay.
 Should
 we
 do
 let's
 do
 those
 three.


So,
 uh
 the
 best
 people,
 what
 what
 does


it
 take
 to
 be
 great
 people
 in
 in
 the


teams
 in
 Formula
 1?
 Well,
 first
 of
 all,


I
 start
 from
 a
 a
 soft
 skill
 approach


that
 has
 to
 be
 you
 have
 to
 have
 people


that
 are
 able
 to
 manage
 pressure.
 The


pressure
 in
 formula
 one
 whatever
 is
 your


level
 is
 huge.
 Can
 you
 imagine
 you
 know


normally
 you
 can
 say
 with
 all
 respect


the
 mechanic
 you
 know
 mechanic
 during


the
 course
 of
 the
 race
 has
 the
 the


responsibility
 of
 changing
 the
 tires
 in


two
 second
 and
 this
 can
 give
 you
 the
 the


the
 the
 win
 or
 the
 lose
 of
 the
 race.
 So


at
 every
 single
 role
 pressure
 management


is
 very
 important.
 Then
 teamwork


approach
 you
 you
 need
 to
 understand


alone
 you
 cannot
 win
 anything.
 You
 need


to
 understand
 what
 is
 you
 know
 your


position
 and
 your
 responsibility
 in
 a


team
 that
 has
 to
 be
 very
 well
 structured


and
 then
 of
 course
 competences
 without


that
 I
 would
 say
 is
 given
 is
 not
 given


for
 granted
 but
 you
 know
 the
 world
 of


for
 one
 is
 very
 specific
 and
 you
 need
 to


know
 the
 business
 very
 well
 no
 matter
 is


your
 role.
 So
 these
 are
 the
 three


elements
 which
 I
 believe
 are
 very
 very


relevant
 and
 of
 course
 you
 need
 to
 love


and
 you
 have
 the
 passion
 of
 this
 job


otherwise
 you
 will
 never
 do
 it.
 How


important
 is
 speed
 not
 on
 the
 track
 but


uh
 speed
 as
 an
 organization?
 Well
 speed


is
 the
 essence
 of
 our
 of
 our
 job
 is
 not


only
 the
 reference
 that
 uh
 you
 know
 you


win
 because
 you
 are
 the
 fastest.
 You
 win


because
 as
 an
 organization
 you
 take
 the


right
 decision
 in
 the
 minimum
 time
 that


is
 required.
 Mhm.
 Speed
 doesn't
 mean


that
 you
 have
 to
 be
 frantic
 or
 or
 active


in
 your
 decision
 process
 making.
 Speed


means
 that
 you
 need
 to
 take
 decision


with
 the
 element
 that
 you
 need
 to
 make


the
 decision.
 Not
 to
 over
 structure


yourself
 in
 actually
 more
 information.


More
 information
 to
 delay
 the
 process
 of


a
 decision.
 So
 this
 is
 what
 I
 believe
 is


the
 essence
 of
 speed.
 Speed
 means
 to
 be


the
 fastest
 with
 the
 elements
 that
 you


need
 to
 make
 a
 decision.
 And
 that's


where
 as
 an
 organization
 we
 need
 to
 you


know
 to
 anticipate
 the
 fact
 that
 the


world
 is
 running
 very
 very
 fast.
 If
 you


do
 just
 reverse
 engineering
 you
 don't


have
 to
 go
 20
 years
 ago
 but
 just
 two


years
 ago
 where
 we
 were
 and
 and
 now
 the


things
 has
 evolved.
 If
 you're
 not
 able


to
 react
 or
 promptly
 anticipate
 the


things
 you're
 out
 of
 the
 business.
 How


do
 you
 make
 sure
 that
 you
 don't
 slow


down
 as
 an
 organization?
 First
 of
 all
 uh


to
 make
 sure
 that
 every
 every
 single


people
 organization
 uh
 is
 in
 record
 mode


to
 understand
 listen
 having
 the
 right


information.
 Secondly
 to
 have
 a
 process


of
 of
 sharing
 and
 and
 keeping
 the
 people


up
 to
 speed
 to
 what
 is
 this
 need
 and


third
 that
 is
 for
 me
 the
 most
 important


thing
 that
 you
 know
 when
 you
 do
 this
 job


is


100%
 full
 speed
 without
 any
 moment
 of


relax
 because
 you
 cannot
 take
 it.


therefore
 is
 a
 very
 intense
 but
 the


intensity
 and
 the
 energetic
 approach


that
 you
 should
 have
 has
 to
 be


transferred
 to
 your
 people
 otherwise


alone
 is
 is
 very
 difficult
 and
 how
 do


you
 do
 that
 how
 do
 you
 transmit
 that


mindset
 with
 the
 with
 example
 and
 how


for
 instance
 what
 um
 you
 know
 the
 first


to
 arrive
 and
 I
 want
 to
 have
 immediately


the
 meeting
 of
 the
 people
 in
 the
 way


that
 I
 want
 and
 if
 I'm
 not
 able
 to
 go


with
 my
 rhythm
 is
 their
 problem
 not
 mine


are
 you
 faster
 now
 than
 you
 were
 uh
 in


the
 past
 faster
 yes
 definitely
 so
 I


think
 that
 with
 the
 experience
 I've


learned
 how
 to
 manage
 the
 speed
 in
 a
 way


that
 I
 know
 how
 when
 I
 need
 to
 use
 the


full
 throttle
 or
 when
 I
 need
 to
 break


that's
 the
 good
 understanding
 of
 a


manager
 that
 needs
 to
 understand
 who
 is


the
 people
 around
 him
 you
 know
 you


cannot
 destroy
 your
 horses
 if
 the
 horses


are
 not
 ready
 for
 that
 so
 it's
 a
 matter


of
 of
 fine-tuning
 and
 having
 the
 right


understanding
 of
 your
 ecosystem
 and


that's
 will
 be
 you
 know
 the
 the
 right


thing
 that
 you
 have
 to
 do
 if
 you
 if
 you


want
 to
 lead
 the
 organization
 for
 a
 long


term
 when
 do
 you


uh
 summer
 time
 the
 only
 slow
 time
 is


when
 we
 have
 a
 you
 know
 two
 weeks
 on


holiday
 in
 August
 and
 two
 weeks
 on


holiday
 in
 Christmas
 time
 and
 that's


that's
 the
 only
 moment
 where
 I
 will
 will


break
 so
 there's
 only
 one
 speed
 that's


full
 speed
 100%
 for
 one
 there's
 no
 doubt


but
 I
 I
 think
 that
 all
 around
 the
 world


if
 you
 want
 to
 be
 a
 protagonist
 of
 what


we
 are
 doing
 there
 is
 only
 full
 speed


when
 you
 look
 at
 society
 are
 you


surprised
 that
 it's
 not
 going
 faster


well
 I'm


surprised
 not
 surprised
 not
 world
 I


think
 that
 today
 as
 a
 normal
 human
 being


I
 would
 love
 to
 see
 more
 quality
 for


people
 that
 are
 managing
 the
 bigger


decision
 of
 the
 world.
 Quality
 means


understanding,
 quality


means
 knowledge,
 quality
 mean
 respect


and
 this
 is
 something
 as
 a
 human
 being
 I


feel
 a
 little
 bit
 the
 bitter
 spirit.
 So,


in
 your
 private


life,
 I
 mean,
 how
 I
 mean,
 if
 I
 were
 to


be
 your
 wife,
 I
 mean,
 mama,
 I'm
 I'm


thanks
 God.
 I'm
 very
 happy
 with
 my
 wife


since
 many,
 many,
 many,
 many
 years.
 I


got
 two
 children.
 I
 think
 it's
 moving


fast
 enough
 at
 home.
 Thanks
 God
 I
 have
 a


wife
 that
 is
 faster
 than
 me.
 So,
 but


that's
 the,
 you
 know,
 that's
 me.
 I
 mean,


I
 I'm
 just
 focused
 out
 of
 the
 business.


I'm
 focused
 on
 my
 family
 and
 with
 my


friends
 that
 are
 the
 same
 since
 I
 was
 in


high
 school.
 So
 that's
 my
 legacy
 with
 my


past
 that
 keep
 me
 with
 the
 feet
 on
 the


ground
 and
 for
 me
 that
 is
 very


important.
 You
 know
 it
 seems
 to
 be
 a


common
 denominator
 with
 Italians.


Friendships
 go
 back
 quite
 far.
 Well
 for


us
 is
 is
 a
 sort
 of
 the
 way
 we
 were


built.
 We
 were
 born
 and
 our
 community
 is


very
 important
 for
 us
 and
 it's
 not
 a


qualitative
 comment.
 is
 a
 fact
 and


therefore
 you
 know
 when
 you
 are
 in
 this


position
 you
 can
 be
 taken
 away
 because


you
 meet
 all
 the
 most
 important
 people


of
 the
 world
 but
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day


when
 you
 are
 alone
 uh
 in
 front
 of
 the


mirror
 you
 are
 yourself
 and
 therefore


for
 me
 to
 be
 like
 this
 I
 need
 to
 go
 back


to
 my
 normal
 life
 that
 is
 what
 I
 told


you
 and
 that's
 it
 how
 do
 you
 prioritize


well
 priorities
 in
 term
 of
 of of
 of
 of


time
 I
 know
 that
 uh
 you
 know
 during
 my


work
 day
 in
 the
 priority
 is
 the
 business


but
 when
 I'm
 At
 home,
 I
 want
 to
 give


quality
 time
 to
 my
 my
 kids,
 kids
 already


bigger,
 but
 the
 kids
 and
 my
 wife


10,000%.
 And
 in
 at
 work,
 how
 do
 you


prioritize?
 You
 come
 in,
 you
 come
 in
 in


the
 morning,
 how
 do
 you
 prioritize
 what


to
 do?
 I
 Well,
 depends.
 Because
 you
 know


what?
 I
 I've
 been
 thinking
 a
 lot
 about


it.
 And
 I
 think
 we
 just
 are
 too
 bad
 at


prioritizing
 what's
 important.
 Well,
 the


priority
 is
 the
 is
 is
 what
 makes
 the
 you


efficient
 and
 effective
 because


unfortunately
 when
 you
 go
 you
 have
 so


many
 things
 to
 do,
 then
 you
 need
 to


understand
 what
 are
 the
 priority
 you


need
 to
 bring
 home.
 strategic,
 tactical


and
 therefore
 is
 a
 matter
 of
 I'm
 I'm
 not


doing
 that
 in
 the
 morning.
 I
 mean
 in
 the


morning
 I'm
 already
 on
 action
 mode.
 what


I
 need
 to
 do
 is
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 I


prioritarize
 you
 know
 in
 a
 different
 way


uh
 long-term
 medium-term
 weekly
 term
 and


and
 and
 and
 I
 I
 have
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 I


have
 a
 clear
 understanding
 what
 I
 need


to
 bring
 home
 what
 I'm
 doing
 to
 myself


and
 this
 is
 something
 that
 I
 use
 for
 me


to
 be
 effective
 is
 every
 evening
 I
 count


the
 the
 decision
 that
 I've


taken
 is
 enough
 or
 not
 enough
 is
 not
 a


number
 but
 let's
 say
 Did
 I
 take
 decision


today?
 In
 my
 position,
 in
 our
 position,


every
 day
 you
 need
 to
 take
 decision.
 If


you're
 not
 taking
 decision
 means
 that
 uh


either
 you
 know
 people
 have
 done
 your


job
 better,
 that
 is
 good
 in
 a
 way
 maybe,


I
 don't
 know,
 but
 otherwise
 you
 are
 not


performing
 the
 way
 that
 you
 should.
 How


has
 your
 decision-
 making
 changed?
 The


decision
 making
 has
 changed
 of
 course


with
 the
 experience
 uh
 with
 the
 fact


that
 now
 hopefully
 I
 am
 a
 little
 more


mature
 not
 to
 make
 mistakes
 even
 if
 I


put
 in
 the
 process
 of
 what
 we're
 doing


also
 mistakes
 it's
 part
 of
 our
 life
 you


know
 it's
 it's
 a
 by
 the
 way
 also
 here
 we


have
 a
 different
 cultural
 approach
 if


you
 take
 the
 example
 of
 our
 you
 know


approach
 as
 an
 Italian
 mistake
 has
 been


always
 seen
 as
 oh
 my
 god
 you
 cannot
 fail


otherwise
 it's
 a
 disaster
 you
 go
 with


the
 American
 mentality
 the
 American


mentality
 failure
 if
 you
 don't
 fail
 you


are
 no
 one.
 Therefore,
 how
 you
 can
 mix


that
 is
 is
 is
 is
 relevant
 or
 how
 do
 you


and
 how
 do
 you
 mix
 that
 and
 how
 do
 you


mix
 that?
 I
 think
 that
 it's
 just
 a


matter
 of
 understanding
 the
 the


magnitude
 of
 the
 mistake
 that
 you're


doing
 and
 try
 to
 if
 if
 you
 feel
 that


you've
 done
 a
 mistake
 how
 you
 can


rectify
 it
 as
 simple
 as
 that.
 Very


simple.
 I
 don't
 have
 to
 over
 complicate


it.
 If
 I
 feel
 that
 we
 and
 I
 always
 say


we
 because
 is
 not
 being
 a
 response
 for


an
 organization.
 If
 some
 of
 my
 people


are
 doing
 a
 mistake
 is
 my
 fault.
 Uh
 I


think
 that
 the
 only
 thing
 to
 do
 is
 to


rectify
 it.
 If
 we
 see
 people
 not


understanding
 that
 then
 it's
 a
 matter


for
 me
 to
 change
 it.
 Tell
 me
 a
 mistake


you
 made
 this
 year.
 This
 year
 so
 far
 no


one.
 That's
 good.
 Very
 straightforward.


So
 far
 I
 think
 that
 I
 was
 managing
 quite


well
 the
 things
 last
 year.
 Last
 year
 I


got
 two
 mistakes.
 One
 I
 cannot
 tell
 you.


Uh
 one
 is
 uh
 related
 to
 a
 process
 that


uh
 I
 didn't
 feel
 completely
 done
 in
 the


proper
 way
 for
 an
 assignment
 here
 in
 the


organization.
 How
 much
 time
 do
 you
 spend


on
 debriefs
 every
 week
 after
 after
 is
 a


part
 of
 my
 process
 of
 approach
 I
 mean


every
 every


every
 event
 there
 has
 to
 be
 a
 debrief


that's
 what
 form


one
 teach
 you
 there
 is
 is
 a
 proper


debriefing
 of
 the
 event
 in
 our
 case


where
 everyone
 has
 to
 go
 through
 a


checklist
 of
 understanding
 if
 we
 have


done
 the
 right
 thing
 or
 or
 what
 we
 have


done
 wrongly
 and
 what
 is
 the
 things
 that


we
 need
 to
 rectify.
 How
 do
 you
 make
 sure


that
 there
 is
 a
 good
 feedback
 system


that
 people
 tell
 you
 the
 truth?
 Well,


there
 is
 for
 sure
 a
 process
 of
 sharing


information
 in
 term
 of
 truth.
 It's
 a


it's
 a
 way
 that
 you
 build
 your
 strength


knowing
 the
 different
 channel.
 Uh
 you


need
 to
 know
 or
 you
 you you
 should
 try


to
 know
 all
 what
 is
 around
 you
 and
 use


this
 information
 at
 the
 right
 moment.
 So


once
 again
 is
 a
 matter
 of
 uh
 deeply


understanding
 who
 you
 can
 really
 rely


100%
 who
 50%
 who
 30%
 and
 and
 make
 sure


that
 you
 have
 the
 ecosystem
 under


control
 that
 is
 relevant
 for
 sure.
 So


talking
 about
 the
 ecosystem
 what's


what's
 the
 the
 the
 most
 complex
 part
 of


your
 job
 to
 get
 right.
 Well
 the
 most


complex
 part
 of
 my
 job
 I
 do
 believe
 is


to
 make
 sure
 that
 uh
 you
 know
 this
 job


is
 divided
 in
 a
 lot
 of
 different
 area.


Yeah.
 There
 is
 one
 error
 related
 to
 the


relation
 with
 the
 with
 the
 broadcaster,


one
 error
 related
 to
 with
 the
 promoters,


one
 error
 related
 with
 the
 teams,
 one


error
 related
 with
 the
 FIA.
 Most


importantly
 is
 my
 job
 is
 to
 make
 sure


that
 our
 organization
 is
 running


smoothly.
 So
 the
 complexity
 in
 all
 these


kind
 of
 things
 is
 to
 manage
 the
 quality


of
 the
 people
 that
 are
 working.
 This
 is


my
 organization.
 Secondly
 is
 to
 manage


the
 the
 different
 relation
 that
 they


have
 to
 have
 in
 the
 different
 context


that
 are
 quite
 complicated.
 So
 I
 cannot


say
 there
 is
 only
 one
 it's
 multiple
 but


the
 approach
 is
 always
 the
 same.
 Try
 to


understand
 try
 to
 listen
 try
 to


understand
 if
 uh
 there
 is
 something


behind
 uh
 that
 I
 I
 need
 to
 understand


when
 we
 are
 talking
 about
 certain
 things


and
 make
 a
 judgment.
 What
 more
 do
 you


want
 to
 accomplish
 at
 Formula
 1?
 I
 think


that
 I
 want
 to
 two
 things.
 one
 to
 keep


the
 re
 relevancy
 of
 what
 we're
 doing
 in


a
 much
 solid
 foundation
 create
 even
 a


stronger
 team
 that
 we
 can
 take
 you
 know


this
 business
 stronger
 in
 the
 future


because
 I
 I
 have
 a
 I've
 taken
 a
 committ


of
 more
 years
 and
 I
 will
 do
 with
 full


dedication
 but
 uh
 one
 of
 the
 legacies
 I


want
 to
 keep
 is
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 what


we
 are
 doing
 now
 will
 stay
 for
 a
 long


time
 even
 after
 um
 a
 couple
 of
 personal


things
 what
 do
 you
 you
 mentioned
 you


were
 the
 first
 one
 at
 at
 work
 in
 the


morning.
 When
 do
 you
 wake
 up?
 I
 wake
 up


at
 5:30.
 5:30.
 What
 do
 you
 What
 do
 you


do
 then?
 I
 run
 every
 day.
 I
 Yeah.
 If


it's
 not
 ugly
 weather,
 yes.
 I
 go
 around


to
 around
 8
 kilometers,
 10
 kilometers


per
 day.
 It's
 the
 only
 time
 that
 I
 have


free
 so
 I
 can
 listen
 the
 music
 because
 I


love
 music
 and
 I'm
 trying
 to
 think
 what


I
 I
 should
 do
 during
 the
 day
 and
 then
 I


come
 back
 in
 the
 work
 here
 and
 then
 um


and
 then
 I
 I
 go
 back
 home
 if
 I'm
 not


around
 the
 world
 because
 I
 tell
 you
 my


schedule.
 Maybe
 you
 don't
 believe
 it,


but
 uh
 I
 believe
 it.
 If
 I
 tell
 you
 what


I
 did
 in
 the
 last
 months,
 you
 you
 cannot


believe
 it.
 So,
 I
 go
 back
 around
 8
 to


have
 dinner
 with
 my
 wife.
 Yeah.
 And
 see


my
 our
 kids.
 And
 when
 you
 when
 you
 run,


what
 kind
 of
 music
 do
 you
 listen
 to?


Well,
 I
 normally
 listen
 to
 Italian
 music


and
 and
 pop
 music.
 Right.
 Do
 you
 get
 any


time
 to
 read?
 Uh
 not
 a
 lot.
 I
 because


normally
 I
 read
 when
 I'm
 on
 the
 plane
 to


try
 to
 to
 to
 to
 have
 a
 strategic
 time


for
 me
 because
 normally
 when
 I'm
 doing


you
 know
 daily
 job
 you
 know
 here
 is


always
 meeting
 meetings
 meet meetings


meet meetings.
 So
 I
 I
 take
 the
 time
 to


think
 strategically.
 So,
 uh,
 I
 I
 I
 was


reading
 more,
 you
 know,
 the
 history
 of


Rome,
 history
 of
 because
 I
 I
 love


history
 and
 the
 second
 world
 because
 I


I'm
 fascinated
 about
 these
 kind
 of


things.
 But
 today,
 um,
 you
 know,
 I
 take


more
 time
 when
 I
 have
 free
 time
 honestly


to
 to
 to
 to
 think
 strategically.
 And


Stephan,
 we
 got
 um
 um
 t
 tens
 of


thousands
 of
 young
 people
 listening
 to


this
 and
 uh
 of
 course
 more
 probably
 more


more
 young
 people
 than
 normal
 and
 uh


perhaps
 even
 more
 female
 listeners
 than


we
 normally
 have.
 What
 is
 your
 advice
 to


young
 people?
 Well,
 first
 of
 all,
 I'm


not
 a
 professor.
 I'm
 not
 a
 teacher.
 I


just
 really
 can
 share
 what
 uh
 what
 I


believe
 is
 important
 that
 I
 live
 in
 my


own.
 I
 mean
 when
 you're
 young
 you
 need


to
 think
 and
 and
 I
 think
 that
 uh
 you


need
 to
 think
 that
 uh
 things
 in
 the


future
 are
 becoming
 opportunities
 and


the
 opportunities
 instead
 of
 being


opportunities
 the
 dreams
 will
 be
 seen
 as


problems
 when
 you're
 getting
 older.
 So


stay
 focused
 on
 be
 younger
 to
 think
 that


to
 think
 big
 to
 think
 that
 you
 need
 to


be
 to
 believe
 in
 yourself
 not
 to
 give
 up


stay
 focused
 and
 and
 work
 hard.
 work


hard
 means
 uh
 you
 you
 need
 to
 stay


dedicated
 to
 what
 you
 love
 and
 and


knowing
 that
 the
 competition
 is
 very


tight
 and
 very
 I
 would
 say
 stronger


today
 because
 it's
 more
 transversal
 more


international
 but
 if
 you
 believe
 in


yourself
 there's
 no
 reason
 why
 you


shouldn't
 do
 it
 so
 really
 believe
 in


yourself
 being
 humble
 listen
 try
 to


understand
 and
 to
 learn
 from
 everyone
 is


around
 you
 this
 would
 be
 my
 basic
 uh
 I


would
 say
 advice
 M
 as
 a
 60
 years
 man


that
 has
 been
 in
 for
 one
 and
 in
 this
 job


that
 is
 getting
 older.
 No
 let's
 say
 one


year
 in
 for
 one
 is
 around
 10
 years
 of
 a


normal
 life.
 So
 that's
 what
 I'm
 saying


as
 a
 shared
 shared
 experience
 with
 with


our
 friends
 that
 listen
 to
 us.
 Very


good.
 Well
 you
 for
 sure
 uh
 exemplify
 uh


all
 the
 all
 the
 qualities
 you
 mentioned


here
 in
 terms
 of
 uh
 working
 hard,


thinking
 big
 and
 moving
 very
 fast.
 Yes.


Really
 great
 talking
 to
 you.
 Big
 thanks.


Thank
 you
 Nico.
 Thanks.
 Congratulations.


Very
 good.
 Thank
 you.
