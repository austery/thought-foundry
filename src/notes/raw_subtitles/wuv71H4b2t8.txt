we
 have
 something
 in
 uh
 Norway
 called


the
 spending
 rule
 hling
 reg
 which
 you


first
 as
 a
 brilliant
 student
 of


Economics
 uh
 worked
 on
 then
 as
 a


minister
 of
 finance
 and
 the
 Prime


Minister
 and
 so
 on
 and
 it's
 a
 rule
 which


tells
 how
 much
 of
 the
 Norwegian
 sov


wealth
 fund
 can
 be
 spent
 every
 year
 to


support
 the
 budget
 and
 it's
 really
 been


a
 Cornerstone
 in
 the
 economic
 planning


in
 this
 country
 now
 what
 what
 inspire


you
 to
 create
 this
 rule
 it
 was
 the


understanding
 that


Norway
 was
 going
 to
 get
 a
 lot
 of


revenues
 from
 the
 oil
 and
 gas
 and
 much


bigger
 revenues
 than
 we


expected
 um
 um
 and
 therefore
 when
 I
 was


prime
 minister
 in
 2000
 uh
 then
 we


actually
 had
 only
 net
 oil
 revenues
 only


for
 a
 few
 years
 the
 first
 net
 oil


revenues
 came
 to
 Norway
 in
 1996
 in
 the


beginning
 they
 were
 quite
 small
 uh
 then


it
 was
 obvious
 that
 we
 needed
 we
 needed


some
 way


of
 uh
 deciding
 how
 much
 we
 could
 spend


and
 we
 were
 very
 afraid
 of
 uh
 what
 we


referred
 to
 as
 Dutch
 disease
 uh
 to
 spend


too
 much
 um
 and
 therefore
 we
 started


partly
 in
 the
 kind
 of
 academic
 but
 also


then
 a
 political
 discussion
 on
 how
 to


establish
 a
 fiscal
 rule
 for
 how
 much
 of


the
 oil
 revenues
 we
 could
 spend
 and
 the


purpose
 was
 actually
 twofold
 one
 was
 to


ensure
 that
 uh
 not
 only
 Our
 Generation


but
 also
 future


Generations
 get
 the
 benefit
 uh
 of
 the


oil
 and
 gas
 resources
 that
 we
 have
 found


on
 thean
 Al
 shelf
 uh
 that's
 kind
 of


long-term
 perspective
 the
 other
 reason


to
 uh
 establish
 the
 fiscal
 Rule
 and
 the


and
 the
 pension
 fund
 um
 was
 to
 ensure


that
 we
 could
 uh
 stabilize
 theion


economy
 to
 separate
 earnings
 from


spending
 and
 prevent
 overheating
 of
 the


uh
 economy
 and
 therefore
 we
 we


established
 a
 pension
 fund
 and
 the
 first


money
 was
 allocated
 to
 the
 pension
 fund


in
 96
 but
 perhaps
 as
 important
 was
 this


fiscal
 rule
 where
 we
 decided
 that
 all


the
 oil
 and
 gas
 revenues
 uh
 was
 going
 to


go
 into
 norian
 pension
 fund
 and
 then


that
 the
 only
 thing
 we're
 going
 to
 spend


was
 the
 financial
 return
 uh
 which
 we


estimate
 to
 3%
 in
 yield
 terms
 per
 year


as
 as
 an
 average
 and
 therefore
 the


fiscal
 R
 says
 that
 we
 should
 only
 uh


spend
 on
 average
 uh
 the
 fiscal
 uh
 return


3%
 estimated
 um
 uh
 and
 um


and
 that
 has
 served
 Norway
 very
 well


it's
 Quite
 a
 feat
 to
 manage
 to
 get
 um


political
 consensus
 around
 the
 spending


of
 such
 vast


resources
 uh
 and
 probably
 one
 of
 the


successes
 of
 uh
 well
 one
 of
 the
 main


successes
 of
 the
 fund
 uh
 has
 it
 worked


the
 way
 you
 thought
 yes
 and
 if
 anything


it
 worked
 even
 better
 uh
 um
 U
 because
 uh


partly
 because
 the
 fund
 has
 become
 much


bigger
 than
 we
 expected
 for
 many
 reasons


oil
 and
 gas
 production
 at
 noran
 on
 Shelf


has
 been
 bigger
 prices
 have
 been
 higher


and
 we
 also
 have
 good
 Investments


because
 of
 people
 like
 like
 you
 have


been
 able
 to
 manage
 the
 fund
 in
 a
 very


good
 way
 so
 the
 combination
 of
 all
 these


things
 have
 made
 the
 fund
 much
 bigger


and
 therefore
 also
 the
 fiscal
 rule
 more


important
 if
 you
 had
 at
 the
 time
 when


the
 fiscal
 rule
 was
 made
 had
 also
 made
 a


rule
 for
 how
 much
 uh
 in
 total
 could
 the


fund
 contribute
 to
 in
 percent
 of
 the


budget
 what
 do
 you
 think
 that
 percentage


would
 have
 been
 I
 think
 it
 would
 have


been
 lower
 than
 the
 current
 percent


which
 I
 think
 is


now
 yeah
 25%
 or
 roughly
 almost
 one
 one


quarter
 of
 the
 norian
 state
 expenditure


or
 state
 budget
 is
 financed
 by
 the


return
 from
 the
 oil
 fund
 or
 from
 so


instead
 of
 25
 what
 do
 you
 think
 he
 would


have
 been
 if
 you
 I
 am
 not
 able
 I
 know


but
 but
 but
 but
 but
 then
 I
 think
 it's


important
 in
 way
 as
 I'm
 not
 able
 to
 give


you
 an
 exact
 number
 but
 I
 think
 it's


also
 important
 to
 understand
 that
 there


are
 concerns
 and
 I'm
 careful
 be
 going


too
 much
 into
 that
 debate
 because
 that's


a
 very
 Norwegian
 debate
 and
 I
 and
 I'm


careful
 being
 too
 specific
 on
 issues
 I


not
 worked
 so
 close
 with
 over
 the
 last


years
 but
 but
 I
 think
 the
 idea
 back
 in


2000
 when
 we
 made
 the
 fiscal
 rule
 was
 in


a
 way
 that
 this
 was
 going
 to
 it
 could


last
 forever
 because
 in
 one
 way
 NATO
 has


sorry
 Norway
 has
 spent
 zero
 of
 the
 oil


uh
 revenues
 the
 only
 thing
 we
 have
 spent


is
 the
 fiscal
 return
 on
 the
 oil
 revenues


and
 um
 and
 and
 of
 course
 that
 can
 last


forever
 uh
 as
 long
 as
 we
 have
 the


installment
 the
 The
 Challenge
 and
 you


know
 that
 better
 than
 anyone
 one
 else
 is


that
 of
 course
 we
 now
 have
 so
 much
 our


wealth
 in
 the
 stock
 market
 then
 of


course
 there
 can
 be
 big
 fluctuations
 uh


that
 can
 have
 a
 impact
 on
 the
 Norwegian


economy
 and
 that's
 a
 new
 risk
 which
 we


didn't
 face
 at
 least
 not
 in
 the
 same
 way


uh
 uh
 before
 um
 uh
 so
 and
 and
 I'm
 always


a
 bit


careful
 um
 uh
 changing
 these
 kind
 of


fiscal
 rules
 to
 offer


because
 that
 will
 undermine
 The


credibility
 uh
 perhaps
 it's
 better
 to


have
 an
 imperfect
 rule
 which
 is
 credible


than
 to
 always
 try
 to
 uh
 run
 for
 a
 more


perfect
 rule
 but
 which
 is
 um
 constantly


changed
 that
 will
 because
 this
 is
 this


is
 a
 self-imposed
 restriction
 and
 the


biggest
 success
 in
 a
 way
 is
 that
 a


Democratic
 Society
 as
 Norway
 has
 been


able
 to
 handle
 this
 enormous
 amount
 of


cash
 without
 spending
 it
 m
 uh
 uh
 I


remember
 back
 in
 the
 1990s
 when
 we
 uh


had
 this
 discussion
 and
 started
 to


invest
 in
 in
 equities
 and
 and
 had
 the


first
 allocation
 to
 the
 pension
 fund


many
 experts
 also
 economists
 colleagues


of
 mine
 said
 this
 cannot
 happen
 the
 the


the
 Democratic
 institutions
 politicians


they
 will
 spend
 if
 they
 get
 the
 money


they
 will
 spend
 so
 they
 were
 actually
 in


favor
 of
 reducing
 the
 oil
 and
 gas


production
 to
 keep
 the
 wealth
 uh
 in
 the


continental
 shelf
 um
 and
 they
 actually


for
 former
 Governor
 norian
 Central
 Bank


bank
 har
 scan
 he
 led
 an
 expert
 group
 and


they


said
 it
 cannot
 work
 politician
 will


spend
 if
 they
 get
 the
 money
 we
 have


proven
 them
 wrong
 and
 that's
 the
 biggest


success
 and
 but
 but
 again
 if
 you
 start


to
 change
 these
 rules
 too
 often
 you
 may


undermine
 in
 a
 way
 the
 the
 magic
 of
 the


Line
 in
 the
 Sand
 which
 is
 which
 is
 the


the
 fiscal
 rle
 I
 think
 we
 can
 say
 Well


done
 norian
 politicians
 and
 well
 done


the
 Minister
 of
 Finance
 and
 the


management
 and
 the
 the
 the
 and
 B
 and
 all


also
 have
 been
 IR
 responsible
