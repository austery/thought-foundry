I'm
 Christine
 Sir
 Cleette.
 I'm
 Kyra


Blackwell.
 I'm
 Rosie
 Garren.
 And
 you're


listening
 to
 the
 Wire
 Cutter
 Show.


[Music]


Hey
 y'all,
 it's
 Kyra.
 A
 few
 days
 ago,
 we


released
 an
 episode
 with
 actor,
 writer,


and
 woodworker,
 the
 famous
 Nick


Offerman.
 It
 really
 is
 a
 fantastic


conversation
 and
 if
 you
 haven't
 listened


to
 it
 yet,
 you
 should
 definitely
 go
 find


it.
 We
 talked
 with
 Nick
 about
 the
 tools


he
 likes
 and
 the
 woodworking
 projects
 he


thinks
 are
 good
 to
 start
 with,


especially
 with
 kids.
 But
 here
 at
 Wire


Cutter,
 our
 tool
 expertise
 goes
 way


beyond
 just
 woodworking.
 We
 have
 a
 team


of
 home
 improvement
 writers
 who
 cover


everything
 from
 power
 tools
 to
 simple


hand
 tools
 to
 the
 best
 way
 to
 store


tools.
 So,
 in
 light
 of
 our
 episode
 with


Nick
 Offerman,
 we
 thought
 it'd
 be


helpful
 to
 bring
 you
 some
 more
 in-depth


information
 on
 how
 to
 build
 a
 basic


toolbox.
 Whether
 you're
 starting
 from


scratch
 or
 a
 couple
 steps
 above
 scratch,


today
 we'll
 chat
 with
 senior
 staff


writer
 Doug
 Mahoney.
 Doug
 has
 joined
 us


on
 the
 podcast
 many
 times
 before
 to
 chat


about
 everything
 from
 fire
 safety
 to


pest
 control,
 and
 he's
 also
 been
 using


tools
 professionally
 and
 writing
 about


them
 for
 years.


In
 a
 minute,
 Doug
 tells
 us
 what
 tools


you
 really
 need
 to
 start
 being
 handy,


what
 you
 can
 expect
 to
 spend,
 and
 what


you
 don't
 need
 to
 invest
 in
 as
 a


beginner.


Be
 right
 back.


[Music]


[Music]


Welcome
 back.
 With
 us
 now
 is
 Doug


Mahoney,
 who
 is
 a
 senior
 staff
 writer
 on


the
 home
 improvement
 team
 who


specializes
 in
 hand
 tools
 and
 power


tools.
 He
 also
 covers
 home
 improvement


topics,
 outdoor
 power
 equipment,
 and


pest
 control,
 which
 y'all
 probably


already
 know.
 And
 Doug
 owns
 a
 hobby
 farm


in
 the
 woods
 of
 New
 Hampshire
 where
 he's


constantly
 fixing
 up
 something
 in
 his


own
 home.
 Doug,
 welcome
 back.


>> Hi.
 How
 is
 everybody?


>> We're
 great.
 And
 we're
 so
 happy
 to
 have


you
 back.
 So
 Doug,
 you
 are
 someone
 that


I
 think
 anyone
 would
 consider
 a
 classic


handyman.
 Um,
 I
 hope
 you
 weren't


offended
 by
 that
 term,
 but


>> I'm
 not.


>> You
 know,
 you've
 remodeled
 your
 home,


you've
 worked
 as
 a
 carpenter,
 you
 review


tools
 for
 a
 living,
 but
 the
 level
 of


handiness
 that
 you
 have
 achieved
 is


beyond
 what
 most
 listeners
 would


probably
 feel
 comfortable
 with.
 Tell
 us


why
 you
 think
 most
 people
 listening
 to


this
 should
 become
 handier
 in
 their
 own


home.


>> For
 one,
 obviously,
 it
 saves
 you
 money.


It's
 also
 it's
 empowering.
 It
 sort
 of


shifts
 your
 relationship
 with
 your
 home.


you
 start
 to
 see
 your
 home
 as
 something


that
 you
 can
 really
 kind
 of
 adapt
 to


your
 needs.
 It's
 not
 sort
 of
 a
 static


thing
 anymore.
 And
 you
 also
 you
 don't


have
 to
 rely
 on
 other
 people
 to
 fix


things.
 Like
 say
 if
 there's
 a
 plumbing


issue
 with
 your
 faucet,
 you
 may
 have
 to


wait
 a
 few
 days
 or
 a
 week
 for
 a
 plumber


to
 show
 up.
 Whereas
 if
 uh
 you
 have,
 you


know,
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 knowhow
 and


confidence
 to
 do
 it,
 you
 can
 just
 dive


right
 in
 and
 speed
 the
 timet
 up.
 So,


even
 if
 somebody
 doesn't
 consider


themselves
 super
 handy,
 what
 are
 the


types
 of
 things
 anyone
 can
 do
 with
 a


really
 basic
 toolkit?


>> Well,
 first,
 I
 mean,
 you
 can
 start
 just


uh
 if
 you're
 really
 starting
 with
 no


knowledge
 as
 far
 as
 any
 of
 this
 stuff,
 I


think
 painting
 a
 room
 is
 a
 great
 place


to
 start.
 It
 starts
 to
 kind
 of
 shift


>> how
 you
 look
 at
 your
 house.
 You


obviously
 every
 house
 has
 like
 loose


wobbly
 hinges
 or
 handles,
 things
 like


that
 you
 can
 tighten.
 Another
 pretty


interesting
 thing,
 you
 could
 just
 swap


out
 the
 hardware
 on
 your
 kitchen


cabinets,
 which
 is
 a,
 you
 know,
 very


simple
 process,
 but
 it
 can
 really
 change


the
 look
 of
 your
 kitchen.


>> What
 if
 somebody
 has
 zero
 tools
 in
 their


home
 right
 now?
 Where
 should
 they
 even


start?


>> What
 I
 tell
 people
 is
 they're
 sort
 of


like,
 it's
 almost
 like
 this
 trifecta
 of


tools
 to
 start
 with.
 A
 screwdriver
 is
 a


great
 starting
 tool,
 a
 hammer,
 and
 a


tape
 measure.
 Those
 are
 three
 pretty


essential
 tools
 that
 you
 can
 really
 do
 a


lot
 of
 little
 things
 in
 your
 house
 with.


You
 can
 tighten
 hinges.
 You
 can
 hang


pictures.


>> Okay.
 I
 have
 two
 out
 of
 three
 of
 those,


I
 think.
 What
 about
 um
 like
 a
 pre-made


kit?
 I've
 seen
 a
 lot
 of
 those
 at
 like


Home
 Depot.


>> Yeah,
 the
 pre-made
 kits,
 they're
 okay.


They're
 they're
 very
 very
 limited
 as
 far


as
 I'm
 concerned.
 They
 cost
 more
 than


what
 they're
 worth.
 They
 usually
 seem
 to


be
 about
 $40
 or
 so.
 I
 think
 they're


probably
 worth
 more
 like
 20.
 They
 are


pretty
 poor
 quality
 tools.
 To
 me,


they're
 perfect
 for
 if
 like
 you're


sending
 a
 a
 kid
 off
 to
 college
 and
 you


want
 them
 to
 just
 have
 something.
 It's
 a


place
 to
 potentially
 start,
 but
 I
 think


that
 if
 you're
 approaching
 this
 work


with
 any
 seriousness,
 you're
 going
 to


bump
 up
 against
 the
 limitations
 of
 those


tools
 very,
 very
 quickly.
 So,
 I
 think


that
 I
 would
 just
 recommend
 getting
 the


individual
 tools.
 Get
 yourself
 a
 nice


screwdriver,
 a
 nice
 hammer,
 nice
 tape


measure,
 good
 utility
 knife,
 pliers,


things
 like
 that.


[Music]


Doug,
 if
 I'm
 standing
 in
 Home
 Depot
 in


front
 of
 a
 wall
 of
 hand
 tools,
 it
 can
 be


overwhelming
 to
 know
 which
 ones
 to
 buy.


What
 is
 the
 difference
 between,
 for


instance,
 a
 mediocre
 hammer
 or
 a


screwdriver
 and
 really
 good
 ones?
 Why


would
 you
 want
 to
 spend
 more
 for
 hand


tools
 versus
 getting
 the
 cheaper
 thing?


>> Yeah.
 So,
 the
 thing
 with
 tools
 is
 that


the
 cheapest
 thing
 usually
 does
 still


work,
 but
 it's
 just
 not
 going
 to
 be
 a


very
 good
 experience.
 A
 better
 tool,


you're
 going
 to
 notice
 it's
 just
 feels


better
 in
 the
 hand.
 The
 grip
 is
 going
 to


be
 much
 better.
 The
 overall
 design
 will


be
 better.
 Like,
 like
 a
 really
 nice
 set


of
 wire
 cutters
 will
 cut
 with
 much
 more


power
 than
 a
 cheaper
 set.
 The
 jaws
 might


be
 designed
 differently
 to
 give
 a


cleaner
 cut.
 Things
 like
 screwdrivers


are
 going to
 be
 made
 of
 much
 better


steel
 so
 they
 don't
 become
 mush
 and


become
 unusable.
 So,
 it's
 just
 going
 to


make
 your
 work
 a
 lot
 easier
 and
 it's


definitely
 more
 of
 an
 investment.
 You


know,
 you'll
 probably
 be
 paying
 anywhere


from
 15
 up
 to
 say
 $30
 per
 tool
 if
 you're


buying
 the
 tools
 individually,
 but


they're
 going
 to
 turn
 into
 lifetime


tools.
 I
 think
 it's
 worth
 leveling
 up
 to


the
 good
 stuff.


>> So,
 once
 someone
 has
 the
 core
 tools,


what
 other
 tools
 would
 you
 recommend


they
 consider
 adding
 over
 time?
 So,
 if


you're
 doing
 this
 ad
 hoc,
 what
 are
 you


adding
 to
 your
 collection
 as
 you
 move


forward?


>> Once
 you
 have
 those
 basics,
 I
 would
 then


sort
 of
 move
 on
 to
 the
 plier
 wrench


category.
 So,
 adjustable
 pliers,


adjustable
 wrench,
 those
 are
 great
 for,


you
 know,
 adjusting
 bike
 seats
 and


tightening
 faucet.
 They're
 obviously


they're
 very
 good
 um
 plumbing
 tools.


Then
 you
 have
 locking
 pliers,
 which
 are


vice
 grips.
 Stud
 finder,
 that's
 a
 pretty


basic
 one,
 especially
 if
 you're
 hanging


like
 a
 heavy
 mirror
 on
 the
 wall,
 things


like
 that.
 Okay,
 so
 level
 stud
 finder


could
 be
 potentially
 helpful.
 What
 else?


>> Allen
 wrenches
 are
 good.
 They're
 another


one
 used,
 especially
 if
 you
 have
 kids


who
 have
 bikes.
 Seems
 like
 half
 the


adjustments
 on
 bikes
 are
 with
 Allen


wrenches.
 I
 think
 a
 headlamp
 is
 is


really
 good,
 especially
 if
 you
 have
 a


basement,
 if
 you
 have
 a
 nasty
 crawl


space
 like
 I
 do.
 Headlamps
 are
 pretty


helpful
 to
 be
 able
 to
 work
 hands-free


and
 still
 get
 some
 light
 on
 what
 you're


doing.
 And
 then
 if
 you
 get
 into
 any


electrical
 work
 or
 you
 start
 figuring


out
 your
 electrical
 system
 in
 your


house,
 a
 non-cont
 voltage
 tester
 is
 a


good
 one.
 And
 what
 you
 do
 is
 you
 can


place
 the
 tip
 of
 it
 against
 a
 wire
 and


it
 will
 tell
 you
 if
 that
 wire
 is
 live.


You
 can
 also
 stick
 them
 into
 an
 outlet


to
 see
 if
 an
 outlet
 is
 live.
 So
 it's
 a


good
 troubleshooting
 thing
 like,
 okay,


my
 lamp
 doesn't
 work.
 I've
 changed
 the


bulb.
 And
 then
 you
 can
 take
 a
 non-cont


voltage
 tester
 and
 you
 can
 test
 the


outlet
 to
 see
 if
 the
 outlet's
 working.


This
 sounds
 both
 incredibly
 handy
 and


advanced.
 I
 think
 I'd
 be
 scared
 to
 be


like,
 "Oh,
 here's
 a
 wire.
 Let
 me
 just


see
 if
 it's
 let
 me
 stick
 this
 thing
 in
 a


live
 outlet,
 maybe."


>> Well,
 it's
 a
 non-cont
 thing,
 so
 you
 can


do
 it.
 You
 don't
 even
 need
 to
 touch
 the


wire.
 You
 You
 just
 get
 the
 tip
 of
 it


close
 to
 the
 wire.


>> When
 do
 you
 think
 it's
 worth
 graduating


from
 hand
 tools
 into
 power
 tools?
 Things


like
 an
 electric
 drill
 or
 a
 power
 sander


or
 a
 saw.
 Well,
 getting
 into
 those


tools,
 that's
 when
 you
 really
 start


taking
 on
 a
 proactive
 approach.
 You're


not
 really
 just
 reacting
 to
 the
 loose


handle
 or
 the
 the
 jiggly
 towel
 bar.


That's
 when
 you're
 like,
 I'm
 going
 to


fix
 this
 rotted
 deck
 board.
 I
 want
 to


maybe
 put
 in
 a
 screen
 door,
 things
 like


that.
 So,
 it
 kind
 of
 depends
 on
 where


you're
 at,
 what
 projects
 you
 have.
 If


you're
 a
 renter,
 you
 may
 not
 need
 to.


Although,
 I
 think
 a
 cordless
 drill
 is


probably
 essential
 for
 anybody
 who's


interested
 in
 taking
 on
 this
 kind
 of


work.
 From
 there,
 you
 can
 graduate
 up


into
 saws.
 Circular
 saw,
 jigsaw.
 You
 can


get
 pretty
 much
 everything
 you
 need
 done


with
 those
 two
 tools
 as
 far
 as
 cutting


goes.
 And
 then
 an
 orbital
 sander
 after


that.
 That
 would
 be
 kind
 of
 like
 the


first
 basic
 kit,
 I
 think,
 of
 power
 tools


to
 get.


>> So,
 you
 said
 earlier
 most
 people
 should


have
 a
 power
 drill.
 What
 does
 that


unlock?
 What
 can
 you
 do
 that
 you


couldn't
 do
 if
 you
 don't
 have
 one?


>> Well,
 first
 it
 can
 save
 a
 lot
 of
 time


even
 from
 what
 a
 screwdiving
 task
 is.


Like
 if
 you're
 putting
 in
 a
 door
 hinge


instead
 of
 sitting
 there
 screw
 screw


screw
 screw
 screw.
 You
 can
 get
 it
 done


in
 like
 less
 than
 a
 second
 and
 you're


not
 really
 relying
 on
 hand
 strength.


You're
 not
 exhausting
 your
 hand.
 And


secondly,
 you
 can
 start
 really
 like


putting
 things
 together.
 Like
 you
 can


drill
 holes,
 you
 can
 drive
 screws.
 So
 So


you
 can
 start
 to
 like
 replace
 the
 deck


board.
 You
 could
 um
 as
 far
 as
 drilling


holes,
 anything
 from
 like
 a
 birdhouse


opening
 to
 drilling
 the
 holes
 you
 need


to
 put
 in
 a
 curtain
 rod
 or
 a
 knife
 rack.


It
 really
 opens
 up
 a
 huge
 huge
 arena
 of


things
 you
 can
 do.


>> What
 is
 our
 top
 pick?


>> Our
 top
 pick
 is
 a
 little
 12vt
 DeWalt.


>> And
 how
 much
 does
 it
 cost?


>> The
 12vt
 drills
 usually
 go
 that's


actually
 the
 smallest
 class
 of
 cordless


drill.
 They
 usually
 go
 for
 less
 than


150.
 They're
 often
 on
 sale
 to
 about
 100


which
 comes
 with
 a
 drill,
 two
 batteries,


and
 the
 charger.
 And
 at
 this
 point,
 we


only
 recommend
 cordless
 drills,
 right?


We
 don't
 really
 have
 any
 corded
 drills


that
 we
 recommend.


>> No.
 No,
 definitely
 not.
 Corded
 tools
 are


definitely
 on
 their
 way
 to
 becoming


extinct
 at
 this
 point.
 Battery


technology
 has
 gotten
 just
 phenomenal.


So,
 there's
 really
 no
 point
 in
 in
 having


a
 corded
 drill.


>> Let's
 say
 that
 you
 buy
 a
 really
 nice


power
 drill
 and
 you're
 feeling


emboldened.
 Do
 you
 just
 jump
 right
 in


and
 buy
 every
 power
 tool
 there
 is
 at


once?
 Or
 the
 dreaded
 question,
 do
 you


buy
 a
 kit?
 Well,
 in
 the
 case
 of
 power


tools,
 a
 kit
 is
 a
 great
 place
 to
 start,


I
 think,
 unlike
 what
 we
 were
 just
 saying


with
 hand
 tools.
 So,


>> for
 one,
 it's
 a
 way
 to
 get
 a
 lot
 of


tools
 at
 a
 fairly
 low
 price.
 So,
 the
 way


to
 think
 about
 power
 tools
 is
 that,
 and


this
 is
 certainly
 the
 way
 manufacturers


think
 about
 it,
 is
 that
 you're
 buying


their
 batteries,
 like
 you're
 buying
 into


their
 battery
 system.
 So,
 they
 want
 you


to
 buy
 their
 tools
 because
 then
 you're


going
 to
 be
 more
 likely
 to
 buy
 other
 of


their
 tools
 which
 are
 compatible
 with


the
 same
 battery,
 which
 which
 also
 makes


sense
 from
 the
 consumer
 point
 of
 view,


too,
 because
 once
 you
 have
 a
 couple


DeWalt
 batteries,
 you
 can
 also
 buy


another
 DeWalt
 tool
 as
 a
 bare
 tool,


which
 means
 it's
 comes
 at
 a
 reduced


price
 and
 it
 doesn't
 have
 a
 battery
 or


it
 doesn't
 have
 a
 charger.
 So,
 the
 kits


are
 great.
 Um,
 you
 can
 get
 a
 wide


variety
 of
 tools.
 Often
 they
 come
 with
 a


drill,
 a
 circular
 saw,
 maybe


reciprocating
 saw,
 oscillating


multi-tool,
 which
 is
 a
 phenomenally


useful
 tool,
 maybe
 a
 flashlight,
 and


then
 you
 get
 two
 batteries
 and
 a


charger.
 And
 sometimes
 that's
 for
 as


little
 as
 like
 $200,
 which
 is
 just
 a


fantastic
 price.
 It's
 a
 good
 place
 to


get
 started.
 You
 kind
 of
 get
 a
 little


bit
 of
 everything.
 So
 you
 kind
 of
 have


everything
 you
 you
 may
 need.


>> And
 an
 oscillating
 multi-tool,
 I
 have


never
 heard
 of
 that
 before.
 What
 is
 it?


What
 does
 it
 do?


>> Yeah,
 so
 oscillating
 multi-tools,


they're
 pretty
 interesting.
 So,
 for
 a


long
 time,
 one
 company
 had
 the
 patent
 on


this
 tool.
 It's
 a
 company
 called
 Fine.


It's
 a
 German
 company,
 but
 what
 it
 does


is
 it's
 you
 can
 put
 a
 lot
 of
 things
 on


it.
 You
 can
 put
 a
 blade
 on
 it.
 You
 can


put
 a
 sander
 on
 it,
 but
 what
 it
 does
 is


it
 oscillates
 back
 and
 forth
 slightly.


So,
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 benefits
 to
 that.


If
 you
 put
 a
 sanding
 pad
 on
 it,
 there's


a
 triangular
 sanding
 pad,
 so
 you
 can
 get


it
 right
 into
 like
 an
 inside
 corner.


If
 you
 have
 a
 saw
 blade
 on,
 and
 these


saw
 blades,
 they're
 only
 like
 an
 inch


wide,
 you
 can
 plunge
 cut
 like
 directly


straight
 into
 a
 wall.
 So,
 it's
 not
 like


a
 circular
 saw,
 which
 is
 going to
 make
 a


huge
 mess.
 So,
 if
 you're
 cutting
 in
 for


like
 an
 outlet
 or
 something
 like
 that,


you
 can
 just
 kind
 of
 plunge
 in
 and
 then


just
 make
 like
 a
 really
 tight
 nice


little
 box.
 There's
 also
 little
 heads
 on


it,
 little
 grinder
 heads,
 so
 you
 can


kind
 of
 clean
 out
 grout
 with
 them,
 too.


So,
 fine
 had
 it
 for
 a
 long
 time
 and


then,
 I
 don't know,
 10
 years
 ago
 or
 so,


their
 patent
 wore
 out,
 and
 so
 then


there's
 been
 a
 flood
 of
 of
 other


companies.
 So
 now
 everybody
 pretty
 much


has
 one.
 They're
 really
 good.
 They're


definitely
 like
 a
 renovator's
 tool
 for


sure.


>> Doug,
 do
 you
 have
 any
 final
 pieces
 of


philosophical
 advice
 for
 people
 who
 are


interested
 in
 becoming
 handy?


>> You've
 got
 to
 seriously
 think
 about


safety
 with
 these
 tools,
 especially


saws.
 Just
 try
 not
 to
 get
 in
 over
 your


head.
 I
 mean,
 it's
 it's
 probably
 going


to
 happen
 at
 some
 point
 and
 YouTube
 is
 a


great
 resource,
 but
 make
 sure
 if
 you're


have
 a
 project
 in
 mind,
 you're
 replacing


your
 toilet,
 for
 instance.
 Like,
 watch


10
 videos
 on
 people
 replacing
 their


toilets
 and
 not
 just
 one.
 And
 and
 that


way
 you
 can
 kind
 of
 get
 a
 sense
 of
 sort


of
 what
 the
 truth
 is
 of
 the
 process,


what
 kind
 of
 things
 everybody
 deals


with,
 what
 kind
 of
 things
 you
 might
 run


into.
 If
 you
 have
 an
 old
 house,
 good


luck
 to
 you.
 It's
 um
 cuz
 everything
 goes


sideways
 very
 quickly
 on
 an
 old
 house.
 I


know
 my
 house
 is
 250
 years
 old
 and


nothing
 is
 to
 any
 standard,
 but
 keep
 a


good
 attitude
 about
 it
 and
 don't
 let
 my


brother-in-law
 always
 says
 this.
 He


says,
 "Don't
 let
 perfect
 get
 in
 the
 way


of
 pretty
 good."


>> Well,
 thanks
 Doug.
 Always
 love
 having


you
 here.
 It's
 the
 best.
 Thanks
 for


joining
 us.


>> Thanks,
 Doug.
 It
 was
 fun
 to
 be
 here.


>> We'll
 drop
 links
 in
 our
 show
 notes
 to


Wire
 Cutters
 top
 picks
 for
 hammers,


screwdrivers,
 drills,
 and
 other
 tools.


And
 we'll
 also
 link
 to
 some
 safety


equipment
 like
 eye
 protection
 and
 dust


masks
 that
 you
 should
 use
 when
 you
 start


getting
 handy.
 That's
 it
 for
 us.
 We'll


be
 back
 next
 week
 with
 a
 brand
 new


episode.
 Thanks
 for
 listening.
