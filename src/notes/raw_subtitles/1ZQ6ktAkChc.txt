Hey
 everyone,
 it's
 Anna.
 Before
 we
 start


the
 show,
 I
 want
 to
 ask
 you
 a
 question.


And
 please
 don't
 be
 offended
 if
 it


sounds
 a
 little
 direct.
 Okay,
 here
 goes.


Are
 money
 issues
 affecting
 your


relationship?
 Money
 can
 be
 awkward
 and


sensitive
 to
 talk
 about
 how
 much
 to


save,
 how
 much
 to
 spend,
 who
 makes
 the


decisions
 about
 what?
 But
 if
 you're
 not


talking
 about
 money,
 it
 can
 cause
 even


bigger
 problems.
 We
 have
 an
 episode


coming
 up
 soon
 where
 I'll
 be
 talking
 to


Rammit
 Sati.
 He
 hosted
 the
 Netflix
 show


How
 to
 Get
 Rich.
 He's
 written
 books
 on


personal
 finance
 and
 he's
 especially


good
 at
 helping
 couples
 resolve
 their


differences
 around
 money
 and
 start
 to


actually
 enjoy
 talking
 about
 it.
 If
 this


sounds
 like
 something
 you
 want
 to
 be
 a


part
 of,
 please
 send
 us
 a
 short
 voice


memo.
 Tell
 us
 about
 a
 moment
 you
 and


someone
 you
 loved
 had
 tension
 around


money.
 It
 could
 be
 your
 partner.
 It


could
 be
 a
 family
 member.
 Tell
 us
 what


happened
 to
 set
 it
 off,
 what
 you
 said
 to


each
 other
 or
 didn't
 say,
 and
 how
 you


felt
 about
 all
 of
 it.
 We
 might
 play
 your


voice
 on
 the
 show
 and
 hear
 Rammit's


advice
 on
 what
 you
 can
 do
 differently.


Please
 email
 your
 voice
 memo
 to


modernlove
 podcastny
 times.com
 by


November
 3rd.
 There's
 instructions
 in


our
 show
 notes.
 Please
 check
 those
 out.


All right,
 here's
 today's
 episode.


>> Love
 now
 and


>> you
 fall
 in
 love.
 Love
 was
 stronger
 than


anything.
 For
 the
 love
 of
 love


>> and
 I
 love

 more
 than
 anything.


There's
 still
 love.

 New
 York
 Times.
 I'm
 Anna


Martin.
 This
 is
 Modern
 Love.
 And
 on
 our


show,
 infidelity
 comes
 up
 a
 lot.
 So
 much


so
 that
 I
 got
 to
 be
 honest,
 I
 kind
 of


thought
 I'd
 heard
 it
 all.
 But
 I
 recently


learned
 about
 a
 way
 to
 handle
 getting


cheated
 on
 that
 was
 totally
 new
 to
 me.


It
 involves
 hiring
 a
 highly
 specialized


professional
 who
 claims
 they
 can
 make
 an


affair
 just
 sort
 of
 disappear
 and
 make


the
 cheaters
 think
 it
 was
 their
 idea
 to


end
 it.
 It's
 called
 mistress
 dispelling


and
 it's
 become
 popular
 in
 cities
 across


China.
 Today
 I'm
 talking
 to
 Elizabeth


Low.
 She's
 a
 filmmaker
 from
 Hong
 Kong


who
 spent
 3
 years
 following
 one
 mistress


dispeller.
 When
 this
 mistress
 dispeller


is
 working
 on
 a
 case
 she
 lies,
 she


manipulates.
 but
 she's
 also
 remarkably


compassionate
 to
 everyone
 involved.


After
 I
 saw
 this
 film,
 I
 could
 not
 stop


thinking
 about
 it.
 So,
 I
 asked
 Elizabeth


to
 sit
 down
 with
 me
 to
 share
 what
 she


learned.
 And
 she
 told
 me
 how
 her
 own


heart
 got
 broken
 along
 the
 way.
 I


remember
 thinking,
 why
 did
 I
 let
 this


woman
 whose
 entire
 job
 is
 to
 orchestrate


breakups


influence
 my
 own
 belief
 in
 this


relationship?


Elizabeth
 Low,
 welcome
 to
 Modern
 Love.


Thank
 you
 so
 much
 for
 having
 me.


>> Thank
 you
 for
 being
 here.
 Your
 new


documentary
 is
 called
 Mistress


Dispeller.


I
 want
 to
 jump
 right
 in
 and
 ask
 you,
 can


you
 explain
 what
 a
 mistress
 dispeller


is?
 Yes.
 So,
 it's
 this
 industry
 that's


emerged
 in
 the
 last
 decade
 in
 China,
 and


it's
 a
 service
 that
 you
 can
 hire
 if
 you


find
 out
 that
 your
 spouse
 is
 cheating
 on


you.
 But
 instead
 of
 directly
 confronting


your
 spouse,
 as
 most
 people
 might
 do,


>> you
 outsource
 this
 crisis
 to
 a
 woman


whose
 job
 is
 to
 infiltrate
 your
 family,


befriend
 your
 your
 partner,
 likely
 a


husband,
 um,
 under
 a
 false
 identity.
 And


then
 through
 her
 friendship
 with
 him,


then
 gains
 access
 to
 his
 mistress.
 And


over
 the
 course
 of
 2
 to
 3
 months,
 the


mistress
 dispeller
 gains
 their
 trust,


gains
 their
 ear,
 and
 slowly
 and
 very


subtly
 influences
 them
 to
 want
 to
 end


the
 affair.


>> Her
 goal
 is
 to
 insert
 herself
 into
 your


life
 and
 really
 into
 your
 cheating


spouse's
 life
 without
 him
 knowing


>> who
 she
 really
 is.
 But
 she
 often
 herself


as
 someone


outside
 of
 their
 obviously
 their


immediate
 friend
 circle


in


their
 family
 affairs.
 So
 she's
 in
 the


most
 neutralized
 least
 threatening


position.


>> In
 mainland
 China,
 therapy
 is
 still
 very


much
 stigmatized
 among
 middle
 classes
 or


upper
 upper
 middle
 classes
 because
 in


China
 there's
 this
 concept
 that
 you
 know


domestic
 shame
 should
 not
 be
 made


public.
 to
 air
 your
 dirty
 laundry
 to
 a


total
 stranger
 um
 would
 be
 unthinkable


and
 to
 preserve
 every
 party's
 dignity


even
 in
 a
 conflict
 is
 deeply
 ingrained


in
 Chinese
 and
 Asian
 culture
 and
 so
 a


mistress
 dispeller
 is
 a
 fixer
 slther


therapist
 family
 counselor


>> slp
 private
 eye


>> let's
 talk
 about
 the
 mistress
 dispeller


you
 focus
 on
 in
 this
 documentary
 known


like
 teacher
 Wang
 and
 teacher
 is
 because


>> that's
 just
 a
 literal
 translation
 of


Wang
 Lao
 in
 Chinese
 which


>> you
 might
 translate
 that
 into
 Mrs.
 Wang


but
 we
 felt
 teacher
 Wang
 set
 her
 apart


in
 the
 subtitles
 and
 gave
 her
 the
 sense


of
 authority


>> which
 people
 treated
 her
 with.


>> Certainly
 they
 did.
 her
 real
 superpower


is
 gaining
 trust
 and
 in
 doing
 so


kind
 of
 convince
 the
 parties
 that
 ending


the
 affair
 is
 their
 idea
 almost
 right


>> that's
 her
 whole
 yeah
 that's
 her
 whole


emmo
 ending
 the
 affair
 has
 to
 be
 their


own
 idea
 that's
 a
 lot
 of
 work
 I
 will
 say


that's
 a
 lot
 of
 I
 mean
 it's
 so
 many


mental


>> it's
 almost
 like
 inception


>> does
 she
 have
 a
 notebook
 where
 she
 keeps


track
 of
 everything
 she
 said
 to
 everyone


or
 what's
 the


>> Yeah
 she
 does
 have
 a
 a
 system
 of


documentation
 of
 all
 her
 cases.
 So
 that


she
 cuz
 she
 has
 like
 it
 to
 us
 it
 it
 felt


like
 she
 had
 at
 least
 100
 cases
 per
 year


incoming
 that
 she
 was
 dealing
 with
 and


constantly
 when
 we
 were
 filming
 with
 her


she
 was
 always
 on
 the
 phone
 12
 hours
 15


hours
 a
 day
 on
 the
 phone
 managing


different
 crises
 that
 were
 cropping
 up


from
 wives
 who
 are
 desperate
 husbands
 or


mistresses
 you
 know
 who
 are
 suicidal
 and


she's
 talking
 them
 down.
 Somehow
 she
 has


this
 remarkable
 ability
 to
 keep
 all
 of


their
 stories
 in
 her
 head.
 I
 think


mostly.


>> Wow.


>> Yeah.


>> The
 case
 teacher
 Wang
 focuses
 on
 in
 your


film
 is
 with
 a
 family,
 the
 Lee
 family,


the
 Lees.


>> Mrs.
 Lee


discovers
 that
 her
 husband
 is
 cheating


on
 her.
 Hires
 teacher
 Wang
 to
 dispel
 the


mistress.


How
 does
 Teacher
 Wang
 insert
 herself


into
 Mr.
 Lee's
 life
 without
 him
 knowing


what
 she's
 up
 to.
 So,
 Mr.
 and
 Mrs.
 Lee


are
 known
 within
 their
 community
 to
 be


this
 model
 couple
 who
 play
 have
 been


playing
 badminton
 with
 each
 other
 for
 30


years.


>> They
 love
 badminton.


>> They
 love
 badminton.
 Like,
 actually,


when
 we
 were
 editing
 them,
 they
 were


called
 the
 badminton
 couple.


>> Of
 course.


>> Yeah.


>> They
 love
 tossing
 it
 over
 the
 net
 or


whatever.
 Yeah.
 And
 uh
 because
 the


husband
 loves
 badminton,
 is
 really
 proud


of
 his
 skill,
 um
 Wang
 figured
 out
 like


what
 is
 your
 husband
 most
 passionate


about?
 What
 is
 something
 he
 would
 be


excited
 to
 share
 with
 someone
 else?
 And


obviously
 badminton
 was
 the
 first
 on
 the


list.
 And
 so
 they
 figured
 out
 that
 she


would
 pretend
 to
 be
 a
 friend
 who's


wanting
 to
 learn
 badminton,


>> a
 friend
 of
 Mrs.
 Le.


So
 that's
 the
 setting
 in
 which
 she


ingratiates
 herself
 into
 his
 life
 and


positions
 herself
 in
 this
 way
 where


she's
 very
 endearing
 because
 she's
 so


bad
 at
 badminton.


>> She
 is
 bad.


>> Yeah.
 And
 and
 he's
 like
 trying
 to
 teach


her.


>> Was
 she
 amping
 that
 up?
 She
 just


couldn't
 play.
 Yeah.


>> I
 mean
 maybe,
 but
 I
 don't
 think
 so.


>> Okay.


>> Yeah.
 I
 think
 she
 was
 just
 genuinely


bad.
 But
 her
 like,
 you
 know,
 her
 her
 how


sort
 of
 demir
 she
 is
 and
 like
 so
 how
 do


I
 do
 the
 how
 do
 I
 hold
 the
 racket?
 I'm


that's
 I'm
 sure
 all
 calculated
 and
 she's


laying
 almost
 this
 trap
 that
 he's


inevitably
 going
 to
 fall
 into
 in
 which


he
 will
 then
 feel
 compelled
 to
 confess.


I
 don't
 want
 to
 divorce
 my
 wife,
 but
 I


just
 also
 can't
 bring
 myself
 to
 give
 up


this
 young
 woman
 that
 I've
 become


entangled
 with.


[Music]


We'll
 be
 right
 back.


[Music]


So,
 in
 addition
 to
 getting
 close
 to
 the


cheating
 husband,
 Mr.
 Lee,
 teacher
 Wayne


has,
 I
 would
 argue,
 maybe
 an
 even
 more


difficult
 job
 of
 getting
 the
 mistress


herself
 to
 open
 up
 to
 her.
 Can
 you


describe
 how
 she
 sort
 of
 breaks
 down
 the


wall
 with
 this
 mistress
 whose
 name
 is
 uh


FE
 in
 the
 film?


>> So,
 she
 has
 convinced
 the
 husband
 that


you
 have
 to
 introduce
 me
 to
 your


mistress
 just
 so
 I
 can
 see
 what's
 going


on
 with
 her,
 not
 to
 say
 that
 I
 want
 to


get
 rid
 of
 her
 because
 he
 might
 be


resistant
 to
 that.
 Um,
 and
 he
 agrees
 to


that.
 And
 so,
 that's
 that
 was
 wild
 to
 me


that
 he
 agreed
 to
 it.
 But
 I
 mean
 were


you
 surprised
 that
 he
 so
 readily
 agreed


to
 introduce
 his
 mistress
 to
 this
 new


friend
 of
 his
 in
 his
 understanding


>> because
 she
 has
 convinced
 him
 that
 she


is
 someone
 who
 can
 help
 him
 in
 his
 life.


She's
 positioned
 herself
 as
 this
 guiding


light
 in
 his
 life
 that
 I
 will
 help
 you


through
 this
 complicated
 situation.
 We


don't
 know
 how
 it
 will
 turn
 out
 but
 just


let
 me
 get
 to
 know
 everybody
 involved


and
 I
 can
 help
 you.


>> Exactly.
 Exactly.
 and
 she
 probably,
 you


know,
 in
 the
 process
 of
 talking
 to
 him


is
 drilling
 down
 on
 what
 are
 his


resentments
 in
 his
 marriage,
 helping
 him


feel
 heard.
 Um,
 and
 then
 also
 making
 him


begin
 to
 see
 the
 mistress
 as
 sort
 of
 an


interloper
 in
 a
 what
 is
 precious,
 his


family.
 And
 so
 then
 he
 introduces
 um,


Feay,
 the
 mistress,
 to
 Wang.
 And
 the


guys
 that
 he
 they
 come
 up
 with
 is
 that


Wang
 wants
 to
 learn
 business
 and


entrepreneurship
 from
 the
 mistress.


>> Wang
 is
 really
 ne
 wanting
 to
 learn
 a


lot.
 First
 she
 wants
 to
 learn
 bad
 things


which
 is
 how
 she
 gets
 to
 know
 the


husband.
 Then
 she
 wants
 to
 learn


business
 from
 the
 mistress.
 But
 so
 she's


a
 sponge.


>> And
 you
 can
 tell
 that
 the
 mistress
 is
 a


little
 skeptical.
 Like
 I'm
 not
 good
 at


business.
 Why
 would
 she
 want
 to
 learn


from
 me?
 I'm
 not
 worth
 learning
 from.


But
 Wang
 already
 has
 a
 backup
 plan
 built


in
 that
 on
 the
 way
 to
 the
 badminton
 uh


game
 again
 where
 they
 are
 going
 to
 meet


this
 is
 their
 you
 know
 this
 is
 their


infrastructure
 the
 social
 infrastructure


in
 which
 they
 will


>> the
 alternate
 title
 of
 this
 could
 have


been
 the
 bad
 mitten
 game
 or


>> uh
 that
 not
 only
 are
 they
 going
 to
 be


playing
 badminton
 together
 but
 she
 has


orchestrated
 it
 so
 that
 the
 husband
 is


going
 to
 be
 called
 away
 by
 work
 and
 will


abandon
 her
 at
 the
 bammon
 game
 10


minutes
 in
 and
 the
 thing
 that
 she
 has


already
 achieved
 is
 that
 the
 mistress


feels
 is
 made
 to
 feel
 unimportant
 by
 the


husband
 and
 in
 this
 way
 in
 those
 moments


Wang
 slowly
 sort
 of
 gains
 her
 trust
 or


at
 least


plants
 those
 seeds
 of
 doubt
 in
 Fe's
 mind


about
 this
 relationship
 and
 how
 worthy


is
 it
 for
 you
 to
 struggle
 for
 a


relationship
 that's
 not
 even
 taking
 you


seriously


and
 it's
 there
 that
 we
 can
 in
 those
 sort


of
 intimate
 conversations
 that
 they


begin
 to
 have.
 That's
 where
 I
 think
 we


really
 see
 teacher
 Wang's


theory
 approach
 to
 infidelity


become
 very
 clear
 and
 she
 has
 this
 this


idea
 about
 who
 suffers
 the
 most
 in


infidelity.
 I
 wonder
 if
 you
 could
 speak


about
 about
 that.


>> Yeah.
 So
 in
 the
 most
 striking
 moment
 in


the
 film
 that
 people
 always
 come
 to
 me


and
 say
 that
 was
 a
 revelation
 when
 I


heard
 that
 because
 it's
 it
 completely


turns
 the
 issue
 of
 infidelity
 down
 its


head.
 She
 basically
 asks
 who
 do
 you


think
 is
 in
 the
 most
 pain
 in
 a
 in
 a
 love


triangle?
 Is
 it
 the
 wife
 or
 is
 it
 the


mistress?
 And
 she
 says
 while
 the
 wife


may
 be
 hurting,
 it's
 actually
 the


mistress
 who
 is
 willing
 to
 put
 herself


in
 a
 situation
 where
 she
 is
 not


deserving
 of
 a
 complete
 love
 that
 she
 is


actually
 suffering
 the
 most
 because
 she


doesn't
 love
 herself
 enough
 to
 be
 in
 a


complete
 relationship
 out
 in
 the
 open.


And
 she's
 both
 hyper
 compassionate
 on


one
 hand,
 I
 think
 that
 she
 can


recognize,
 okay,
 these
 are
 young
 women


often
 who
 need
 some
 degree
 of
 therapy.


and
 she
 talks
 about
 it
 as
 I
 need
 to
 help


their
 cognition
 about
 themselves.
 But
 on


the
 other
 hand,
 in
 terms
 of
 her


strategy,
 she's
 very
 ruthless
 and
 brutal


towards
 what
 she's
 doing
 with
 the
 young


woman's
 emotions
 in
 the
 moment
 that
 are


painful
 in
 the
 moment,
 but
 maybe
 for
 a


greater
 good.


I
 mean,
 so
 her
 idea
 is
 that
 it's
 the


mistress
 who's
 feeling
 the
 most
 pain.
 Do


you
 buy
 this?
 Like,
 was
 that
 borne
 out


from
 the
 couples
 that
 you
 saw?


I
 think
 it
 makes
 a
 lot
 of
 sense
 in


Wang's
 approach
 to
 these
 cases
 and
 it's


an
 a
 philosophy
 that
 helps
 her
 approach


these
 mistresses
 in
 a
 way
 that
 is


hyperco
 compassionate
 and
 non-judgmental


and
 so
 it's
 easy
 for
 the
 mistresses
 to


trust
 her.
 But
 I
 don't
 necessarily
 think


on
 the
 whole
 it's
 it's
 that
 simple.
 I


think


>> when
 you
 see
 a
 woman
 such
 as
 Mrs.
 Lee


who's
 been
 betrayed
 by
 her
 husband
 after


30
 years.
 I
 think
 that
 kind
 of


heartbreak
 and
 betrayal
 is
 really


profound
 as
 well.


Maybe
 you
 know
 betrayal
 by
 another
 human


being
 who's
 so
 close
 to
 you.
 I
 think


that
 is
 probably
 as
 profound
 as
 being


betrayed
 by
 yourself
 which
 is
 in
 the


mistress's
 case
 she
 it's
 herself
 that's


betraying
 her.
 But
 which
 maybe
 maybe


Wang
 is
 right
 as
 I'm
 talking
 through


this.
 Wang
 is
 right
 that
 when
 you


yourself
 betray
 yourself
 that
 is
 far


worse
 than
 if
 another
 human
 being


betrays
 you.


>> Wang
 always
 10
 steps
 ahead.


>> Wow.
 Yeah.
 I
 mean
 it
 is
 it
 is


perception.
 It
 really
 is
 to
 betray
 the


mistress
 is
 betraying
 herself.


>> The
 wife
 is
 being
 betrayed
 by
 someone


else


>> which
 you
 cannot
 control
 in
 life.


>> Wow.
 In
 a
 way,
 it
 seems
 like
 teacher


Wang
 sees
 her
 job
 as
 helping
 a
 mistress


open
 her
 eyes
 or
 understand
 her
 worth


100%.
 That's
 totally
 what
 it
 is.
 But
 I
 I


think
 she's
 doing
 it
 with
 all
 three


parties.
 And
 that's
 why
 I
 was
 so
 so


compelled
 to
 this
 premise
 because
 I
 saw


in
 each
 of
 these
 three
 characters
 in


each
 corner
 of
 the
 love
 triangle
 these


really
 classical
 classically
 heroic


journeys
 that
 they're
 going
 on.
 The


wife,
 she
 has
 to
 set
 aside
 her
 pride
 to


save
 her
 family.
 She
 has
 to
 bite
 her


tongue
 to
 save
 her
 family.
 The
 husband


is
 at
 this
 fork
 in
 the
 road
 which
 Wang


makes
 him
 see.
 You
 either
 have
 to
 choose


your
 commitment
 and
 love
 for
 your
 family


or
 you
 choose
 this
 life
 where
 you
 are


pursuing
 your
 own
 individual
 desires.


And
 then
 with
 the
 mistress,
 she
 is
 like


you
 said
 helping
 her
 see
 her
 own
 value


enough
 to
 extricate
 herself
 from
 this


love
 that
 is
 not
 satisfying.
 M
 and
 where


does
 that
 leave
 the
 le
 and
 and
 mistress


FA
 I
 mean
 what
 is
 the
 ending
 h
 is
 a


happy
 ending
 even
 the
 goal


>> I
 think
 the
 ending
 of
 the
 film
 and
 I


don't
 know
 how
 much
 I
 should
 be
 giving


away
 bittersweet


>> um
 but
 as
 Wang
 would
 say
 each
 of
 them
 is


somehow
 where
 they
 belong
 in
 the
 track


that
 they
 belong
 when
 you
 ask
 her
 you


know
 what
 is
 your
 success
 rate.
 She'll


say
 99%
 success
 rate
 because
 she
 says


she's
 very
 clever.


>> She
 says
 that
 no matter
 what
 happens
 in


the
 outcome
 of
 a
 case,
 she
 is
 always


helping
 all
 three
 parties
 go
 back
 to
 or


go
 to
 whatever
 tracks
 they
 belong
 in
 in


life.
 And
 if
 that
 sometimes
 does
 lead
 to


divorce,
 um
 she'll
 say
 that's
 the
 track


that
 is
 best
 for
 each
 of
 your
 lives.


>> And
 she
 will
 business
 a
 shrewd.
 It's


like
 a
 handyman
 being
 like,
 "I
 will
 try


to
 fix
 your
 sink,
 but
 if
 the
 sink
 stays


broken,
 that's
 how
 the
 sink
 was
 meant
 to


be."
 Like
 100%.
 Yeah.
 And
 and
 because


her
 powers
 of
 persuasion
 are
 so
 strong,


she
 can
 convince,
 you
 know,
 the
 wife


figure
 or
 the
 husband
 figure
 that


however
 their
 love
 story
 turns
 out
 is
 in


their
 best
 interest.


You
 know,
 I
 think
 often,


at least
 I
 think
 about
 infidelity
 in


terms
 of


um
 in
 terms
 of
 retribution,
 like
 I'm


going
 to
 find
 you
 out.
 I'm
 going
 to
 end


this
 relationship.
 You're
 going
 to
 pay.


But
 the
 approach
 we
 see
 in
 your
 film


avoids
 that
 confrontation,


but
 at
 the
 same
 time,
 as
 we've
 spoken


about,
 it
 does
 involve
 a
 lot
 of


deception.


And
 I'm
 curious
 how
 you
 sort
 of


calibrate
 those
 things.


>> I
 think
 the
 the
 huge
 blind
 spot
 or


downside
 of
 this
 approach
 to
 solving
 a


marital
 crisis
 is
 that
 there
 is
 no


accountability.


Nobody
 has
 to
 take
 responsibility


because
 everything
 is
 swept
 under
 the


rug.
 And
 I
 don't
 know
 what
 the


consequences
 of
 that
 is


>> exactly,
 but
 I
 I
 do,
 you
 know,
 just


instinctually
 see
 that
 as
 a
 as
 a
 as
 an


issue.
 All
 the
 emotional
 labor,
 so
 much


of
 it
 is
 taken
 on
 by
 the
 women
 in
 the


case.


>> Now,
 that
 is
 that


>> that
 feels
 true
 to
 me.


>> Yeah.
 But
 I
 think
 that
 that
 is
 just
 a


symptom
 of
 the
 way
 our
 world
 is
 in
 which


women
 around
 the
 world
 are
 doing
 so
 much


emotional
 labor


>> on
 behalf
 of
 all
 relationships.


Did
 immersing
 yourself
 in
 this
 world
 of


mistress
 dispellers,


did
 it
 change
 your
 own
 perspective


on
 love
 or
 commitment
 or
 infidelity?
 I


will
 say


I
 think
 the
 takeaway
 that
 I
 have
 drawn


from
 this
 experience
 which
 for
 a
 long


time
 was
 very
 muddled


>> and
 you
 know
 uh
 there's
 a
 lot
 of


cynicism
 that
 you
 can
 derive
 from


witnessing
 case
 after
 case
 after
 case
 of


this
 betrayal.


>> But
 for
 me


it
 is
 a
 testament
 to
 love
 and
 enduring


love
 and
 struggle
 for
 love
 and
 people


failing
 to
 communicate.
 But
 there's
 this


like
 idealistic
 part
 of
 me
 that
 still


very
 much
 believes
 that
 these
 people


love
 each
 other.
 There's
 a
 lot
 of
 love


between
 all
 these
 people
 even
 if
 they're


transgressing
 and
 even
 if
 they're


failing
 in
 their
 marriages.
 I
 think
 I've


always
 been
 kind
 of
 a
 romantic
 and
 an


optimist
 and
 I
 went
 in
 with
 that


feeling.
 Um,
 I
 had
 met
 someone
 that
 I


felt
 very
 much
 in
 love
 with


>> right
 before
 embarking
 on
 this
 project.


>> Wow.


>> And
 I
 remember
 over
 the
 course
 of
 the
 3


years
 of
 making
 this
 film,
 we
 got


engaged,
 but
 it
 fell
 apart
 by
 the
 end
 of


the
 process
 of
 film
 making.


>> Sorry.
 Yeah.


And
 it's
 interesting
 because
 for
 the


longest
 time
 I
 actually
 blamed
 teacher


Wang,
 the
 mistress
 dispeller,
 for


playing
 a
 hand
 in
 sort
 of
 dispelling
 me


from
 my
 own
 relationship.


[Music]


We'll
 be
 right
 back.


[Music]


[Music]


[Music]


Elizabeth,
 you
 told
 me
 that
 you
 went


through
 your
 own
 breakup
 when
 you
 were


filming
 this
 documentary
 and
 that
 you


blamed
 teacher
 Wang.
 Why?
 She
 had


somehow
 planted
 the
 seed
 um
 in
 the
 first


year
 that
 I
 met
 her
 when
 I
 first


revealed
 to
 her
 about
 my
 my


>> kind
 of
 new
 relationship.


>> Yeah,
 my
 new
 relationship.
 My
 new


relationship
 that
 I
 felt
 very
 confident


about.


>> Um


>> what
 did
 you
 tell
 her?
 You
 were
 like,
 I


have
 this
 boyfriend
 and
 Okay.
 Yeah.
 So,


uh
 it
 was
 like
 after
 a
 long
 shoot
 day


and
 we
 were
 eating
 takeout
 in
 her
 office


floor
 and


>> fun.


>> Yeah.
 You
 know,
 of
 course,
 naturally
 the


conversation
 would
 turn
 to
 our
 own
 love


lives.


>> And
 I
 said,
 "Oh,
 I
 have
 this
 this


boyfriend."
 And,
 you
 know,
 we
 were


friends
 at
 first
 and
 then,
 you
 know,
 I


started
 to
 fall
 for
 him
 before
 he


started
 to
 fall
 for
 me,
 but
 eventually


he's
 reciprocated
 and
 now
 we're
 in
 love.


And
 I
 showed
 her
 a
 picture
 of
 the
 two
 of


us.
 Classic.
 And
 she
 looked
 at
 that


picture
 in
 which
 we
 were
 sitting
 a
 meter


apart
 because
 we
 were
 still
 friends
 at


that
 point.
 And
 he
 was
 sitting
 in
 a


relaxed,
 confident
 way,
 but
 I
 was
 like


sitting
 in
 this
 really
 like
 shy
 koi
 way


with
 my
 shoulders
 kind
 of
 like
 up
 by
 my


ears.


>> And
 she
 was
 like
 she
 was
 like
 repulsed


by
 this
 image
 and
 was
 like,
 "Oh."
 Was


like
 this.


>> Well,
 why'd
 you
 show
 her
 that
 pic?


>> I
 don't
 know.
 I
 didn't
 think
 there
 was


anything
 wrong
 with
 this
 picture
 and
 I


thought
 it
 was
 cute.
 And
 then
 she
 she


goes,
 "Oh,
 no,
 no,
 no.
 This
 is
 doomed.


This
 will
 never
 work
 out."
 And
 I
 was


stunned
 because
 that's
 such
 a


prescriptive,


gigantic
 statement
 to
 make
 about


someone's
 new
 relationship.


>> Yes,
 it
 is.


>> Yeah.
 Stunned.
 I
 would
 have
 felt


offended.


>> I
 was
 very
 offended.
 But
 I
 also
 grew
 up


in
 a
 household
 where
 criticism
 is
 love.


So
 I
 was
 curious.
 I
 wanted
 to
 understand


my
 world.


>> It's
 probably
 why
 we
 do
 what
 we
 do.


Totally.


And
 I
 was
 like,
 "Oh,
 why
 do
 you
 say


that?
 What
 would
 lead
 you
 to
 say
 such
 a


thing?


>> And
 you
 are
 also
 a
 documentarian.
 So


instead
 of
 just
 being
 offended
 angry,


you
 say,
 "Well,
 why?
 I'm
 open.
 I'm


constantly
 porous
 to
 a
 fault."
 And
 I


said,
 and
 I
 said,
 "Um,
 why?
 Why
 do
 you


say
 that?"
 And
 she
 said,


>> "Because


he
 didn't,"
 and
 this
 sounds
 so
 harsh.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.


>> She
 said,
 and
 and
 I
 think
 because
 I
 was


not
 one
 of
 her
 clients.
 She's
 no
 filter


with
 me,
 right?
 She
 says
 because
 he


didn't
 like
 you
 at
 first.
 He
 didn't


value
 you.
 He
 couldn't
 see
 your
 value


from
 at
 the
 beginning,
 but
 he
 was
 moved


by
 how
 good
 you
 were
 to
 him.
 And
 that's


how
 he
 fell
 for
 you.
 So
 in
 the
 future,


the
 moment
 that
 you
 stop
 giving,
 then
 he


will
 leave.


>> Holy
 You're
 like
 you're
 like


eating
 noodles
 and
 then
 you're
 like,


>> "What?
 I
 just
 showed
 you
 a
 picture
 of
 my


boyfriend.


>> Yeah.
 And
 and
 you
 know,
 we
 had
 just


started
 dating.
 We
 were
 deeply
 in
 love.


And
 I
 was
 like,
 but
 he
 respects
 me
 so


much.
 Like
 he
 cares
 about
 my
 work.
 He's


the
 one
 who
 pushed
 me
 to
 come
 here
 to


find
 you.


>> And
 she
 says,
 she's
 quips.
 She's
 like,


"Any
 man
 who's
 okay
 with
 their
 partner


leaving
 them
 for
 such
 an
 extended
 period


of
 time,
 there's
 a
 problem
 there."


>> Whoa.
 I
 mean,
 it's
 so
 it's
 so


Well,
 okay,
 let
 me
 just
 say
 before
 I


editorialize
 like,
 did
 you
 think
 what


she
 said
 had
 some
 merit?
 Did
 you
 brush


it
 off?
 I
 brushed
 it
 off
 because
 I
 was


so
 in
 love
 at
 that
 point.
 And
 I
 told
 my


boyfriend
 about
 this
 and
 he
 said,
 you


know,
 why
 are
 you
 letting
 a
 stranger


diagnose
 our
 relationship?
 And
 I,
 you


know,
 I
 agreed,
 right?
 But
 it
 obviously


those
 kind
 of
 profound
 statements
 can


like
 sink
 into
 you
 some.
 They
 become


embedded
 into
 your
 consciousness
 in
 a


way
 that
 is
 almost
 impossible
 to
 erase.


That's
 my
 humble


>> predicting
 a
 future
 that
 has
 not
 come


yet,
 but
 it's
 a
 doomed
 future
 that
 may


come
 at
 any
 point.
 Right.
 And
 then
 so
 a


year
 later,
 you're
 still
 making
 the


film.


>> I'm
 still
 making
 the
 film.
 I
 return
 to


China
 and
 this
 time
 I
 return
 engaged.


>> Wow.


>> You're
 like,
 "Look
 at
 that
 rock,
 Der


Wang."


>> And
 I
 tell
 her,
 you
 know,
 feeling
 kind


of
 triumphant
 like,
 "Look,
 I
 proved
 you


wrong."


>> Yeah.


>> And
 she
 says,
 "Congratulations."


quietly,
 but
 I
 can
 tell
 in
 her


congratulations
 that
 it's
 a
 little
 bit


skeptical.
 You
 know how
 when
 you
 can


tell
 when
 someone's
 not
 being
 totally


genuine?
 But
 she's
 holding
 her
 tongue,


right?


>> And
 I
 also
 decide
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 reveal


too
 much
 to
 her
 anymore.
 I
 don't
 want


her
 opinion.


>> Yeah.


>> Um
 her
 negative
 opinion.


>> Yeah.


>> So
 I
 am
 quiet
 about
 it.
 But
 I
 also


notice
 in
 myself
 after
 a
 summer
 in
 which


um
 we've
 had
 a
 lot
 of
 turmoil
 in
 our


relationship
 despite
 being
 engaged
 over


you
 know
 where
 are
 we
 going
 to
 live
 how


are
 we
 going
 to
 raise
 children
 what
 the


next
 20
 years
 are
 going
 to
 look
 like
 we


had
 you
 know
 fundamental
 disagreements


about
 that
 but
 I
 was
 still
 hanging
 on


but
 I
 noticed
 in
 myself
 I
 was
 like
 why


is
 it
 that
 a
 year
 ago
 I
 was
 I
 could
 be


so
 vocal
 in
 my
 defense
 of
 our
 love
 but
 a


year
 later
 I'm
 more
 by
 it
 and
 not
 able


to
 bring
 myself
 to
 defend
 it


>> even
 despite
 having
 taken
 this
 next
 step


in
 your
 relationship.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 So,
 you
 know,
 that
 started


to
 disturb
 me
 and
 then
 over
 the
 course


of
 shooting
 in
 China
 and
 we're
 in
 a


long-distance
 relationship.
 We're


getting
 into
 all
 these
 fights,


>> you
 know,
 jealousy,
 fundamental


disagreements
 about
 what
 our
 future


looks
 like
 and
 we
 weren't
 able
 to


resolve
 the
 fights
 in
 long
 distance.
 And


at
 one
 point
 he
 asked
 for
 a
 break.


>> And
 in
 response
 I
 impulsively
 said,


"Let's
 break
 up
 then."


>> And
 then
 10
 days
 later,
 I
 quickly


regretted
 it.
 And
 but
 then
 by
 the
 time
 I


got
 back
 to
 him,
 he
 said
 he
 couldn't


trust
 in
 the
 relationship
 anymore.
 And


in
 that
 moment,
 I
 thought,
 "Oh
 god,
 Wang


was
 right."


>> Wow.
 that
 once
 things
 got
 tough,
 once


you
 stopped
 giving
 that
 the
 relationship


would
 end
 or
 that
 he
 would
 leave.


>> And
 I
 remember
 thinking,
 "Oh
 my
 god,


Wang
 is
 right."
 But
 then
 I
 got
 really


angry
 and
 I
 was
 like,
 "Why
 did
 I
 let


this
 woman
 whose
 entire
 job
 is
 to


orchestrate
 breakups


influence
 my
 own
 belief
 in
 this


relationship


>> in
 which
 I
 knew
 there
 was
 a
 deep
 love?"


Did
 you
 tell
 her
 by
 the
 way
 like
 we


broke
 up
 or
 did
 you
 keep


>> I
 told
 her
 I
 told
 her


>> and
 how
 did
 she
 react?


>> I
 actually
 don't
 remember
 her
 reaction


but
 probably
 just
 like


>> yeah
 she
 that
 probably
 she's
 not
 going


to
 say
 more
 and
 she
 never
 said
 anything


else
 but
 it's
 just
 her
 quiet
 reads
 her


presence


>> and
 how
 she
 really
 knows
 people
 that


lingered
 and
 had
 this
 like
 long
 staying


power.
 And
 in
 the
 film,
 the
 mistress


says
 something
 like,
 "Wang's
 influence


is
 like
 a
 quiet
 and
 soft
 drizzle.
 You


barely
 feel
 it.
 You
 barely
 hear
 it,
 but


it's
 there."
 And
 I
 really
 feel
 like
 that


was
 her
 influence.


>> And
 I
 don't
 think
 she
 actually


influenced
 the
 outcome
 of
 my


relationship.
 I
 think
 in
 reflection,


what
 I
 realized
 she
 was
 doing
 was
 just


spotting
 something
 that
 I
 didn't
 spot


myself,
 which
 is
 that
 I
 was
 a
 young


woman
 who
 hadn't
 come
 into
 herself
 yet,


who
 didn't
 really
 know
 what
 she
 needed


or
 wanted
 from
 a
 relationship
 and
 was


chasing
 after
 a
 love
 that
 was
 completely


untethered
 to
 reality,
 you
 know,


pragmatics,
 um,
 lifestyle
 values.


>> And
 so
 in
 that
 way,
 it's
 this
 incomplete


love,


>> even
 though
 emotionally
 it
 felt
 like


love.


>> And
 I
 think
 that
 and
 this
 realization


that
 I've
 gone
 through,
 which
 has
 taken


me
 a
 lot
 of
 time,


>> is
 probably
 the
 same
 realization
 that


these
 mistresses
 go
 through.


>> She
 just
 flashed
 you
 this
 little
 truth,


and
 that
 truth
 was
 a
 seed
 that
 grew
 and


grew
 and
 grew.


>> Yeah.
 And
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 denigrate
 the


relationship
 that
 we
 had.
 And
 I
 don't


think
 it
 says
 anything
 about
 his


capacity
 to
 love


>> or
 how
 he
 behaved
 in
 the
 relationship.


>> I
 think
 it's
 just
 that
 she
 spotted
 the


immaturity


that
 we
 were
 at
 at
 that
 point
 in
 our


lives
 and
 it
 was
 not
 going
 to
 serve


either
 of
 us
 well.


>> May
 I
 ask
 are
 you
 are
 you
 single?
 Are


you
 in
 a
 relationship
 now?


>> I'm
 in
 a
 very
 happy
 relationship
 now.


Nice.


>> Have
 you
 told
 teacher
 Wang
 about
 it?


>> No.


>> Yeah.
 No.
 No.
 No.
 But
 I
 would
 very


confidently
 learn.


>> Yeah.
 But
 I
 would
 very
 confidently
 tell


her
 about
 it.
 And
 you
 know
 what
 you
 do?


You'd
 show
 her
 a
 picture
 of
 you
 two


hugging,


>> embracing
 with
 you
 looking
 so
 confident.


>> I
 do.
 I
 don't
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 be


overconfident.
 ever
 the
 optimist
 and


idealist
 that
 I
 am.
 But
 I
 I
 I I


>> I
 do
 feel
 like
 if
 I
 came
 to
 her
 with
 the


relationship
 that
 I
 am
 in
 now
 that
 she


would
 have
 a
 more
 positive
 response


hopefully.


>> Do
 you
 think
 her
 voice
 will
 always
 be
 in


your
 head?


>> I
 hope
 not.


>> No.


>> I
 mean,


well,
 it's
 funny
 because
 that
 So,
 when
 I


say
 I
 hope
 not,
 that
 was
 the
 past
 me,


the
 resentful,
 childish
 me.
 just


knee-jerk
 reaction.


>> Um,


>> but
 thinking
 about
 it,
 I
 I
 think
 what


she
 does
 for
 her
 clients
 is
 a
 remarkable


thing.


>> And


I
 think
 what
 what
 stays
 with
 me
 is
 her


ability
 to
 help
 people
 see
 their
 worth.


>> The
 mistress,
 the
 wife,
 and
 and
 and
 the


husband
 and
 and
 what
 priorities
 they


have
 in
 life.
 And
 obviously
 with
 Fay,


the
 mistress,
 she
 helps
 her
 realize
 her


ultimate
 priorities
 that
 she
 wants
 to
 be


a
 part
 of
 a
 love
 that's
 complete,


>> not
 in
 the
 shadows.


What
 did
 Teacher
 Wang


help
 you
 realize


was
 your
 priority?


I
 think


much
 like
 probably
 the
 advice
 that
 she


slowly
 imparts
 to
 the
 clients
 that
 she


works
 with
 that
 you
 are
 deserving
 of
 a


complete
 love
 that
 can
 withstand
 the


pressures
 of
 time
 and
 life.


>> I
 am
 so
 happy
 for
 you
 that
 you
 feel
 like


you
 found
 that.


>> Thanks.


>> I
 genuinely
 am.
 No,
 no.
 I'm
 full
 stop.
 I


just
 am.
