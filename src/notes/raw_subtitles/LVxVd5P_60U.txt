Thank
 you
 very
 much
 for
 that
 kind


introduction
 and
 also
 thank
 you
 for
 the


opportunity
 to
 be
 here
 today.
 It's
 a


great


honor.
 We're
 talking
 about
 what
 makes


great
 companies.
 Obviously
 you
 would
 all


feel
 that
 return
 to
 shareholders
 is
 one.


I
 would
 claim
 contribution
 to
 society
 is


another.
 And
 for
 company
 like
 Nor


Nordisk
 and
 all
 pharmaceutical
 companies


that
 is
 linked
 to
 innovation
 and
 that's


what
 will
 be
 the
 topic
 of
 of
 my
 speech


today.
 We
 typically
 look
 at
 companies
 at


a
 snapshot
 and
 assess
 a
 company
 but
 when


it
 comes
 to
 innovation
 in
 our
 sector


these
 are
 actually
 journeys
 that
 takes


10
 20
 30
 years
 and
 as
 was
 mentioned
 my


speech
 will
 be
 built
 on
 the
 more
 than
 30


years
 of
 experience
 I
 have
 from


Nordisk
 I'll
 start
 by
 talking
 a
 bit


to
 what
 are
 some
 of
 the
 choice
 you
 can


make
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 innovation


strategy.


ch
 deep
 strength
 and
 then
 give
 a
 few


examples
 of
 how
 we
 have
 apped
 that
 in


some
 real
 innovation


programs.
 So
 starting
 first
 on
 the


innovation


strategy.
 For
 me
 that's
 linked
 to
 having


a
 clear
 purpose
 an
 opportunity
 to
 to


address
 some
 real
 unmid
 need
 in


society
 and
 then
 you
 have
 to
 figure
 out


how
 do
 you
 address
 that
 purpose.
 And
 at


Norisk
 we
 are
 very
 keen
 on
 making
 some


selective
 choice
 about
 some
 core


capabilities
 where
 we
 where
 we
 develop


distinct
 capabilities
 with
 the
 eye
 to
 be


the
 best
 or
 among
 the
 say
 few
 best


companies
 in
 the
 world
 within
 that


narrow


area.
 So
 if
 unfold
 purpose
 first
 the


purpose
 of
 Nordisk
 is
 to
 drive
 change
 to


defeat
 serious
 chronic


diseases.
 So
 there's
 a
 chronic
 disease


part
 and
 there's
 a
 drive
 change


part.
 If
 you
 look
 at
 healthcare
 systems


today,
 they
 are
 typically
 designed
 for


acute
 care.
 I
 typically
 say
 that
 the


best
 way
 to
 enter
 the
 healthcare
 system


is
 to
 arrive
 in
 an
 ambulance
 with,
 you


know,
 a
 lot
 of
 lights
 around
 you
 because


then
 the
 whole
 system
 gets
 in
 effect
 in


a
 very
 effective
 way
 right


away.
 So
 that's
 how
 we
 designed
 healthc.


The
 reality
 today
 is
 that
 most
 burdens


to
 the
 healthcare
 system
 come
 from


chronic
 diseases,
 people
 living
 with


diabetes,
 cardovasc
 disease,
 obesity


etc.
 And
 these
 are
 complex
 diseases


multidisciplinary
 in
 terms
 of
 how
 they


are
 treated
 and
 the
 systems
 are
 not


designed
 for
 that.
 So
 in
 most
 countries


the
 state
 of
 chronic
 disease
 is
 actually


jeodizing
 the
 longevity
 of
 healthc


systems
 and
 that
 is
 the
 exact
 purpose


that
 we
 are
 trying
 to
 address.


to
 take
 the
 burden
 of
 the
 healthc
 system


and
 of
 course
 strength
 the
 health


resilient
 for
 the
 individual
 citizens.


The
 driving
 chains
 we
 also
 take
 very


seriously.
 Obviously
 our
 largest


contribution
 is
 the
 innovation
 we
 make,


but
 we
 also
 focused
 on
 preventing
 the


diseases
 we
 serve.
 So
 how
 can
 we


organize
 large
 cities
 in
 a
 way
 where
 we


prevent
 type
 two
 diabetes,
 we
 prevent


obesity
 to
 create
 capacity
 in
 the


healthc
 system
 to
 actually
 pay
 for
 the


products
 we
 come
 up
 with.
 And
 if
 the


system
 is
 challenged
 in
 doing
 that


today,
 prevention
 is
 as
 important
 as


coming
 up
 with
 innovation.


So
 that
 was
 our
 purpose
 turning
 to
 core


capabilities.


We
 have
 painful
 experience
 in
 innovation


that
 has
 t
 us
 that
 when
 we


actually
 make
 the
 clear
 choice
 stay


within
 our
 core
 capabilities
 we
 are
 more


likely
 to
 succeed
 than
 when
 we
 attempted


by
 the
 latest
 and
 the
 greatest


innovation
 and
 chase
 some
 new
 technology


in
 a
 disease
 area.
 We
 do
 not
 understand


that
 well.
 So
 over
 the
 years
 we
 have


focused
 a
 lot
 on
 working
 with
 the


molecules
 in
 the
 areas
 we
 are
 in
 and


building
 leading
 technologies
 to
 do


that.
 So
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 to
 protein


engineering,
 taking
 an
 insulin
 molecule,


taking
 a
 GLP1
 molecule
 or
 another
 large


biological
 molecule
 being
 able
 to
 modify


that
 to
 improve
 the
 pharmaceutical


benefits
 of
 that
 we
 are
 among
 the


leading
 companies
 in
 doing


that.
 So
 we
 have
 a
 very
 simple
 strategic


innovation
 grid
 where
 on
 one
 axis
 we


have
 technologies.
 So
 a
 select
 few


technologies
 we
 master
 really
 really


well
 and
 then
 we
 apply
 those
 up
 against


a
 few
 set
 of
 diseases


diabetes
 you
 know
 aye
 commitment
 and


then
 we
 have
 based
 on
 adjacency
 thinking


gone
 into
 obesity
 card
 vasc
 disease
 and


a
 few
 other
 diseases
 that
 are
 linked
 to


that
 whole
 cardiometabolic
 space
 and
 you


can
 say
 the
 same
 in
 a
 few
 rare
 diseases


where
 we
 also
 had
 unique
 capabilities.


So
 a
 very
 tight
 strategic
 innovation
 map


where
 we
 can
 build
 strength
 and
 it


actually
 also
 leads
 to
 synergies
 across


our
 value
 chain
 where
 those
 capabilities


lend
 itself
 for
 synergy
 across
 that


value
 chain.
 Now
 that
 sounds
 maybe
 a
 bit


tight
 and
 based
 on
 Davis
 comment
 I
 will


also
 bring
 in
 culture
 because
 we
 do


allow
 for
 a
 bit
 of
 say
 experimentation


and
 I
 have
 to
 admit
 that
 while
 this
 grid


is
 really
 good
 at
 guiding
 our


researchers
 behind
 most
 products
 there's


actually
 a
 very
 stub
 researcher
 that


that
 decided
 to
 break
 some
 of
 the
 rules


on
 the
 way


to
 a
 bit
 go
 against
 what
 management


thought
 was
 the
 right
 thing
 to
 do
 and
 if


you
 Think
 about
 our
 whole
 GLP
 one


venture
 which
 I'll
 talk
 a
 bit
 about
 in


in
 a
 minute
 that
 came
 after
 seven
 years


of
 success
 in
 insulin.
 So
 you
 can


imagine
 when
 somebody
 suggested
 let's


focus
 on
 something
 else
 most
 of


management
 felt
 maybe
 that
 was
 not
 a


good
 idea.
 I
 would
 say
 however
 that
 it


was
 driving
 against
 the
 same
 purpose
 the


same
 unmmet
 need
 and
 it
 was
 leveraging


the
 same
 set
 of
 core
 capabilities.
 So
 it


was
 actually
 on
 strategy
 I
 have
 to
 say.


So
 leaving
 a
 bit
 innovation
 strategy
 and


then
 going
 to
 some
 of
 the
 examples.
 I


already
 started
 on
 GLP1
 glucogon
 like


peptide
 one.
 This
 is
 the
 molecule
 behind


say
 the
 strong
 growth
 of
 Noris
 right


now.
 It's
 a
 natural
 hormone
 that
 all
 of


us
 have
 in
 our
 body
 right
 now.
 It
 helps


regulate
 your
 glucose
 level
 after
 lunch.


It
 also
 has
 a
 lot
 of
 other
 additional


benefits
 which
 creates
 it
 creates
 one
 of


the
 biggest
 opportunities
 in
 terms
 of


addressing
 many
 of
 these
 cardiometabolic


diseases.
 The
 natural
 G1
 you
 have
 in


your
 body
 if
 you
 extracted
 that
 and
 want


to
 use
 a
 medicine
 it
 doesn't
 work


because
 it
 only
 lasts
 for
 very
 very


short
 time.
 So
 our
 bodies
 are
 designed


to
 produce
 it
 all
 the
 time.
 So
 from
 a


research
 point
 of
 view,
 it
 doesn't
 work


as
 a
 medicine
 because
 if
 you
 take
 it


somehow
 it
 would
 last
 only
 for
 a
 few


seconds.
 So
 that's
 where
 our
 core


capabilities
 came
 in.
 So
 the
 protein


engineering
 modifying
 first
 to
 make
 it


last
 for
 one
 day
 so
 you
 can
 make
 it
 a


daily
 injection
 and
 then
 continue
 the


innovation
 game
 to
 make
 it
 a
 once


weekly.
 So
 a
 weekly
 injection
 with
 even


improved
 pharmaceutical
 benefits
 and


also
 safety
 benefits
 and
 also
 the
 quest


to
 make
 it
 a
 tablet
 which
 was
 from
 a


textbook
 point
 of
 view
 impossible.
 So
 if


you
 ask
 any
 scientist
 if
 you
 take
 a


protein
 formulate
 it
 into
 a
 tablet
 put


it
 in
 the
 stomach
 will
 that
 be
 absorbed


into
 the
 bloodstream?


People
 say
 no
 because
 the
 enzymes
 in


your
 stomach
 that
 just
 broke
 down
 the


steak
 you
 had
 will
 also
 kill
 this
 tablet


because
 it's
 a
 protein
 and
 enimes
 will


kill
 it.
 So
 an
 example
 of
 how
 our
 core


cabilities
 come
 into
 play
 is
 what
 you


then
 do
 with
 that
 how
 can
 you
 actually


make
 a
 unique


formulation
 together
 with
 a
 partnership


with
 a
 biotech
 company
 that
 creates
 a


local
 pH
 environment
 that
 actually
 you


know
 fenders
 off
 the
 enzymes.
 So
 there's


time
 for
 the
 Gilp
 one
 to
 be
 released,
 go


through
 the
 membrane
 and
 into
 the


bloodstream.
 So
 that
 was
 a
 major


revolution
 and
 that
 is
 now
 in
 the
 market


for
 type
 two
 diabetes
 and
 we
 have


submitted
 it
 for
 approval
 in
 obesity
 in


the


US.
 So
 the
 Gilbon
 journey
 started
 in
 in


diabetes
 we
 saw
 that
 you
 also
 lose


weight.


We
 were
 worried
 about
 actually
 pursuing


the
 obesity
 indication
 because
 back


then
 development
 of
 medicines
 for


obesity
 was
 a
 graveyard
 of
 failed


interventions.
 Some
 of
 the
 products
 even


turned
 out
 to
 be
 dangerous
 and
 were


taken
 off
 the
 market.
 So
 we
 had
 this


fantastic
 hope
 in
 type
 two
 diabetes
 but


we
 saw
 that
 patients
 also
 lost
 weight.


So
 we
 felt
 we
 actually
 had
 to
 study
 that


and
 was
 actually
 a
 bit
 say
 decision


made
 from
 say
 a
 respect
 for
 patients


because
 if
 if
 there
 was
 a
 weight
 loss


observed
 we
 knew
 that
 it
 would
 be
 used


for
 weight
 loss
 so
 we
 had
 to
 study
 it
 to


show
 what
 was
 actually
 the
 safety
 of


that
 so
 it
 was
 actually
 a
 risk
 taken
 to


support
 patient
 safety
 and
 then
 I
 think


as
 we
 all
 know
 it
 turns
 into
 a
 fantastic


commercial
 opportunity


att
 weight
 loss
 agent
 and
 down
 the
 road


also
 shown
 that
 it
 reduces
 risk
 cut


vascular
 disease,
 kidney


disease,
 liver
 disease
 and
 later
 this


year
 will
 have
 data
 on
 potential
 use
 in


Alzheimer's


disease.
 So
 the
 quest
 to
 continue


invasion
 in
 Gilb
 one
 continues.
 We
 have


more
 great
 ideas
 and
 we
 also
 now


combining
 it
 with
 other
 biologies.


biology
 we
 believe
 lot
 is
 is
 amin
 so
 we


believe
 it's
 complementary
 to
 gp1
 and
 we


have
 late
 state
 clinical
 trials
 going
 on


there
 so
 the
 journey


continues
 another
 example
 of
 how
 the


core
 capabilities
 and
 the
 purpose
 comes


into
 play
 is
 weekly
 insulin
 so
 nog
 nye


history
 of
 making
 insulins
 as
 we
 all


know
 and
 when
 you
 live
 with
 type
 one


diabetes
 or
 type
 two
 diabetes
 you
 need


to
 inject


insulins
 on
 a
 regular
 basis


longer
 produce
 insulin
 no
 longer
 produce


enough


insulin
 and
 that
 takes
 place
 once
 a
 day


or
 several
 times
 a
 day
 and
 obviously


it's
 a
 big
 burden
 for
 for
 the
 patients


because
 you
 have
 to
 combine
 that
 with


constant
 glucose
 monitoring
 so
 would
 it


be
 possible
 to
 make
 a
 weekly
 insulin


that
 would
 take
 the
 burden
 away
 from


these
 daily
 treatments
 and
 again
 most
 of


the
 key
 opinion
 leaders
 the
 clinicians


we
 work
 with
 say
 that's
 impossible


because
 who
 would
 like
 to
 inject
 insulin


that
 stays
 for
 week
 because
 that's


dangerous
 you
 can
 get
 too
 low
 glucose


level,
 it
 can
 kill
 you.
 Øh,
 so
 we
 said,


well,
 let's
 again
 work
 a
 bit
 with
 this


insulin
 molecule.
 How
 can
 we
 leverage


our
 protein
 engineering
 capabilities?


And
 we
 actually
 made
 it.
 We
 are
 now


launching
 the
 first
 the
 world's
 first


weekly
 insulin
 where
 people
 with
 type


two
 diabetes
 goes
 from
 365
 injections
 to


52.


We
 proved
 that
 it
 regulates
 glucose


level
 as
 well
 as
 st
 injections
 and
 even


at
 a
 very
 attractive
 safety
 profile.
 So


there
 are
 many
 of


these
 impossibles
 that
 when
 you
 have
 a


strong
 purpose
 in
 terms
 of
 serving
 a


defined
 set
 of
 of
 patients
 with
 the


unmit
 needs
 and
 you
 have
 the
 deepest


capability
 in
 the
 world
 in
 a
 narrow


field
 you
 can
 overcome
 conventional


barriers.
 The
 next
 quest
 when
 it
 comes


to
 insulin
 is
 actually
 developing
 a


glucose
 sensitive


insulin.
 When
 you
 live
 with
 diabetes,


wouldn't
 it
 be
 fantastic
 to
 get
 a


insulin
 injected
 that's
 actually
 glucose


sensitive?
 So
 when
 you
 eat
 it
 will


switch
 on,
 bring
 the
 glucose
 level
 down


and
 when
 it's
 brought
 down
 it
 switches


off.
 So
 a
 smart
 insulin


parents
 writing
 to
 me.
 I
 have
 a


particular
 parent
 who
 already
 lost
 one


child
 because
 of
 a
 very
 very
 difficult


to
 control
 type
 one
 diabetes.
 And
 he
 is


really
 really
 interested
 in
 our
 clinical


development
 of
 this
 because
 he
 has


another
 child
 with
 type
 one
 diabetes.
 So


any
 buffering
 effect
 can
 be
 very


important
 for
 these
 patients.
 We
 have


proven
 that
 we
 can
 make
 the
 switch
 work


so
 it
 start
 releasing
 insulin
 and
 it


stops
 releasing
 insulin
 when
 the
 glucose


level
 is
 high.
 It's
 still
 too
 shortlift


to
 be
 a
 drug
 but
 going
 back
 to
 the
 first


example
 I
 gave
 with
 GP1
 we
 we
 solved


that
 down
 the
 road.
 So
 I
 start


blossoming
 when
 I
 talk
 about
 it
 because


this
 is
 very
 emotional
 for
 these


patients.
 So
 I
 hope
 I
 have
 made
 the


point
 that
 innovation
 is
 essential
 for


our
 industry.
 Øh,
 I
 took
 as
 CEO
 7
 and
 a


half
 years
 ago
 and
 during
 this
 tenure


I've
 seen
 the
 advent
 of
 obesity
 marking


market
 opening
 up
 øh
 being
 the
 only


company
 more
 less
 our
 share
 price
 eight


doubling
 and
 then
 coming
 a
 bit
 down
 it's


still
 a
 three
 times
 up
 since
 I
 since
 I


took
 over
 so
 clearly
 there's
 link


between
 innovation
 and
 shareholder


return
 I
 hope
 I
 also
 made
 the
 point
 that


by
 having
 guidance
 by
 clear
 purpose


addressing
 unmade
 need
 for
 patient
 and


society


compared
 to
 others
 you
 have
 a
 better


likelihood
 of
 success
 than
 others
 and
 by


saying
 to to
 that
 I'm
 quite
 convinced


that
 will
 be
 a
 successful
 company
 for


the
 future
 also
 and
 hopefully
 be
 one
 of


the
 best
 companies
 for
 the
 future.
 Thank


you
 very
 much
 for
 listening.
