Hi
 everybody.
 I'm
 Nicolola
 Tangan,
 the


CEO
 of
 the
 Norwegian
 So
 Wealth
 Fund
 and


today
 I'm
 really
 delighted
 because
 I
 am


here
 in
 Singapore
 with
 Dylan
 Ple,
 the


CEO
 of
 Teasec
 and
 Tease
 is
 Singapore's


so
 wealth
 fund
 managing
 roughly
 300


billion
 US.
 Now
 Dylan,
 he
 has
 been
 in


charge
 of
 Teisec
 since
 2021


and
 uh
 after
 a
 remarkable
 journey


building
 up
 to
 the
 leading
 law
 firm
 in


the
 country
 and
 so
 big
 thank
 you
 for


taking
 the
 time.


>> Thank
 you
 Nikolai.
 Pleasure
 to
 be
 here.


>> Lots
 of
 things
 to
 talk
 about
 but
 let's


just
 kick
 off
 first.


>> I
 wish
 I'
 given
 you
 better
 weather.
 I


think
 it's
 pretty
 good.


>> Um
 what
 is
 TESOS?


>> Well
 I
 think
 that
 people
 define
 us
 in


two
 different
 ways.
 Um
 I
 think
 most


people
 would
 see
 us
 as
 a
 sovereign


wealth
 fund
 if
 you're
 based
 outside
 of


um
 of
 Singapore
 because
 we're
 owned
 by


the
 government
 but
 we're
 really
 an


investment
 holding
 company.
 We
 own
 uh


three
 different
 portfolios.
 You
 know
 we


have
 operating
 companies
 which
 together


have
 something
 like
 about
 150
 billion
 US


in
 revenues.
 We
 have
 a
 global
 portfolio


of
 investments
 around
 the
 world
 mostly


minority
 investments.
 And
 we
 also
 have
 a


business
 uh
 that
 builds
 asset
 management


platforms
 and
 also
 invest
 in
 private


equity
 funds
 and
 alternative
 investment


managers.
 What's
 the
 main
 difference


between
 you
 and
 GIC
 which
 is
 the
 other


>> so
 GIC
 manages
 the
 government's
 reserves


uh
 and
 so
 it
 is
 really
 a
 fund
 manager
 uh


no
 different
 from
 NBIM
 I
 would
 say
 and


so
 they're
 also
 multi-asset
 uh
 multi


strategy


>> for
 Tamasic
 we
 have
 been
 set
 up
 from
 day


one
 as
 an
 equities
 owner
 you
 know
 so


whether
 is
 in
 relation
 to
 the
 companies


that
 we
 control
 or
 whether
 it's
 in


relation
 to
 our
 global
 investment


portfolio
 we're
 primarily
 equities
 we


have
 a
 very
 small
 credit
 portfolio


something
 like
 about
 uh
 two
 odd
 percent


of
 our
 portfolio
 value
 but
 the
 rest
 of


it
 equities


>> and
 so
 if
 you
 look
 at
 from
 that


perspective
 the
 big
 difference
 is
 GIC


manages
 money
 and
 we
 own
 our
 assets
 and


so
 therefore
 for
 us
 it's
 very
 important


that
 we
 uh
 recycle
 our
 capital
 because


that's
 how
 we
 get
 capital
 to
 invest
 and


so
 we
 have
 to
 make
 the
 trade-offs


between
 sometimes
 owning
 it
 for
 longer


or
 secondly
 trying
 to
 recycle
 some
 of


the
 capital
 into
 better
 opportunities


for
 for
 long-term


>> and
 if
 you
 look
 at
 if
 you
 look
 at
 the


two
 of
 you
 combined
 how
 important
 are


you
 for
 Singapore


So,
 MESGIC
 and
 Tamasic
 are
 part
 of
 what


we
 call
 the
 net
 investment
 returns


contribution
 framework
 which
 the


government
 put
 in
 place
 um
 some
 years


ago
 in
 order
 for
 the
 government
 to
 have


a
 view
 of
 the
 expected
 returns
 of
 all


three
 financial
 agencies


>> and
 that
 will
 help
 the
 government
 plan


its
 own
 budgetary
 requirements


especially
 in
 terms
 of
 the
 operating


budget
 the
 government.
 So,
 in
 a
 sense,


we
 are
 quite
 we're
 very
 important
 from


the
 perspective
 of
 having
 to
 deliver


those
 long-term
 returns
 for
 the


government
 to
 be
 able
 to
 have
 that
 that


funding
 available
 for
 its
 own
 programs


and
 quite
 a
 bit
 of
 it
 goes
 towards


funding
 the
 social
 programs
 of


Singapore.


>> Do
 they
 leave
 you
 alone
 or
 they


interfere
 in
 your
 business?
 So
 from
 a


tamastic
 perspective
 they
 have
 from
 the


first
 from
 get-go
 from
 the
 day
 that
 we


were
 set
 up
 left
 us
 alone
 because
 the


government
 set
 us
 up
 because
 they
 wanted


to
 make
 sure
 that
 the
 policy
 frameworks


governing
 companies
 that
 they
 had
 set
 up


a
 decade
 earlier
 um
 would
 be
 seen
 from
 a


regulatory
 perspective
 and
 they
 would


leave
 Tamasic
 to
 oversee
 the
 the


commercial
 operations
 of
 those


businesses
 and
 that
 has
 been
 the
 case


from
 the
 from
 the
 very
 beginning.
 We
 do


not
 have
 a
 government
 nominee
 on
 our


board.
 Our
 chairman
 was
 a
 former


government
 minister
 but
 he
 operates


independently
 of
 the
 government
 and
 so


that
 is
 a
 bit
 unique
 I
 would
 say
 uh
 in


terms
 of
 what
 people
 will
 classify
 as
 a


sovereign
 wealth
 fund.


>> Now
 in
 countries
 like
 Norway
 the
 the


government
 owns
 uh
 stakes
 in
 the


businesses
 individually
 whilst
 here
 you


put
 it
 into
 a
 holding
 company.
 What
 are


the
 what
 are
 the
 kind
 of
 pros
 and
 cons


of
 operating
 like
 this?
 Well,
 I
 think


that
 if
 you
 if
 you
 own
 them
 separately,


uh
 I
 think
 you
 have
 to
 figure
 out


whether
 you
 get
 the
 benefit
 of
 synergies


between
 those
 companies,
 whether
 the


insights
 you
 get
 from
 one,
 you
 can,
 you


know,
 put
 it
 uh
 across
 to
 the
 others
 as


well.
 Take
 sustainability
 for
 example.


>> Um
 because
 we
 have
 it
 under
 one


umbrella,
 we
 have
 something
 called
 the


Tamasi
 portfolio
 company
 sustainability


council.
 We
 are
 a
 member
 of
 it
 as
 well


and
 we
 bring
 in
 the
 CTOs
 and
 CEOs
 of
 all


our
 companies
 together
 with
 ourselves
 so


that
 we
 can
 exchange
 ideas,
 get
 insights


and
 so
 on.
 You
 think
 about
 adaptation,


resilience,
 some
 of
 our
 companies
 are


far
 more
 ahead
 of
 the
 curve
 than
 even
 we


are.
 And
 so
 the
 learnings
 that
 we
 can


have
 from
 that
 is
 actually
 quite


critical
 for
 us
 and
 having
 all
 the


companies
 under
 one
 umbrella
 allows
 us


to
 convene
 uh
 these
 companies
 and
 and


share
 their
 their
 insights
 with
 each


other.


>> It's
 a
 bit
 like
 uh
 the
 function
 of
 the


Wenbergs
 in
 Sweden.
 I
 guess


>> it
 is
 that
 way.
 Now
 we
 don't
 set
 up


these
 companies
 under
 an
 umbrella
 for
 us


to
 be
 able
 to
 do
 things
 together.
 If


there
 are
 opportunity
 to
 do
 things


together,
 it
 must
 come
 bottoms
 up.
 A


willingness
 by
 by
 them
 to
 collaborate


together
 or
 if
 we
 have
 a
 point
 of
 view,


then
 we
 will,
 you
 know,
 sort
 of
 put
 it


across
 to
 them.
 But
 really
 the
 the


getting
 together
 of
 our
 companies
 is


really
 up
 to
 those
 boards
 because


ultimately
 we
 hold
 them
 accountable
 for


their
 performance.


>> What
 would
 you
 say
 is
 the
 um
 investment


philosophy
 of
 Teas?
 How
 do
 you
 how
 do


you
 think
 what's
 your
 time
 frame
 and
 how


do
 you
 think?


>> So
 the
 idea
 for
 us
 to
 do
 is
 to
 deliver


sustainable
 good
 sustainable
 returns


over
 the
 long
 term.
 So
 the
 first
 thing


is
 the
 long-term
 orientation
 of
 our


portfolio
 and
 by
 the
 way
 it's
 a


necessity
 given
 that
 we
 own
 these


operating
 businesses
 um
 and
 many
 of


which
 we
 would
 continue
 to
 hold
 for
 a


long
 time
 you
 know
 so
 in
 that
 respect


you
 have
 to
 think
 about
 things
 like


climate
 change
 and
 AI
 because
 these
 are


going
 to
 be
 drivers
 of
 value
 or
 they're


going
 to
 help
 displace
 you
 in
 some
 uh


form
 or
 another.
 Um
 so
 for
 us
 it's
 about


delivering
 financial
 returns
 but
 being


able
 to
 deliver
 other
 other
 outcomes


associated
 with
 the
 kind
 of
 companies


that
 we
 own
 and
 and
 operate.
 Uh
 from
 the


perspective
 of
 global
 portfolio
 there
 I


would
 say
 two
 things
 that
 we
 look
 for.


Number
 one
 is
 clearly
 financial
 returns.


That's
 the
 first
 and
 foremost
 um
 uh


requirement.
 The
 second
 insights
 that
 we


get
 that
 we
 could
 then
 use
 across
 the


portfolio
 in
 order
 to
 enhance
 value
 you


know
 and
 that
 would
 include
 um
 not
 just


the
 Singapore
 based
 companies
 but
 other


companies
 we
 invest
 around
 the
 world.
 So


this
 network
 effect
 is
 quite
 important


for
 us.
 So
 we
 say
 that
 we
 have
 to
 be


aworked
 organization
 going
 into
 this


decade
 and
 beyond.
 And
 when
 we
 look
 at


aworked
 organization
 we
 have
 an
 internal


f focus
 on
 that
 between
 our
 uh
 between


ourselves
 and
 our
 offices
 around
 the


world.
 But
 we
 also
 want
 to
 make
 sure
 our


portfolio
 companies
 are
 areworked
 where


it
 makes
 sense
 as
 well.
 How
 do
 you
 make


investment
 decisions?
 What
 does
 the


structure
 look
 like?


>> Well,
 much
 of
 it
 is
 devolved
 to
 the


management
 team
 of
 Tamasic.
 Um,
 and
 we


uh
 we
 have
 a
 certain
 threshold
 value


where
 anything
 up
 to
 that
 level
 is


determined
 only
 by
 the
 management
 team


through
 our
 investment
 committee.
 uh


which
 actually
 is
 technically
 a


committee
 of
 the
 of
 the
 holding
 company


but
 devolved
 to
 um
 to
 to
 management
 to


make
 decisions
 and
 beyond
 that
 level
 it


goes
 to
 executive
 committee
 of
 the
 board


of
 which
 I'm
 a
 member
 and
 then
 beyond


that
 if
 it's
 very
 large
 it
 goes
 to
 the


board
 now
 that's
 for
 investments


>> and
 so
 how
 how
 big
 does
 it
 need
 for
 it


to
 be
 before
 you
 you
 get
 involved


>> it
 has
 to
 be
 over
 a
 billion
 dollars
 uh


US
 for
 it
 to
 go
 beyond
 the
 management


team


>> right


>> yeah
 and
 and
 per
 per
 transaction
 and


that
 includes
 if
 you
 structure
 in
 a


where
 the
 amounts
 may
 be
 invested
 over


over
 a
 period
 of
 time.
 Um
 but
 I
 would


say
 that
 um
 the
 most
 important
 thing
 is


uh
 that
 institutional
 issues
 where
 it
 it


concerns
 a
 shift
 of
 the
 organization
 or


shift
 in
 strategy
 that
 has
 to
 go
 to
 the


board


>> because
 the
 board
 ultimately
 is


responsible
 to
 the
 shareholder
 for
 how


we
 operate.
 So
 for
 instance
 you
 have
 the


geographical
 split
 of
 your
 assets
 and


and
 I
 think
 it's
 quite
 uh
 quite
 cool
 you


have
 it
 down
 in
 the
 reception
 area.
 So


it's
 well
 actually
 it's
 it's
 out
 on
 the


street.
 So
 when
 you


>> we're
 very
 transparent


>> approach
 your
 building
 you
 can
 see
 where


you
 have
 the
 money.
 How
 how
 is
 that


decision
 made?


>> Uh
 that's
 made
 by
 management
 and


proposed
 to
 the
 board
 for
 the
 board
 to


understand
 where
 we
 are
 headed
 towards


in
 terms
 of
 portfolio
 construction


>> and
 that
 goes
 towards
 the
 capital


allocation
 that
 we
 put
 in
 place


yearbyear.


>> That
 capital
 allocation
 is
 also
 shared


with
 the
 board
 for
 them
 to
 endorse.
 So


tell
 me
 about
 the
 split
 now
 the
 current


split
 just
 how
 um
 what
 does
 that
 reflect


in
 terms
 of
 your
 I
 guess
 geopolitical


thinking.


>> So
 much
 of
 how
 we
 have
 uh
 constructed


portfolio
 over
 the
 last
 20
 odd
 years


since
 we
 started
 to
 become
 a
 global


investor
 has
 really
 been
 determined
 by


the
 external
 environment.
 So
 if
 you
 look


at
 the
 at
 the
 2000s
 really
 it's
 about


the
 opening
 up
 of
 Asia
 following
 WTO
 the


extension
 of
 India
 and
 China
 in


particular
 and
 and
 the
 ability
 of
 these


two
 economies
 of
 becoming
 not
 just


plugged
 into
 a
 into
 a
 global
 economy
 but


becoming
 leading
 economies
 for
 the
 world


which
 has
 largely
 happened
 India
 a


little
 bit
 later
 than
 China
 obviously


>> and
 so
 um
 and
 so
 you
 know
 when
 we
 looked


at
 we
 realized
 that
 you
 know
 we
 couldn't


be
 Singaporeentric
 we
 had
 to
 step
 out


and
 therefore
 going
 out
 to
 Asia
 first


made
 sense
 since
 Asia
 is
 our
 sort
 of


backyard
 if
 I
 can
 call
 it
 that.
 But
 in


the
 2010s
 following
 the
 GFC,
 we


recognized
 that
 you
 need
 to
 have
 a


balanced
 portfolio
 and
 you
 couldn't
 just


have
 an
 emerging
 market
 focus
 which
 was


really
 where
 we
 were
 for
 the
 previous


decade
 outside
 of
 Singapore.


>> And
 so
 that's
 when
 we
 start
 to
 invest


significantly
 US
 and
 Europe.
 So
 our


exposure
 to
 US
 and
 Europe
 in
 2011
 before


we
 embarked
 on
 2020
 uh
 road
 map
 was


about
 11%
 in
 aggregate.
 By
 the
 end
 of


decade
 was
 33%.
 M


>> so
 three
 times
 and
 the
 portfolio
 doubled


in
 value
 so
 that's
 a
 significant
 uplift


that
 meant
 that
 capital


>> what
 drove
 that
 what
 was
 the
 thinking


behind
 that


>> well
 because
 for
 the
 one
 thing
 that
 the


GFC
 taught
 us
 is
 that
 actually
 you
 have


to
 look
 at
 first
 of
 all
 macro
 factors


and
 look
 at
 strength
 of
 economies
 as
 you


think
 about
 your
 thematic
 investing
 you


got
 to
 go
 where
 there
 is
 capital
 the


capital
 flows
 but
 also
 where
 you
 see
 the


best
 of
 innovation
 and
 quite
 apart
 from


what
 we
 saw
 in
 China
 uh
 we
 thought
 that


the
 US
 would
 be
 clearly
 uh
 the
 leader
 in


innovation


uh
 for
 Europe,
 we
 always
 felt
 that
 they


had
 globally
 competitive
 companies
 that


were
 extremely
 good
 despite
 whatever


people
 may
 think
 about
 the
 macro
 or


Europe.
 We
 still
 have
 that
 view
 that
 you


can,
 you
 know,
 we're
 not
 a
 macro


investor.
 So
 we're
 not
 saying
 avoid


Europe
 because
 of
 the
 macro,


>> but
 we
 are
 invested
 in
 companies.
 So


what
 was
 driven
 by
 was
 this
 whole
 issue


of
 globalization
 and
 which
 are
 the


likely
 winners
 depending
 on
 the
 sectors


that
 we
 were
 in.
 Now
 in
 the
 last
 decade


when
 we
 started
 to
 really
 push
 out
 in


actual
 fact
 we
 were
 driven
 by
 themes
 you


know
 we
 were
 looking
 at
 things
 like


urbanization
 rising
 middle-
 inome


populations
 you
 know
 the
 comparative


advantages
 of
 companies
 which
 will
 be


like
 linked
 to
 IP
 for
 example
 for


example
 biotech
 and
 then
 looking
 at


domestic
 champions
 who
 will
 go
 beyond
 uh


their
 their
 geographies
 uh
 into
 the


world
 uh
 later
 on
 we
 looked
 at
 trends


and
 trends
 are
 things
 like
 you
 know
 four


broad
 trends
 we
 have
 are
 digitalization


future
 consumption
 longer
 lifespan,


sustainable
 living
 which
 embodies
 within


it
 obviously
 things
 like
 sustainability.


Um
 and
 so
 as
 we
 looked
 into
 that
 you


know
 you
 could
 find
 you
 could
 actually


determine
 which
 geographies
 are
 more


likely
 give
 you
 those
 opportunities
 and


so
 allocation
 of
 capital
 went
 to
 some


extent
 according
 to
 trends
 uh


geographies
 according
 to
 where
 we


thought
 there
 would
 be
 flows
 and
 where


we
 could
 get
 the
 alpha
 and
 then
 finally


uh
 into
 sectors
 and
 so
 yeah
 you
 sourced


some
 of
 the
 uh
 increased
 allocation
 here


by
 reducing
 your
 exposure
 to
 China.


Actually
 I
 would
 not
 say
 that
 we
 reduce


exposure.
 Exposure
 kept
 on
 going
 up
 but


we
 could
 monetize
 on
 China
 because
 China


is
 giving
 us
 true
 alpha


>> and
 take
 that
 capital
 invest
 in
 US
 and


Europe.


>> Do
 you
 think
 do
 do
 uh
 do
 you
 think
 you


can
 predict
 the
 future?


>> No.
 And
 the
 reason
 why
 I'm
 saying
 that


last
 weekend
 I
 sat
 together
 with
 uh


seven
 of
 the
 cleverest
 people
 I
 know


>> and
 we
 did
 the
 same
 a
 year
 ago
 and
 we


tape
 record


>> Yeah.


>> uh
 what
 we
 thought
 was
 going
 to
 happen


over
 the
 next
 12
 months.
 And
 we
 talked


about
 financial
 markets,
 geopolitics,


you
 know,
 just
 all
 the
 variables
 and
 we


didn't
 predict
 any
 of
 the
 things.
 I


think
 we
 were
 like
 80%
 wrong.


>> I
 think
 we've
 taken
 a
 view
 we
 can
 never


predict.


>> It's
 incredible.


>> Now
 um
 you
 can't
 predict
 how
 do
 you


operate
 in
 that
 world
 then
 that's
 the


that's
 the
 tricky
 thing
 right
 for
 all
 of


us.
 You
 know
 I
 I
 think
 the
 first
 thing


you
 have
 to
 do
 is
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 you


engage
 engage
 broadly
 globally.
 You


can't
 sit
 in
 Singapore
 and
 feel
 that
 you


will
 only
 get
 information
 by
 reading


things
 doing
 Zoom
 calls
 or
 team
 calls


and
 things
 like
 that.
 You
 have
 to
 go
 out


there
 and
 meet
 people,
 meet
 them


regularly,
 exchange
 views.
 They
 see


things
 from
 a
 different
 angle,
 different


perspective
 from
 where
 they
 are
 seated


and
 you
 see
 things
 from
 different
 angle


>> and
 um
 and
 I
 think
 that
 helps
 the
 the


learnings
 for
 all
 of
 us.
 And
 I
 think


that's
 the
 first
 thing.
 The
 second
 thing


you
 have
 to
 cleareyed
 about
 what
 are


your
 objectives
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day


you
 know
 u
 financial
 returns
 and
 other


outcomes
 you
 need
 to
 do
 and
 you
 have
 to


then
 be
 disciplined
 about
 how
 you


allocate
 your
 capital
 for
 those
 outcomes


but
 also
 how
 you
 build
 muscle
 in


organization
 for
 that.
 So
 one
 of the


things
 that
 we
 have
 learned
 over
 the


last
 um
 I
 would
 say
 um
 15
 years
 is
 that


investment
 capabilities
 by
 themselves


will
 not
 be
 enough
 for
 you
 to
 get
 um


around
 the
 the
 shifts
 that
 you
 see
 out


there.
 So
 we've
 been
 building
 our


geopolitical
 capabilities
 since
 2017.


You
 know
 we
 set
 up
 office
 in
 DC
 in
 2017.


people
 asking
 us
 why
 do
 you
 feel
 you


need
 to
 set
 up
 office
 in
 2017
 and
 we


felt
 that
 what
 was
 happening
 back
 back


then
 not
 just
 US
 China
 but
 even
 with
 the


United
 States
 required
 us
 to
 be
 on
 top


of
 of
 of
 shifts
 that
 were
 happening


there
 that
 could
 have
 global


ramifications
 and
 so
 we've
 been
 building


that
 we've
 been
 building
 up
 more


portfolio
 strategy
 risk
 management
 uh
 um


capabilities
 and
 tools
 uh
 AI
 um
 you
 know


uh
 digitalization


>> so
 um
 without
 um
 uh
 talking
 about


politics
 just
 from
 your
 point
 of
 view


what
 are
 the
 main
 geopolitical
 trends


you're
 seeing
 just
 now
 which
 have


implications
 for
 you


>> well
 I
 think
 the
 first
 thing
 we
 have
 to


bear
 in
 mind
 is
 that
 um
 the
 impact
 of


liberation
 day
 and
 the
 tariffs
 I
 don't


think
 anybody
 can
 predict
 what
 the
 real


impact
 would
 be
 you
 know
 today
 you're


increasingly
 hearing
 that
 it's
 a


one-time
 effect
 on
 inflation
 perhaps
 but


over
 time
 it
 just
 becomes
 part
 of
 cost


structure
 and
 won't
 see
 accelerating


inflation
 uh
 that
 means
 you
 have
 to
 take


the
 view
 that
 the
 costs
 involved
 in


production
 will
 continue
 to
 be
 stable.


>> So
 what
 do
 you
 think
 are
 the
 implica
 the


long-term
 implications
 of
 the
 tariffs?


>> Well,
 so
 so
 tariffs
 first
 of
 all
 I
 think


that
 you
 will
 see
 uh
 I
 think
 some


inflationary
 impact
 but
 it
 will
 be


different
 depending
 on
 countries
 and


geographies
 and
 sectors
 and
 products
 and


services.
 You
 cannot
 negate
 the
 effect


of
 China
 as
 the
 leading
 manufacturing


hub
 of
 the
 world
 but
 you
 can
 then
 talk


about
 resilience.
 So
 tariffs
 makes
 you


re
 reclassify
 or
 recalibrate
 what
 it


means
 to
 have
 supply
 chain
 resilience


>> because
 before
 supply
 chain
 resilience


would
 have
 meant
 China
 plus
 one
 and
 the


plus
 one
 could
 be
 Mexico
 could
 be
 uh


Southeast
 Asia.
 Today
 or
 India
 today


that
 question
 of
 plus
 one
 is
 also
 up
 in


the
 air
 because
 of
 of
 of
 tariffs.
 So


then
 the
 question
 comes
 about
 is
 okay
 if


you
 want
 to
 have
 supply
 chain
 resilience


how
 do
 you
 then
 operate
 in
 markets
 where


you
 have
 something
 that
 gets
 yourself


out
 of
 the
 realm
 of
 the
 highest
 impact


of
 tariffs
 you
 know
 in
 particular
 uh


especially
 going
 into
 the
 major
 markets


and
 that's
 really
 the
 United
 States


where
 tariffs
 are
 are
 relevant
 um
 the


second
 thing
 is
 you
 got
 to
 think
 about


what
 it
 means
 for
 global
 trade
 because


all
 of
 us
 are
 trading
 countries
 yeah
 you


know
 every
 one
 of
 us
 and
 so
 our


lifeblood
 is
 trade
 and
 investment
 and


they
 go
 together
 and
 so
 as
 you
 look
 at


the
 at
 what's
 have
 been
 happening
 with


uh
 with
 with
 tariffs.
 Then
 the
 question


comes
 as
 to
 what
 happens
 not
 just
 with


point-to-point
 trade
 but
 intermediate


trade
 which
 is
 so
 much
 part
 of
 the


supply
 chains
 that
 we've
 been
 relying
 on


to
 in
 effect
 to
 get
 a
 disinflationary


world
 you
 know
 from
 a
 cost
 basis
 when


you
 look
 at
 production


>> and
 then
 you
 got
 to
 think
 about
 where
 um


uh
 you
 you
 know
 what
 do
 you
 have
 to
 you


have
 to
 think
 about
 things
 like
 you
 know


the
 US
 China
 um
 competition
 how
 does
 it


affect
 you
 in
 terms
 of
 where
 you
 invest


in
 the
 US
 and
 where
 you
 invest
 in
 China


>> uh
 and
 for
 that
 matter
 way
 invest
 in


other
 countries
 as
 well.
 So
 increasingly


if
 you
 think
 about
 the
 world
 today
 um


it's
 not
 a
 bipolar
 world
 it's
 a


multipolar
 world
 but
 the
 definition
 of


multipolarity


depends
 on
 on
 the
 person
 who
 thinks


about
 it


>> but
 you
 do
 have
 a
 you
 do
 have
 a


strengthening
 of
 the
 of
 the
 block
 of
 uh


you
 know
 India
 Russia
 China
 which
 you


didn't
 have
 before
 as
 exemplified
 in
 the


>> yeah
 but
 meeting
 you
 you
 yeah
 I
 think
 I


don't
 think
 that
 would
 have
 been


foreseen
 by
 the
 United
 States
 you
 know


up
 to
 about
 you
 know
 four
 weeks
 ago
 for


example
 Yeah,


>> but
 you
 know
 you
 do
 have
 cause
 and


effect.
 So
 when
 something
 happens
 then


you
 know
 that
 some
 other
 things
 may
 well


happen.
 You
 can't
 predict
 all
 those


things
 but
 some
 things
 you
 could
 say
 as


a
 scenario
 could
 possibly
 happen
 which


is
 why
 we
 we
 believe
 that
 scenario


planning
 is
 so
 critical
 for
 us
 today
 you


know
 to
 know
 what
 could
 possibly
 happen.


Uh
 and
 so
 if
 you
 look
 at
 the
 uh
 the


China
 India
 uh
 uh
 Russia
 um
 meeting
 that


happened
 uh
 you
 know
 at
 the
 SEO


clearly
 I
 think
 that's
 also
 a
 question


of
 uh
 ensuring
 resilience
 against


vulnerabilities
 for
 all
 of
 them
 for
 each


one
 of
 them
 but
 it
 means
 different


things
 to
 each
 one
 of
 them
 it
 means
 a


different
 thing
 for
 China
 for
 Russia
 and


for
 and
 for
 India


>> um
 and
 that's
 sort
 of
 one
 example
 you


know
 um
 but
 I
 think
 that
 uh
 when
 we
 look


at
 geopolitics
 Um,
 you
 also
 have
 to


think
 about,
 for
 example,
 how
 is
 Europe


going
 to
 react
 to
 all
 of
 this?
 It's
 sort


of
 caught
 in
 the
 middle
 because


>> and
 so
 and
 how
 will
 Europe
 react?


>> I
 mean,
 I'm
 hoping
 that
 they
 react
 in
 a


way
 that
 focuses
 on
 growth,
 you
 know,


and
 because
 when
 you
 focus
 on
 growth,


you're
 creating
 economic
 opportunity.


>> Are
 you
 are
 you
 seeing
 signs
 of
 this?
 uh


you
 know
 I
 think
 that
 there
 there
 is
 a


willingness
 to
 look
 that
 way
 but
 the


actions
 have
 not
 yet
 come
 out
 at
 a
 pace


that
 we
 would
 like
 look
 at
 the
 US
 it's


moving
 so
 quickly
 other
 countries
 are


reacting
 Europe
 seems
 like
 it's
 still


moving
 at
 a
 glacial
 pace
 it
 needs
 to
 up


itself
 you
 know
 because
 we
 want
 to
 put


more
 capital
 in
 U
 in
 in
 Europe


>> but
 Brussels
 has
 to
 figure
 out
 how
 to
 be


an
 enabler
 for
 business
 you
 know
 and
 and


you
 know
 you
 can't
 you
 can't
 be
 putting


yourself
 in
 a
 situation
 where
 you're


pressing
 the
 brake
 if
 there's
 nobody


pressing
 the
 accelerator.


>> Yeah.


>> Okay.
 And
 we
 need
 a
 couple
 markets
 in


there
 and
 so
 many
 other
 things
 that
 goes


with
 it.


>> Talking
 about
 accelerator,
 you
 uh


briefly
 mentioned
 the
 themes,
 right,


that
 you
 are
 looking
 at
 in
 the
 world


now.
 Should
 we
 can
 we
 just
 unpack
 that
 a


bit?
 Yeah.


>> So,
 the
 four
 themes
 that
 you're
 talking


about.


>> Yeah.
 So,
 you
 know,
 I
 think
 quite


frankly,
 I
 think
 we
 have
 to
 reook
 at
 our


themes
 because
 a
 lot
 of
 things
 have


changed,
 but
 one
 of
 but
 the
 four
 themes


are
 still
 relevant.
 you
 know
 the
 uh
 the


issue
 of
 digitalization
 includes


therefore
 digital
 data
 AI
 okay
 so
 now


it's
 much
 more
 broader
 than
 just
 a


generic
 definition
 of
 digitalization
 and


what
 does
 AI
 mean
 uh
 for
 for
 for


countries
 for
 businesses
 and
 for
 society


>> uh
 the
 second
 thing
 is
 of
 course
 if
 we


look
 at
 longer
 lifespans
 the
 developed


world
 is
 aging
 and
 therefore
 how
 what


does
 that
 mean
 in
 terms
 of
 sectors
 which


are
 relevant
 could
 be
 healthcare
 could


be
 retirement
 savings
 and
 therefore


asset
 management
 insurance
 and
 the
 like


uh
 if
 you
 look
 at
 and
 that
 also
 goes
 to


future
 consumption
 because
 future


consumption
 is
 different
 for
 emerging


markets
 versus
 developed
 markets


demographics
 as
 well.
 If
 you
 ask
 me
 the


India
 story
 is
 a
 story
 of
 consumption.


It's
 not
 so
 much
 a
 story
 of


industrialization.
 It's
 actually
 the


effect
 of
 industrialization
 on
 the


Indian
 consumer.
 You
 know
 quite
 part
 of


whatever
 else
 is
 going
 on
 now.
 India
 has


been
 a
 services
 sector
 for
 the
 longest


time.
 And
 so
 the
 benefits
 of
 that
 in
 the


context
 of
 rising
 consumerism
 is
 is


high.
 Uh
 if
 you
 think
 about
 uh
 things
 to


sustainable
 living,
 it
 used
 to
 be


associated
 with
 just
 moving
 into
 green


energy.


>> But
 let's
 face
 it,
 today
 it's
 energy


itself.
 Because
 when
 you
 talk
 about
 um


uh
 you
 know
 energy,
 you
 have
 to
 talk


about
 energy
 security,
 energy


affordability.
 It's
 not
 just
 about
 going


from
 brown
 to
 green.
 You
 know,
 you
 got


to
 go
 from
 brown
 to
 light
 brown
 to


greenish
 brown
 to
 light
 green
 to
 to
 to


to
 green.
 And
 so
 for
 us,
 the
 question
 is


is
 what's
 the
 mix
 that's
 going
 to
 be


relevant
 to
 get
 the
 net
 zero.
 So
 for


example,
 we
 start
 to
 invest
 in
 nuclear


energy
 a
 few
 years
 ago.


>> And
 we
 not
 just
 invest
 in
 nuclear


fusion,
 we
 also
 invest
 in
 nuclear


fusion.
 we
 are
 still
 invested
 in
 LG.
 96%


or
 95
 96%
 of
 Singapore's
 energy
 uh


source
 is
 LG
 because
 we
 can't
 produce
 uh


renewable
 energy
 first
 of
 all
 land
 mass


secondly
 cloud
 cover
 you
 know
 uh
 and
 so


and
 with
 climate
 change
 that's
 becoming


even
 more
 difficult.
 So
 but
 when
 you


look
 at
 LG
 how
 can
 you
 have
 low
 carbon


energy
 and
 blending
 is
 one
 element
 of
 it


making
 sure
 there's
 no
 leakage
 of


methane
 is
 the
 second
 otherwise
 it's


just
 as
 bad
 as
 coal


>> uh
 the
 third
 thing
 is
 if
 you
 think
 about


coal
 then
 it's
 managed
 phase
 out
 of
 coal


then
 how
 do
 you
 help
 accelerate
 that
 how


do
 you
 contribute
 towards
 that
 issue
 you


know
 do
 you
 also
 get
 involved
 in
 blended


finance
 for
 that
 so
 that
 there
 is
 in


fact
 a
 just
 transition
 uh
 before
 you
 can


even
 think
 about
 renewable
 energy
 and


infrastructure
 that's
 needed
 to
 go
 into


that
 between
 uh
 battery
 storage


upgrading
 the
 grid
 and
 the
 renewable


energy
 infrastructure
 with
 solar
 panels


and
 wind
 farms
 and
 what
 have
 you.
 So
 if


you
 so
 therefore
 we
 look
 at
 sustainable


living
 and
 that
 and
 living
 is
 for


humanity


um
 you
 know
 you
 have
 to
 be
 I
 would
 say


quite
 considered


>> about
 the
 things
 which
 you
 can
 do
 in
 the


near
 term
 in
 the
 medium-term
 and
 the


long
 term
 but
 you
 must
 be
 cleareyed


about
 the
 fact
 that
 that
 the
 world
 needs


to
 get
 greener
 because
 without
 that
 we


have
 a
 bigger
 problem.


>> How
 do
 you
 think
 about
 private
 versus


public
 markets?
 Well,
 going
 back
 almost


a
 decade.


>> So,
 private
 are
 the
 companies
 which
 are


not
 listed
 on
 the
 stock
 exchange.


>> Yeah.
 Going
 back
 more
 than
 a
 decade
 when


we
 started
 our
 2020
 strategy
 in
 in
 in


April
 of
 2011,
 80%
 of
 our
 portfolio
 was


publicly
 quoted,
 20%
 was
 private.
 Fast


forward
 a
 decade
 later,
 uh
 it
 was
 u
 50


odd%
 private,
 40
 odd%
 publicly
 quoted.


And
 if
 you
 include
 in
 a
 public
 coded
 our


Singapore
 companies
 that
 we
 control,
 you


know,
 from
 20%
 to
 to
 50
 60%.
 Uh
 that


means
 a
 very
 small
 part
 of
 our
 portfolio


is
 actually
 really
 publicly
 quoted.


>> Yeah.


Um,
 and
 by
 the
 way,
 you
 know,
 I
 would


say
 in
 a
 low
 interest
 rate
 environment,


um,
 and
 in
 a
 rather
 benign
 2010s
 decade,


going
 into
 private
 made
 a
 lot
 of
 sense,


you
 know,
 because
 first
 of
 all,
 you


didn't
 have


>> where
 we
 and
 where
 are
 we
 now?


>> I
 think
 now
 you
 have
 to
 be
 a
 little
 bit


more
 circumsp


um
 because
 I
 think
 it's
 wrong
 to


conflate
 uh
 a
 generic
 model
 into
 where


you
 should
 invest
 in
 the
 private


markets.
 So,
 there's
 still
 value
 in


private
 equity,
 but
 you
 have
 to
 be
 very


good
 at
 managerial
 selection.


>> There's
 still
 good
 value
 in
 uh
 in


private
 credit
 despite
 what
 people
 think


because
 if
 you
 are
 very
 clear-minded


about
 um
 about
 how
 you
 invest
 in
 private


credit
 and
 you're
 looking
 at
 actually


cash
 yield
 rather
 than
 just
 pure
 pick


and
 so
 on
 um
 you
 know
 you
 you
 might
 have


a
 good
 opportunity
 set
 even
 in
 the
 next


uh
 next
 in
 even
 as
 you
 go
 through


cycles.
 The
 third
 of
 course
 is
 in
 the


private
 markets
 is
 core
 plus


infrastructure
 and
 core
 plus


infrastructure
 is
 not
 a
 public
 market
 uh


product.
 It's
 a
 private
 market
 product,


but
 it
 gives
 you
 a
 yield
 and
 a
 and
 a


decent
 uh
 low
 low
 double
 digit
 returns


if
 you
 want.


>> What's
 more
 risky?
 What's
 more
 risky


now?
 Private
 or
 um
 public?


>> Both
 are
 risky


>> for
 different
 reasons.


>> Okay.
 For
 different
 reasons.
 Um
 I
 would


say
 that
 the
 problem
 with
 private


markets
 is
 you
 have
 more
 opacity.
 As
 an


investor
 in
 the
 private
 markets,
 you


don't
 have
 the
 same
 access
 to


information
 to
 know
 what
 to
 do.
 If


you're
 in
 a
 par
 markets,
 because
 it's


illquid,
 you
 can't
 pivot
 easily.
 So
 you


have
 to
 be
 clear
 that
 when
 you
 put
 money


in
 private
 markets,
 you're
 in
 there
 for


the
 long
 haul.


>> Well,
 in
 today's
 terms,
 5
 years
 could
 be


long
 haul.


>> And
 you
 are
 in
 there
 with
 your
 partner


long-term
 partnerships.


>> Yeah.


>> How
 do
 you
 think
 about
 your
 partners
 and


who
 are
 they?


>> Yeah.
 By
 the
 way,
 before
 I
 forget,
 the


danger
 of
 public
 markets
 is
 that
 if
 you


measure
 from
 year
 to
 year,
 the


volatility
 hits
 you.


>> Yeah.


>> So,
 it
 has
 to
 be
 managed.
 So,
 long-term


partners.
 So
 I
 believe
 that
 really
 um


and
 I've
 said
 this
 internally
 and
 with


everybody
 I
 said
 look
 you
 know
 we
 we


have
 to
 look
 at
 ourselves
 um
 as
 a


network
 organization
 as
 one
 focus
 on


partnerships.
 So
 in
 everything
 we
 do


now,
 we
 should
 find
 ourselves
 thinking


first
 and
 foremost
 who
 could
 partner


with
 us
 on
 this
 unless
 unless
 it's
 a


it's
 a
 it's
 a
 um
 investment
 opportunity


where
 it
 doesn't
 allow
 us
 to
 look
 for


partners.
 But
 I
 I
 think
 that's
 important


because
 we
 need
 to
 realize
 that
 Tamasic


we
 do
 not
 have
 all
 the
 skill
 sets
 needed


for
 the
 for
 all
 the
 opportunities
 to


come
 through
 our
 door
 and
 so
 we
 have
 to


augment
 it
 with
 others
 who
 have
 it
 and


therefore
 partnership
 is
 more
 important


for
 them
 from
 that
 perspective.
 It's
 not


about
 risk
 diversification.
 We
 don't


look
 for
 partners
 of
 risk


diversification.
 We
 look
 at
 at
 them
 as


as
 partners
 to
 augment
 what
 we
 already


have.


>> How
 do
 you
 work
 with
 them?


>> Well,
 I
 think
 that
 we
 are
 seen
 to
 be


more
 relational
 and
 less
 transactional.


I
 think
 that's
 generally
 what
 most


people
 would
 say
 about
 we
 take
 time
 to


build
 the
 relationships
 and
 we
 are
 you


know
 we
 have
 a
 very
 good
 two
 and
 fro


discussion.
 So
 we
 feel
 we
 should
 also


bring
 something
 to
 the
 table
 and
 not


just
 get
 ideas
 from
 them
 as
 well.


>> What
 does
 it
 mean?
 What
 does
 it
 mean
 to


be
 relational
 in
 your
 mind?
 I
 think


that's
 where
 your
 first
 when
 you
 want
 to


form
 a
 partnership,
 you've
 got
 to
 bear


in
 mind
 that
 there
 must
 be
 this
 level
 of


trust
 with
 each
 other.
 Trust
 not
 just
 in


terms
 of
 something
 you
 want
 to
 get
 into,


but
 even
 about
 sharing
 your
 information,


knowledge,
 perspectives
 and
 things
 like


that.
 The
 higher
 the
 level
 of
 trust,
 the


higher
 the
 quality
 relationship


>> and
 then
 if
 it
 translates
 into
 something


tangible
 in
 terms
 of
 doing
 something


together,
 it
 it's
 more
 likely
 to
 succeed


than
 not
 because
 of
 that.


>> Do
 you
 think
 there's
 some
 Asian
 thinking


into
 your
 relationship
 thinking?
 I
 don't


want
 to
 say
 that
 relational
 is
 only


Asian
 because
 I
 have
 so
 many
 friends
 in


the
 US
 and
 Europe
 and
 elsewhere
 where


they
 have
 the
 same
 way
 of
 thinking.
 So
 I


would
 say
 that
 it's
 very
 much
 up
 to
 the


individuals
 and
 how
 they
 look
 at
 things


in
 life.
 I
 do
 think
 that
 the
 world
 has


become
 more
 transactional.
 I
 think
 that


you
 know
 since
 countries
 have
 become


transaction
 or
 countries
 could
 become


more
 transactional
 and
 multilateralism


gives
 rise
 to
 transactionalism
 the
 world


may
 start
 to
 change
 a
 bit
 and
 then


finding
 those
 people
 who
 think
 the
 same


way
 as
 you
 do
 may
 not
 be
 as
 easy
 as


before
 other
 than
 the
 relationships
 you


already
 have.


>> Uh
 I
 wouldn't
 but
 I
 would
 say
 in
 Asia


trust
 comes
 from
 spending
 time
 building


relationships.
 That's
 for
 sure.


>> Yeah.
 It
 takes
 longer.
 takes
 longer.


Well,
 we
 have
 things
 to
 learn
 here,
 I


think.
 Um,
 moving
 on
 to
 the


organization.
 So,
 you
 are
 uh
 a
 bit
 more


than
 900
 people,
 13
 offices.
 Uh,
 what
 do


the
 people
 do?


>> So,
 apart
 from
 working
 hard,


>> my
 colleagues
 may
 say
 that
 we
 work


sometimes
 too
 hard,
 but
 you
 know,
 I'll


put
 that
 everybody
 works
 hard
 especially


in
 this
 world.
 Um,
 we
 have
 about
 950


people
 in
 Tamasi.
 Y


>> um,
 and
 that's
 sort
 of
 like
 a
 stable


number
 for
 time
 being.
 And
 like
 you


mentioned
 we
 have
 13
 offices,
 12
 outside


Singapore.


We
 have
 650


people
 in
 Singapore.
 So
 the
 other
 300
 so


two/3s
 on
 Singapore,
 one
 third
 outside


and
 in
 Singapore
 we
 have
 a
 multinational


cohort
 here.


>> Uh
 we
 have
 something
 35
 nationalities


working
 in
 Tamasic
 globally.


>> In
 the
 markets
 the
 majority
 of
 people


there
 are
 investment
 folks.
 in
 Singapore


um
 the
 majority
 are
 people
 who
 support


the
 investment
 engines
 you
 know
 um


because
 we've
 actually
 put
 more
 people


out
 into
 the
 markets
 uh
 directly
 so


currently
 in
 terms
 of
 headcount
 um
 uh
 in


the
 markets
 the
 US
 is
 the
 largest


followed
 by
 China
 than
 Europe
 than
 India


>> and
 um
 in
 the
 US
 the
 the
 vast
 majority
 I


think
 I
 would
 say
 80%
 of
 people
 we
 have


there
 are
 investment
 folks
 the
 same


thing
 with
 China
 the
 same
 thing
 with


Europe
 and
 India
 What
 type
 of
 people
 do


you
 hire?
 Who
 do
 you
 what
 do
 you
 look


for?


>> Uh
 historically
 we
 looked
 at
 people
 from


investment
 banking.
 Uh
 because
 we
 found


that
 they
 came
 well
 trained
 especially


if
 you
 hire
 them
 for
 the
 best
 from
 the


best
 banks
 and
 uh
 they
 would
 have
 they


would
 know
 how
 to
 access
 the
 right


information
 flows
 because
 that's
 what


they
 would
 do
 as
 a
 normal
 thing
 and
 they


come
 with
 some
 domain
 capability
 in


terms
 of
 understanding
 the
 sectors
 that


we
 hire
 them
 into.
 Uh
 and
 I'm
 talking


about
 investment
 folks
 only.
 Yeah.
 Um


more
 recently
 we've
 been
 trying
 to
 get


people
 um
 who
 come
 from
 private
 equity.


Um
 and
 when
 we
 look
 at
 the
 public


markets
 part
 of
 the
 house
 uh
 we
 get


people
 from
 long
 um
 long
 long
 asset
 uh


managers
 as
 well
 as
 uh
 from
 hedge
 funds.


Uh
 but
 we
 also
 lose
 them
 also
 as
 you


know
 back
 to
 where
 they
 came
 from
 over


time.


>> But
 is
 still
 like
 a
 way
 of
 doing
 things.


I
 mean
 it's
 like
 a
 bible
 or
 like
 a
 holy


script
 is
 like
 this
 is
 the
 demos
 sec
 way


of
 doing
 things
 and
 this
 is
 how
 we
 train


you
 and
 this
 is
 how
 we
 do
 things.
 I


think
 every
 organization
 has
 something


like
 that.
 I
 mean
 we
 are
 very
 focused
 on


our
 values
 you
 know
 we
 have
 uh
 six


components
 of
 uh
 what
 we
 call
 merit


value
 system
 and
 so
 we're
 very
 focused


on
 this
 whole
 issue
 about
 excellence


meritocracy
 respect
 integrity
 teamwork


trust


>> that
 won't
 change
 so
 that's
 actually


culture
 you
 know
 I
 I
 think
 in
 any


organization
 values
 cultures
 behaviors


sense
 of
 purpose
 is
 critical
 you
 know


but
 that
 forms
 the
 foundation
 that


people
 can
 then
 leverage
 off
 for
 how


they
 do
 their
 work
 in
 tamasi
 so
 that's


the
 first
 part
 of
 our
 script
 we
 look
 for


the
 values
 in
 people
 not
 just
 expertise.


>> Um
 increasingly
 um
 we
 are
 toggling


between
 people
 who
 can
 be
 generalists


and
 people
 who
 are
 specialists
 and
 I
 say


that
 because
 of
 the
 complexity
 of


portfolio
 and
 so
 if
 we
 look
 at
 the
 three


different
 components
 of
 portfolio
 each


one
 of
 them
 has
 different


characteristics.
 If
 you
 are
 going
 to
 be


at
 the
 apex
 of
 organization
 you
 have
 to


be
 flexible
 in
 your
 thinking
 you
 know


and
 therefore
 um
 even
 if
 you're
 a


specialist
 having
 some
 level
 of


understanding
 about
 you
 know
 things
 like


geopolitics
 global
 shifts
 for
 example


and
 things
 that
 makes
 you
 a
 better


leader
 so
 therefore
 we
 have
 to
 train


people
 to
 do
 that
 now


>> is
 there
 such
 a
 thing
 as
 a
 Singaporean


value


>> we
 like
 to
 say
 Singapore
 DNA


>> what
 is
 that
 what
 is
 that


>> well
 first
 of
 all
 I
 think
 for
 okay
 so
 if


you
 look
 at
 our
 value
 system
 I
 would
 say


Singapore
 stands
 for
 similar
 things
 you


know
 meritocracy
 excellence
 respect
 for


each
 other
 integrity
 is
 the
 most


important
 value


>> okay
 when
 when
 we
 say
 something
 people


have
 to
 you
 know
 you
 want
 people
 to
 take


us
 at
 our
 word
 I
 have
 done
 so
 many


things
 Nikolai
 with
 my
 counterparts
 in


the
 US
 elsewhere
 where
 it's
 done
 on
 a


handshake
 where
 the
 lawyers
 and
 my
 and


the
 colleagues
 on
 both
 sides
 say
 no no


we
 have
 to
 put
 in
 writing
 and
 the
 two
 of


us
 say
 nope
 we've
 promised
 each
 other
 we


will
 keep
 to
 our
 word


>> that's
 important
 and
 and
 if
 you
 don't


have
 that
 sense
 of
 integrity
 and


therefore
 trust
 in
 each
 other
 on
 the


basis
 of
 that
 you
 know
 there
 will
 be
 a


limit
 to
 what
 you
 can
 do
 so
 I
 think
 in


Singapore
 that
 has
 always
 been
 something


of
 value
 you
 know
 we
 we
 we
 do
 things
 on


a
 principled
 way
 you
 know
 that's
 how
 we


look
 at
 things


>> why
 why
 has
 Singapore
 been
 so
 incredibly


successful


>> much
 of
 it
 I
 think
 is
 due
 to
 our


founding
 fathers
 you
 know
 Lie
 Kuwanu
 and


his
 first
 generation
 of
 leaders
 and
 not


just
 the
 political
 leaders
 but
 also
 the


civil
 servants
 who
 supported
 them
 was
 a


whole
 team
 that
 um
 took
 took
 um
 uh
 I


would
 say
 took
 over
 a
 Singapore
 that


became
 self-governing
 away
 from
 colonial


um
 uh
 running
 of
 our
 country
 to
 one
 that


became
 part
 of
 Malaysia
 for
 2
 years
 to


becoming
 independent
 without
 natural


resources
 where
 your
 only
 resource
 are


your
 people.


>> That's
 why
 I
 see
 Tamasics
 not
 really


primarily
 in
 the
 investment
 game.
 We're


in
 the
 people
 game


>> because
 the
 only
 way
 for
 us
 advance
 is


to
 make
 sure
 the
 quality
 of
 our
 people


uh
 how
 we
 train
 them
 is
 is
 critical
 when


the
 people
 decide.
 But
 but
 if
 you
 look


at
 the
 civil
 servants,
 they
 are
 much


more
 highly
 paid
 than
 in
 most
 countries


relative
 to


>> So
 are
 the
 politicians.


>> Absolutely.
 Civil
 servants,
 politicians


really
 highly
 paid,
 very
 highly


educated.


>> They
 work
 very
 hard
 too.


>> Yeah.


>> Yeah.
 Extremely
 hard.


>> What's
 the
 what's
 the
 consequence
 of


having
 such
 like
 a
 cater
 of


civil
 servants
 and
 politicians
 who
 are


so
 what
 should
 we
 say
 outstanding?


>> That's
 good
 for
 the
 country.


>> Yeah.
 You
 know,
 I
 would
 say,
 you
 know,


if
 you
 are
 a
 young
 Singaporean,
 you'd


want
 that
 to
 be
 the
 case
 because
 you


because
 if
 you
 have
 your
 life
 ahead
 of


you,
 if
 you're
 30
 years
 old
 and
 you're


going
 to
 work
 to
 the
 age
 of
 80
 because


you
 can
 live
 to
 the
 age
 of
 100,
 you


know,
 um
 you
 want
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 your


leadership,
 your
 political
 leadership


and
 your
 your
 civil
 service
 have


top-notch
 people
 and
 they
 have
 to
 be


there
 to
 formulate
 policies
 where


business
 can
 thrive.


>> Okay,
 that's
 the
 main
 thing.
 So
 you
 need


good
 people
 there
 who
 are
 able
 to
 engage


with
 industry
 both
 within
 Singapore
 and


outside
 to
 be
 able
 to
 think
 of
 the


policies
 we
 need
 in
 the
 short
 term,
 in


the
 medium
 and
 definitely
 the
 long
 term


for
 Singapore
 to
 succeed.
 The
 one
 thing


good
 about
 government
 is
 that
 they
 do
 a


lot
 lot
 of
 long-term
 planning.
 So


infrastructure
 buildout
 is
 always
 ahead


of
 demand.
 You
 know,
 we're
 building


terminal
 5
 at
 Changi
 right
 now.
 Uh
 we're


not
 up
 to
 full
 capacity
 in
 terminals
 1


to
 four,
 but
 we're
 building
 it
 in


anticipation
 of
 the
 world
 of
 travel
 of


Singapore
 as
 a
 hub.
 uh
 you
 know
 and
 um


we
 know
 that
 we
 need
 it
 we'll
 need
 it
 in


about
 10
 years
 time
 but
 we
 we're


building
 it
 now
 you
 know
 so
 when
 you
 do


those
 things
 the
 government
 plays
 a
 very


important
 role
 as
 an
 enabler
 first


they're
 a
 policy
 uh
 originator
 but


they're
 also
 an
 enabler
 and
 they
 have


the
 fiscal
 balance
 sheet
 to
 do
 the


infrastructure
 spending
 ahead
 of
 demand


and
 that
 helps
 industry
 plan
 as
 well.
 So


we
 own
 an
 airline.
 So
 when
 we
 see
 that


we
 can
 also
 do
 that
 uh
 and
 dovetail
 it


with
 our
 root
 network
 planning
 as
 well


as
 our
 fleet
 planning
 and
 that
 allows
 us


to
 think
 about
 what
 kind
 of
 aircraft
 we


need
 to
 procure
 and
 things
 that
 you
 know


it's
 very
 useful
 and
 I
 think
 that


multinational
 corporations
 have


understood
 how
 to
 leverage
 the


government's
 policy
 thinking
 uh
 for
 for


what
 they
 do
 in
 Singapore
 either
 uh
 for


export
 or
 for
 or
 for
 regionalization
 as


well.
 And
 uh
 and
 if
 you
 look
 at


Singapore's
 economy,
 um
 it's
 really


driven
 primarily
 by
 the
 fact
 that
 we


have
 these
 multinationals
 mainly
 from


the
 US,
 Europe,
 from
 Japan
 and
 so
 on


here.
 And
 we
 have
 a
 bunch
 ofmemes
 to


support
 them
 as
 part
 of
 an
 ecosystem.


Tamas
 companies
 account
 for
 maybe
 just


5%
 of
 GDP
 in
 Singapore.


>> Yeah.
 But
 yet,
 of
 course,
 we
 are


important
 in
 the
 ecosystems
 in
 which
 we


operate,
 you
 know,
 whether
 it's


financial
 services
 or
 utilities,


whatever.
 But
 we're
 leveraging
 a
 uh
 an


ecosystem
 that
 has
 also
 been
 built


because
 of
 the
 of
 the
 other
 contributors


to
 our
 economy,
 especially
 the


multinational
 corporations.
 And
 so
 we


have
 to
 be
 an
 open
 economy.
 We
 have
 to


be
 open
 to
 all
 of
 them
 to
 come
 in


because
 that's
 the
 only
 way
 for
 us
 to


remain
 competitive.
 The
 worst
 thing
 is


for
 us
 to
 protect
 our
 own
 companies.
 To


do
 that,
 I
 think,
 you
 know,
 we're


setting
 ourselves
 up
 for
 a
 very


different
 future
 for
 Singapore.


>> Dylan,
 moving
 on
 to
 uh
 to
 you
 as
 a


leader.
 How
 how
 would
 people


characterize
 you
 as
 a
 leader?


>> I
 don't
 know.
 You
 have
 to
 ask
 them


actually
 I'm
 not
 sure
 that
 I
 want
 to


think
 too
 much
 about
 it
 because


I
 have
 a
 job
 to
 do.
 I
 got
 to
 do
 the
 best


way
 I
 can
 and
 what
 I
 do
 is
 for
 the


organization
 and
 what
 I
 do
 for
 the


organization
 is
 for
 the
 people
 in
 the


company.


>> What's
 the
 key
 in
 everything
 I
 do
 by
 the


way?
 So


>> what's
 the
 key
 what's
 the
 key
 to
 be
 an


efficient
 leader?


>> Um
 I
 think
 you
 have
 to
 really
 think


about
 the
 future
 all
 the
 time.
 You
 you


you
 know
 you
 but
 you
 have
 to
 also


prioritize
 things.
 Um
 because
 the


organization


has
 to
 keep
 up
 with
 you.
 you
 have
 to


have
 followership
 and
 bring
 people


along.
 And
 that
 means
 you
 have
 to


engage,
 you
 know.
 Um,
 and
 uh,
 I
 would


say
 that
 I've
 gotten
 better
 at
 engaging,


but
 not
 quite
 there
 yet
 because
 I'm I'm


also
 a
 bit
 impatient
 by
 nature.
 So,


>> so
 how
 have
 you
 developed
 with
 age,
 you


think?


>> In
 some
 respects,
 I
 mellowed,
 in
 other


respects
 I
 may
 not
 have
 mellowed.
 You


know,
 when
 you
 get
 older,
 Nikolai,
 you


realize
 your
 runway
 is
 getting
 narrower,


you
 know,
 so
 you
 want
 to
 do
 more
 things


more
 quickly.
 Um,
 but
 when
 you
 get


older,
 you
 also
 realize
 sometimes
 when


to
 pull
 back
 and
 you
 know
 that
 you
 you


might
 be
 going
 too
 far
 too
 fast.


>> How
 old
 are
 you?


>> 62.


>> It's
 a
 great
 age,


>> I
 think.
 So
 to
 be
 62
 than
 25
 as
 of
 this


moment.


>> You
 said
 engaging
 with
 people.
 What
 do


you
 how
 do
 you
 do
 that?
 Well,
 I
 I
 talk


widely,
 you
 know,
 if
 I
 can
 say
 that
 even


internally
 within
 the
 company,
 you
 know,


I've
 I
 try
 to
 make
 sure
 I'm
 I'm


accessible
 to
 people


>> and
 um
 people
 want
 to
 have
 a
 chat
 with


me,
 they
 can
 have
 a
 chat
 with
 me.
 Uh
 I


make
 sure
 that
 we
 there
 are
 internal


coms
 are
 f
 uh
 you
 know
 are
 focused
 on


making
 sure
 our
 people
 are
 aware
 of
 what


we're
 doing.
 Um
 and
 uh
 you
 know
 I
 well


and
 then
 of
 course
 I've
 um
 I
 try
 to


engage
 widely
 outside
 with
 our
 portfolio


companies
 but
 also
 with
 our
 invested


companies
 around
 the
 world
 and
 people
 I


know
 around
 the
 world
 and
 I
 bring
 try
 to


bring
 those
 insights
 back
 to
 the


organization
 where
 I
 find
 them.


>> How
 do
 you
 make
 sure
 that
 you
 prioritize


the
 right
 things?


>> You
 know
 you
 can
 only
 know
 you're
 doing


the
 right
 things
 if
 your
 colleagues
 tell


you
 are
 are
 in
 it
 with
 you
 and
 sometimes


it
 takes
 time
 to
 persuade
 them
 because


they
 may
 not
 see
 the
 world
 the
 same
 way


you
 see
 the
 world.
 you
 know,
 CEOs
 tend


to
 see
 a
 lot
 more
 than
 others
 and
 it's


not
 it's
 it's it's
 quite
 natural
 because


um
 we
 have
 to
 broaden
 our
 aperture
 and


go
 out
 there
 and
 we
 have
 to
 think
 about


many
 many
 different
 things
 and
 we
 have


to
 think
 on
 based
 on
 horizons
 whereas


people
 who
 have
 jobs
 where
 they're
 given


a
 function
 to
 do
 they
 will
 tend
 to
 want


to
 make
 sure
 that
 is
 done
 really
 really


well
 you
 know
 and
 you
 need
 both
 right
 so


in
 a
 sense
 uh
 you
 have
 to
 do
 a
 lot
 more


persuading
 these
 days
 than
 before
 you


know
 um
 and
 So
 you
 know
 you're
 on
 the


right
 track
 where
 everybody
 finally
 sees


what
 you're
 seeing
 and
 they're
 on
 track


and
 they're
 moving
 faster
 than
 you.


>> So
 uh
 on
 that
 note,
 how
 do
 you
 how
 do


you
 absorb
 technology
 and
 AI
 into
 tease


in
 the
 way
 you
 work?


>> Yeah.
 So
 I
 I
 I
 would
 say
 that
 um
 we're


still
 a
 work
 in
 progress.
 Um
 we
 have


four
 things
 that
 we
 think
 about
 in
 terms


of
 AI.
 Okay.
 First
 is
 how
 AI
 is
 an


enabler
 for
 ourselves.
 Second
 is
 how
 do


we
 use
 AI
 to
 future
 proof
 our
 portfolio


>> and
 for
 that
 matter
 how
 how
 to
 ensure


our
 portfolio
 is
 futurep
 proofed
 on
 the


effects
 of
 AI


>> okay
 for
 example
 operating
 companies.


The
 third
 is
 how
 do
 we
 scale
 our
 AI


exposure
 as
 a
 as
 a
 firm.
 And
 the
 fourth


is
 um
 is
 the
 diffusion
 of
 AI
 within


Singapore
 as
 a
 whole
 because
 we
 have
 so


many
 companies
 which
 are
 involved
 in


ecosystems
 here
 which
 make
 the
 country


work
 the
 way
 it
 works
 uh
 or
 contributes


towards
 that.
 And
 so
 the
 first
 thing
 of


course
 is
 that
 within
 Tamasic
 we
 are
 now


rolling
 out
 AI
 um
 at
 a
 much
 faster
 pace


than
 before
 into
 all
 our
 workflows
 to


become
 more
 efficient.
 So
 that's
 the
 one


level
 and
 that
 goes
 towards


productivity.
 Um
 and
 that's
 critical


because
 one
 of
 the
 complaints
 that
 we've


been
 getting
 over
 the
 years
 from
 younger


people
 especially
 is
 that
 there's
 too


much
 stuff
 that
 they
 have
 to
 do


especially
 if
 they
 have
 to
 do


administrative
 stuff
 in
 addition
 to
 uh


to
 what
 they
 what
 they're
 doing
 on
 on


investments
 and
 things
 like
 that.
 And
 so


we're
 trying
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 we


effectively
 and
 AI
 can
 actually
 help


quite
 a
 bit


>> there.
 Um
 I
 would
 say
 AI
 can
 definitely


help
 them
 in
 terms
 of
 getting
 the
 base


information
 that
 we
 need
 for
 any


investment
 proposal.
 One
 can
 could


possibly
 see
 that
 chat
 GPT
 could
 replace


your
 associate
 and
 senior
 associate
 in


which
 case
 you
 have
 to
 train
 your


associate
 and
 senior
 associate
 to
 be
 to


be
 performing
 at
 level
 two
 levels
 above


them
 you
 know
 that's
 the
 only
 way
 you
 do


it
 you
 know
 uh
 and
 therefore
 the


brightest
 minds
 will
 have
 to
 be
 given


the
 tools
 to
 succeed
 so
 that's
 the
 first


thing
 you
 know
 and
 all
 our
 workflows
 I


would
 say
 have
 to
 be
 AI
 enabled
 the


second
 thing
 is
 um
 AI
 has
 to
 help
 us
 get


better
 returns
 on
 our
 portfolio
 that's


what
 we
 should
 be
 trying
 to
 achieve
 and


that
 means
 Um
 AI
 is
 a
 tool
 for
 us
 for


sourcing
 of
 investments.
 It's
 a
 tool
 for


us
 for
 doing
 performance
 uh
 monitoring.


Well,
 performance
 analysis
 and
 I
 would


say
 investment
 analysis
 first
 and
 then


performance
 monitoring.
 Um
 and
 finally


portfolio
 management
 that's
 critical
 and


so
 if
 we
 if
 we
 have
 AI
 embodied
 within


our
 investment
 flows
 and
 the
 way
 in


which
 we
 are
 approaching
 uh
 the
 sourcing


the
 valuation
 the
 making
 and
 then
 the


the
 managing
 of
 of
 our
 investment


opportunities
 that
 I
 think
 will
 enhance


the
 returns
 we
 get
 and
 also
 allow
 us
 to


be
 more
 productive.
 What
 we
 want
 to
 do


is
 to
 make
 sure
 we
 do
 fewer
 things,
 you


know,
 and
 get
 a
 narrower
 range
 of


outcomes
 so
 that
 we
 can
 get
 really


long-term
 predictable
 returns,
 you
 know,


uh
 for
 for
 the
 for
 the
 purposes
 of
 our


net
 investment
 return
 contribution.


>> Some
 personal
 questions
 um
 at
 the
 end,


how
 do
 you
 relax?


>> I
 run


>> every
 day
 or


>> uh
 I
 try
 to
 do
 it
 every
 day,
 you
 know.


Uh
 I
 didn't
 do
 it
 this
 morning
 because
 I


had
 to
 wake
 up
 early
 for
 a
 7:30


breakfast
 meeting
 and
 I
 was
 and
 I


finished
 late
 last
 night.
 But
 generally


I
 try
 I
 run
 every
 day.


>> What
 do
 you
 read?


>> I
 read
 a
 lot
 of
 stuff.
 Well,
 everybody


reads
 news
 feeds,
 you
 know.
 So,
 you


know,
 you
 read
 your
 local
 papers,
 you


read
 the
 financial
 times,
 you
 read,
 you


know,
 Wall
 Street
 Journal,
 etc.
 Uh
 um


and
 then
 obviously
 things
 like
 the


economist
 and
 so
 on.
 So,
 that's
 human


given.
 That's
 basic.
 But
 I
 read
 a
 lot
 of


books.


>> Yeah.


>> Now,
 we
 having
 dinner
 tonight.
 Uh
 pepper


crab
 or
 chili
 crab?


>> I
 prefer
 pepper
 crab
 only
 because
 it's


less
 messy
 than
 chili
 crab.
 But
 the


chili
 crab
 may
 actually
 taste
 better,


you
 know.
 And
 I
 told
 you
 when
 I
 was
 at


Oslo
 in
 September
 of
 2023,
 I
 went
 to
 a


restaurant
 in
 Oslo
 that
 served
 chili


crab.


>> That's
 good.
 I
 have
 to
 I
 have
 to
 I
 have


to
 figure
 that
 one
 out.
 What
 is
 your


advice
 to
 young
 people?


>> Uh
 life
 is
 a
 journey.
 Life's
 a
 journey.


It's
 got
 many
 phases.
 You
 have
 to
 be


open
 to
 learning.
 You
 have
 to
 So
 when
 we


talk
 about
 lifelong
 learning,
 be
 open
 to


experiences.


um
 think
 broadly,
 read
 widely,
 you
 know,


however
 you
 want
 to
 read,
 you
 know,


whether
 it's
 through
 the
 internet
 or


chat
 GPT
 or
 books.
 Um
 you
 have
 to
 you


have
 to
 read
 widely
 because
 the
 world


now
 um
 is
 going
 into
 a
 very
 different


phase
 going
 forward
 and
 things
 like
 AI,


things
 like
 climate
 change
 and
 so
 on
 and


they
 all
 converge
 at
 some
 point
 in
 time


requires
 you
 to
 to
 to
 really
 think
 ahead


because
 you're
 going
 to
 be
 living
 the


next
 you
 know
 60
 70
 80
 years.
 you
 know


that
 future
 belongs
 to
 you.


>> Um
 all
 of
 us
 of
 our
 age
 group
 has
 to


make
 sure
 that
 there's
 a
 bright
 future


for
 them
 but
 they
 are
 also
 responsible


for
 that.
 So
 I
 feel
 that
 in
 your
 life


you
 you
 will
 have
 to
 be
 open
 to
 new


opportunities


>> new
 opportunities
 within
 your


organization
 or
 even
 outside
 you
 know


you
 can
 no
 longer
 join
 a
 company
 and
 say


I'm
 going to
 be
 a
 lifer.
 The
 company
 has


got
 to
 make
 it
 worth
 your
 while
 for
 you


to
 be
 a
 lifer.
 I'll
 put
 it
 the
 other
 way


around.
 Okay.
 So,
 so
 as
 much
 as
 a
 as
 a


as
 employee
 has
 to
 justify
 themselves
 to


employer,
 the
 employer
 has
 got
 to
 be


forward
 thinking
 and
 and
 for
 moving


forward
 to
 be
 justifiable
 to
 the


employee.
 So
 I
 would
 say
 that
 in
 life
 uh


you
 will
 find
 that
 doors
 will
 close
 but


new
 doors
 will
 open


>> and
 so
 you
 know
 look
 at
 it
 that
 way


>> and
 and
 be
 optimistic.
 Okay,
 be


optimistic
 because
 um
 over
 you
 know
 the


world
 history
 has
 shown
 that
 we
 go


through
 times
 of
 difficulties
 and
 we


always
 come
 out
 better
 than
 the
 previous


generation.
 So
 when
 there's
 darkness,


you
 know,
 the
 dark
 clouds
 will
 give
 way


to
 to
 light.
 That's
 how
 I
 believe.


Absolutely.


>> Well,
 optimists
 are
 more
 happy
 and
 make


more
 money.
 And
 I
 think
 on
 that
 on
 that


on
 that
 happy
 note,
 Dylan,
 it's
 been
 a


pleasure.


>> Thank
 you,
 Nikolai.


>> Thank
 you.
 Thank
 you
 very
 much.
