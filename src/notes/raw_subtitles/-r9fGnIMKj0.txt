I'm
 Gilbert
 Cruz,
 editor
 of
 the
 New
 York


Times
 Book
 Review,
 and
 this
 is
 the
 Book


Review
 Podcast.


This
 week,
 we're
 staying
 on
 October


vibes
 and
 presenting
 you
 with
 a
 couple


of
 conversations
 from
 years
 past
 with


great
 horror
 writers.
 First
 from
 2024,


Joe
 Hill,
 who
 has
 just
 released
 his


first
 novel
 in
 almost
 a
 decade,
 King


Sorrow,
 came
 on
 the
 Pod.
 Great


conversation.
 He
 offered
 a
 bunch
 of


fantastic
 scary
 book
 recommendations.


And
 then
 after
 the
 break,
 Victor
 Laval,


author
 of
 2023's
 Lone
 Women,
 talks
 about


the
 book
 he's
 read
 the
 most
 in
 his
 life,


a
 book
 I
 have
 read
 many
 times,
 The
 Great


Shirley
 Jackson's
 The
 Haunting
 of
 Hill


House.
 I
 hope
 you
 enjoyed
 both
 of
 these


conversations.
 I
 absolutely
 did
 and
 I


doubly
 hope
 that
 you
 look
 forward
 to


next
 week's
 episode
 of
 the
 podcast
 in


which
 MJ
 Franklin,
 as
 he
 does
 every


month,
 hosts
 a
 book
 club
 discussion.


This
 one
 about
 this
 year's
 The
 Buffalo


Hunter
 Hunter
 by
 Steven
 Graham
 Jones.


But
 first,
 let's
 turn
 to
 Joe
 Hill.


Joe
 Hill,
 author,
 novelist,
 short
 story


writer,
 has
 worked
 in
 the
 graphic
 novel


space.
 The
 first
 time
 I
 read
 you
 before


interviewing
 you,
 I
 feel
 like
 years
 ago


for
 Time
 magazine
 for
 Horns,
 this
 was
 a


very
 long
 time
 ago,


>> was
 20th
 Century
 Ghost,
 which
 is
 a
 short


story
 collection.


>> And
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 I
 said
 this
 at
 the


time,
 but
 it
 has
 stuck
 with
 me.
 I
 was


listening
 to
 it.
 I
 was
 listening
 to
 the


audiobook
 version
 of
 20th
 Century
 Ghost.


And
 the
 first
 story
 in
 20th
 Century


Ghost
 is
 a
 story
 called
 Best
 New
 Horror


if
 I'm
 recalling
 correctly.
 And
 it
 was


so
 tense
 that
 I
 was
 genuinely
 sweating


on
 a
 New
 York
 City
 subway
 platform.
 And


I
 wasn't
 sweating
 cuz
 it
 was
 summertime


and
 it
 gets
 to
 be
 97
 degrees
 on
 these


platforms.
 I
 think
 it
 was
 a
 different


time
 of
 year.
 It
 was
 just
 it
 was
 very


tense.
 Very
 tense.
 And
 then
 several


stories
 later,
 there's
 a
 story
 called


Pop
 Art,
 which
 was
 one
 of
 the
 more


moving


pieces
 of
 short
 fiction
 I've
 read
 in
 a


horror
 collection
 ever.
 Maybe
 it
 was
 a


great
 delight
 to
 see
 the
 range
 there.


>> That's
 very
 kind.
 I
 remember
 that
 we


spoke
 in
 a
 restaurant
 in
 Boston
 around


2010


>> for
 horns
 and
 shortly
 afterwards
 I
 had
 a


nervous
 breakdown
 and
 a
 divorce.
 So,


Gilbert,
 I'm
 hoping
 this
 conversation


has
 a
 better
 outcome.


>> I
 don't
 want
 to
 lay
 all
 that
 on
 you,
 but


I'm
 not
 taking
 you
 completely
 off
 the


hook.
 Clearly,
 we
 had
 this
 conversation


and
 two
 years
 later,
 I
 was
 a
 divorced


guy
 in
 therapy
 and
 so


>> anyway,
 no
 pressure
 here.


>> What
 happened?
 I'm
 so
 sorry.
 I
 feel
 like


you
 should
 have
 told
 me
 this
 earlier


this


>> going
 into
 the
 conversation.


>> Yeah,
 this
 might
 be
 the
 first
 time
 we've


spoken
 since
 then.


>> I'll
 keep
 you
 updated
 after
 this


conversation.
 I'll
 let
 you
 know
 how
 it


goes.


>> Great.
 Thank
 you.
 Welcome
 to
 the
 book


review
 podcast.


>> Thanks
 for
 having
 me
 on.
 It's
 wonderful


to
 be
 here.
 This
 is
 such
 a
 silly


question
 given
 who
 you
 are
 and
 how
 you


grew
 up,
 but
 what
 has
 your
 relationship


to
 scary
 books
 been
 from
 the
 time
 you


were
 a
 child?
 We're
 here
 to
 talk
 about


scary
 books.


>> It
 is
 quite
 literally
 a
 lifelong


relationship
 with
 the
 scary
 stuff.
 So,


the
 elephant
 in
 the
 room
 is
 my
 dad
 is


Stephen
 King.
 A
 fact
 that
 I
 was
 able
 to


keep
 secret
 for
 a
 period
 of
 time
 in
 the


early
 part
 of
 my
 career
 while
 I
 was


>> finding
 my
 own
 voice
 and
 starting
 to


publish.
 But
 I'm
 a
 huge
 Stephen
 King
 fan


and
 fell
 hard
 for
 my
 dad's
 work
 like
 so


many
 other
 children
 of
 the
 1980s
 and


read
 everything.
 And
 the
 thing
 is
 people


they
 think
 of
 it
 as
 a
 long
 book
 but
 I


read
 it
 in
 second
 draft
 and
 manuscript


and
 that
 thing
 that
 manuscript
 was
 like


came
 to
 my
 knee.


I
 was
 shorter
 then
 but
 I
 wasn't
 that


short.
 It
 was
 a
 huge
 manuscript
 and


certainly
 I
 was
 swept
 away
 by
 that


story.
 How
 how
 old
 were
 you
 when
 you


read
 that
 book
 which
 has
 a
 lot
 of


>> young
 far
 too
 young.
 Yeah,


>> I
 think
 I
 was
 12.


>> If
 you
 look
 at
 the
 date
 the
 book
 came


out
 and
 subtract
 two
 years


>> 86


maybe.


>> Okay.
 So
 I
 read
 it
 in
 1984
 and
 I
 would


have
 been
 12.


>> Okay.


>> I
 I
 was
 talking
 to
 a
 friend
 recently
 and


I
 said
 in
 some
 ways
 I
 feel
 like
 I've


been
 trying
 to
 write
 it
 my
 whole
 life.


My
 third
 book
 Noseratu


>> Mhm.
 was
 a
 stab
 my
 attempt
 to
 write
 it.


I've
 got
 a
 new
 one
 that'll
 be
 out
 next


year
 called
 King
 Sorrow
 where
 I
 was


trying
 to
 write
 it.
 I
 think
 I
 did
 a


short
 story
 called
 The
 Black
 Phone
 that


was
 in
 20th
 Century
 Ghost
 and
 at
 the


time
 I
 wrote
 it,
 it
 was
 the
 furthest


thing
 from
 my
 mind,
 but
 when
 I
 look
 at


it
 now,
 I
 see
 the
 influence
 of
 that
 book


all
 over
 that
 story.


>> What
 did
 you
 take
 from
 that
 book?
 It's
 a


big
 book.
 There's
 a
 lot
 to
 take
 from
 it,


but
 what
 do
 you
 think
 are
 the
 elements


that
 keep
 coming
 back
 over
 and
 over
 in


your
 writing?
 I
 learned
 pretty
 early
 on


that
 effective
 horror
 is
 not
 about


sadism.


It's
 not
 about
 throwing
 a
 pile
 of
 guts


at
 the
 reader.
 Effective
 horror
 is
 about


giving
 you
 some
 characters
 to
 fall
 in


love
 with.
 Introducing
 fully
 rounded


characters
 who
 feel
 like
 you
 would
 want


to
 you
 would
 want
 to
 spend
 time
 with


them
 and
 you're
 going
 to
 spend
 time
 with


them
 because
 it
 usually
 takes
 between
 12


and
 20
 hours
 to
 read
 a
 book.
 So
 you
 you


meet
 some
 characters
 and
 you
 fall
 in


love
 with
 them
 and
 then
 you
 see
 them


forced
 to
 confront
 the
 worst
 that
 we
 can


imagine.
 And
 so
 in
 that
 sense,
 I
 think


good
 horror
 fiction
 is
 about
 sympathy.


It's
 about
 empathy,
 not
 cruelty.


>> That
 isn't
 always
 so
 clearly
 understood.


And
 so
 I
 think
 when
 you
 look
 at
 the


horror
 movies
 of
 the
 1980s,
 the
 slasher


films
 of
 the
 1980s,


>> you
 see
 a
 lot
 of
 movies
 that
 are


terrible
 horror
 films
 but
 great


slapstick
 comedies.
 The
 Friday
 the
 13th


films,
 for
 example,
 every
 character
 in


those
 movies
 is
 one-dimensional.
 You've


got
 the
 cheerleader,
 you've
 got
 the


jock,
 you've
 got
 the
 stoner,
 you've
 got


the
 the
 good
 girl
 who
 studies
 and
 is


saving
 her
 virginity
 for
 marriage.


>> All
 of
 the
 tropes
 that
 were
 made
 fun
 of


in
 the
 film
 Cabin
 in
 the
 Woods.


>> Absolutely.
 And
 none
 of
 these
 characters


have
 any
 depth
 to
 them.
 You
 never
 really


care
 about
 them
 as
 human
 beings
 or
 even


see
 them
 as
 fully
 rounded
 human
 beings.


And
 so
 it
 actually
 becomes
 somewhat


entertaining
 to
 watch
 Jason
 Vorhees
 work


his
 way
 through
 them
 with
 one
 ghoulish


murder
 after
 another.
 We
 respond
 to
 that


exactly
 the
 same
 way
 we
 respond
 to
 a


Warner
 Brothers
 cartoon
 where,
 you
 know,


Bugs
 Bunny
 smashes
 a
 sledgehammer
 into


Daffy
 Duck's
 head.
 Mhm.


>> The
 difference
 between
 a
 Three
 Stooges


film
 and
 some
 of
 the
 later
 Friday
 the


13th
 films
 is
 very
 fine.


>> A
 lot
 of
 eyes
 getting
 poked.


>> Yeah,
 exactly.
 That
 thing
 where
 Mo
 takes


a
 sledgehammer
 to
 Curley's
 head.
 You
 see


that
 scene
 and
 you
 shout
 with
 laughter.


You're
 watching
 Texas
 Chainsaw
 Massacre


and
 Leatherface
 takes
 a
 sledgehammer
 to


some
 teenager's
 head
 and
 blood
 flies
 all


over
 the
 camera
 and
 you
 scream.


But
 you're
 responding
 fundamentally
 to


the
 same
 scene.
 It's
 actually
 the
 same


scene.
 And
 I
 also
 think
 it's
 interesting


that
 in
 both
 cases
 you
 respond
 with
 this


kind
 of
 reptile
 brain
 vocalization,


something
 that's
 deeper
 than
 than
 words,


a
 scream
 or
 a
 laugh.


>> I
 was
 describing
 this
 phenomenon
 or
 this


response
 mechanism
 to
 someone
 recently.


I
 saw
 a
 movie
 called
 In
 a
 Violent


Nature.
 I
 haven't
 seen
 it
 yet,
 but
 I'm


pretty
 excited
 for
 it.


>> Which
 for
 many
 people
 listening,
 do
 not


watch
 this
 movie.
 This
 movie
 is
 not
 for


most
 people,
 but
 I
 will
 talk
 to
 Joe
 here


about
 it
 because
 it
 is
 for
 him.
 And


there's
 a
 scene
 in
 that
 movie
 I
 was


watching
 at
 Home
 Alone
 late
 at
 night


where
 I
 did
 the
 thing
 you
 just
 described


where
 I
 went,
 "Oh,
 I
 started
 making


sounds
 that
 I
 was
 not
 expecting
 to
 and
 I


was
 not
 prepared
 to,
 but
 I
 could
 not


help
 myself."


Yeah,
 that
 is
 a
 mark
 of
 course
 of
 an


effective
 moment
 because
 it's
 cut
 right


through
 your
 conscious
 the
 fortress
 of


your
 conscious
 mind
 and
 got
 to
 something


deeper
 and
 has
 reminded
 you
 that
 were


animals
 on
 the
 face
 of
 the
 planet
 and


terrible
 things
 can
 happen
 to
 us
 if
 we


get
 in
 the
 way
 of
 a
 buzzing
 chainsaw.


>> It's
 a
 very
 odd
 thing
 to
 to
 laugh
 to.


>> It
 is.
 And
 it's
 weird.
 It's
 weird
 that


we
 want
 this.
 It's
 weird
 that
 we
 want
 to


spend
 a
 weekend
 with
 a
 frightening


novel,
 someone
 facing
 a
 dreadful


scenario.
 Why
 would
 we
 want
 to
 read


these
 stories
 of
 someone
 lost
 in
 a
 dark


basement
 with
 a
 vampire
 or
 something
 and


something
 that's
 going
 to
 make
 it
 hard


for
 us
 to
 sleep?
 There
 is
 a
 a
 Dutch


writer
 named
 Matias
 Lawson
 who's
 written


a
 book
 called
 How
 Horror
 Seduces.
 That's


one
 of
 the
 better
 non-fiction
 works
 on


the
 genre
 in
 the
 last
 quarter
 century.


and
 he
 studies
 horror
 fiction
 from
 the


viewpoint
 of
 evolutionary
 psychology.


And
 his
 attitude
 about
 horror
 fiction
 is


it's
 much
 like
 when
 children
 play


hideand-
 seek
 or
 tag
 because


hide-and-seek
 and
 tag
 are
 are
 play


versions
 of
 predator
 and
 prey.
 It's


chasing
 and
 being
 chased.
 Children
 find


this
 terrifically
 entertaining,
 but


there
 have
 been
 times
 and
 places
 in


history
 when
 knowing
 how
 to
 hide
 fast


was
 extremely
 useful
 for
 small
 human


beings.
 And
 by
 the
 same
 token,
 I
 think


that
 we
 read
 horror
 fiction
 as


rehearsal,
 that
 we
 study
 horror
 fiction


because
 in
 the
 safe
 playground
 of
 our


imagination,


we
 can
 explore


frightening
 questions
 about
 our
 own


mortality
 and
 our
 own
 well-being
 that
 in


everyday
 life
 we
 normally
 don't
 want
 to


confront.


The
 example
 I
 use
 is
 there's
 obviously,


you
 know,
 a
 terrific
 passion
 for
 stories


about
 vampires
 of
 all
 sorts
 from
 from


glittering
 vampires
 to
 drooling


noseratu.


And
 spoiler
 alert,
 you're
 never
 going
 to


face
 a
 vampire
 in
 real
 life.
 They
 don't


exist.
 No
 blood
 sucker
 is
 going
 to
 come


by
 your
 house
 in
 the
 middle
 of
 the


night,
 you
 know,
 get
 a
 pint
 of
 blood.


>> I'm
 slightly
 disappointed,
 but
 continue.


>> I
 know.
 I
 know
 I'm
 a
 heartbreaker,
 but


many
 people
 in
 their
 lives
 will
 wrestle


with
 something
 like
 cancer.


Cancer
 is
 an
 invisible
 adversary
 that


that
 wants
 to
 take
 your
 life
 and
 will


can
 weaken
 you
 day
 by
 day
 and
 it's
 not


clear
 how
 to
 fight
 it
 and
 it's


frightening
 and
 puts
 you
 right
 up
 in
 the


face
 of
 your
 own
 mortality.
 Cancer
 is
 a


vampire.
 And
 when
 we
 read
 a
 story
 about


people
 fighting


fighting
 off
 a
 vampire,
 I
 think
 that


we're
 engaged
 in
 a
 kind
 of
 rehearsal


about
 what
 sort
 of
 choices
 would
 I
 make


if
 some
 invisible
 adversary
 was
 preying


on
 my
 life
 and
 my
 time
 was
 running
 out.


>> Mhm.


>> How
 would
 I
 want
 to
 be
 in
 the
 world
 if
 I


felt
 my
 strength
 ebbing
 away
 and
 was
 in


this
 fight
 for
 my
 life
 that
 there
 was
 a


good
 chance
 I
 might
 lose?
 Also,
 what
 do


moments
 of
 great
 stress
 reveal
 about
 a


person?
 What
 would
 it
 reveal
 about
 me?


>> Absolutely.
 How
 would
 I
 cope?
 And
 we're


drawn
 to
 these
 questions


because
 we
 want
 to
 prepare
 for
 the
 big


moments
 ahead
 of
 time
 before
 it's
 too


late.
 We
 want
 to
 have
 some
 idea
 about


what
 is
 admirable
 behavior,
 what
 is


wholesome
 behavior,
 what
 is
 emotionally


healthy
 behavior,
 and
 what's
 destructive


and
 damaging
 and
 useless
 and


counterproductive.
 I
 think
 most
 people


don't
 want
 to
 go
 out
 like
 the
 Paul
 Riser


character
 in
 Aliens


shutting
 doors
 on
 his
 fellows
 and


running
 to
 save
 his
 own
 ass
 and
 everyone


else
 be
 damned.
 One
 of
 the
 great


cowards.


>> Yeah,
 one
 of
 the
 great
 cowards
 of
 horror


cinema.
 Whereas
 whereas
 Bill
 Paxton,
 the


Bill
 Paxton
 character
 in
 Aliens
 who


seems
 like
 such
 a
 coward,
 actually
 has


this
 moment
 at
 the
 end
 when
 suddenly
 he


grabs
 his
 courage
 with
 both
 hands
 and


he's
 standing
 there
 with
 the
 aliens


running
 at
 him
 saying,
 "You
 want
 some?


You
 want
 some,
 too?
 How
 about
 you?"
 And


I
 think
 most
 of
 us
 feel
 like,
 "Okay,
 if


I
 was
 in
 that
 scenario,
 I'd
 be
 just
 as


terrified
 as
 him,
 but
 I
 hope
 in
 my
 last


moments,
 I'd
 make
 my
 stand."


So,
 we're
 here
 to
 talk
 about
 horror


fiction,
 but
 first
 I
 want
 to
 ask
 you,


given
 the
 season,
 given
 that
 Halloween


is
 part
 of
 the
 reason
 that
 we're
 having


this
 conversation,
 what
 is
 Halloween
 for


you?


>> I
 think
 the
 thing
 about
 Halloween,
 and
 I


I'm
 a
 New
 England
 guy,
 I
 live
 in
 New


Hampshire.
 And
 the
 thing
 about
 Halloween


is
 it's
 all
 about
 the
 buildup.
 The
 joy


is
 all
 in
 the
 buildup.
 The
 leaves
 are


turning,
 the
 mornings
 are
 crisp,
 nothing


tastes
 better
 than
 the
 first
 cup
 of
 tea.


And
 every
 Friday
 night,
 you
 watch
 a
 new


horror
 film.
 You
 plan
 ahead.
 So
 you've


got
 your
 whole
 horror
 film
 festival


worked
 out.


>> You
 pick
 some
 reading
 that's
 appropriate


for
 the
 season.


>> So
 at
 the
 moment
 I'm
 reading
 the
 best


ghost
 stories
 of
 Algenon
 Blackwood.
 It's


the
 first
 time
 I've
 read
 him
 since
 I
 was


a
 teenager.
 It's
 all
 early
 20th
 century.


It
 has
 a
 kind
 of
 Edwardian
 Victorian


feel
 to
 it.
 So
 it's
 just
 right.
 It
 feels


just
 perfect
 for
 the
 season.
 Tasteful


but
 frightening.
 Mhm.


>> And
 and
 then
 you
 have
 the
 big
 night
 and


the
 kids
 go
 out
 and
 they
 get
 dressed
 and


run
 from
 house
 to
 house
 collecting


candy.
 That's
 fun.
 That's
 fine.
 But
 sort


of
 like
 opening
 your
 presents
 on


Christmas
 morning,
 the
 anticipation
 and


the
 buildup
 is
 where
 all
 the
 real


pleasure
 is.


>> That
 is
 perfectly
 put.
 I
 want
 to
 talk


about
 some
 books
 that
 you
 would


recommend
 for
 the
 season.
 You
 just


mentioned
 the
 stories
 of
 Aldron


Blackwood,
 but
 I
 know
 you
 have
 a
 few


more
 that
 you
 wanted
 to
 dip
 into.
 The


first
 one
 is
 Lost
 Man's
 Lane
 by
 Scott


Carson.
 Who
 is
 Scott
 Carson?


>> Not
 who
 he
 appears
 to
 be.
 Scott
 Carson


is
 a
 pen
 name
 for
 the
 thriller
 writer


Michael
 Karita.
 Michael's
 probably
 best


known
 for
 a
 novel
 under
 his
 own
 name


called
 Those
 Who
 Wish
 Me
 Dead,
 which
 was


made
 into
 an
 intense
 backwoods
 thriller


starring
 Angelina
 Jolie,
 but
 he
 does


write
 other
 novels
 under
 the
 name
 Scott


Carson.
 His
 Michael
 Karita
 thrillers
 are


all
 mainstream
 thrillers
 set
 in
 the


world
 as
 we
 understand
 it.
 But
 the
 Scott


Carson
 books
 indulge
 in
 his
 love
 of


supernatural
 fiction.
 Lost
 Man's
 Lane
 is


probably
 the
 best
 of
 the
 Scott
 Carson


books
 to
 date.
 So
 if
 you
 loved
 Stranger


Things,
 you
 will
 love
 Lost
 Man's
 Lane.


It
 has
 something
 of
 the
 same
 feel
 to
 it.


It
 has
 some
 of
 the
 texture
 of
 a
 young


adult
 novel,
 but
 is
 also
 very
 much
 for


grown-ups.
 something
 like
 Stranger


Things.
 It
 is
 set
 not
 the
 1980s
 like


Stranger
 Things,
 but
 at
 the
 at
 the
 tail


end
 of
 the
 1990s


and
 occasional
 historical
 events
 intrude


in
 quite
 striking
 ways.
 They're
 all


pllopped
 in
 front
 of
 the
 TV
 on
 the
 day


that
 Coline
 happens.
 And
 one
 of
 the
 most


moving


moments
 in
 the
 story
 is
 when
 one
 of
 the


parents
 says
 to
 the
 kids,
 "We
 will
 never


let
 this
 happen
 again."
 And
 that's
 the


most
 frightening
 moment
 in
 the
 book
 sent


a
 shiver
 right
 through
 me.
 But
 the
 story


is
 about
 a
 young
 man
 on
 the
 day
 he
 gets


his
 driver's
 license.
 He's
 pulled
 over


by
 the
 police
 for
 going
 just
 slightly


over
 the
 speed
 limit.
 The
 cop
 who
 pulls


him
 over
 is
 a
 terrifying
 bully
 and


there's
 something
 off
 about
 him.
 And


gradually
 we
 are
 forced
 to
 conclude
 that


he's
 had
 an
 encounter
 with
 a
 police


officer
 who
 is
 50
 or
 60
 or
 70
 years
 out


of
 time.
 Someone
 who
 has
 popped
 into
 the


1990s


from
 all
 the
 way
 back
 in
 the
 1940s
 or


1950s.
 And
 this
 person
 and
 that
 this


person
 who
 is
 hop
 skipping
 through
 time


is
 also
 responsible
 for
 a
 number
 of


murders.


>> There's
 also
 I
 mentioned
 it
 has
 a
 little


bit
 of
 the
 quality
 of
 a
 young
 adult


story.
 There's
 also
 the
 best


supernatural
 snake
 in
 this
 story
 since


the
 snake
 in
 the
 Harry
 Potter
 books.


What's
 the
 name
 of
 the
 snake?


>> Neagini.


>> Yes.
 Yes.


>> Okay.
 So,
 number
 one
 and
 number
 two
 on
 a


list
 of
 two.


>> Yes.
 Exactly.
 It's
 sort
 of
 like
 Jaws
 2


is
 the
 absolute
 second
 best
 shark
 film.


>> It's
 on
 actually
 a
 huge
 list.


>> Yeah.


>> So,


>> so
 that's
 a
 great
 recommendation.
 The


writing
 is
 light
 and
 witty.
 The
 pages


turn
 swiftly.
 Because
 Michael
 is
 a


thriller
 writer
 in
 the
 mold
 of
 a
 Harlon


Cobin
 or
 a
 Lynwood
 Barlay,
 he
 also
 has
 a


little
 dash
 of
 Dennis
 Leane
 in
 him.
 And


because
 that's
 the
 world
 of
 writing
 he


comes
 from,
 there
 are
 a
 lot
 of
 very


satisfying
 twists,
 a
 lot
 of,
 you
 know,


really
 stunning,
 oh,
 I
 can't
 believe


that
 just
 happened.
 And
 the
 art
 is
 in


having
 those
 reversals
 and
 twists
 and


then
 getting
 to
 the
 end
 of
 the
 book
 and


feeling
 like
 they
 were
 all
 earned.


>> Yeah.
 That
 it
 wasn't
 just
 it
 wasn't
 just


a
 twist
 to
 shock
 you
 and
 keep
 you


moving.


>> Do
 you
 feel
 as
 someone
 who
 has
 read
 more


than
 most
 perhaps
 and
 has
 written
 a
 lot


and
 has
 to
 think
 about
 plotting
 and


structure
 and
 twists
 and
 turns
 and


surprises.
 Do
 you
 find
 that
 when
 you


actually
 encounter
 a
 genuine
 one
 in


fiction,
 it
 remains


delightful?
 The
 idea
 that
 someone
 can


still
 come
 up
 with
 a
 twist
 that
 can


confound
 even
 someone
 who's
 read


hundreds
 and
 hundreds
 of
 books.


>> The
 really
 good
 ones
 are
 miraculous.


Probably
 the
 writer
 who
 is
 best
 at


the
 mindblowing
 twist
 is
 the
 crime
 and


thriller
 writer
 Anthony
 Horowitz,
 who


also
 dabbles
 in
 horror.
 Some
 of
 his


fiction
 is
 horror.


>> Has
 he
 written
 Sherlock
 Holmes
 books?
 Am


I
 Is
 that
 the
 same
 person?


>> He
 has.
 He
 has.
 He
 wrote
 a
 book
 called


Morardi.
 I
 was
 reading
 it
 aloud
 to
 my


wife
 and
 it
 had
 one
 twist
 that
 was
 so


ingenious
 and
 so
 stunning.
 She
 didn't


believe
 it
 had
 really
 happened.
 She


thought
 I
 was
 making
 it
 up
 just
 to
 upset


and
 perturb
 her.
 And
 she
 snatched
 the


book
 out
 of
 my
 hands
 to
 read
 it
 for


herself
 to
 make
 sure
 it
 was
 really
 on


the
 page.
 So
 that's
 the
 power
 of
 a


really
 good
 twist.
 All
 I
 can
 speak
 of
 is


my
 own
 work
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 this
 sort


of
 thing.


>> I'm
 not
 an
 outliner.
 I
 don't
 plan
 the


books
 ahead.
 When
 I
 have
 pulled
 off
 a


satisfying
 twist,
 the
 first
 person
 it


surprised
 was
 me.
 before
 it
 ever


surprised
 a
 reader.
 It
 was
 a
 decision


that
 one
 of
 my
 characters
 made
 or
 some


kind
 of
 revelation
 where
 I
 was


completely
 stunned
 for
 that
 to
 just
 fly


onto
 the
 page.


>> And
 how
 does
 that
 come
 to
 you?
 You're


sitting
 there
 and
 it
 happens.
 Are
 you
 in


the
 shower?
 Are
 you
 on
 a
 walk?


>> It
 usually
 happens
 while
 you're
 writing.


So,
 it's
 usually
 it's
 not
 something
 that


just
 occurs
 to
 you
 while
 you're
 out
 for


a
 walk.
 My
 view
 of
 it
 is
 you
 have
 a


situation.
 I
 wrote
 a
 story
 about
 a
 man


who
 has
 a
 collection
 of
 disturbing


artifacts.
 So
 he
 has
 a
 trey
 panned
 human


skull.
 He
 has
 a
 witch's
 confession.
 He


has
 a
 snuff
 film.
 He
 has
 a
 whole
 cabinet


of
 curiosities
 of
 disturbing
 artifacts.


And
 he
 hears
 about
 a
 woman
 selling
 a


ghost
 online
 and
 he
 decides
 he
 has
 to


have
 it
 for
 his
 collection.
 Now,
 if
 you


ever
 read
 even
 a
 single
 horror
 story,


you
 know
 what
 a
 terrible
 idea
 this
 is.


But
 the
 the
 guy
 buys
 it.
 In
 my
 case,
 it


was
 this
 death
 metal
 rocker
 named
 Judas


Coin
 who's
 in
 his
 mid60s.
 This
 was
 my


first
 book,
 Heart-Shaped
 Box.
 And
 when
 I


wrote
 the
 story,
 I
 thought
 it
 was
 going


to
 be
 a
 short
 story
 called
 Dead
 Man's


Suit,
 because
 I
 was
 sure
 that
 he
 was
 the


guy.
 When
 we
 first
 meet
 Jude,
 he's
 sort


of
 an
 angry
 creep
 and
 a
 belligerent


creep.
 And
 I
 thought
 he
 would
 buy
 this


ghost
 online
 and
 it
 would
 eat
 him
 for


breakfast
 by
 page
 30
 and
 I'd
 sell


another
 short
 story
 for
 500
 bucks.
 But


Jude
 turned
 out
 to
 be
 like
 a
 cockroach.


Every
 time
 I
 stepped
 on
 him,
 I'd
 lift
 my


shoe
 and
 he'd
 scuttle
 away
 again.
 Every


time
 he
 survived,
 it
 surprised
 me
 all


over
 again.
 But
 the
 reason
 he
 surprised


is
 because
 I
 was
 projecting
 myself
 into


his
 psychology
 and
 his
 views,
 his
 whole


sort
 of
 persona.
 And
 he
 kept
 making


choices
 that
 were
 perfectly
 natural
 for


him,
 but
 were
 surprising
 to
 me
 because


they
 were
 never
 the
 choices
 that
 I
 would


have
 made
 in
 the
 same
 situation.
 So,
 I


think
 that's
 how
 a
 reveal
 or
 a
 a
 shock


can
 work
 if
 you
 don't
 outline
 for
 it.


Maybe
 Michael
 outlines.
 I'd
 have
 to
 I'd


have
 to
 ask
 him.
 I've
 spoken
 to
 him
 a


few
 times.


>> The
 next
 two
 books
 on
 your
 list,
 Fever


House
 and
 The
 Devil
 by
 Name
 are
 by
 Keith


Rosson.
 And
 the
 first
 one
 in
 particular


has
 a
 classic
 conceit,
 which
 is
 that


there's
 an
 evil
 severed
 head.
 We've
 all


been
 there.


>> Yeah.
 And
 the
 Fever
 House,
 and
 it's
 just


out
 in
 hardcover
 sequel,
 The
 Devil
 by


Name,
 is
 absolutely
 bonkers.


Gonzo
 horror.
 Every
 scene,
 every
 chapter


is
 more
 bananas
 than
 the
 one
 before.
 And


somehow
 it
 all
 works
 and
 is
 propulsive


and
 tremendously
 exciting.
 When
 Fever


House
 begins,
 we're
 with
 two


enforcers,
 two
 two
 goons
 who
 work
 for
 a


criminal
 syndicate,
 and
 they've
 come
 to


collect
 some
 money
 from
 a
 methhead.


Well,
 when
 they
 go
 to
 collect,
 they


discover
 a
 severed
 hand
 in
 his
 ice
 box.


And
 the
 severed
 hand
 works
 on
 you
 a


little
 bit
 like
 bath
 salts.
 It's


druglike


and
 has
 power
 over
 your
 reactions
 in


your
 mind.
 There's
 something
 addictive


about
 being
 close
 to
 it,
 but
 it
 also


makes
 you
 incredibly
 violent.
 makes
 you


want
 to
 hurt
 everyone
 around
 you
 and


respond
 to
 the
 slightest
 setback
 by


reaching
 for
 the
 closest
 baseball
 bat.


And
 on
 one
 endless
 rainy
 night
 in


Portland,
 Oregon,
 this
 severed
 hand,


which
 might
 be
 the
 severed
 hand
 of
 a


devil,
 begins
 to
 move
 across
 Portland,


move
 across
 the
 city,
 being
 passed
 from


one
 person
 to
 another
 and
 creating
 more


and
 more
 chaos.


It
 turns
 out
 that
 the
 severed
 hand
 is


one
 of
 three
 remnants.
 There's
 also
 a


tape
 recording
 that
 drives
 people
 crazy,


a
 voice,
 a
 tape
 recording
 of
 a
 voice


that
 drives
 people
 crazy
 to
 hear
 it.
 And


there's
 an
 eyeball,
 an
 eyeball
 of
 a


devil,
 and
 if
 you
 look
 into
 this


eyeball,
 you
 see
 how
 you
 yourself
 will


die.


>> Somehow,
 I
 knew
 this
 conversation
 would


be
 very
 different
 from
 views
 I've
 had


throughout
 the
 rest
 of the
 year.


The
 Fever
 House
 is
 an
 ingenious
 work
 of


writing.
 It
 has
 the
 energy
 of
 early
 punk


rock.
 It
 has
 something
 of
 a
 punk
 rock


ethos.
 It's
 very
 in-your-face.


It
 has
 a
 tremendous
 cast
 of
 characters.


There
 is
 a
 pair
 of
 feds
 that
 read
 like
 a


twisted
 version
 of
 Moulder
 and
 Scully


from
 the
 XFiles.
 There
 is
 an
 angel


that's
 being
 held
 under
 conditions
 that


make
 Guantanamo
 Bay
 look
 like
 the


Hilton.


>> Did
 you
 say
 an
 angel?


>> Yes,
 an
 angel.
 And
 occasionally
 people


with
 the
 secretive
 government
 agency


take
 a
 hacksaw
 to
 his
 wings
 to
 force
 him


to
 talk.


>> So
 that's
 savage.


>> I
 don't
 know
 what
 to
 make
 of
 this.


>> This
 is
 all
 in
 one
 book.


>> This
 is
 all
 in
 one
 book.
 There
 is
 a


former
 rock
 and
 roll
 singer
 who
 is
 now


almost
 incapable
 of
 leaving
 her


apartment
 and
 she's
 a
 bit
 like
 Patty


Smith.
 She's
 tough
 and
 highly


intelligent
 but
 in
 this
 case
 she's
 also


crippled
 by
 her
 anxieties.
 You
 have
 this


whole
 world.
 It
 it
 actually
 I
 have


actually
 sometimes
 described
 it
 as
 the


pulp
 fiction
 of
 horror
 novels


>> in
 the
 sense
 that
 you
 have
 this


kaleidoscopic


ensemble
 of
 characters
 on
 a
 whole


spectrum
 of
 scummyiness
 and
 all
 of
 them


are
 whirling
 about
 in
 this
 one
 city
 in


this
 one
 incredibly
 rainy
 night
 while


our
 whole
 world
 spins
 out
 of
 control
 and


this
 hand
 spreads
 rage,
 madness,
 and


chaos
 across
 Portland,
 Oregon.


The
 ending
 is
 so
 outrageous
 I
 won't


speak
 of
 it.


>> Thank
 you.


>> I
 will
 say
 the
 devil
 by
 name.
 The


followup
 presents
 us
 with
 a
 world
 that


has
 been
 profoundly
 changed.
 Fever
 house


is
 set
 in
 our
 world
 as
 we
 understand
 it


with
 the
 supernatural
 intruding
 on
 life


as
 we
 know
 it.
 And
 the
 devil
 by
 name
 is


something
 of
 the
 reverse
 where
 the
 real


world
 is
 now
 intruding
 on
 a
 world
 that


has
 been
 changed
 by
 the
 power
 of
 the


supernatural.
 That
 was
 a
 superb


recommendation.
 I
 think
 you
 should
 do


this
 for
 a
 living.
 I
 recommend


>> the
 job
 is
 taken.


>> The
 last
 thing
 I'll
 say
 about
 it
 is


because
 I
 think
 this
 matters
 to
 a
 lot
 of


readers.
 The
 last
 thing
 I'll
 say
 about


it
 is
 the
 pages
 of
 Fever
 House
 and
 the


Devil
 by
 Name
 fly
 by
 so
 quickly,
 you're


in
 constant
 danger
 of
 paper
 cuts.
 And
 I


think
 that
 matters
 cuz
 I
 think
 good


horror
 fiction
 needs
 to
 move.
 Stuff
 has


got
 to
 happen.
 And
 there's
 certainly
 not


time
 for
 a
 lot
 of
 introspection
 in
 the


work
 of
 Keith
 Rosson.
 There's
 some


though.


>> I
 feel
 like
 the
 next
 and
 last
 book


you're
 going
 to
 talk
 about
 probably
 has


a
 little
 bit
 of
 that.
 It's
 totally


completely
 different,
 quite
 serious,


quite
 frightening.
 This
 is
 a
 book
 called


The
 Reformatory.


>> Yeah,
 The
 Reformatory
 by
 Tanana
 Reef
 Du


is
 just
 out
 in
 paperback.
 It
 also
 just


won
 the
 World
 Fantasy
 Award
 for
 best


novel.
 I
 think
 that's
 wonderful,
 but


hardly
 surprising.
 The
 Reformatory
 is


probably
 one
 of
 the
 two
 or
 three
 best


horror
 novels
 published
 in
 this
 century


so
 far.
 It
 is
 set
 in
 the
 early
 1950s
 in


the
 south
 and
 it's
 about
 a
 black
 kid
 who


gets
 in
 a
 tustling
 match
 with
 a
 white


kid
 after
 her
 sister
 is
 insulted.


This
 black
 kid
 winds
 up
 in
 a
 reformatory


that
 is
 as
 terrifying
 as
 the
 Overlook


Hotel
 and
 just
 as
 haunted.


And
 gradually
 it
 becomes
 clear
 that
 if


this
 kid
 doesn't
 get
 out
 of
 the


reformatory
 in
 a
 hurry,
 he
 will
 not
 live


to
 be
 15.
 The
 book
 is
 has
 a
 lot
 to
 say


about
 the
 early
 civil
 rights
 movement


and
 about
 what
 it
 was
 like
 to
 be
 black


in
 the
 south
 in
 the
 middle
 of
 the
 20th


century.
 I
 thought
 I
 knew
 that
 story
 and


it
 turned
 out
 there
 was
 a
 whole
 bunch
 I


did
 not
 know.
 Mhm.


>> It's
 also
 just
 a
 damn
 fine
 horror
 novel,


you
 know,
 scary,
 zippy,
 full
 of
 fraught,


tense
 set
 pieces.
 Our
 lead
 character


encounters
 a
 number
 of
 ghosts
 in
 the


reformatory,
 and
 those
 encounters
 are


chilling
 and
 also
 emotionally
 powerful.


These
 are
 moments
 that
 have
 something
 to


say


about
 the
 tragedy
 of
 so
 many
 of
 the
 kids


who
 were
 sent
 to,
 for
 example,
 the
 Doure


School
 for
 Boys
 who
 never
 left,
 who


walked
 through
 that
 door
 and
 never


walked
 back
 out.
 And
 probably
 the


highest
 praise
 I
 can
 give
 the
 book
 just


about
 is,
 boy,
 it
 reads
 like
 a
 Stephen


King
 novel,
 you
 know?
 I
 mean,
 it's
 it's


just
 it's
 got
 that
 energy,
 that


vividness,
 and
 that
 heart.
 And
 I
 was


completely
 blown
 away.
 I
 read
 the
 book


probably
 a
 year
 ago
 and
 I
 think
 about
 it


all
 the
 time.


>> I
 have
 one
 more
 question
 for
 you
 that
 I


didn't
 prepare
 you
 for,
 but
 I
 am
 curious


given
 you
 have
 you
 have
 kids.
 What
 do


you
 think
 are
 good
 entry
 points?


Goosebumps
 aside,
 we
 know
 the
 work
 of


Arl
 Stein
 is
 a
 gateway
 drug
 for
 kids


into
 horror.
 But
 what
 do
 you
 give


younger
 people
 maybe
 who
 want
 to
 that's


not
 it,
 but
 who
 want
 to
 dip
 into
 this


stuff?
 I
 think
 the
 gateway
 drug
 for


horror
 fiction
 for
 kids
 who
 are
 maybe


10,
 11,
 and
 to
 any
 parents
 listening,
 I


am
 not
 the
 parent
 of
 your
 kid
 and
 you


have
 to
 make
 your
 own
 decisions
 about


what
 your
 kid
 is
 appropriate
 for.
 So,


take
 any
 advice
 from
 me
 with
 a
 grain
 of


salt.
 You
 know,


>> you
 legally
 protected.
 Thank
 you.


>> Yeah,
 you
 know
 what
 your
 kid
 can
 handle


and
 I
 don't.
 That
 said,
 there
 is
 a
 work


of
 dark
 fantasy
 by
 a
 writer
 named
 John


Bolair's
 called
 The
 House
 with
 a
 Clock


in
 Its
 Walls.
 There
 was
 a
 film.
 I


haven't
 seen
 the
 film
 because
 I


desperately
 wanted
 to
 write
 the


screenplay
 and
 I
 never
 got
 a
 chance
 to


and
 I'm
 so
 disgusted
 someone
 else
 got
 to


have
 that
 pleasure
 instead
 that
 just
 I'm


just
 rejecting
 the
 film.
 I'm
 pretending


the
 film
 doesn't
 exist
 on
 personal


grounds.
 The
 book
 is
 a
 masterpiece
 of


dark
 fantasy
 and
 I
 would
 look
 for
 any
 of


the
 editions
 that
 were
 illustrated
 by


Edward
 Gory
 who
 illustrated
 the
 original


edition
 as
 part
 of
 the
 joy
 of
 the
 book.


marvelous
 illustrations,
 but
 it
 is
 about


a
 young
 boy
 named
 Lewis
 Barnvelt
 who


like
 so
 many
 kids
 in
 young
 adult
 novels


has
 been
 orphaned
 and
 he
 goes
 to
 live


with
 his
 uncle
 in
 I
 want
 to
 say
 New


Zebedee,
 Connecticut.
 It
 turns
 out
 that


his
 uncle
 is
 a
 sorcerer
 and
 that
 the


house
 is
 full
 of
 magical
 artifacts.
 And


in
 the
 course
 of
 trying
 to
 impress


another
 boy,
 Lewis
 accidentally
 cast


some
 gets
 involved
 with
 necromancy
 and


raises
 the
 spirit
 of
 evil,
 terrible


person.
 And
 I've
 read
 that
 book.
 I've


probably
 read
 House
 with
 Clock
 and
 it


walls
 a
 dozen
 times
 over
 the
 course
 of


my
 life.
 And
 I
 think
 it
 has
 some


incredibly
 chilling
 scenes,


but
 still
 within
 the
 range
 of
 what
 an


imaginative,
 good
 humored
 11-year-old


can
 cope
 with.
 It's
 the
 masterpiece
 of


fantasy
 that
 JK
 Rowling
 never
 wrote.
 I
 I


would
 put
 House
 with
 Clock
 on
 his
 walls


comfortably
 ahead
 of
 any
 of
 the
 Harry


Potter
 novels.


>> I
 read
 those
 books
 in
 those
 editions


that
 you're
 describing.
 I
 remember
 the


illustrations
 quite
 well.
 Well,
 I
 think


there
 was
 one
 John
 Belair's
 book,
 not


illustrated
 by
 Edward
 Gorey,
 that


genuinely
 gave
 me
 bad
 dreams
 for
 years.


I
 think
 it
 was
 from
 the
 letter
 of
 the


witch
 in
 the
 ring.
 But
 do
 you
 think
 John


Belair's
 is
 still
 discussed
 these
 days?


I
 feel
 like
 uh
 you
 don't
 hear
 it
 as
 much


about
 him
 as
 maybe
 you
 should.


>> I
 think
 he's
 mostly
 dropped
 out
 of
 the


conversation
 and
 that's
 too
 bad.
 He's


someone
 who
 deserves
 to
 be
 rediscovered


because
 the
 work
 is
 so
 great.
 That
 book


in
 particular,
 The
 House
 with
 the
 Clock


and
 Walls
 in
 particular
 is
 really
 one
 of


the
 classics
 of
 childhood
 fantasy
 just


as
 much
 as
 The
 Phantom
 Pole
 Booth
 or
 The


Black
 Cauldron,


>> Mhm.


>> The
 Lion
 Witch
 in
 the
 Wardrobe.
 It
 is
 in


that
 class,
 that
 very
 elite
 class
 of


lasting,
 timeless
 stories
 of
 childhood


wonder,
 Darkness,
 and
 the
 Fantastic.
 And


I'm
 pretty
 sure
 that
 house
 with
 a
 clock


on
 his
 moss
 at
 least
 is
 still
 in
 print.


>> Joe
 Hill,
 thank
 you
 so
 much
 for
 coming


on
 the
 book
 review
 podcast
 to
 recommend


a
 bunch
 of
 great
 scary
 books
 for
 the


season.
 This
 was
 a
 real
 delight.


>> Good.
 It
 was
 a
 pleasure.
 Thanks
 for


talking
 to
 me.


>> That
 was
 my
 conversation
 from
 last


October
 with
 Joe
 Hill,
 who
 has
 just


released
 his
 first
 novel
 in
 almost
 a


decade,
 King
 Sorrow.
 We'll
 be
 right


back.


Welcome
 back.
 I'm
 Gilbert
 Cruz,
 editor


of
 the
 New
 York
 Times
 Book
 Review,
 and
 I


am
 presenting
 you
 now
 with
 a


conversation
 that
 I
 had
 with
 a
 great


writer
 from
 two
 years
 ago,
 Victor
 Laval,


who
 wrote
 a
 piece
 of
 historical
 horror


fiction
 called
 Lone
 Women.
 He
 is
 talking


about
 Shirley
 Jackson's
 The
 Haunting
 of


Hill
 House.
 Alongside
 Henry
 James'
 The


Turn
 of
 the
 Screw
 and
 Stephen
 King's
 The


Shining,
 The
 Haunting
 of
 Hill
 House,


published
 in
 1959,
 is
 one
 of
 the
 seminal


haunted
 house
 stories
 of
 the
 20th


century.
 It
 tells
 a
 tale
 of
 Eleanor


Vance,
 a
 32-year-old
 woman
 who
 is


invited
 to
 the
 Titular
 Hill
 House
 by
 a


psychic
 investigator
 who
 has
 gathered
 a


small
 group
 of
 people
 to
 try
 to
 gather


actual
 proof
 of
 the
 existence
 of


paranormal
 phenomena.
 Eleanor,
 who
 had


spent
 years
 essentially
 cut
 off
 from
 the


world
 as
 she
 cared
 for
 her
 now
 deceased


mother,
 previously
 experienced
 an


unexplained
 event
 when
 she
 was
 12
 when


stones
 fell
 on
 her
 house
 for
 three
 days.


This
 quartet
 of
 people,
 Eleanor,
 Dr.


Montigue,
 a
 woman
 named
 Theo,
 who
 is


clairvoyant,
 and
 Luke,
 who's
 the
 heir
 to


the
 house,
 experience
 increasingly


creepy
 incidents
 as
 they
 begin
 to
 wonder


what's
 real
 and
 what's
 not,
 as
 we
 begin


to
 wonder
 what's
 real
 and
 what's
 not,


and
 whether
 or
 not
 one
 of
 them
 is


actually
 responsible.


Victor,
 I'd
 love
 it
 if
 you
 can
 read
 the


first
 paragraph
 of
 The
 Haunting
 of
 Hill


House.


>> I'm
 happy
 to.
 No
 live
 organism
 can


continue
 for
 long
 to
 exist
 sainely
 under


conditions
 of
 absolute
 reality.
 Even


larks
 and
 cattyids
 are
 supposed
 by
 some


to
 dream.
 Hillhouse,
 not
 sane,
 stood
 by


itself
 against
 its
 hills,
 holding


darkness
 within.
 It
 had
 stood
 so
 for
 80


years
 and
 might
 stand
 for
 80
 more.


Within
 walls
 continued
 upright,
 bricks


met
 neatly,
 floors
 were
 firm,
 and
 doors


were
 sensibly
 shut.
 Silence
 lay
 steadily


against
 the
 wood
 and
 stone
 of
 Hill


House,
 and
 whatever
 walked
 there
 walked


alone.


>> Yeah,


>> I
 love
 that.
 One
 of
 the
 great
 opening


paragraphs.


>> Talk
 to
 me
 about
 that
 paragraph.


>> Number
 one,
 it's
 just
 so
 beautiful,


beautifully
 written.
 And
 I
 think
 one
 of


the
 great
 things
 about
 Shirley
 Jackson


is
 the
 way
 that
 she
 finds
 a
 way
 to
 she


writes
 about
 the
 fantastical,
 the


supernatural,
 and
 all
 the
 rest,
 but
 she


does
 it
 with
 such
 beautiful
 sentences.


And
 it's
 it's
 a
 real
 gift,
 number
 one.


But
 it's
 that
 opening
 line
 in
 that


paragraph
 that
 is
 really
 like
 the


thematic,
 the
 organizing
 principle
 of


the
 entire
 book.
 No
 live
 organism
 can


continue
 for
 long
 to
 exist
 sely
 under


conditions
 of
 absolute
 reality.
 And
 that


turns
 out
 to
 be
 essentially
 the
 test


that
 is
 put
 to
 our
 main
 character,


Eleanor.
 We
 see
 her
 because
 she's
 our


real
 main
 character.
 We
 spend
 a
 great


deal
 of
 time
 in
 her
 head
 as
 she's
 trying


to
 parse
 out
 like
 what's
 actually


happening
 and
 what
 isn't
 happening,
 but


even
 more,
 what
 do
 I
 feel?
 What
 do
 I


want?
 What
 do
 I
 not
 want?
 Do
 I
 really


understand
 myself
 or
 not?
 And
 it's
 a


kind
 of
 debate
 she's
 having
 with
 herself


throughout
 the
 book.
 And
 by
 the
 end,
 I


would
 say
 the
 choice
 she
 makes,
 I
 don't


want
 to
 ruin
 it
 for
 anybody,
 but
 the


choice
 she
 makes
 is
 almost
 her
 final


reaction
 to
 the
 absolute
 reality
 of
 who


she
 is
 and
 what
 her
 circumstances
 are.


And
 it's
 right
 there
 in
 the
 opening


sentence.


>> And
 that
 paragraph
 is
 repeated
 at
 the


end
 of
 the
 book,
 as
 I
 recall.


>> That's
 right.
 And
 I
 think
 it's
 just
 like


a
 refrain
 that
 comes
 back,
 but
 by
 the


end
 of
 the
 book,
 hopefully
 you


understand
 it
 very
 differently
 because


of
 the
 choice
 that
 Eleanor
 has
 made.
 And


it's
 spooky
 in
 the
 beginning
 and
 at
 the


end
 it's
 heartbreaking.


>> Talk
 to
 me
 about
 the
 first
 time
 you
 read


this
 book
 or
 the
 earliest
 memory
 that


you
 have
 of
 reading
 this
 book.
 Tell
 me


everything
 where
 you
 got
 it.
 Was
 it
 did


you
 buy
 it?
 Was
 it
 at
 the
 library?
 Do


you
 still
 have
 that
 copy?
 What
 you


thought
 then?
 The
 whole
 McGill.
 Well,
 it


actually
 begins
 before
 Shirley
 Jackson.


It
 begins
 with
 Stephen
 King
 and
 his
 book


Dance
 Macabra,
 which
 was
 his
 80s
 summary


of
 the
 horror
 field
 in
 general.
 And
 as
 a


kid
 who
 was
 in
 love
 with
 Stephen
 King
 at


the
 time,
 but
 who
 was
 not
 supremely
 well


read,
 I
 treated
 that
 book
 like,
 as
 many


people
 did,
 I'm
 sure,
 like
 a
 just
 a


list,
 a
 bibliography.
 Here's
 everything


you
 got
 to
 read.
 And
 for
 better
 or


worse,
 Shirley
 Jackson's
 Haunting
 of


Hill
 House
 was
 one
 of
 the
 first
 I
 picked


up.
 Actually,
 I
 know
 the
 reason
 is


because
 it
 was
 one
 of
 the
 few
 that
 was


in
 the
 library,
 our
 local
 the
 Flushing


branch
 of
 the
 public
 library.
 And
 I


picked
 it
 up
 because
 essentially
 cuz


Stephen
 King
 said
 I
 should.
 And
 then
 I


read
 it
 and
 I
 didn't
 understand
 more


than
 half
 of
 it.
 The
 funny
 thing
 is
 when


I
 think
 about
 the
 book
 at
 my
 different


stages,
 when
 I
 read
 it
 as
 a
 kid,
 I
 was


probably
 15
 and
 all
 I
 really
 remembered,


the
 part
 that
 really
 stayed
 with
 me
 was


the
 haunted
 house.
 Everything's
 spooky,


which
 as
 I
 reread
 it
 again,
 like


preparing
 to
 come
 today,
 I
 was
 like


looking
 through
 it
 and
 I
 was
 marveling


at
 the
 fact
 that
 we
 don't
 even
 get
 to


the
 house
 till
 page
 25
 of
 the
 book
 and


it's
 a
 short
 book.
 It's
 only
 175
 pages.


But
 when
 I
 was
 a
 kid,
 that
 was
 the
 part


that
 sparked
 my
 excitement.
 Oh,
 there's


a
 big
 spooky
 house.
 And
 then
 the
 other


thing
 that
 she
 does
 that
 to
 me
 is
 even


more
 rarified
 within
 the
 haunted
 house


field,
 although
 certainly
 anyone
 who's


read
 The
 Shining
 will
 understand
 it
 is


that
 a
 lot
 of
 haunted
 house
 stories
 turn


out
 to
 be
 that
 there's
 an
 entity
 there


that
 is
 the
 cause.
 Someone
 died
 there.


Someone
 a
 crime
 was
 done,
 blah
 blah


blah.
 But
 in
 her
 book,
 it's
 the
 house


itself.
 It's
 Hill
 House
 that
 is
 evil.
 Or


at least
 that's
 what
 Eleanor
 believes.


The
 Overlook
 Hotel
 feels
 very
 much
 like


akin
 to
 that.


>> Yeah.
 I
 believe
 there's
 a
 line
 early
 on


maybe
 when
 Eleanor
 sees
 the
 house
 for


the
 first
 time.
 Jackson
 writes,
 "The


house
 was
 vile.
 She
 shivered
 and
 thought


the
 words
 coming
 freely
 into
 her
 mind."


Hill
 House
 is
 vile.
 It
 is
 diseased.
 Get


away
 from
 here
 at
 once.
 You're


absolutely
 right
 that
 there
 is
 something


to
 the
 house
 being
 evil.
 And
 the
 way


that
 Jackson
 gets
 at
 it,
 as
 I
 recall,
 is


not
 just
 having
 Eleanor
 tell
 us,
 but


it's
 also
 within
 the
 architecture
 of
 the


house
 is
 what
 to
 me
 is
 one
 of
 the
 more


memorable
 things
 about
 the
 book.
 If
 you


think
 about
 books
 that
 came
 decades


later,
 like
 House
 of
 Leaves,
 which
 is


about
 a
 house
 that
 keeps
 mutating,


growing
 bigger
 on
 the
 inside.
 the
 way


that
 Jackson
 describes
 the
 way
 rooms


just
 don't
 seem
 right.
 Walls
 don't
 come


together
 at
 the
 right
 angles.
 Pieces
 of


the
 house
 that
 you
 should
 be
 able
 to
 see


from
 this
 window
 are
 just
 completely


obscured.
 It
 touches
 on
 how
 HP
 Lovecraft


used
 to
 write
 about
 the
 way
 in
 which


angles
 never
 came
 together
 in
 the
 right


way.
 But
 she
 applies
 that
 to
 a
 house
 as


a
 living
 organism
 almost.


>> Yeah.
 the
 non
 uklitian
 geometry.
 That


was
 Lovecraft's
 whole
 whole
 cities
 built


on
 non
 uklitian
 geometry,
 which
 I
 always


love
 cuz
 I
 have
 no
 idea
 what
 that
 means.


I
 don't
 know
 what
 it
 means.
 Nobody


knows.
 Nobody
 knows
 what
 it
 means,
 but


it
 sounds
 good.
 And
 definitely
 Shirley


Jackson,
 even
 the
 first
 time
 Eleanor


enters
 her
 room,
 she's
 just
 standing
 at


like
 the
 doorway
 and
 she's
 just
 trying


to
 understand
 where
 the
 corners
 are
 cuz


there's
 strange
 shadows
 in
 places
 where


she
 thinks
 there
 shouldn't
 be.
 and
 the


ceiling
 goes
 higher
 on
 one
 end
 than
 the


other
 and
 then
 she
 walks
 across
 the
 room


and
 suddenly
 where
 she
 was
 looks
 strange


and
 it's
 so
 disorienting
 in
 a
 way
 that


feels
 not
 cheap
 like
 the
 I
 feel
 like
 the


cheap
 version
 of
 this
 is
 she
 walks
 in


and
 then
 there
 was
 a
 skeleton
 in
 the


corner
 and
 whatever
 it
 might
 be


>> please
 I
 would
 never
 read
 that
 book


>> right
 it
 would
 not
 become
 a
 classic
 but


for
 her
 it's
 that
 sense
 of
 something
 is


off
 something
 is
 always
 off
 in
 this


place
 and
 then
 of
 course
 the
 beauty
 of


it
 is
 you
 start
 to
 understand
 or
 you


start
 to
 wonder
 is
 that
 the
 house
 or
 is


that
 Eleanor?
 Because
 Eleanor
 is
 also


always
 trying
 to
 figure
 out
 why
 why


can't
 she
 get
 close
 to
 people?
 Why
 can't


she
 trust
 anyone?
 Why
 can't
 she
 love


anyone?
 What
 is
 what
 are
 the
 things
 that


are
 off
 in
 her?
 And
 how
 is
 this
 house
 a


reflection
 of
 that?
 And
 it
 becomes
 this


wonderful
 funhouse
 mirror
 back
 and
 forth


between
 the
 two.


Talk
 to
 me
 about
 another
 moment
 in
 your


life
 when
 you
 were
 older
 when
 you
 can


remember
 reading
 this
 book
 and
 how
 you


received
 it
 differently.
 So
 if
 the
 first


time
 you
 read
 it
 you're
 like
 wow
 this
 is


a
 great
 creepy
 haunted
 house
 story.
 Tell


me
 where
 you
 were
 in
 your
 life
 when
 you


read
 it
 second
 third
 fourth
 time
 and


what
 you
 picked
 up
 then.
 So
 the
 second


time
 I
 can
 recall
 reading
 it.
 I
 was
 it


must
 have
 been
 about
 199
 I
 want
 to
 say


94
 and
 I
 had
 been
 kicked
 out
 of
 college


because
 I
 was
 not
 doing
 well.
 I
 had
 poor


grades
 all
 this
 kind
 of
 rest.
 I
 was


living
 in
 Ithaca,
 New
 York,
 and
 I
 took
 a


job
 working
 for
 Manpower,
 the
 temp


agency,
 and
 I
 was
 usually
 like
 moving


furniture,
 cleaning
 offices,
 whatever
 it


might
 be,
 and
 trying
 to
 figure
 out
 like


was
 my
 college
 career
 over
 cuz
 I
 got


booted
 out
 in
 my
 junior
 year,
 I
 think.


And
 I
 had
 a
 lot
 of
 free
 time,
 as
 you


sometimes
 do
 at
 temp
 jobs.
 And
 I'd


picked
 up
 the
 book
 for
 a
 class
 that
 I


characteristically
 at
 that
 time
 in
 my


life
 did
 no
 work
 in.
 But
 I
 had
 the
 book


in
 the
 house
 that
 I
 was
 sharing
 in
 the


room
 that
 I
 was
 sharing
 with
 these
 other


guys
 and
 I
 started
 to
 read
 it.
 And
 the


thing
 that
 stayed
 with
 me
 this
 time
 was


those
 first
 25
 pages
 where
 you
 discover


how
 awful
 Elanor's
 life
 was
 before
 she


shows
 up
 at
 Hill
 House.


The
 awfulness
 of
 that
 was
 she
 spent


years
 taking
 care
 of
 a
 mother
 who
 was


vile
 to
 her
 and
 then
 she
 lives
 with
 her


in
 one
 of the
 most
 effective
 scenes


right
 at
 the
 start
 but
 that
 I
 totally


glossed
 over
 at
 15.
 She's
 sitting
 with


her
 sister
 and
 brother-in-law
 and
 she's


saying
 I'd
 like
 to
 take
 the
 family
 car


to
 drive
 to
 Hill
 House
 for
 this
 trip.


And
 you
 watch
 the
 sister
 keeps
 saying


she's
 Jackson's
 so
 nice
 about
 this.


Eleanor
 keeps
 saying,
 "The
 car
 is
 half


mine.
 It
 was
 like
 half
 my
 inheritance."


And
 the
 sister
 keeps
 saying,
 "I
 just


don't
 know
 if
 I
 can
 let
 you
 take
 my


car."
 And
 they
 just
 keep
 doing
 that.
 And


then
 the
 h
 the
 brother-in-law
 just
 keeps


saying,
 "What
 if
 our
 kid
 gets
 sick
 while


we're
 on
 while
 you're
 away?
 We
 might


need
 to
 get
 in
 the
 car
 and
 drive


somewhere."
 And
 you
 see
 her
 being
 snowed


under
 by
 the
 weight
 of
 this
 family
 and


these
 people
 who
 just
 don't
 listen
 to


her.
 And
 so
 then
 one
 morning
 after


they've
 told
 her
 no,
 she
 just
 steals
 the


car
 and
 you're
 actually
 proud
 of
 her.


She
 had
 done
 this
 bold
 thing.
 And
 I


guess
 in
 a
 way
 like
 reading
 it
 then
 when


I
 was
 booted
 out
 of
 school
 and
 I
 had


been
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 say
 anybody's


names,
 but
 I
 had
 been
 treated
 really


badly
 by
 this
 dean
 when
 I
 got
 booted


out.
 Like
 literally
 in
 his
 office,
 he


said
 to
 me,
 "You
 will
 never
 graduate


while
 I
 am
 a
 dean."
 And
 I
 had
 never
 met


this
 dude
 before.
 And
 so
 it
 really
 felt


like,
 wow,
 the
 universe
 is
 out
 to
 get


me.
 And
 so
 maybe
 I
 was
 extra
 empathetic


to
 Eleanor
 and
 her
 feelings
 of
 being


crushed
 under
 the
 weight
 of
 these


people.
 And
 so
 that
 first
 25
 page,
 she


steals
 the
 car.
 And
 then
 on
 her
 drive
 to


Hill
 House,
 it's
 her
 first
 time
 that
 she


is
 free.
 And
 you
 watch
 her
 stopping
 in


different
 places
 and
 living
 out
 these


fantasies
 about,
 oh,
 I
 could
 just
 go


here
 and
 I
 could
 live
 in
 the
 woods
 and
 I


could
 grow
 this
 kind
 of
 fruit
 and


vegetables
 and
 I
 could
 just
 live


happily.
 Or
 I
 could
 go
 here
 and
 the


beauty
 of
 it
 is
 you
 see
 her
 trying
 out


independence.
 You
 see
 her
 trying
 to


stand
 up
 for
 herself
 and
 then
 she
 goes


to
 Hill
 House


>> where
 everything
 goes
 fine.


>> Where
 it's
 the
 shortest
 novel
 ever.
 She


gets
 there,
 everyone
 welcomes
 her.
 It's


all
 sweet.
 The
 house
 isn't
 haunted.


>> Have
 you
 ever
 borrowed
 anything
 from


this
 book
 for
 your
 work?
 A
 character


name,
 a
 beat,
 a
 motivation,
 a
 tone.
 What


have
 you
 pulled
 out
 of
 it?


>> Well,
 actually,
 I
 mean,
 rereading
 it


again
 just
 over
 the
 weekend,
 the
 opening


bits,
 I
 realized
 the
 beginning
 of
 Lone


Women
 is
 Eleanor's
 escape
 and
 the
 way


that
 she's
 afraid
 of
 being
 caught.
 Like


I
 absolutely
 lifted
 that
 feeling
 for


Adelaide
 and
 in
 a
 way
 it's
 not
 in
 the


book
 because
 in
 the
 end
 my
 editor
 and
 I


agreed
 it
 was
 a
 little
 boring
 but
 I


spent
 actually
 a
 lot
 more
 time
 in
 an


earlier
 draft.
 You
 stayed
 with
 her
 on


the
 ship
 that
 she's
 first
 on
 from


Southern
 California
 then
 she's
 in


Seattle.
 She
 spends
 a
 little
 time
 in


Seattle
 then
 in
 then
 from
 Seattle
 she


takes
 the
 train
 across
 Montana.
 And
 that


one
 I
 spent
 even
 more
 time
 like
 really


borrowing
 from
 that
 first
 25
 pages
 in


particular.


>> When
 was
 the
 last
 time
 that
 you
 read
 The


Haunting
 of
 Hill
 House?


>> The
 last
 time
 before
 this
 weekend
 when
 I


was
 rereading
 it
 for
 this
 my
 wife
 had


given
 birth
 to
 our
 first
 son.
 It
 was
 the


summer
 we're
 both
 off
 from
 teaching.
 So


we
 were
 just
 basically
 what
 we
 would
 do


is
 we
 were
 up
 and
 down
 by
 his
 schedule


at
 that
 point
 and
 living
 this
 kind
 of


weird
 nocturnal
 life
 where
 we
 would
 at


around
 5:00


watch
 the
 wire
 while
 drinking
 beer
 and


eating
 popcorn
 with
 this
 like
 wheat
 dust


on
 top
 of
 it
 cuz
 it
 was
 supposedly
 going


to
 give
 us
 more
 energy
 or
 whatever
 it


might
 do.
 And
 then
 eventually
 he
 would


fall
 asleep.
 My
 wife
 who
 was
 absolutely


much
 more
 exhausted
 would
 crash.
 And
 one


of
 those
 times
 I
 was
 in
 the
 kitchen.
 I


started
 to
 make
 it
 my
 thing
 that
 I
 would


be
 in
 the
 kitchen
 so
 that
 I
 could
 be


closer
 to
 if
 he
 woke
 up
 I
 could
 get
 to


him
 quicker.
 And
 I
 started
 to
 read
 some


things.
 And
 this
 was
 one
 of
 the
 books
 I


actually
 read
 Haunting
 of
 Hill
 House


then.
 So
 that
 would
 have
 been
 11
 years


ago
 now
 cuz
 he's
 11.
 And
 I
 also
 read
 her


the
 book
 that
 came
 after
 this.
 We
 have


always
 lived
 in
 the
 castle
 which
 is
 as


much
 as
 I
 love
 this
 book
 that's
 her


masterpiece
 I
 would
 say.
 But
 it's
 it
 the


two
 are
 almost
 like
 a
 great
 pairing.
 But


I
 read
 that
 exhausted
 in
 our
 kitchen
 in


Washington
 Heights.
 And
 in
 that
 one,
 I


just
 envied
 the
 idea
 that
 Eleanor
 lived


alone
 cuz
 I
 really
 needed
 to
 live
 alone


at
 that
 point
 when
 our
 baby
 was
 about
 a


month
 or
 two
 old.


>> I
 remember
 those
 crazy
 early
 morning


hours
 and
 being
 up
 and
 trying
 to
 read


something
 or
 trying
 to
 I
 think
 I
 watched


the
 Baba
 at
 like
 4:00
 in
 the
 morning,


which
 is
 not
 a
 great
 movie
 if
 you've


just
 had
 a
 kid.
 That
 is
 a
 No,
 that's
 a


terrible
 idea.


>> Oh
 my
 god.
 Maybe
 this
 was
 a
 bad
 idea.


>> Yes,
 that
 one
 that's
 a
 profound
 I
 mean
 I


love
 that
 movie,
 but
 yeah,
 I
 wouldn't


recommend
 it
 then.


>> I
 had
 not
 read
 a
 plot
 synopsis


beforehand.
 It
 was
 my
 mistake.


>> How
 do
 you
 recommend
 this
 book
 to
 people


if
 you
 ever
 do
 when
 you're
 trying
 to


tell
 someone
 you
 absolutely
 have
 to
 read


The
 Haunting
 of
 a
 Hill
 House?
 How
 do
 you


sell
 it?
 You
 know,
 actually
 often
 it's


with
 that
 opening
 paragraph
 that
 you


asked
 me
 to
 read
 because
 I
 really
 feel


like
 it's
 almost
 a
 kind
 of
 key
 like
 if
 a


person
 hears
 that
 paragraph
 and
 they


lean
 in,
 they
 kind
 of
 go,
 "Wait
 a


second.
 What
 does
 that
 mean
 Hill
 House


is
 not
 saying?
 What
 does
 that
 mean
 that


even
 Larks
 and
 Caddyy
 did
 dream?"
 If
 all


those
 things
 inspire
 questions,
 then
 I


know
 this
 will
 be
 your
 thing.
 Just
 take


it.
 I
 promise
 you.
 And
 then
 if
 I
 read


that
 to
 someone
 and
 they
 go,
 I
 don't


know
 what
 they're
 talking
 about.
 I
 don't


know
 what
 that
 means.
 I
 often
 say,
 let


me
 think
 of
 something
 else.
 How
 about


because
 the
 other
 the
 nice
 thing
 is
 then


I
 might
 recommend
 the
 we
 have
 always


lived
 in
 the
 castle
 because
 that
 one


begins
 with
 a
 much
 clearer
 in
 theory


introduction
 to
 the
 main
 character


Maryat.
 And
 she's
 super
 weird,
 but
 it's


more
 concrete.
 But
 really,
 I
 say
 at


heart
 like
 do
 you
 want
 to
 read
 a


beautifully
 written
 book
 about
 a
 very


lonely
 woman
 in
 a
 very
 lonely
 house?


Well,
 this
 is
 definitely
 a
 book
 that
 I


can
 see
 myself
 reading
 several
 more


times
 in
 my
 life.
 Hopefully,
 that's
 the


same
 for
 you.
 Yes.
 And
 hopefully
 for


everyone
 listening,
 we've
 convinced
 you


to
 give
 it
 a
 shot.


>> I
 hope
 so.
 I
 hope
 so.
 It
 will
 reward


you.


>> It's
 one
 of
 the
 greats.


>> Yes.


>> I've
 been
 speaking
 with
 Victor
 Laval


about
 Shirley
 Jackson's
 The
 Haunting
 of


Hill
 House
 and
 about
 his
 new
 novel,
 Lone


Women.
 Victor,
 thank
 you
 so
 much
 for


being
 here
 today.


>> It
 was
 a
 pleasure.
 Thanks
 for
 this.


Those
 were
 my
 conversations
 with
 Joe


Hill
 from
 2024
 and
 Victor
 Laval
 from


2023.


I'm
 Gilbert
 Cruz.
 I
 hope
 you
 keep
 it


spooky,
 everyone.
 See
 you
 next
 week.
