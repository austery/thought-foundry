[Music]


hello
 greetings
 from
 Philadelphia
 and


thank
 you
 very
 much
 for
 having
 me
 uh


it's
 my
 honor
 to
 follow
 Mark
 and
 to
 um


say
 that
 you
 know
 in
 uh
 a
 climate
 of


uncertainty
 and
 change
 um
 but
 also
 I


would
 say
 you
 know
 historically
 across


time
 that
 there
 has
 been
 a
 quality
 of


the
 highest
 Achievers
 in
 every
 domain
 at


least
 every
 domain
 that
 I
 have
 studied


and
 that
 includes
 leadership
 um
 so
 I'd


like
 to
 present
 to
 you
 today
 what
 I
 have


discovered
 about
 what
 grid
 is
 why
 it's


special
 and
 what
 this
 means
 especially


in
 the
 leadership
 context
 um
 I
 want
 to


say
 on
 a
 personal
 note
 that
 I
 grew
 up


with
 a
 father
 who
 only
 talked
 about


being
 a
 world
 class
 achiever
 literally


that's
 all
 we
 talked
 about
 at
 breakfast


at
 dinner
 on
 the
 weekends
 summer


vacations
 um
 and
 my
 dad
 talked
 a
 lot
 um


implicitly
 about
 how
 the
 highest


Achievers
 were
 naturally
 talented
 they


were
 smarter
 than
 everyone
 they
 were


more
 gifted
 and
 what
 I
 grew
 up
 to
 learn


as
 a
 psychologist
 is
 that
 Talent
 innate


Talent
 especially
 has
 nothing
 to
 do
 with


grit
 let
 me
 show
 you
 four
 questions
 from


the
 grit
 scale
 to
 give
 give
 you
 a
 sense


of
 what
 I'm
 talking
 about
 um
 here's
 an


item
 that
 indexes
 your
 perseverance
 for


long-term
 goals
 ask
 yourself
 whether
 if


I
 talk
 to
 your
 closest
 colleagues


whether
 they
 would
 rush
 to
 tell
 me
 that


you
 are
 an
 especially
 hard
 worker
 um


would
 they
 tell
 me
 that
 you
 uh
 finish


whatever
 you
 begin
 um
 this
 item
 by
 the


way
 um
 also
 an
 index
 of
 your


perseverance
 for
 longterm
 goals
 is
 the


single
 most
 predictive
 item


on
 the
 grit
 scale
 so
 this
 is
 probably


what
 you
 think
 of
 when
 you
 think
 of
 grit


someone
 who's
 really
 a
 hard
 worker
 also


uh
 you
 know
 resilient
 in
 the
 face
 of


setbacks
 they
 finish
 things
 when
 a
 lot


of
 other
 people
 quit
 and
 I
 would
 tell


you
 that
 that
 is
 half
 right
 because
 that


is
 half
 of
 grit
 uh
 but
 grit
 is
 also


passion
 for
 long-term
 goals
 and
 let
 me


show
 you
 two
 items
 from
 the
 grit
 scale


that
 index
 your
 passion
 for
 long-term


goals
 and
 before
 you
 read
 them
 I
 need
 to


warn
 you
 that
 they're
 reverse
 scored


meaning
 that
 if
 you
 read
 them
 and
 you


say
 wow
 that's
 just
 like
 me
 that's
 how


everyone
 would
 describe
 me
 then
 actually


you
 get
 a
 lower
 passion
 score
 and
 a


lower
 overall
 grit
 score
 for
 example
 I


have
 difficulty
 maintaining
 my
 focus
 on


projects
 that
 take
 more
 than
 a
 few


months
 to
 complete
 or
 I
 often
 set
 a
 goal


but
 later
 choose
 to
 pursue
 a
 different


one
 given
 that
 I'm
 following
 Mark
 and


his
 comments
 I
 do
 want
 to
 say


importantly
 that
 when
 I
 study
 grit
 this


combination
 of
 perseverance
 and
 passion


for
 long-term
 goals
 I
 want
 to
 say
 on
 the


passion
 element
 that
 in
 the
 context
 of


uncertainty
 and
 change
 now
 more
 than


ever
 what
 I
 what
 I
 mean
 about
 passion


for
 long-term
 goals
 is
 a
 kind
 of


steadfast
 and
 even
 stubborn
 dedication


to
 some
 top
 level
 goals
 some
 it's


usually
 very
 abstract
 it
 can
 even
 be


um
 so
 abstract
 as
 to
 not
 be
 easily


understandable
 by
 other
 people
 um
 but


you
 want
 extreme
 agility
 and
 flexibility


on
 how
 you're
 going
 to
 get
 there
 um
 and


I
 think
 that
 reconciles
 in
 some
 ways
 the


current
 environment
 of
 of
 uncertainty


and
 change
 with
 this
 um
 Timeless


character
 strength
 of
 grit
 now
 I
 said


that
 in
 my
 research
 that
 I
 found
 grit


and
 talent
 to
 be
 not
 at
 all
 related
 and


that's
 exactly
 true
 in
 my
 re
 Arch
 and
 in


research
 from
 around
 the
 world
 when
 you


measure
 IQ
 or
 other
 kinds
 of
 natural


ability
 uh
 you
 find
 that
 IQ
 is
 great
 it


predicts
 achievement
 but
 it's
 not


correlated
 with
 grit
 which
 I
 think
 is
 at


least
 as
 essential
 and
 I
 want
 to
 um


share
 with
 you
 one
 personal
 um


relationship
 that
 I
 have
 with
 a
 paragon


of
 grit
 because
 I
 think
 he
 illustrates


um
 how
 talent
 and
 grit
 are
 different
 and


how
 grit
 in
 some
 ways
 unleashes
 uh
 the


the
 the
 talent
 that
 uh
 people
 have
 in


order
 for
 them
 to
 accomplish
 great


things
 um
 meet
 Toby
 Cosgrove
 Toby


Cosgrove
 grew
 up
 he
 was
 a
 a
 very


mediocre
 student
 uh
 turns
 out
 he
 had


dyslexia
 a
 reading
 disability
 but
 um
 in


those
 days
 they
 didn't
 have
 a
 word
 for


it
 they
 just
 thought
 he
 was
 slow
 um
 but


he
 wanted
 to
 be
 um
 a
 doctor
 and
 he


eventually
 um
 got
 into
 medical
 school


and
 he
 eventually
 graduated
 from
 medical


school
 and
 it
 was
 time
 for
 him
 to
 choose


his
 specialty
 um
 he
 wanted
 the
 hardest


one
 so
 he
 he
 chose
 heart
 surgery
 and
 and


it
 was
 the
 most
 competitive
 and
 everyone


told
 him
 he
 couldn't
 do
 it
 um
 but
 Toby


did
 it
 anyway
 um
 he
 was
 told
 while
 he


was
 a
 resident
 in
 uh
 heart
 surgery


cardiac
 surgery
 that
 he
 was
 the
 least


talented
 individual
 there
 was
 um
 and
 uh


he
 didn't
 disagree
 with
 that
 um
 but
 he


believed
 that
 he
 could
 learn
 from
 his


failures
 failure
 is
 a
 great
 teacher
 he


said
 um
 and
 Toby
 went
 on
 to
 work
 and


work
 and
 work
 at
 refining
 the
 craft
 of


cardiac
 surgery
 um
 he
 said
 he
 was
 on
 a


constant
 quest
 to
 find
 ways
 uh
 to
 do


things
 better
 and
 I
 want
 to
 share
 one
 um


very
 specific
 story
 from
 you
 know
 Toby's


early
 years
 as
 a
 cardiac
 surgeon
 um
 he


realized
 that
 there
 were
 other
 surgeons


in
 the
 world
 who
 were
 far
 better
 than
 he


was
 so
 he
 would
 uh
 go
 and
 see
 see
 them


he
 would
 get
 on
 a
 plane
 like
 Mark
 did


and
 he
 would
 travel
 and
 he
 would
 stand


in
 the
 operating
 theater
 not
 operating


himself
 of
 course
 and
 he
 would
 take


notes
 and
 he
 would
 watch
 like
 a
 hawk
 and


these
 these
 Discovery
 trips
 um
 as
 he


sometimes
 called
 them
 he
 would
 come
 back


and
 then
 he
 would
 have
 a
 goal
 he
 would


have
 a
 picture
 in
 his
 head
 of
 something


he
 could
 do
 better
 that
 he
 would
 try
 to


do
 as
 as
 best
 he
 could
 and
 then
 to


refine
 and
 refine
 and
 refine
 and
 to


improve
 and
 I
 want
 to
 share
 with
 you
 how


this
 links
 up
 to
 um
 what
 is
 sometimes


called
 the
 10,000
 hour
 rule
 10,000
 hours


of
 practice
 now
 it's
 a
 dark
 Auditorium


and
 I'm
 in
 Philadelphia
 I'm
 not
 with
 you


but
 I'd
 like
 you
 to
 raise
 your
 hand
 if


you've
 ever
 heard
 this
 expression
 10,000


hours
 of
 practice
 10,000
 hours
 you
 know


makes
 you
 great
 at
 what
 you
 do
 well
 um


uh
 I
 know
 it's
 not
 the
 same
 country
 but


I
 do
 want
 to
 say
 that
 in
 Sweden
 there


was
 born
 a
 scientist
 named
 Anders


Ericson
 and
 um
 he
 was
 the
 scientist


whose
 research
 became
 popularized
 as
 the


10,000
 hour
 rule
 now
 Anders
 was
 a
 dear


friend
 of
 mine
 he
 passed
 away
 several


years
 ago
 um
 but
 he
 spent
 his
 entire


life
 as
 a
 cognitive
 scientist
 trying
 to


understand
 the
 learning
 curve
 of


worldclass
 experts
 so
 Grand
 Chess


Masters
 Olympic
 gold
 medalist
 athletes


Prima
 ball
 Aras
 worldclass


mathematicians
 etc
 etc
 and
 that


expression
 that
 you've
 heard
 of
 10,000


hours
 of
 practice
 comes
 from
 a
 single


study
 just
 one
 of
 his
 studies
 that


showed
 that
 at
 a
 German
 Music
 Academy


the
 very
 best
 musicians
 those
 who
 would


go
 on
 to
 recording
 contracts
 and
 um


achieve
 worldclass
 prominence
 um
 they


had
 on
 average
 about
 10,000
 hours
 of
 a


certain
 kind
 of
 practice
 the
 next
 group


had
 less
 of
 it
 maybe
 7500
 hours
 and
 the


worst
 group
 who
 were
 still
 pretty
 great


because
 this
 was
 a
 selective
 German


Music
 Academy
 they
 had
 maybe
 5,000
 now


that
 became
 popularized
 as
 a
 kind
 of
 um


heris
 a
 rule
 that
 the
 quantity
 of


practice
 makes
 you
 great
 but
 I
 want
 to


show
 you
 a
 different
 learning
 curve
 that


Anders
 also
 discovered
 and
 this
 graph


essentially
 summarizes
 his
 lifetime
 of


insight
 into
 how
 to
 become
 world
 class


at
 what
 you
 do
 you
 can
 put
 in
 10,000


hours
 or
 20,000
 or
 even
 40,000
 hours
 of


a
 different
 kind
 of
 practice
 a
 less


effective
 kind
 of
 practice
 and
 actually


stop
 improving
 unlike
 worldclass
 experts


I
 call
 this
 the
 plateau
 of
 Arrested


Development
 and
 I
 think
 it
 makes
 the


point
 that
 it's
 not
 just
 quantity
 of


practice
 that
 makes
 you
 world
 class
 it's


the
 quality
 of
 the
 practice
 you're
 doing


now
 I
 want
 to
 unpack
 that
 for
 you
 very


specifically
 because
 I
 think
 there's
 a


lesson
 in
 that
 for
 every
 leader
 for


every
 investor
 and
 indeed
 every


performer
 who
 wants
 to
 get
 somewhat


better
 every
 day
 at
 what
 they're
 doing


before
 I
 unpack
 that
 I
 want
 to
 show
 you


another
 learning
 curve
 um
 I
 have
 two


daughters
 and
 I
 rais
 them
 to
 believe


that
 life
 is
 a
 multiple
 choice
 question


you
 have
 a
 choice
 of
 improving
 every


single
 day
 at
 what
 you
 do
 that's
 the


path
 to
 becoming
 a
 world-class
 expert


there
 is
 plateauing
 at
 some
 level


of
 mediocre
 performance
 you
 know
 you
 get


better
 in
 your
 first
 year
 you
 get
 a


little
 better
 in
 your
 second
 year
 but


maybe
 in
 your
 fourth
 or
 fifth
 year


you're
 just
 on
 autopilot
 that's
 probably


most
 people
 and
 then
 there's
 a
 third


choice
 for
 you
 in
 life
 and
 that
 is
 to


drop
 out
 of
 what
 you're
 doing
 now


especially
 given
 Mark's
 comments
 and
 my


own
 um
 personal
 history
 and
 what
 I've


learned
 as
 a
 scientist
 I
 want
 to


emphasize
 to
 you
 today
 that
 dropping
 out


is
 sometimes
 exactly
 the
 thing
 to
 do


especially
 when
 there's
 some
 low-level


goal
 some
 tactic
 some
 quarterly


objective
 that's
 just
 not
 working
 out
 or


when
 the
 opportunity
 cost
 exceeds
 what


you're
 doing
 right
 now
 those
 are


excellent
 reasons
 to
 drop
 out
 I
 played


piano
 when
 I
 was
 a
 little
 girl
 and
 I'm


so
 glad
 I
 quit
 because
 I
 wasn't
 very


good
 at
 it
 and
 I
 didn't
 love
 it
 and
 I


was
 able
 to
 take
 my
 time
 and
 devote
 it


to
 something
 else
 but
 what
 you
 find


about
 every
 worldclass
 investor
 and


every
 worldclass
 leader
 is
 that
 they


eventually
 find
 something
 that
 they
 love


enough
 to
 keep
 with
 it
 to
 stay
 improving


and
 improving
 to
 have
 passion
 for
 that


long-term
 top
 level
 goal
 that
 keeps
 them


motivated
 now
 here
 is
 what
 Anders


Ericson
 discovered
 about
 highquality


practice
 it
 has
 three
 specific
 elements


and
 they're
 quite
 easy
 to
 understand
 but


maybe
 not
 easy
 to
 do
 in
 combination
 the


first
 element
 is
 that
 you
 must
 decide
 on


a
 very
 specific
 narrow
 aspect
 of
 your


overall
 performance
 and
 you
 drill
 that


in
 particular
 so
 uh
 if
 you
 if
 you
 ask
 an


Olympic
 Athlete
 you
 know
 like
 you
 know
 a


skier
 you
 know
 like
 what
 are
 you
 doing


they're
 not
 going
 to
 say
 I'm
 skiing


better
 they're
 going
 to
 give
 you
 a
 very


technical
 answer
 that
 you
 probably
 only


understand
 if
 you
 were
 also
 a
 worldclass


skier
 now
 they
 uh
 they
 do
 this
 usually


with
 a
 coach
 helping
 them
 but
 when
 they


practice
 they
 usually
 practice
 alone
 so


Andre's
 discovered
 toward
 the
 end
 of
 his


career
 that
 almost
 everyone
 needs
 a


mentor
 to
 show
 them
 and
 to
 help
 them


identify
 what
 to
 do
 next
 but
 when
 they


do
 the
 work
 it
 is
 almost
 always
 uh
 alone


uh
 so
 they
 can
 concentrate
 completely


and
 and
 really
 pay
 attention
 to
 what


they're
 doing
 so
 the
 second
 element
 is


practicing
 with
 complete
 Focus
 the


opposite
 of
 multitasking
 if
 you
 will
 and


the
 third
 element
 is
 the
 hardest


motivationally
 psychologically
 I
 would


say
 which
 is
 that
 you
 have
 to
 get


feedback
 on
 what
 you're
 doing
 feedback


back
 on
 that
 performance
 and
 then
 to


repeat
 the
 cycle
 again
 and
 I
 say
 it's


the
 most
 difficult
 motivationally


because
 if
 you
 tell
 me
 one
 thing
 that
 I


could
 have
 done
 better
 for
 you
 today
 in


my
 15
 minutes
 with
 you
 I
 will


immediately
 be
 defensive
 I
 don't
 want
 to


hear
 you
 criticize
 what
 I
 just
 did
 but


if
 I
 ignore
 your
 feedback
 then
 I
 will


never
 get
 better
 as
 a
 speaker
 and
 so


this
 feedback
 is
 the
 essential
 element


closing
 the
 feedback
 uh
 cling
 the


learning
 Loop
 but
 also
 it's
 something


that
 is
 the
 enemy
 of


ego
 now
 if
 you
 are
 somebody
 like
 Toby


cosgro
 if
 you
 do
 this
 kind
 of
 deliberate


Practice
 Day
 in
 day
 out
 to
 become
 a


better
 cardiac
 surgeon
 you
 have
 a
 top


level
 goal
 let
 me
 show
 you
 what
 a


hierarchy
 of
 goals
 looks
 like
 uh
 for


somebody
 like
 like
 Toby
 Cosgrove
 all


human
 beings
 have
 goals
 but
 what
 makes


gritty
 people
 special
 is
 that
 there
 is
 a


top
 level
 goal
 for
 which
 they
 are
 have


so
 much
 passion
 and
 persever


that
 they
 don't
 give
 up
 for
 Toby
 that


was
 to
 improve
 the
 patients
 lives
 that


he
 was
 working
 with
 both
 the
 quality
 and


the
 length
 of
 their
 life
 and
 to
 achieve


that
 goal
 he
 had
 mid-level
 goals
 you


know
 prevent
 cardiac
 conditions
 the


treat
 the
 conditions
 coordinate
 care
 and


then
 there
 were
 these
 low-level
 tactical


goals
 that
 uh
 he
 should
 be
 more
 flexible


and
 agile
 with
 but
 he
 should
 be
 very


stubborn
 about
 the
 top
 level
 goal
 now
 I


want
 to
 say
 what
 happened
 to
 Toby
 so
 he


became
 uh
 arguably
 the
 best
 heart


surgeon
 in
 the
 world
 he
 invented
 many


procedures
 um
 that
 are
 still
 in
 use


today
 um
 and
 then
 he
 became
 a
 leader
 uh


he
 became
 a
 real
 leader
 and
 he
 um
 uh


became
 the
 CEO
 of
 the
 Cleveland
 clinic


now
 the
 Cleveland
 Clinic
 is
 um
 uh
 one
 of


the
 world's
 most
 um
 renowned
 medical


facilities
 and
 suddenly
 Toby
 had
 to


understand
 how
 to
 lead
 with
 grit
 not


just
 how
 to
 be
 a
 Prof
 former
 with
 grit


but
 a
 leader
 with
 grit
 and
 I
 want
 to
 end


with
 this
 Insight
 I
 believe
 that
 what
 a


gritty
 organization
 is
 a
 gritty
 company


for
 example
 is
 uh
 in
 a
 way
 it's
 a


macrocosm
 of
 what
 a
 gritty
 individual
 is


so
 there
 is
 still
 a
 top
 level
 goal
 there


is
 a
 goal
 hierarchy
 with
 mid-level
 goals


and
 low-level
 goals
 I
 believe
 that
 the


top
 level
 goal
 in
 this
 case
 when
 Toby


took
 over
 the
 Cleveland
 Clinic
 he
 made


the
 top
 level
 goal
 put
 patience
 first


just
 those
 three
 words
 everybody
 walked


around
 with
 buttons
 that
 said
 put


patience
 first
 when
 I
 talked
 to
 the
 uh


secretaries
 and
 the
 custodians
 anybody


at
 the
 Cleveland
 Clinic
 I
 said
 what's


this
 place
 all
 about
 they
 said
 put


Patients
 First
 every
 single
 one
 of
 them


told
 me
 that
 now
 they
 all
 had
 different


jobs
 right
 they
 all
 had
 different


functions
 there
 was
 a
 hierarchy
 but


there
 was
 this


steadfast


stubborn
 dedication
 to
 a
 top
 level
 goal


and
 I
 want
 to
 say
 in
 conclusion
 that
 if


you
 believe
 that
 Talent
 is
 not
 enough
 if


you
 believe
 that
 it's
 not
 enough
 to
 be


lucky
 if
 you
 believe
 that
 in
 addition


you
 need
 to
 have
 passion
 and


perseverance
 at
 the
 individual
 level
 as


a
 performer
 you
 must
 also
 believe
 that


you
 need
 that
 at
 the
 organizational


level
 and
 that
 to
 me
 is
 the
 essence
 of


leadership
 with
 grit
 um
 in
 the
 words
 of


the
 Great
 American
 writer
 Ralph
 Waldo


Emerson
 any


institution
 is
 the
 lengthened
 shadow
 of


its
 leader
 when
 I
 find
 gritty
 leaders
 I


find
 gritty
 organizations
 when
 I
 find


gritty
 organizations
 I
 find
 gritty


leaders
 there
 is
 a
 top
 level
 goal
 that


motivates
 both
 and
 in
 on
 a
 personal
 note


I
 will
 say
 the
 reason
 I
 am
 so
 delighted


to
 be
 with
 you
 um
 is
 that
 I
 think
 niiki


is
 uh
 truly
 a
 great
 leader
 uh
 he
 leads


with
 grit
 and
 integrity
 and
 has
 been
 an


example
 for
 me
 uh
 for
 many
 years
 so
 in


friendship
 and
 in
 uh
 admiration
 I
 say


thank
 you
