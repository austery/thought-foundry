Keynesian

 John


Maynard
 Kanes
 in
 his
 1936
 general
 theory


revolutionized
 economic
 thinking
 by


challenging
 classical
 assumptions
 that


markets
 automatically
 self-correct.


Kanes
 argued
 economies
 could
 reach


equilibrium
 with
 high
 unemployment


justifying
 government
 intervention.


Aggregate
 demand
 the
 total
 spending
 on


goods
 and
 services
 in
 an
 economy


consumption
 plus
 investment
 plus


government
 spending
 plus

 exports.


Canes
 identified
 insufficient
 demand
 as


the
 primary
 cause
 of
 recessions,


shifting
 focus
 from
 supply
 side


concerns.
 Government
 intervention.
 When


private
 spending
 falls
 during
 downturns,


governments
 should
 increase
 spending
 and


cut
 taxes
 to
 stimulate
 demand
 and


restore
 full
 employment.
 This


countercyclical
 approach
 aims
 to
 smooth


business
 cycles.
 Multiplier
 effect.
 The


phenomenon
 where
 initial
 government


spending
 creates
 a

 effect,


generating
 more
 economic
 activity
 than


the
 original

 advocating

 they

 mid-
 20th
 century

 by


identifying

 as
 the
 primary

of

instability.
 Money

 Montorists
 argue

rather
 than

or
 engaging

 Marxist


economics
 developed
 by
 Karl
 Marx
 in
 Das


Capital


1867
 provides
 a
 radical
 critique
 of


capitalism
 analyzing
 it
 as
 an
 inherently


exploitative
 and

 system


driven
 by

 the
 principle
 that
 a


commodity's
 value
 derives
 from
 the


socially
 necessary

 required


for

 Markx
 argued
 this


reveals
 how
 capitalists
 extract

 from
 workers
 who
 receive

worth
 less
 than
 the
 value
 they
 create.


Surplus

Austrian
 school

 by


Carl
 Manger,
 Ludvig

 Friedrich

 offers
 a
 distinctive
 approach
 to


economic
 analysis
 emphasizing


methodological

 subjective


valuation
 and
 skepticism
 of
 government


intervention.


Spontaneous

 the
 concept
 that


complex
 social
 institutions
 and


arrangements,
 markets,

emerge
 naturally
 from
 individual
 actions


without

 Austrians


argue
 these
 decentralized
 systems


outperform

 alternatives
 by


aggregating

Subjective
 theory
 of

 The


principle
 that
 value
 derives
 not

but
 from
 subjective
 individual


preferences.
 Items
 are
 valuable
