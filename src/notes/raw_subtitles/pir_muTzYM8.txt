I'm here at the Navy's
Indoor Ocean at Carderock.
This is the biggest wave pool in the world
and they can make all
kinds of different waves
so they can test scale
ships and make them better
before they actually go
out on the open ocean.
I came in and I'd seen some pictures,
but I just walked in here
and it's just, it's insane.
'Cause they say indoor ocean,
but it's exactly what it is.
The water even looks ocean colored.
(laughing)
It doesn't look like a swimming pool,
this looks like an ocean,
looks like a test facility.
It is huge.
- It is 360 feet long in this dimension,
240 feet long in that dimension.
It's 20 feet deep.
Just about the size of a
football field out there.
The dome above us was the
largest free standing dome
for a while.
- [Derek] Largest free
standing dome in the world?
- Yep.
- What?
(Miguel laughs)
In this pool they can make
waves of all shapes and sizes
using huge paddles that
line two walls of the pool.
- We have 216 individual wave makers.
We can make waves from -45
degrees up to 135 degrees,
which is kind of coming right back at it.
- We are now behind the big
paddles that make the waves.
These 216 paddles are programmed to move
in incredibly well choreographed ways
so that they can produce reproducible,
perfect sized, perfect frequency waves
that go across the entire pool.
- You can see these air bellows
that are what's making the angular motion.
That vertical piece is
the force transducer.
The other force transducer's
right up on the top.
- [Derek] There are lots
of wave pools in the world,
but what makes this one
different is control.
You can create waves of a
specific amplitude and frequency
and do so repeatedly.
Can we try a one Hertz?
- [Miguel] Yeah. Do me a
favor and dial up one Hertz.
- [Operator] Amplitude
will be 0.078 at one Hertz.
- Okay, go ahead and
send it from zero please.
And so this is the largest
wave we can make, at one Hertz.
That's based on the motion
and power requirement
for the wave maker.
- [Derek] There's something a bit surreal
about watching this,
'cause it almost looks like an ocean
except you never see waves
this regular out there.
- [Miguel] Yeah, correct.
- One of the fundamental characteristics
of a wave is its wavelength,
the distance from one crest to the next.
The first thing most people learn
about waves is they transmit energy
rather than material from
one place to another.
In this case, as the wave
travels to the right,
the water molecules themselves
basically move along
circular paths.
And the deeper the water,
the smaller this motion.
All motion stops at a depth
equal to half the wavelength.
This is known as the wave base.
But even in an ideal water wave,
the molecules do drift a bit
in the direction of wave motion.
And this is because the
molecules travel faster
the higher up they are.
So they move farther at
the top of their loop
than they move backwards at the bottom,
creating a spiral path.
This place is perfect
for observing properties
of different waves.
I asked Miguel to show me some waves
with different frequencies
but the same amplitude.
- So what I'll have him do now is
I'll have him stop this wave
and just change the frequency.
'Cause we're at .6, we'll go to .5,
so it'll be a two second wave.
- Here I'm split screening
waves with frequencies
of .67, .5, and .33 Hertz,
all with the same amplitude.
So two things to notice.
Even though they all
have the same amplitude,
the ones with higher frequency
look like they have a greater amplitude
because the slope of the waves is steeper.
And second, the frequency
of a wave affects its speed.
High frequency waves travel
slower than low frequency waves.
In fact, as long as the water
is deeper than the wave base,
wave speed is inversely
proportional to its frequency.
They have a really cool demo
that takes advantage
of the different speeds
of different frequency waves.
You can see it starting here.
They send out high frequency waves first
followed by lower and
lower frequency waves.
And because the high
frequency waves travel slower,
the lower frequency
waves gradually catch up.
Whoa.
And they've timed it so
that all the waves meet up
at exactly the same time
and place in the pool,
and this causes the wave to break.
The ocean engineers can do this again
and again,
in exactly the same way,
thanks to their precise
control over the waves.
This demo also nicely illustrates
the principle of superposition,
that when waves meet they add together.
The height of the water is
equal to the sum of the heights
of the individual waves
meeting at that point.
You can see how much
bigger the amplitude is.
Those individual waves weren't that big,
but when you add them all together,
you can make this big breaking wave.
They can also take advantage
of the superposition principle
to create standing waves.
- So what's coming up
next are two regular waves
coming at each other.
What we call the quilt wave.
So we're gonna have a wave coming this way
and a wave going this way,
and it's gonna create standing waves.
So there's two regular waves coming out
and if you look at the wave,
it looks like a big
quilt pattern out there.
- At some places in the pool,
the waves always cancel
out to zero amplitude,
and at other places the waves
add up for maximum amplitude.
They can even send waves
from all directions,
so they form circular wave fronts
and then all the wave energy
is channeled into one spot
they call the bullseye.
- And so now we're gonna
run the bullseye wave
which is essentially the same thing,
but instead of having a line of waves,
we're having it all coalesce
at one individual point.
So you can start seeing the waves are
coming from the long bank here,
and you can see they're
making a spherical wave.
And then you have another spherical wave
coming from the short bank.
And this is breaking due
to the coalescing waves,
and the wave height being more than
one seventh of the wavelength.
- We tried throwing some toys
into the wave to see what
would happen to them.
Would they get pushed
into the breaking wave?
Even though there's not much
net movement of the water,
the ducky drifts with the waves,
and pretty quickly is
pushed into the bullseye.
How's the ducky doing?
(Miguel laughs)
- He's getting to the
danger zone right now.
It's starting to funnel him
right into that breaking wave.
Ooh, it's getting up, getting up.
- [Miguel] Oh!
(laughs) It swamped it.
- [Derek] That's amazing.
- That was right where we wanted it.
- [Derek] Now the real
purpose of this facility
is not to play with toys or
make perfect unnatural waves.
It is to replicate on a small scale
the types of waves Navy
ships will encounter
in the oceans of the world.
Research engineers place
ships modeled after
billion dollar vessels in the water
to see how different
designs actually behave
in real world conditions.
- [Miguel] Right now this
is coming from 45 degrees.
It's gonna be about a five
inch significant wave height,
which if we were to scale
it up for this model
would be 20 foot waves.
When we're doing a free
running model like this,
we usually run a race track,
like a big circle or a figure eight track,
so we know the headings
that we're running in,
so that we can correlate that
to the full scale vessel.
- [Derek] For the model to provide
an accurate representation
of the real world,
a lot of things must
be taken into account.
Is the water fresh?
- Fresh water.
- [Derek] Okay, not salty.
- Nope. Fresh water.
So when you're in salty water,
you're gonna have a lot more buoyancy.
So when we're balasting our models,
we have to make sure that
they take into account
that buoyancy difference.
So when we go full scale
you're in the same conditions.
- [Derek] For fluid mechanics,
I always expect that you have
to keep the Reynolds number
the same as in the real world phenomena.
But actually to get the
right wave dynamics,
you have to use a different scaling
which is based on the Froude number.
So the Froude number is a measure
of the ratio of inertial
to gravitational forces.
It's equal to the flow velocity divided
by the square root of the
acceleration due to gravity
times the characteristic length,
like the length of the ship.
In this case, the model ship's hull
is 46 times smaller than the real thing,
which means to get accurate data,
it should be traveling at one
over the square root of 46
times it's real world speed.
And to make the footage from the model
look the same as that
from the full size ship,
you have to slow it down
by a factor of the square root of 46.
So roughly 6.8 times slower.
I'm amazed at just how
well these shots match,
but of course that's the idea.
Scale the model and the the waves,
so the physics are
identical to a real ship
out on the open ocean.
Naturally, I asked if I could
go swimming in the pool,
but they said, very kindly, "No way."
The closest I could get
would be on a little dingy.
This is our boat.
With a catch.
It's pretty smooth sailing
out here right now.
- (laughs) Yep. No waves
while we're out here.
- [Derek] So I'm assuming
no one's ever been out here
in waves?
- Nope. That's one of the
no-nos they don't want us to do.
I guess it's a risk thing, so...
- This place seems like a... I don't know
Like a massive playground kind of.
(Miguel laughs)
- It kind of is for engineers like us
where we kind of dork out on the science
and what we're doing here.
It's a huge volume.
Like I guess I never understood
how deep 20 feet was,
until they emptied it to
put in the new wave makers.
It's a large volume that's
taken up by this water.
- [Derek] Yeah.
- So as we come by, these
are our sensors right here.
We have a big array here.
These are ultrasonic sensors,
and that's how we measure wave height
and period and direction in the basin.
So we wanna measure that to
make sure that what we test in
is what we think we have.
- [Derek] In this pool, they can create
all sorts of different wave
conditions you might encounter
in different parts of the world.
Most ocean waves are created by wind
and the strongest winds
occur in and around storms.
Five factors affect the size
and shape of waves created.
These are the wind
speed, the wind duration,
the distance over which
the wind is acting,
which is known as the fetch,
the width of the fetch,
and the depth of the water.
As waves travel out from a storm,
the higher frequency waves
dissipate their energy more quickly.
So the waves that travel a long way
are the fast moving low frequency waves,
which are called swell.
- When those waves end up
becoming hundreds of miles away,
like if you have it in the Pacific,
eventually you'll get long
period swell from them.
So you're no longer near the storm,
but it created enough
energy to make long waves,
and that's where you get
your open ocean swell.
- Tell me if this is a good analogy.
I feel like with sound, a
lot of the high frequencies
will die off quickly away from a source.
- Yep.
- [Derek] But the low frequencies
will travel much further.
- Correct.
- So is it the same thing with the waves?
It's like you're walking
away from a concert,
and you can still hear the bass,
but you can't see any
of the high frequencies.
- That's a great analogy. Yep.
- What's the deal with rogue waves?
- People like to think it's a rogue wave
where it just came outta
nowhere and just came up.
No, it's usually multiple
waves that are meeting up
and creating an amplitude
that's much larger
than what the self-standing wave would be.
So when it meets it's gonna break,
because you have this large wave
creating this huge amplitude
that it just can't hold it and it breaks.
- [Derek] On a calm day,
when you see waves crashing
at the beach around 10 seconds apart,
that is swell.
But because of its long wavelength,
swell isn't really a concern for ships
out in the open ocean.
- You know, if you're
in a long period swell,
your ship's probably just
gonna heave a little bit.
You're more worried about the steep waves
and the windy waves
that are really moving you around.
- [Derek] Wind waves are
formed in three steps.
First, as wind blows across the surface
of perfectly still water,
the turbulent motion of
the air creates regions
of slightly higher and
slightly lower pressure.
And this makes tiny ripples
with wavelengths of around a centimeter.
But now the wind can act on these ripples
creating larger pressure differences
between the front and the
top of the wave crest,
pulling them up into bigger waves.
And the interaction of
the wind with these waves
then creates even larger
pressure differences
and even larger waves.
The waves are mostly
uniform at this point,
but as they interact with each other,
they create a range of
different wavelength waves.
And as the wind keeps blowing,
these waves begin breaking
transferring their kinetic energy
into swirling eddies that
dissipate their energy as heat.
Once the energy dissipation matches
the energy input from the wind,
the waves have reached their maximum size
and this is known as
a fully developed sea.
- [Miguel] So this is
gonna be an irregular wave.
- [Derek] This is irregular?
- Irregular wave,
so what you saw earlier
with the regular waves
were one frequency, one amplitude.
This is what we call a spectra,
or multiple frequencies
and multiple amplitudes.
You can see there's higher
frequency with the waves
that kind of go travel slower
than the low frequency waves.
Those low frequency waves will
travel fast and overcome 'em
and that's what's making 'em look peaky
or kind of dulling it out.
- [Derek] What surprised me
is that the different oceans of the world
have different mixtures
of wave frequencies
or different spectra,
depending on their geography
and the types of storms
that occur there.
For example, the North Sea and
other small bodies of water
have a peakier spectrum,
and this is due to
the limited fetch of
storms that occur there.
In the mid-Atlantic, a broader
spectrum best describes
the developing or
decaying open ocean waves
that you'd find there.
And in the North Atlantic,
the steady wind across an open ocean
produces the broadest
spectrum of wind waves.
So when testing, engineers
first have to figure out
where the ship will be deployed,
and which spectra best
match these locations
before creating them in the pool.
For most people I think,
an ocean is an ocean.
But you're saying that there's sort of
different conditions
depending on where you are?
- The destroyer when I was in command,
we did an operation off
the coast of South Korea
in the spring.
Very rough sea keeping conditions.
But then, when you're
crossing the Pacific,
a lot of that is a lot calmer.
So again, you know from there
to the coast of South Korea
to the Arabian Gulf, all those
very different conditions.
- Were there any conditions that were
particularly rough for you?
- So my bed was actually
in the middle of a room
and the seas were so bad,
and this was either
South or East China Sea.
The seas were so bad that one night,
I woke up in the middle of the night
and my whole mattress with me on it
was sliding off of my bed frame,
and that's a pretty
significantly sized mattress.
So you can imagine the
seas we were in that night.
Much bigger than this would terrify me.
I know it probably looks benign, but...
(laughs)
Much bigger than this,
I think that model will
take a lot of water.
- Why do you care about how
much water goes on the deck?
- So on the back of this DDG
is a helicopter landing pad.
They don't want any water on the deck
when a helicopter's about to land.
That's a big problem.
You know, that's one of
the tests that we do here
is we'll put cameras to look at the deck
and understand how much water washes on.
- [Derek] Since I knew
they wouldn't wanna risk
their fancy model in rough conditions,
we brought along a little
remote controlled boat to test.
- Yeah, I wouldn't be happy on that boat.
A lot of people would be getting seasick.
- Whoa!
(Miguel laughs)
- Oh no.
- [Miguel] Is it gone?
- [Derek] It's gone.
- [Miguel] No, it's
right there. It came up.
It's upside down.
(laughs)
- It was totally gone.
It was in the air, then it went under.
Now, not all the models tested here
can be remote controlled.
- So on the carriage is where
we're gonna do captain model tests
where you can tether, put
power and instrumentation
onto a model that can't hold it itself.
So usually the model go in
this moon bay right here.
- [Derek] The models are hooked up here
and then the whole lab
speeds over the waves
towing the model underneath.
(pensive music)
(waves crashing)
People have been making
ships for thousands of years.
- Mm-hm.
- Is there actually any innovation today?
- Most definitely.
So sometimes, you know,
people say that's the
way we've always done it.
And then when you look into it,
there's some validity to some hair-brained ideas,
And when we test them,
that's why you cut your
cost of doing a model test
versus building the full thing and saying,
"Oh that didn't work."
Every ship that's in the Navy's
fleet has gone through here,
has gone through either our purview,
or has been tested peripherally with us.
But all of the Navy-owned ships
have been tested in this facility,
and there is a ship out there
with a tumble home design
where if you look at this ship
behind you, it flares out.
So this flare is usually
what helps protect you from,
when you start rolling, it
gives you a reaction force
or helps push you back.
A tumble home is shaped, you
know, the opposite direction.
And if you have a ship
shaped in that direction,
it doesn't have as much of a
restoring force when you roll.
- But what is the idea with
making a ship like that?
- There's a lot of different reasons
why you want to change a hull design.
Some of it is the above water signatures.
It's all about the
shape and radar sections
and there's a lot that goes into that.
You always wanna be stealthier,
you always want to be faster,
you always wanna have more power.
And that's always what
the innovations come.
- [Derek] So most of
the sailors aren't aware
of the work that's going
on in the background
to support what they do.
- When I was in the fleet,
and I've been in the Navy 27 years,
I never had any idea,
certainly not the
magnitude of what they do.
I'm not exaggerating when I say
it's impacted every ship
and submarine in the fleet.
(waves crashing)
(electronic zoom)
- Hey, if you don't have a
huge wave pool in your house
to test out wave physics,
I suggest you check out Brilliant,
the sponsor of this video.
Brilliant is the best learning tool I know
for mastering concepts in math, science,
and computer science.
All their lessons are
built around interactivity.
Just check out this one on buoyancy.
You can adjust the size
of void in this block
and see whether it sinks or floats,
and then you proceed through a series
of increasingly challenging
questions and simulations.
You know, what I love about Brilliant
is that it really gets me thinking.
So when I complete a lesson,
I feel a sense of accomplishment
because I figured it out myself.
And this applies to their
fundamentals courses
as well as to their more advanced topics.
For example, the wave principles
of superposition and interference
also apply to their course
on quantum mechanics,
which I found to be both engaging
and really comprehensive.
This is a great interactive
which forces you to deeply
engage with the conditions
that lead to interference,
a concept I know a lot of
students struggle with.
Brilliant keeps supporting Veritasium
I think for two reasons.
First, they know that viewers
of this channel are smart
and they want to understand things deeply.
So, a lot of you have already signed up.
And second, I know that some of you
haven't given it a try yet.
So I guess my question is,
what are you waiting for?
You can try it out for free right now
by going to brilliant.org/veritasium.
And finally,
I wanna remind you that with
the holiday season coming up,
you can give the gift of Brilliant
to a friend or family member,
that clever person in your
life who is really into STEM.
There are courses tailored for anyone,
whether beginner,
intermediate, or advanced.
