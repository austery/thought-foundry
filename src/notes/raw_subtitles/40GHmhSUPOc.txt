welcome
 to
 in
 good
 company
 today
 we
 are


diving
 into
 the
 world
 of
 batteries


renewable
 energy
 Innovative
 technology


with
 Peter
 Carlson
 the
 CEO
 of
 nwal
 thank


you
 now
 Peter
 what
 is
 nwal
 nwal
 is
 uh
 um


battery
 company
 that
 focus
 on
 develop
 uh


uh
 the
 most
 sustainable
 products
 uh
 in


the
 industry
 one
 of
 the
 things
 we


recognize
 is
 that
 batteries
 and
 Battery


Supply
 chains
 are
 uh
 in
 incredibly


energy
 intensive
 uh
 and
 and
 as
 such
 uh


they're
 also
 actually
 producing
 a


significant
 carbon
 footprint
 and
 uh
 what


we
 want
 to
 uh
 show
 uh
 is
 is
 that
 there


is
 an
 uh
 there
 is
 another
 way
 by


building
 sustainable
 uh
 Supply
 chains
 by


building
 uh
 Factory
 setups
 uh
 in
 Grid
 uh


solutions
 that
 actually
 provide


renewable
 energy
 and
 doing
 it
 with
 with


the
 latest
 technology
 uh
 incl
 including


building
 circular
 um
 a
 circular
 setup


that
 we
 can
 drive
 this
 battery


revolution
 in
 a
 more
 sustainable
 way
 and


thereby
 we
 we
 get
 a
 a
 significantly


bigger
 impact
 on
 the
 green
 transition


now
 you
 got
 some
 really
 wonderfully


hairy
 goals
 yeah
 I
 love
 it
 where
 are
 you


going
 to
 be
 in
 10
 years
 time
 I
 think
 in


in
 10
 years
 time
 we
 will
 be
 uh
 an


entirely
 you
 know
 fully
 circular
 company


uh
 we
 will
 probably
 at
 least
 have
 uh
 50%


of
 of
 everything
 that
 we
 produce
 we
 will


produce
 with
 recycled
 material
 I
 think


we
 build
 out
 um
 our
 footprint
 uh
 to
 be


kind
 of
 the
 the
 Western
 leader
 uh
 both


in
 Europe
 in
 in
 North
 America
 and
 then


with
 with
 sodium
 ion
 uh
 which
 is
 a
 new


emerging
 technology
 I
 think
 we
 are


rapidly
 evolving
 a
 footprint
 in
 uh
 if
 I


call
 it
 the
 the
 developing
 World
 India


Middle
 East
 uh
 Africa
 when
 you
 started


nwal
 in
 2016
 many
 people
 in
 the
 industry


didn't
 think
 you
 had
 a
 chance
 but
 wow


here
 we
 are
 and
 you
 know
 the
 factory
 you


are
 building
 you
 can
 see
 on
 Google
 Earth


that's
 how
 big
 it
 is
 now
 one
 of
 the


reasons
 why
 they
 you
 were
 skeptical
 was


because
 of
 Chinese
 competition
 so
 what


are
 the
 the
 challenges
 you
 are
 facing


here
 the
 Chinese
 ecosystem
 and
 and
 this


is
 uh
 you
 know
 batteries
 is
 a
 scale


business
 uh
 it
 is
 big
 or
 go
 home


generally
 A
 good
 rule
 in
 life


yeah
 that
 is
 that
 is
 true
 but
 the


Chinese
 has
 a
 you
 know
 they
 have
 a
 5
 to


10
 year
 head
 start
 on
 uh
 scale
 which
 we


need
 to
 catch
 up
 but
 they
 have
 from
 the


vehicles
 to
 the
 battery
 supply
 chain
 uh


to
 the
 battery
 value
 chain
 taken
 a
 very


strategic
 position
 they
 have
 put
 in
 uh
 a


large
 amount
 of
 capitals
 in
 in


everything
 from
 raw
 materials
 mining
 uh


up
 until
 really
 a
 very
 very
 clear


transition
 plan
 towards
 uh


electrification
 and
 then
 you
 know


they're
 you
 know
 formidable
 in
 running


operation
 so
 you
 know
 a
 head-to-head


competition
 with
 the
 Chinese
 is
 going
 to


be
 difficult
 what
 we
 are
 trying
 to
 do
 is


is
 that
 we
 can
 do
 it
 in
 a
 different
 way


we
 can
 uh
 you
 know
 we
 can
 stretch
 the


technology
 uh
 we
 can
 do
 it
 in
 a
 more


circular
 way
 uh
 and
 we
 can
 build
 build


customization
 and
 and
 customer
 intimacy


because
 batteries
 are
 going
 from
 kind
 of


being
 commodity
 you
 know
 five
 six
 years


when
 when
 we
 went
 out
 to
 U
 many
 of
 our


customers
 they
 were
 thinking
 as
 battery


as
 a
 black
 box
 and
 and
 today
 as
 this


Market
 evolves
 we
 we
 see
 that
 uh
 the


battery
 you
 know
 it's
 a
 chemistry
 system


and
 and
 as
 a
 chemistry
 system
 you
 can


basically
 optimize
 that
 towards
 the


features
 that
 your
 products
 want
 to
 be


and
 that
 your
 brand
 have
 as
 as
 an


aspiration
 and
 what
 we
 perhaps
 have
 been


a
 little
 bit
 better
 than
 than
 some
 of


our
 our
 competitors
 is
 to
 work
 together


with
 with
 our
 customers
 engineering


groups
 on
 that
 optimization
 you
 know
 if


you're
 a
 Volvo
 you
 sell
 a
 lot
 of
 uh
 uh


cars
 in
 in
 the
 northern
 hemisphere
 so


cold
 weather
 performance
 is
 a
 key


feature
 for
 for
 a
 battery
 if
 you're
 a


Porsche
 you
 know
 your
 customers
 don't


want
 to
 stand
 waiting
 long
 at
 at
 at
 the


charging
 station
 they
 really
 want
 fast


charging
 so
 that
 kind
 of
 intimacy
 and


optimizing
 the
 systems
 is
 also
 something


that
 that
 we
 uh
 see
 this
 is
 where
 we
 can


really
 differentiate
 so
 what
 do
 you


actually
 need
 to
 be
 successful
 here
 I


mean
 if
 I
 now
 decided
 to
 start
 a
 battery


Factory
 and
 we
 have
 had
 some
 attempts
 or


we
 have
 some
 attempts
 on
 you
 know
 to


start
 startup
 in
 no
 way
 what
 what
 are


the
 key
 things
 there
 is
 it
 is
 it
 money


technology
 people
 just
 how
 how
 would
 you


rank
 them
 starting
 point
 is
 obviously


you
 need
 a
 really
 really
 good
 core


Engineering
 in
 terms
 of
 how
 you
 optimize


that
 that
 chemistry
 system
 is
 is
 that


people
 or
 is
 that
 property
 can
 you
 can


you
 buy
 that
 not
 not
 really
 you
 know
 in


in
 a
 similar
 way
 as
 as
 with
 with
 many


others
 these
 R&D
 architects
 who
 has
 the


full
 visibility
 of
 of
 both
 how
 to


optimize
 a
 chemistry
 system
 but
 can
 also


understand
 how
 it
 affect
 the
 process
 and


and
 the
 manufacturing
 setup
 they
 are


worth
 their
 weight
 in
 in
 Gold
 um
 as
 a


first
 mover
 with
 with
 a
 a
 very
 clear


impact
 Mission
 we
 were
 able
 to
 recruit
 a


handful
 of
 of
 of
 these
 people
 primarily


from
 from
 Asia
 then
 we've
 filled
 up
 with


with
 uh
 people
 from
 all
 over
 uh
 the


world
 but
 that's
 kind
 of
 the
 starting


point
 and
 and
 it
 is
 still
 a
 very


emerging
 uh
 technology
 ology
 so
 I
 would


say
 there's
 probably
 less
 than
 100


people
 in
 the
 world
 it's
 rapidly
 growing


that
 that
 have
 that
 full
 system
 overview


and
 they
 are
 are
 so
 important
 then
 you


know
 again
 coming
 back
 to
 that
 this
 is
 a


scale
 business
 then
 you
 need
 to
 be
 able


to
 attract
 Talent
 at
 scale
 what
 does


that
 mean
 how
 many
 people
 is
 that
 well
 I


mean
 we've
 grown
 from
 from
 25
 to
 6,000


people
 in
 the
 last
 6
 years
 but
 what
 I


would
 say
 is
 is
 you
 know
 per
 Factory
 you


need
 a
 process
 engineering
 team
 that
 is


very
 very
 talented
 and
 and
 I
 think
 you


need
 to
 be
 somewhere
 around
 three
 to
 400


you
 know
 really
 good
 process
 Engineers


per
 Factory
 setup
 so
 that
 Talent
 base


that
 is
 is
 crucial
 uh
 to
 bring
 bring
 on


and
 and
 this
 is
 a
 big
 big
 bottleneck
 uh


for
 for
 the
 industry
 right
 now
 then


obviously
 you
 need
 the
 capital
 base
 so


you
 need
 to
 have
 strong
 investors
 like


yourself
 and
 how
 much
 money
 do
 you
 need


as
 a
 rule
 of
 thumb
 you
 you
 basically


need
 somewhere
 between
 70
 to
 90
 million


US
 dollar
 per
 gigawatt
 hour
 that
 that


you're
 investing
 and
 in
 order
 to
 make


scale
 uh
 and
 and
 to
 become
 uh


significant
 uh
 we
 think
 that
 you
 you


need
 to
 reach
 at
 least
 somewhere
 between


um
 200
 to
 300
 gwatt
 hours
 so
 if
 you
 do


the
 math
 how
 much
 money
 is
 that
 that
 is


somewhere
 around
 20
 to
 to
 30
 billion


give
 or
 take
 20
 to
 25
 billion
 dollars


over
 time
 this
 is
 not
 for
 the
 poor


people
 this
 is
 not
 for
 the
 the
 poor


people
 and
 then
 of
 course
 you
 need
 a


scalable
 footprint
 you
 you
 need
 a
 way
 of


of
 uh
 uh
 setting
 up
 your
 your
 lines
 and


your
 factories
 that
 is
 systematic
 that


can
 be
 scaled
 in
 in
 an
 efficient
 way
 so


people
 capital
 and
 the
 scalable


blueprint
 I
 think
 that
 is
 is
 uh
 you
 know


the
 core
 you
 mentioned
 the
 the
 client


relationships
 um
 you
 have
 a
 a
 great


relationship
 Volvo
 um
 Volkswagen
 Porsche


I
 met
 the
 U
 the
 CEO
 recently
 who's


really
 excited
 about
 this
 uh
 how


important
 are
 these
 relationships
 and


the
 contracts
 you
 have
 they
 are


essential
 on
 so
 if
 you
 if
 you
 didn't


have
 any
 contracts
 you
 you
 couldn't
 go


ahead
 no
 you
 couldn't
 excuse
 me
 but
 are


these
 not
 pretty
 indifferentiation


products
 can't
 I
 just
 produce
 loads
 of


batteries
 and
 sell
 it
 to
 want
 to
 have


them
 there
 is
 a
 commodity
 Market
 H
 you


know
 you
 can
 buy
 280
 amp
 hour
 lfp


batteries
 at
 the
 very
 very
 low
 cost


today
 from
 China
 but
 if
 if
 you
 want
 to


design
 a
 Leading
 Edge
 vehicle
 to
 to
 be


head-to-head
 in
 competition
 with
 with


Tesla
 and
 and
 some
 of
 the
 others
 then


you
 really
 need
 high
 performance
 battery


highly
 defined
 towards
 your
 uh
 brand
 and


and
 and
 your
 uh
 performance


optimizations
 and
 and
 those
 are
 not


Commodities
 I
 mean
 obviously
 we
 are


fighting
 head-to-head
 with
 with
 catl
 and


LG
 and
 Samsung
 in
 in
 those
 those
 rfqs


but
 but
 uh
 uh
 through
 these
 these


relationships
 that
 we
 managed
 to
 build


this
 has
 been
 crucial
 also
 to
 get
 our


investors
 comfortable
 that
 we
 will
 not


go
 the
 way
 solar
 cells
 went
 and
 and


where
 where
 uh
 the
 Western
 kind
 of
 lost


uh
 all
 those
 operations
 to
 to
 uh
 to
 Asia


you
 worked
 at
 Tesla
 for
 some
 time
 what


did
 you
 learn
 and
 what
 are
 what
 are
 you


bringing
 to


norwal
 I
 I
 learned
 a
 lot
 I
 must
 say
 when


I
 came
 to
 to
 Tesla
 I
 felt
 uh
 that
 I
 was


a
 you
 know
 a
 Prett
 pretty
 seasoned


supply
 chain
 and
 operation
 uh
 guy
 you


know
 worked
 with
 mobile
 phones
 for
 for
 a


long
 period
 of
 time
 I
 worked
 with
 with


with
 semiconductors
 but
 coming
 in
 to
 a


startup
 where
 you
 build
 you
 know
 the


rail
 in
 front
 of
 the
 the
 train
 uh
 and


and
 where
 you
 constantly
 need
 to


challenge
 and
 your
 strongest
 assets
 is


your
 speed
 and
 your
 mission
 you
 really


really
 stretch
 your
 comfort
 zone
 and
 and


Elon
 for
 sure
 stretched
 my
 my
 comfort


zone
 with
 what
 did
 you
 learn
 from
 him


what
 I
 learned
 from
 him
 is
 is
 how


powerful
 it
 is
 to
 drive
 a
 company
 with


with
 a
 super
 super
 clear
 Mission
 You


could
 argue
 about
 management
 methods
 but


you
 can't
 argue
 about
 the
 mission
 and


that
 is
 giving
 an
 incredible
 passion


among
 people
 and
 loyalty
 then
 he
 always


challenged
 the
 conventional
 way
 why


should
 ocean
 sea
 sea
 Freight
 be
 slower


why
 can't
 it
 be
 faster
 I
 still
 remember


one
 uh
 it
 was
 one
 time
 we
 were
 looking


at
 the
 cost
 of
 the
 modess
 and
 and
 we


were
 having
 you
 were
 in
 a
 same
 room
 with


him
 yeah
 yeah
 I
 mean
 we
 you
 know
 we
 met


weekly
 and
 in
 the
 beginning
 we
 were


basically
 giving
 away
 a
 check
 with
 with


every
 vehicle
 that
 we
 we
 produced
 and


the
 Elon
 uh
 told
 me
 you
 know
 I
 would


like
 the
 entire
 bill
 of
 material
 to
 be


analyzed
 based
 on
 the
 cost
 of
 athoms
 for


every
 part
 and
 and
 you
 know
 a
 vehicle
 is


like
 just
 a
 bill
 of
 materials
 like
 3,000


500
 port
 numbers
 and
 and
 you
 know
 to


analyze
 the
 cost
 of
 the
 atoms
 I
 mean
 it


blew
 me
 away
 it's
 like
 holy
 how
 do


I
 do
 this
 but
 we
 got
 the
 team
 to
 work


through
 and
 a
 couple
 of
 weeks
 later
 we


we
 came
 back
 and
 and
 it
 was
 actually
 a


whole
 bunch
 of
 of
 different
 learnings


about
 what
 is
 the
 cost
 of
 atoms
 for


steering
 gear
 and
 and
 what
 is
 the
 the


sales
 price
 and
 and
 does
 it
 make
 sense


we
 learned
 a
 lot
 and
 and
 you
 know
 I


would
 not
 be
 here
 today
 I
 would
 not
 have


dared
 to
 start
 norfold
 if
 I
 haven't
 been


on
 on
 on
 that
 Journey
 do
 you
 also
 have
 a


reality
 Distortion


field
 yes
 I
 I
 I
 I
 think
 I'm
 sometimes


I'm
 I'm
 a
 little
 bit
 naive
 in
 in
 what
 I


think
 we
 we
 we
 can
 uh
 we
 can
 do
 so
 give


me
 some
 examples
 of
 where
 you
 are
 kind


of
 asking
 for
 the


impossible
 and
 where
 it
 is
 actually


happening
 sometimes
 too
 whenever
 I
 see
 a


budget
 or
 whenever
 I
 see
 a
 timeline
 I


always
 think
 there
 there
 must
 be
 ways
 to


cut
 this
 30
 40%
 there
 must
 be
 smarter


ways
 uh
 uh
 to
 drive
 uh
 uh
 the
 capital
 uh


structure
 Etc
 so
 I


I
 I
 have
 a
 an
 inherent
 uh
 you
 know
 push


to
 to
 see
 where
 is
 the
 boundary
 where


can
 I
 stretch
 and
 at
 the
 end
 many
 times


we're
 not
 reaching
 that
 that
 stretch
 but


we're
 still
 reaching
 towards
 something


that
 was
 was
 better
 than
 than
 what
 we


started
 with
 and
 and
 that
 is
 is
 of


course
 very
 very
 important
 when
 you
 are


in
 in
 any
 type
 of
 of
 Industry
 to


continuously
 stretch
 you
 know
 can
 you
 do


this
 a
 little
 bit
 faster
 can
 you
 do
 this


a
 little
 bit
 uh
 uh
 more
 effective
 uh
 can


we
 do
 it
 with
 a
 little
 bit
 less
 people


uh
 Etc
 and
 how
 does
 this
 work
 in
 in
 the


Nordic
 region
 and
 in
 Sweden
 I
 mean
 are


we
 are
 we
 fast
 enough
 are
 we
 efficient


enough
 uh
 do
 we
 have
 are
 there
 too
 many


regulations
 and
 rules
 I
 I
 do
 think
 there


is
 too
 many
 uh
 regulations
 and
 and
 and


and
 rules
 in
 an
 early
 stage
 you
 know
 you


you
 you're
 50
 to
 100
 people
 you
 you
 work


around
 the
 clock
 but
 then
 when
 you're


starting
 to
 scale
 up
 and
 when
 you're


starting
 you
 know
 then
 you
 know
 you
 have


to
 it's
 basically
 impossible
 to
 to


operate
 in
 in
 Sweden
 without
 the


collective
 bargaining
 agreement
 Al
 musk


tried
 yeah
 I
 mean
 I
 mean
 it's
 tried
 and


that
 is
 it
 is
 an
 interesting
 dispute


because
 I'm
 I'm
 not
 sure
 who
 is
 going
 to


budge
 first
 uh
 uh
 to
 be
 honest
 and
 and


it's
 not
 easy
 to
 see
 how
 you
 will
 find
 a


a
 win
 win
 in
 in
 in
 that
 situation
 but


but
 you
 have
 a
 situation
 where
 if
 you're


building
 a
 company
 and
 if
 you're


starting
 up
 you
 know
 new
 Factor


especially
 if
 new
 factories
 that
 haven't


been
 built
 before
 that's
 not
 done
 in
 in


a
 9
 to5
 environment
 you
 know
 you
 need


extra
 flexibility
 from
 people
 and
 and


normally
 people
 are
 willing
 to
 uh
 to


give
 that
 you
 know
 it
 doesn't
 need
 to
 be


demanded
 normally
 you
 can
 get
 it
 on
 a


voluntary
 basis
 and
 then
 when
 you're


trying
 to
 to
 convert
 this
 into
 you
 know


how
 does
 this
 adhere
 with
 with
 the


collective
 bargaining
 agreement
 you
 know


this
 you
 you
 you
 you
 stumble
 into
 a


whole
 bunch
 of
 of
 bottlenecks
 with
 with


the
 central
 organization
 because
 they


are
 basically
 saying
 you
 know
 it's
 not


that
 they
 don't
 understand
 what
 you
 need


but
 they
 are
 of
 course
 worried
 if
 we


give
 this
 flexibility
 to
 you
 immediately


a
 Volvo
 or
 an
 ABB
 will
 start
 and
 come


for
 for
 for
 the
 same
 and
 and
 we
 get


stuck
 to
 some
 extent
 in
 in
 in
 our
 uh


regulation
 I
 think
 actually
 it
 is
 time


to
 a
 little
 bit
 review
 some
 of
 these


these
 structures
 we
 we
 have
 because


nothing
 comes
 for
 free
 succeeding
 also


requires
 hard
 work
 and
 as
 long
 as
 it
 is


a
 mutual
 understanding
 why
 not
 but
 you


know
 why
 not
 allow
 people
 to
 to
 to
 work


specifically
 during
 a
 uh
 uh


a
 certain
 period
 of
 of
 of
 time
 when
 when


you
 need
 that
 so
 which
 part
 of
 the


structure
 kind
 of
 the
 scandavian
 model


is
 it
 that
 you
 think
 we
 need
 to
 review
 I


think
 we
 we
 need
 to
 to
 allow
 more


flexible
 working
 hours
 in
 Norway
 in


Sweden
 a
 lot
 of
 our
 industrial


infrastructure
 was
 built
 long
 ago
 and


and
 and
 it
 wasn't
 built
 you
 know
 by
 by
 9


to5
 and
 if
 you
 look
 at
 at
 our


competition
 that
 that
 that
 is
 being


built
 in
 in
 in
 China
 you
 know
 to
 take
 an


example
 I
 was
 visiting
 one
 of
 our


competitors
 uh
 and
 and
 we
 were
 walking


through
 their
 Factory
 and
 and
 I
 was
 kind


of
 you
 know
 is
 it
 free
 shift
 structure


or
 is
 it
 the
 four
 shift
 structure
 and


there
 was
 a
 this
 is
 a
 two-
 shift


structure
 structure
 so
 we
 have
 two
 teams


uh
 12
 hours
 a
 day
 six
 days
 a
 week
 and


then
 you
 know
 flexible
 over
 times
 on
 on


on
 Sunday
 we
 are
 competing
 with
 with
 a


five
 shift
 structure
 in
 order
 to
 to
 uh


to
 fill
 uh
 the
 factory
 I'm
 not
 saying


that
 that
 we
 should
 go
 to
 towards
 the


Chinese
 model
 but
 what
 I
 do
 say
 is
 is


that
 if
 if
 people
 wants
 to
 make
 a
 bigger


impact
 if
 they
 want
 to
 to
 to
 work
 uh
 a


bit
 more
 also
 making
 more
 more
 money
 uh


we
 should
 have
 a
 bit
 more
 flexibility


for
 that
 is
 that
 why
 you
 are
 starting


factories
 outside
 Sweden
 no
 it
 is
 not


the
 reason
 why
 we're
 doing
 that
 is
 both


proximity
 to
 customers
 but
 it's
 but
 it's


also
 you
 know
 access
 to
 Talent
 base
 we


have
 recognized
 that
 know
 at
 least
 short


term
 with
 what
 we're
 doing
 in
 vest
 Ros


what
 we're
 doing
 in
 Ino
 and
 what
 we're


doing
 in
 gothenberg
 we
 are
 draining
 a


lot
 of
 uh
 the
 capabilities
 uh
 of
 and
 the


talent
 base
 that
 is
 in
 the
 in
 the


surrounding
 so
 so
 it
 is
 driven
 by
 other


uh
 other
 reasons
 moving
 on
 to
 the
 whole


battery
 Market
 um
 you
 say
 that
 batter
 is


the
 key
 technology
 to
 replace
 the
 use
 of


coal
 and
 gas
 why
 could
 you
 elaborate
 a


bit
 on
 that
 for
 example
 if
 if
 Europe


should
 should
 meet
 our
 our
 our
 Paris


treaty
 obl
 obligations
 which
 is


basically
 80%
 CO2
 reduction
 over
 over


three
 decades
 we
 basically
 both
 need
 to


to
 get
 uh
 oil
 out
 of
 our
 transport
 a


little
 bit
 more
 difficult
 with
 airplanes


but
 but
 with
 most
 of
 our
 transports
 is


absolutely
 doable
 but
 then
 it
 needs
 to


be
 replaced
 by
 by


electrification
 maybe
 some
 hydrogen
 but


but
 primarily
 uh
 which
 is
 you
 know
 also


driving
 an
 electrical
 uh
 powertrain
 but


but
 primarily
 uh
 it's
 going
 to
 be


batteries
 uh
 and
 in
 the
 same
 way
 if
 we


want
 to
 transform
 our
 our
 we
 also
 need


to
 transform
 our
 energy
 generation
 from


natural
 gas
 and
 coal
 and
 oil
 and
 and
 and


we
 need
 to
 build
 a
 new
 uh
 infrastructure


with
 renewable
 you
 know
 Norway
 and


Sweden
 have
 the
 hydrop
 power
 that
 is
 is


crucial
 in
 in
 this
 but
 then
 it
 is
 wind


and
 solar
 and
 there's
 probably
 a
 certain


part
 also
 of
 of
 of
 of
 nuclear
 but
 all
 of


these
 will
 create
 more
 and
 more


instability
 in
 the
 in
 in
 the
 grid
 which


means
 that
 that
 your
 ability
 to
 store


energy
 to
 to
 balance
 this
 in
 the
 grid
 is


also
 becoming
 crucial
 and
 you
 also
 have


the
 situation
 where
 we're
 sitting
 here


in
 Stockholm
 today
 Stockholm
 has


basically
 an
 infrastructure
 I
 think
 it


is
 around
 three
 and
 a
 half
 uh,
 megawatts


that's
 the
 copper
 cables
 that
 comes
 into


to
 to
 the
 city
 this
 is
 maxed
 out
 between


9
 and
 2:00
 in
 the
 day
 and
 and
 with
 all


people
 that
 is
 now
 transforming
 into


electric
 vehicles
 coming
 in
 from
 the


suburbs
 uh
 you
 know
 want
 to
 charge
 the


the
 vehicle
 during
 the
 day
 and
 and
 and


and
 get
 back
 we
 probably
 need
 to
 to
 uh


uh
 to
 create
 an


additional
 maybe
 50%
 increase
 during


peak
 hour
 and
 we
 can
 either
 do
 it
 by
 by


digging
 up
 the
 entire
 city
 and
 and
 you


know
 pump
 in
 uh
 copper
 or
 we
 can
 build


energy
 storage
 in
 in
 in
 the
 CI
 so
 that


we
 can
 fill
 that
 up
 during
 the
 the
 night


and
 we
 can
 utilize
 it
 during
 uh
 during


the
 peak
 hour
 and
 I
 think
 the
 the
 the


later
 one
 is
 is
 going
 to
 be
 a
 much
 more


efficient
 model
 for
 how
 we
 develop
 that


so
 the
 the
 ability
 to
 store
 energy
 is
 is


absolutely
 crucial
 in
 the
 in
 the


transition
 now
 um
 historically
 we've


been
 dependent
 on
 lithium
 where
 which


you
 find
 in
 places
 like
 Argentina
 Chile


and
 and
 China
 but
 not
 in
 Europe
 so
 what


are
 the
 challenges
 here
 it's
 not
 the


challenge
 about
 uh
 access
 in
 the
 sense


that
 that
 lithium
 is
 very
 available
 on


Earth
 the
 easier
 access
 is
 either
 by


rock
 where
 Canada
 Australia
 is
 is
 uh
 for


example
 is
 is
 really
 big
 but
 we
 have
 it


in
 Serbia
 we
 have
 it
 in
 Portugal
 and
 in


other
 locations
 then
 you
 have


groundwater
 that
 has
 a
 strong
 lithium
 uh


uh
 content
 and
 and
 there
 for
 example


South
 South
 America
 where
 you
 pump
 up


and
 and
 you
 you're
 basically
 evaporate


in
 big
 uh
 big
 brins
 this
 uh
 industry
 is


is
 evolving
 uh
 very
 fast
 I
 have
 a
 little


bit
 of
 of
 a
 concern
 over
 you
 know


creating
 these
 these
 big
 dams
 uh
 in
 in


in
 the
 desert
 over
 time
 I
 think
 this


will
 have
 a
 a
 pretty
 big
 environmental


impact
 but
 there
 is
 also
 new
 technology


em
 emerging
 around
 uh
 so
 so-called
 drri


uh
 so
 where
 you
 you
 do
 direct
 reduction


without
 these
 spres
 so
 I
 think


technology
 will
 will
 solve
 it
 part
 of


the
 challenge
 today
 is
 that
 almost
 all


of
 of
 these
 this
 lithium
 if
 I
 call
 it
 a


early
 concentration
 form
 then
 goes
 to
 to


China
 to
 be
 processed
 into
 either


lithium
 carbonate
 or
 lithium
 hydroxide


so
 so
 you
 know
 the
 whole
 uh
 value
 or
 the


processing
 part
 uh
 I
 think
 is
 somewhere


between
 80
 to
 85%
 of
 the
 the
 world's


production
 is
 in
 in
 uh
 in
 in
 China
 so


that's
 that's
 an
 advantage
 that
 China


these
 producers
 have
 it
 is
 an
 advantage


and
 and
 this
 is
 where
 we
 we
 need
 to


build
 value
 chains
 um
 you
 know
 we


started
 a
 joint
 venture
 in
 Portugal


together
 with
 galp
 to
 build
 one
 of


Europe's
 first
 lithium
 processing
 and


and
 this
 is
 a
 necessity
 to
 build
 these


these
 supply
 chain
 because
 eventually


batteries
 will
 be
 a
 a
 regional
 business


batteries
 are
 so
 heavy
 they
 are
 a
 bit


dangerous
 to
 transport
 and
 the
 customers


would
 like
 to
 have
 just
 in
 time
 uh


setups
 so
 so
 there
 will
 be
 a


regionalization
 of
 the
 market
 and
 and
 as


part
 of
 that
 regionalization
 it's
 super


crucial
 to
 build
 also
 these
 Regional


Supply
 chains
 do
 every
 country
 have
 to


have
 a
 battery
 production
 not
 every


country
 needs
 to
 to
 have
 a
 does
 no
 way


need
 to
 have
 it
 it's
 a
 good
 question
 I


think
 Norway
 probably
 have
 the


opportunity
 of
 having
 a
 good
 battery


production
 given
 its
 grid
 setup
 but
 uh


then
 there
 is
 a
 whole
 bunch
 of
 of
 other


things
 that
 needs
 to
 come
 together
 for


for
 that
 to
 happen
 but
 in
 reality
 over


the
 next
 I
 would
 say
 next
 couple
 of


years
 most
 of
 the
 decisions
 uh
 that
 will


drive
 the
 transformation
 of
 the
 entire


Auto
 industry
 will
 be
 be
 taken
 where
 is


my
 key
 strategies
 for
 for
 for
 battery


supplies
 then
 it
 will
 take
 10
 years
 to


execute
 them
 but
 it
 is
 very
 important


that
 Europe
 as
 total
 is
 on
 our
 toes


because
 if
 we
 don't
 have
 this


infrastructure
 in
 the
 next
 decade
 then


the
 train
 have
 gone
 uh
 and
 and
 then
 the


infrastructure
 is
 is
 built
 up
 and
 it's


so
 much
 Capital
 that
 it's
 going
 to
 be


very
 difficult
 to
 to
 uh
 to
 change
 this


so
 then
 we
 would
 be
 in
 a
 situation
 like


we
 have
 been
 in
 solar
 panels
 microchips


and
 so
 on
 right
 exactly
 tell
 me
 about


the
 new
 sodium
 I
 am
 breakthrough
 you've


had
 sodium
 ion
 has
 been
 in
 in
 research


for
 for
 for
 quite
 quite
 some
 some
 time


uh
 as
 it
 is
 probably
 the
 you
 know
 the


second
 best
 to
 lithium
 and
 it's
 even


more
 abundant
 from
 a
 norfold
 perspective


one
 of
 the
 things
 that
 that
 we've
 seen


over
 uh
 over
 the
 last
 couple
 of
 years
 is


is
 you
 know
 in
 the
 drive
 for
 lower
 cost


batteries
 which
 is
 necessary
 for
 even


higher
 Market
 penetration
 and
 with
 very


fluctuating
 uh
 raw
 material
 prices


lithium
 ion
 phosphate
 so
 so
 iron
 based


batteries
 have
 grown
 uh
 a
 lot
 driven
 by


a
 very
 very
 uh
 rapid
 and
 and
 efficient


uh
 execution
 of
 of
 uh
 of
 of
 the
 uh
 the


Chinese
 it
 is
 roughly
 half
 the
 energy


density
 of
 high
 performance
 uh
 nickel


batteries
 but
 for
 energy
 storage
 and
 for


lower
 cost
 Passenger
 cars
 it
 it
 works


and
 obviously
 as
 as
 a
 company
 you're


sitting
 and
 seeing
 that
 and
 you're
 kind


of
 you
 know
 should
 we
 should
 we
 address


that
 uh
 that
 market
 what
 should
 be
 our


strategy
 we've
 been
 struggling
 with
 with


how
 to
 approach
 this
 I
 must
 admit
 both


that
 we
 would
 be
 almost
 100%
 dependent


on
 Chinese
 active
 material
 and
 the
 fact


that
 this
 active
 material
 would
 come


with
 a
 very
 large
 uh
 carbon
 footprint
 so


it
 would
 be
 very
 difficult
 to
 how
 do
 we


combine
 our
 mission
 with
 with
 this
 type


of
 of
 technology
 and
 lastly
 these
 lfp


batteries
 as
 they're
 less
 valuable
 there


hasn't
 been
 a
 natural
 development
 of
 of


recycling
 methodology
 it's
 coming
 but


it's
 also
 going
 to
 require
 more


regulatory
 demands
 in
 order
 for
 for
 for


that
 to
 to
 to
 make
 make
 it
 happen
 when


can
 you
 have
 a
 big
 production
 of
 this
 we


are
 right
 now
 working
 on
 our


industrialization
 plan
 for
 for
 this
 um


uh
 and
 and
 we
 think
 we
 can
 scale
 this
 up


in
 the
 2026
 20
 uh
 27
 uh
 Ty
 of
 time
 frame


will
 this
 be
 a
 unique
 product
 or
 will


all
 companies
 have
 well
 you
 know
 there


is
 a
 raise
 on
 on
 sodium
 what
 is
 a
 bit


unique
 uh
 is
 is
 that
 I
 think
 we
 were
 a


bit
 ahead
 of
 the
 competition
 in
 being


able
 to
 uh
 uh
 to
 develop
 um
 based
 on
 on


this
 pran
 blue
 cathode
 to
 produce
 an
 lfp


type
 performance
 competition
 is
 is


either
 working
 with
 an
 iron
 based
 uh
 uh


uh
 cathod
 material
 that
 has
 lower
 uh


lower
 energy
 density
 or
 they
 working


with
 with
 a
 nickel-based
 cathode
 so
 then


H
 but
 what
 we've
 what
 we've
 shown
 is
 is


that
 we
 can
 do
 a
 product
 without
 without


both
 and
 and
 this
 I
 think
 is
 is
 a
 big


Edge
 what
 what
 is
 also
 very
 interesting


with
 sodium
 ion
 batteries
 is
 that


lithium
 is
 very
 reactive
 but
 but
 sodium


you
 can
 basically
 uh
 heat
 up
 a
 sodium


ion
 battery
 towards
 300°
 without
 getting


a
 thermal
 Runway
 so
 they
 are
 inherently


safer
 which
 I
 think
 also
 becomes
 very


important
 you
 know
 in
 both
 harsh


conditions
 if
 you're
 putting
 battery


storage
 in
 the
 desert
 next
 to
 a
 solar


farm
 or
 or
 if
 you're
 moving
 energy


storage
 into
 cities
 and
 where
 where
 you


know
 the
 fire
 hazard
 is
 is
 of
 course


very
 very
 uh
 important
 one
 more
 thing


you
 you
 touched
 on
 the
 importance
 of


having
 this
 recyclable
 infrastructure
 as


well
 parallel
 to
 your
 battery
 production


how
 does
 this
 work
 basically
 the
 way
 it


works
 is
 you're
 taking
 end
 of
 life
 packs


and
 you're
 this
 manle
 them
 uh
 you
 remove


copper
 and
 the
 you
 know
 the
 aluminum
 in


in
 the
 pack
 and
 you
 discharge
 it
 and
 it


seems
 simple
 but
 to
 take
 a
 battery
 pack


to
 absolutely
 down
 to
 to
 zero
 is
 is
 not


you
 know
 in
 industrial
 it's
 not
 that


that
 novel
 then
 uh
 you
 basically
 crush


and
 sort
 it
 where
 you
 need
 to
 take
 out


the
 electrolyte
 that
 is
 very
 important


and
 the
 end
 product
 of
 that
 is
 is
 black


mass
 and
 out
 of
 that
 black
 mass
 you
 you


can
 then
 either
 uh
 use
 pyro
 technology


so
 you
 you
 use
 furnaces
 to
 to
 remove
 it


but
 then
 you
 lose
 lithium
 or
 uh
 you
 can


take
 the
 way
 that
 we've
 done
 where


you're
 using
 a
 hydrometallurgical


separation
 and
 then
 uh
 you
 can
 basically


get
 over
 90
 towards
 95%
 recyclability
 of


nickel
 of
 cobalt
 but
 also
 of
 of
 U


lithium
 do
 anybody
 else
 do
 this
 there
 is


other
 uh
 companies
 who
 are
 uh
 evolving


but
 we
 have
 been
 able
 to
 build
 a
 pretty


strong
 IP
 base
 around
 this
 and
 and
 up
 in


hfo
 we're
 right
 now
 commissioning


Europe's
 largest
 recycling
 facility
 it's


a
 4
 gwatt
 Hour
 setup
 and
 and
 there's
 a


brilliant
 B
 bunch
 of
 of
 people
 who
 is


now
 getting
 all
 these
 these
 processes
 uh


uh
 to
 work
 moving
 on
 to
 corpor
 culture


um
 pretty
 unique
 situation
 to
 build


something
 from
 zero
 to
 6,000
 people
 in


eight
 years
 how
 do
 you
 think
 about
 what


type
 of
 culture
 you
 want
 to
 have
 in
 the


company
 I'm
 a
 person
 that
 is
 um
 driven


very
 much
 by
 by
 Passion
 and
 energy
 and


and
 obviously
 it


is
 a
 a
 company
 culture
 that
 reflects


that
 is
 is
 very
 very
 important
 to
 me
 I


you
 know
 uh
 when
 I
 step
 into
 room
 I'm


very
 sensitive
 to
 the
 the
 energy
 level


in
 in
 the
 room
 that
 is
 that
 is
 very


important
 thermometer
 for
 me
 whether
 you


know
 whether
 there
 is
 true
 activity


going
 on
 I'm
 sorry
 and
 just
 just
 on
 and


how
 do
 you
 measure
 that
 so
 now
 you
 come


into
 a
 room
 what
 do
 you
 what
 do
 you


gauge
 what
 do
 you
 what
 do
 you
 look
 for


what
 you're
 looking
 for
 is
 can
 you
 feel


the
 energy
 can
 you
 see
 people
 you
 know


standing
 over
 uh
 together
 you
 know


looking
 at
 at
 at
 something
 whether
 it's


in
 a
 display
 whether
 it's
 a
 you
 know


it's
 a
 prototype
 or
 or
 collectively
 you


you
 can
 you
 can
 feel
 whether
 is
 an


energy
 whether
 it's
 it's
 like
 a
 newsroom


before
 the
 the
 the
 the
 nights
 uh
 you


know
 7:30
 uh
 play
 or
 whether
 it's
 it's
 a


Trader
 room
 in
 in
 in
 a
 stock
 market
 you


know
 that
 type
 of
 of
 of
 energy
 so
 that


that
 is
 important
 to
 me
 the
 other


important
 uh
 thing
 and
 we
 worked
 a
 lot


from
 day
 one
 and
 we
 kept
 the
 same
 uh
 the


same
 kind
 of
 core
 Words
 which
 is
 being


bold
 being
 passionate
 and
 and
 and
 being


excellent
 as
 uh
 the
 key
 pillars
 of
 of
 of


what
 we
 doing
 but
 one
 important
 thing


when
 you're
 building
 something
 like
 this


and
 that
 that
 we're
 driving
 that
 is
 you


cannot
 run
 at
 maximum
 speeds
 all
 the


time
 it
 doesn't
 work
 like
 like
 that
 but


but
 when
 you're
 hitting
 a
 bottleneck


that's
 when
 the
 light
 needs
 to
 be
 on


that's
 when
 you
 need
 uh
 you
 know
 part
 of


an
 organization
 to
 Sprint
 and
 that


principle
 is
 very
 very
 important
 to
 me


that
 that
 whenever
 we
 we
 stumble
 because


it
 is
 still
 so
 speed
 and
 and
 the
 pace


forward
 as
 as
 a
 as
 a
 company
 is
 one
 of


our
 biggest
 assets
 who
 do
 you
 hire
 we


have
 125
 nationalities
 in
 in
 the
 company


so
 so
 we're
 very
 very
 diverse
 we
 want
 to


hire
 uh
 people
 who
 have
 done
 difficult


things
 who
 have
 multiple
 experiences


that
 are
 not
 afraid
 to
 to
 roll
 up
 the


sleeves
 and
 and
 shovel
 dirt
 we
 want
 to


to
 hire
 people
 specifically
 that
 is


logic


but
 also
 Dynamic
 you
 say
 um
 speed
 is
 an


asset
 now
 in
 our
 strategy
 document
 for


the
 fund
 we
 have
 speed
 is
 a
 mindset
 how


do
 you
 make
 sure
 that
 you
 keep
 the
 speed


up
 do
 you
 walk
 around
 on
 the
 floor
 here


and
 whip
 people
 Direction
 no
 I
 I
 think


um
 I
 think
 it's
 it's
 incredibly


important
 to
 constantly
 drive
 that
 that


culture
 and
 and
 that
 is
 that
 is
 a


challenge
 when
 when
 you're
 growing
 very


very
 fast
 last
 year
 we
 were
 having
 a
 a


kickoff
 uh
 with
 the
 first
 and
 second


later
 the
 50
 people
 and
 and
 we
 realize


that
 we
 have
 one
 group
 who's
 been
 with


the
 company
 for
 three
 four
 five
 years


and
 and
 they
 are
 you
 know
 totally


engraved
 in
 in
 the
 culture
 but
 then


we're
 starting
 new
 sites
 and
 we're


bringing
 in
 more
 people
 it
 requires
 a


bit
 of
 effort
 um
 uh
 to
 bring
 everybody


else
 into
 what
 is
 it
 being
 a
 North


Walter
 and
 and
 this
 is
 crucial
 what
 is


it
 to
 be
 a
 North
 Walter
 well
 I
 come
 back


to
 it
 is
 about
 being
 passionate
 it's


about
 being
 bold
 and
 being
 excellent
 in


what
 we're
 doing
 with
 with
 a
 strong


focus
 on
 on
 what
 our
 customer
 uh
 need


but
 it
 is
 a
 challenge
 when
 you're
 being


proud
 of
 being
 this
 diverse
 but
 you
 also


have
 to
 remember
 that
 that
 if
 you
 come


from
 from
 125
 different
 nationalities


your
 perspectives
 if
 you
 come
 from
 Asia


on
 on
 how
 an
 organization
 Works
 versus


the
 the
 Nordic
 model
 of
 being
 very
 flat


and
 goal
 oriented
 this
 is
 a
 big
 mental


transition
 and
 this
 won't
 happen
 over


days
 so
 we
 work
 a
 lot
 with
 with
 both


getting
 people
 together
 in
 big
 team


buildings
 to
 so
 I
 I
 for
 instance
 hear


that
 you
 have
 a
 weakness
 for
 CER


challenges
 you
 got
 your
 whole
 Management


Group
 to
 uh
 to
 do
 vasal
 lopit
 now
 for


those
 of
 you
 who
 are
 not
 into


CrossCountry
 skiing
 vasal
 lopa
 is
 a
 bit


of
 a
 it's
 a
 pretty
 damn
 long
 uh
 cross


country
 trip
 90k
 right
 uh
 even
 the


people
 who
 hadn't
 done
 it
 before
 cross


country
 they
 had
 to
 do
 it
 so
 how
 did


that
 go
 we
 haven't
 done
 it
 yet
 uh
 we're


on
 the
 path
 uh
 and
 the
 velop
 is
 not
 the


the
 the
 the
 important
 thing
 but


basically
 what
 we
 said
 is
 with
 this


Focus
 that
 we
 have
 on
 on
 the
 ramp
 up
 in


the
 factories
 we
 will
 have
 our


management
 teams
 up
 Ino
 on
 a
 weekly


basis
 this
 is
 where
 the
 focus
 needs
 to


be
 and
 as
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 feature
 to


being
 in
 kfo
 is
 is
 the
 availability
 of


snow
 so
 Monday
 evenings
 after
 we
 have


had
 our
 management
 meetings
 we
 we're


doing
 a
 joint
 training
 on
 on


CrossCountry
 skiing
 and
 we
 have
 this


this
 excellent
 coach
 his
 name
 is
 Claus


neelson
 he've
 won
 the
 nden
 H
 lopet
 which


is
 the
 world's
 longest
 cross
 country


it's
 220
 kilometers
 uh
 so
 he
 has
 been


helping
 us
 and
 as
 as
 bringing
 the
 team


together
 with
 one
 goal
 it's
 been
 uh
 it's


been
 very
 very
 fun
 but
 we've
 started
 on


very
 very
 different
 levels
 and
 perhaps


um
 kind
 of
 suitable
 to
 go
 for
 something


which
 is
 pretty
 Mar
 like
 because
 this
 is


going
 to
 be
 a
 marathon
 to
 build
 not


world
 it
 is
 a
 marathon
 for
 sure
 what
 are


your
 leadership
 principles
 what
 is
 the


most
 important
 thing
 for
 you
 I
 think
 it


it
 is
 uh
 very
 very
 important
 in
 in
 order


to
 to
 understand
 the
 problem
 to
 go
 to


the
 depth
 whenever
 you
 have
 a
 problem


don't
 just
 leave
 it
 at
 at
 face
 value
 the


Japanese
 have
 this
 this
 saying
 Gamba


gutsu
 go
 to
 the
 source
 and
 and
 and
 and


see
 it
 and
 and
 I
 very
 much
 like
 that


philosophy
 we're
 trying
 to
 find
 a
 model


and
 I'm
 trying
 to
 apply
 a
 model
 where


people
 are
 given
 a
 lot
 of
 responsibility


and
 and
 I
 will
 leave
 them
 alone
 until


they
 prove
 that
 they
 can't
 uh
 manage


that
 that
 responsibility
 but
 I'm
 a


strong
 believer
 in
 people
 I
 don't
 set


the
 agendas
 for
 for
 for
 people
 and
 I'm


very
 focused
 on
 on
 two
 things


how
 they
 together
 with
 the
 team
 achieve


their
 their
 objectives
 and
 secondly
 how


they
 are
 building
 the
 teams
 around
 them


you
 know
 how
 they're
 being
 Talent


attractors
 when
 I'm
 having
 performance


reviews
 these
 are
 the
 two
 parameters


that
 is
 very
 very
 important
 for
 me
 when


you
 make
 decisions
 how
 uh
 dependent
 are


you
 on
 analysis
 and
 how
 much
 is
 pattern


recognition
 are
 things
 you've
 seen


before
 I
 think
 data
 is
 important
 because


number
 of
 the
 things
 that
 we're
 doing
 is


to
 some
 extent
 we're
 doing
 it
 for
 the


first
 time
 but
 I'm
 also
 cognizant
 about


you
 can
 go
 and
 collect
 data
 forever
 it


is
 about
 having
 the
 sufficient
 amount
 of


data
 so
 so
 that
 you're
 not
 going
 totally


off
 the
 track
 but
 if
 you
 have
 80%
 of


what
 you
 need
 then
 I'm
 normally
 ready
 to


take
 uh
 the
 decision
 and
 and
 and
 go
 on


Now
 One
 former
 colleague
 of
 yours


described
 you
 as
 optimistic
 bold
 forward


leaning
 and
 aggressive
 so
 where
 does


this
 come
 from
 what
 what
 is
 what
 is
 your


driving
 force
 as
 with
 many
 of
 us
 there


is
 a
 there
 is
 a
 little
 young
 achiever


inside
 that
 want
 to
 do
 good
 that
 that


want
 to
 learn
 and
 want
 to
 to
 uh
 want
 to


succeed
 and
 then
 you
 know
 obviously


wants
 to
 get
 a
 certain
 recognition
 for


it
 I'm
 not
 driven
 by
 financials
 but
 I
 do


like
 to
 get
 recognition
 it
 was


interesting
 I
 gave
 a
 speech
 at
 the
 stomm


school
 of
 Economics
 yesterday
 and
 uh
 and


I
 asked
 people
 to
 put
 up
 their
 hand
 if


they
 if
 they
 really
 you
 know
 wanted
 to


show
 the
 world
 and
 surprisingly
 few


people
 did
 and
 I
 suspect
 it's
 just


because
 they
 didn't
 admit
 it
 want
 to


admit
 it
 m


who
 do
 you
 want
 to
 prove
 wrong
 who
 do


you
 want
 to
 show
 yes
 in
 in
 in
 the
 sense


I
 want
 to
 prove
 the
 ones
 that
 that
 is
 is


saying
 that
 we
 can't
 solve
 this
 big


problem
 the
 climate
 crisis
 and
 the
 green


transition
 in
 in
 the
 timelines
 that
 that


we
 we
 set
 up
 we
 we
 need
 to
 give


ourselves
 more
 more
 time
 because
 the


solutions
 to
 solve
 these
 problems
 is
 is


there
 it
 is
 about
 you
 know
 executing


them


2017
 uh
 I
 I
 was
 out
 for
 for
 for
 an


accident
 I
 was
 in
 in
 in
 an
 avalanche
 and


and
 when
 they
 found
 me
 I
 I
 didn't
 uh
 I


didn't
 breed
 so
 I
 I
 actually
 don't


recall
 it
 uh
 uh
 until
 I
 was
 on
 a


helicopter
 on
 the
 way
 to
 to
 hospital
 and


I
 was
 in
 pretty
 bad
 shape
 but
 when
 I
 was


recovering
 I
 was
 laying
 there
 and


thinking
 what
 is
 important
 now
 then
 I


got
 kind
 of
 a
 a
 second
 chance
 and
 then


what
 came
 very
 very
 clear
 because
 I
 was


also
 engaged
 in
 a
 whole
 bunch
 of
 of


other
 startups
 this
 is
 my
 mission
 in


life
 this
 is
 combining
 what
 I've
 learned


through
 through
 my
 my
 career
 with
 my


passion
 this
 will
 be
 hopefully
 the


important
 effort
 of
 uh
 of
 my
 life


sometimes
 you
 know
 when
 when
 you
 can


feel
 a
 little
 bit
 almost
 overwhelmed
 you


know
 what
 have
 I
 started
 I
 kind
 of
 go


back
 to
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day
 this
 is


really
 really
 important
 if
 we
 should
 be


able
 to
 contain
 climate
 uh
 and
 global


warming
 to
 at
 least
 below
 uh
 two


degrees
 we
 need
 to
 take
 these
 these


dramatic
 rapid
 actions
 and
 we
 need
 to
 be


bold
 did
 the
 Evar
 change
 your
 life
 in


other
 ways
 it
 it
 did
 I
 think
 it
 made
 me


much
 more
 humble
 to
 how
 fragile
 life
 can


be
 and
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 you're
 not


pushing
 all
 your
 wants
 to
 the
 Future
 and


I
 can
 I
 can
 clearly
 say
 that


that
 I
 would
 die
 tomorrow
 I
 would
 still


you
 know
 be
 very
 happy
 with
 with
 the


life
 uh
 I've
 had
 how
 do
 you
 relax
 you


know
 one
 of
 the
 things
 that
 I
 think
 is


is
 is
 a
 good
 feature
 when
 when
 you're
 an


entrepreneur
 is
 as
 an
 entrepreneur
 you


have
 a
 lot
 of
 shitty
 days
 where
 you're


thinking
 we're
 not
 going
 forward
 we're


going
 backwards
 and
 and
 you
 just
 get
 an


aggregate
 of
 all
 the
 pile
 of
 that


happens
 when
 you're
 building
 and
 and


starting
 and
 new
 things
 but
 I
 have
 this


this
 uh
 ability
 to
 feel
 like
 go
 to


bed
 sleep
 and
 wake
 up
 with
 totally
 new


energy
 it's
 like
 almost
 like
 a
 goldfish


how
 much
 it
 uh
 does
 one
 have
 to
 take
 to


be
 a
 good
 entrepreneur
 the
 harder
 task


you
 take
 on
 the
 more
 pile
 of
 you


will
 experience
 that
 is
 probably
 a
 a
 law


of
 of
 some
 sort
 but
 I'm
 also
 a
 bit
 of
 an


onoff
 person
 so
 we
 have
 a
 board
 meeting


today
 but
 but
 later
 tonight
 I'm
 going
 to


jump
 on
 the
 uh
 the
 train
 and
 and
 I'm


going
 to
 go
 up
 to
 AA
 with
 my
 kids
 and


I'm
 just
 going
 to
 focus
 on
 going
 skiing


and
 and
 spending
 a
 weekend
 with
 them
 and


go
 back
 a
 little
 bit
 refreshed
 here
 on


on
 Monday
 lastly
 Peter
 what
 is
 your


advice
 to
 young
 people
 uh
 I
 think
 it
 is


uh
 super
 important
 to
 to
 follow
 your


passion
 don't
 follow
 what
 other
 people


tell
 you
 to
 do
 if
 you're
 not
 passionate


about
 what
 what
 you're
 doing
 you're
 not


going
 to
 put
 in
 that
 extra
 effort
 that


is
 required
 to
 to
 to
 Really
 achieve
 uh


excellence
 in
 the
 early
 days
 we
 were


sitting
 in
 an
 attic
 in
 Stockholm
 a
 small


team
 and
 we
 had
 a
 room
 where
 we
 put
 up


favorite
 quotes
 there's
 two
 two
 quotes


that
 still
 sticks
 out
 very
 much
 in
 in
 my


mind
 one
 I
 think
 it's
 from
 the
 Google


Founders
 is
 good
 idea
 is
 normally


perceived
 as
 as
 not
 good
 at
 all
 until


it's
 really
 good
 you
 know
 if
 you
 have
 an


alternative
 you
 should
 never
 give
 up
 and


and
 try
 and
 and
 when
 you've
 tried
 and


proved
 that
 it
 works
 you're
 surrounding


will
 will
 will
 recognize
 oh
 you
 know


this
 was
 a
 really
 really
 great
 idea
 but


but
 it
 takes
 a
 lot
 of
 effort
 to
 to
 to


get
 there
 the
 second
 one
 was
 for
 from


from
 Mike
 Tyson
 everybody
 got
 the


strategy
 uh
 up
 until
 they
 went
 in
 and


get
 the
 first
 punch
 in
 the
 face
 and


that's
 really
 something
 you
 know
 what
 do


you
 do
 then
 to
 continue
 going
 on
 when


when
 you're
 constantly
 B
 in
 challenge


that
 that
 is
 a
 very
 very
 important
 thing


well
 Peter
 it
 for
 sure
 seems
 like
 you


are
 following
 your
 passions
 and
 and
 I


have
 to
 say
 I'm
 also
 thinking
 perhaps
 a


few
 more
 of
 us
 need
 a
 tiny
 bit
 of


avalanche
 to
 shake
 out
 the
 really


important
 things
 in
 life
 so
 we
 can
 focus


where
 it
 really
 matters
 but
 uh
 big


thanks
 for
 taking
 the
 time
 and
 all
 the


best
 of
 luck
 thank


you
