 The
 Bloomberg
 Business


Week
 Daily
 podcast
 with
 Carol
 Masser
 and


Tim
 Stenbec
 on
 Bloomberg
 Radio.
 All


right,
 we
 want
 to
 stay
 on
 this
 story.


Joining
 us
 right
 now
 is
 Mona
 Yakubian


and
 she
 is
 director
 and
 senior
 adviser


Middle
 East
 program
 at
 the
 Center
 for


Strategic
 and
 International
 Studies.
 She


joins
 us
 from
 Washington
 DC.
 Mona,


should
 President
 Trump
 be
 taking
 a


victory
 lap
 here?


I
 think
 the
 president
 does
 deserve
 to


take
 a
 victory
 lap
 considering
 what
 has


been
 accomplished
 today.
 uh
 the
 release


of
 the
 last
 20
 remaining
 hostages
 uh
 who


were
 alive
 uh
 are
 alive
 in
 Gaza.
 Uh
 the


the
 sessation
 of
 hostilities
 for
 now
 uh


the
 flowing
 in
 of
 much
 needed
 assistance


into
 Gaza.
 These
 are
 important
 uh


milestones.
 However,
 I
 think
 the


president
 is
 perhaps
 premature
 in
 saying


the
 war
 is
 over.
 the
 difficult
 steps


ahead
 are
 the
 ones
 that
 we
 will
 have
 to


watch
 closely
 to
 see
 if
 in
 fact
 his


aspirations
 become
 reality.


And
 Mona,
 how
 does
 that
 play
 out?
 If
 you


were
 going
 to
 say
 that
 this
 is


presumably
 some
 form
 of
 a
 stop
 gap
 and


not
 necessarily
 a
 conclusion
 and
 marking


a
 next
 chapter,
 what
 plays
 out?
 How
 does


this
 play
 out?
 And
 kind
 of
 what's
 your


view
 on
 that?


Well,
 what
 will
 distinguish
 what


happened
 today
 from
 ceasefires
 in
 the


past
 is
 if
 the
 various
 points
 that
 are


laid
 down
 in
 President
 Trump's
 20point


plan
 are
 in
 fact
 implemented.
 Critical


among
 them
 is
 the
 disarming
 of
 Hamas.
 Uh


hard
 to
 know
 how
 exactly
 that's
 going
 to


happen.
 The
 the
 uh
 the
 agreement
 itself


is
 very
 short
 on
 details.
 There's
 also


the
 envisioning
 of
 an
 international


stabilization
 force
 that
 would
 surge


into
 Gaza
 and
 be
 responsible
 for


security.
 Not
 at
 all
 clear
 how
 that's


going
 to
 happen.
 And
 of
 course,


questions
 around
 governance
 and
 the


constituting
 of
 a
 committee
 of


Palestinian
 technocrats
 to
 be
 overseen


by
 former
 British
 Prime
 Minister
 Tony


Blair.
 I
 mean,
 there
 is
 there
 are
 so


many
 details
 that
 have
 yet
 to
 be
 ironed


out,
 let
 alone
 implemented.
 And
 I
 think


these
 are
 the
 key
 potential
 sticking


points
 uh
 in
 the
 coming
 days
 and
 weeks


and
 and
 likely
 months.


Mona,
 and
 I
 think
 it's
 fair
 to
 say,


right,
 a
 conflict
 like
 this
 that
 has


gone
 on
 not
 just
 in
 the
 last
 2
 years
 uh


of
 a
 war,
 but
 it's
 been
 going
 on
 for
 a


long
 time
 between
 uh
 Israel
 and
 and
 and


Gaza
 and
 Hamas.
 What
 is
 Hamas
 though
 in


a
 world
 where
 there
 is
 no
 conflict


between
 Hamas
 and
 Israel?
 I
 mean,
 they


have
 been
 designated
 terrorist
 groups.


So,
 I'm
 just
 curious,
 what
 is
 Hamas


potentially
 going
 forward
 in
 if
 there's


real
 peace
 in
 this
 region?


Well,
 I
 think
 you
 point
 to
 a
 really


important
 issue
 here.
 I
 mean,
 Hamas's


rea
 is
 resistance.
 Resistance
 against


Israel
 and
 against
 Israeli
 occupation.


Now
 presumably
 if
 all
 of
 the
 various


elements
 that
 would
 bring
 actual
 peace


between
 Israelis
 and
 Palestinians
 come


into
 fruition
 then
 that
 would
 indeed


sort
 of
 I
 think
 dramatically
 undermine


the
 rationale
 for
 Hamas
 to
 continue
 to


exist.
 But
 I
 do
 think
 it's
 really


important
 Carol
 to
 note
 this
 agreement


talks
 about
 and
 calls
 for
 the
 disarming


of
 Hamas.
 does
 not
 call
 for
 the


destruction
 of
 Hamas
 uh
 as
 Prime


Minister
 Netanyahu
 has
 called
 for
 and


made
 a
 centerpiece
 of
 his
 policies
 on


Gaza.


So,
 okay.
 So,
 that's
 an
 important


distinction.
 Correct.


Very
 much
 so.
 I
 mean,
 we're
 already


seeing
 reporting
 that
 as
 uh
 Israeli


troops
 withdraw
 from
 limited
 areas
 of


Gaza,
 there
 is
 reporting
 that
 Hamas
 is


filling
 in
 and
 is
 taking
 over.
 And
 so


again,
 the
 this
 just
 gives
 you
 a
 sense


of
 how
 daunting
 this
 challenge
 is
 going


to
 be
 going
 forward.


And
 Mona,
 you
 have
 about
 you
 have
 more


than
 30
 years
 of
 experience
 in
 the


Middle
 East
 and
 North
 Africa.
 With
 that


in
 mind,
 what
 do
 the
 next
 weeks
 and


months,
 years
 look
 like?


Well,
 I
 think
 immediately
 what's
 going


to
 need
 to
 happen
 is
 more
 meat
 on
 the


bones
 of
 exactly
 how
 it
 is
 that
 this


agreement
 that
 all
 of
 these
 various


leaders
 just
 signed
 off
 on
 in
 charlie,


how
 will
 those
 how
 will
 those
 points


actually
 be
 implemented?
 So
 I
 think
 the


first
 order
 of
 the
 day
 is
 going
 to
 be


figuring
 out
 how
 to
 establish
 security


on
 the
 ground
 as
 Israeli
 troops
 withdraw


and
 not
 at
 all
 clear
 how
 that's
 going
 to


happen.
 What
 are
 the
 mechanisms
 by
 which


Hamas
 is
 going
 to
 be
 disarmed
 and
 to


whom?
 Whom
 will
 they
 give
 their
 arms
 to?


And
 then
 of
 course
 the
 other
 key
 element


of
 any
 postconlict
 stabilization
 is


governance.
 You've
 got
 to
 have


governance.
 You've
 got
 to
 have


authorities
 on
 the
 ground.
 Who
 will
 they


be?
 M


how
 will
 that
 structure
 be
 set
 up?
 Those


are
 really
 critical
 questions
 and
 we're


a
 long
 ways
 from
 understanding
 what
 the


details
 are
 that
 will
 will
 govern
 those


various
 arrangements.


Does
 a
 disarmed
 Hamas
 just
 to
 kind
 of


tie
 this
 up?
 Does
 do
 they
 want
 a
 Gaza
 a


Palestinian
 state
 that
 actually
 thrives?


Presumably
 they
 have
 called
 and
 and


would
 be
 in
 agreement
 with
 that.
 But
 as


always,
 the
 devil
 is
 in
 the
 details.
 For


example,
 they
 are
 saying
 that
 Israel


must
 withdraw
 100%
 from
 Gaza.
 That
 is


not
 envisioned
 by
 the
 plan.
 And


ultimately,
 what
 does
 a
 Palestinian


state
 look
 like?
 Uh
 is
 there
 a
 way
 to


actually
 uh
 build
 a
 Palestinian
 state


from
 the
 current
 set
 of
 circumstances


that
 we
 see
 on
 the
 ground?
 That
 is
 also


going
 to
 be
 extraordinarily
 difficult.


As
 long
 as
 these
 questions
 remain,
 there


will
 be
 space
 for
 resistance.
 There
 will


be
 space
 for
 groups
 like
 Hamas
 or
 its


successor
 to
 cause
 trouble.


Yeah,
 it's
 fascinating,
 right?
 And
 you


you
 talk
 about,
 you
 know,
 the
 building


of
 a
 Palestinian
 state
 and
 then
 there's


just
 the
 actual
 build
 of
 a
 land
 that
 has


just
 been
 uh
 devastated.
 Um
 so
 much
 more


to
 come
 and
 I
 know
 we'll
 lean
 on
 you
 in


the
 future
 because
 I'm
 sure
 there'll
 be


more
 to
 come.
 I'm

Well,
 big
 Aon
 uh
 is
 a
 big
 market
 story


as
 well
 today
 once
 again
 driving
 the


trade
 pushing
 semi
 as
 a
 group


semiconductors
 that
 is
 higher
 today
 led


by
 Broadcom
 whose
 stock
 jumped
 after


openai
 agreed
 to
 buy
 the
 company's


custom
 chips
 and
 networking
 equipment
 in


a
 multi-year
 deal
 part
 of
 an
 ambitious


plan
 by
 the
 startup
 to
 add
 AI


infrastructure.
 So
 we
 wanted
 to
 just
 dig


a
 little
 bit
 deeper
 into
 it.
 Amy
 talked


about
 it.
 We
 certainly
 are
 seeing
 it


playing
 out
 in
 the
 market.
 Got
 a
 great


voice
 though
 to
 walk
 us
 through
 it.
 One


of
 my
 favorite
 people.
 I
 will
 say


Billy
 must
 have
 said
 Mandep's
 name
 about


five
 times
 on
 the
 call
 this
 morning.


Immediately
 was
 like
 we
 need
 to
 get
 him


in
 studio.
 So
 perfect
 timing.
 And
 that's


why
 we're
 joined
 now
 by
 Bloomberg


Intelligence
 global
 head
 of
 technology


research
 Mandep
 Singh
 here
 in
 the


studio.
 Mandep
 walk
 us
 through
 this
 deal


because
 it
 feels
 like
 every
 other
 day


Open
 AAI
 has
 a
 new
 agreement
 with
 some


chip
 manufacturer
 and
 the
 terms
 are


slightly
 different
 whether
 it's
 an


ownership
 stake
 or
 front
 buying
 chips.


What's
 up
 with
 uh
 this
 broad
 compact?


I
 mean
 they
 are
 really
 going
 after
 uh


you
 know
 data
 center
 capacity
 right
 now


and
 the
 way
 they
 are
 doing
 it
 is
 by


diversifying
 their
 supplier
 base.
 So


it's
 not
 just
 relying
 on
 Nvidia
 which


everyone
 does
 right
 now
 uh
 for
 compute


but
 really
 uh
 leveraging
 Broadcom
 which


is
 a
 custom
 silicon
 maker.
 So
 think


about
 you
 know
 Nvidia
 giving
 you
 a


generic
 chip
 where
 you
 can
 run
 your
 AI


workloads
 whether
 it's
 training
 or


inferencing
 custom
 silicon
 is
 used
 just


for
 uh
 you
 know
 the
 specific
 workflow


that
 open
 AAI
 has
 to
 run
 for
 its


proprietary
 model.
 So
 no
 one
 else
 has


any
 benefit
 of
 using
 a
 custom
 silicon


because
 open
 AAI
 is
 not
 looking
 to
 sell


its
 own
 chips
 to
 compete
 with
 Nvidia.
 is


looking
 to
 use
 its
 chips
 for
 its
 own


chat
 chip
 app
 or
 any
 other
 custom
 app


that
 it
 has
 developed
 in-house
 and


Google
 is
 a
 prime
 example
 of
 what
 a


custom
 silicon
 looks
 like
 because
 they


have
 their
 own
 TPUs
 which
 when
 you


compare
 it
 to
 Nvidia
 GPUs
 is
 more


customized
 in
 nature
 but
 it
 does
 a


terrific
 job
 of
 running
 YouTube
 or
 any


other
 AI
 workloads
 that
 Google
 wants
 to


run
 on
 its
 chip.
 So
 that's
 what
 OpenAI


is
 doing
 and
 it
 has
 a
 tremendous
 cost


advantage
 because
 it
 costs
 a
 lot
 lower


than
 the
 Nvidia
 price
 tag
 of
 $30,000
 on


an
 average
 for
 a
 GPU


TPU
 tensor
 processing
 unit.
 I
 just
 want


to
 make
 sure
 I
 understand.
 Um
 what's


interesting
 though
 is
 I
 do
 feel
 like


there's
 this
 move
 trend
 to
 get
 chips


that
 maybe
 don't
 cost
 as
 much,
 maybe


don't
 use
 as
 much
 power,
 but
 do
 exactly


what
 we
 need.
 Is
 that
 fair?
 Yeah,
 I
 mean


look,
 one
 one
 gawatt
 requires
 up
 to
 500


to
 600,000
 accelerator
 chips.
 So
 we're


talking.5
 to6
 million
 chips
 for
 1
 gawatt


data
 center.
 Imagine
 if
 you
 can
 save
 up


to
 $5,000


how
 it
 multiplies,
 you
 know,
 in
 terms
 of


cost
 savings.
 The
 real
 constraint
 right


now
 is
 power.
 It's
 not
 as
 if
 you
 get
 a


cheaper
 chip
 and
 you
 are
 all
 good.
 You


still
 need
 the
 performance
 per
 watt


which
 is
 why
 Nvidia
 is
 so
 good
 because


it
 gives
 you
 five
 to
 10x
 more


performance
 per
 watt
 than
 the
 nearest


competitor.


Right.


Exactly.


I
 want
 to
 show
 there's
 a
 graphic
 um
 and


uh
 one
 of
 our
 producers
 made
 it


Elizabeth
 Cedron
 and
 I
 think
 it
 you
 know


we've
 all
 been
 looking
 at
 this.
 It's


about
 OpenAI
 and
 all
 of
 the
 companies


that
 they're
 doing
 deals
 with.
 And
 it's


not
 even
 been
 a
 month,
 but
 they
 have


done
 deals
 with
 Nvidia,
 Oracle,


Coreweave,
 AMD,
 now
 Broadcom.
 And
 again,


it's
 just
 late
 September
 to
 midocctober.


So,
 is
 that
 what
 this
 is?
 Is
 just
 giving


them
 a
 smarter
 supply
 chain
 and
 having


access
 to
 what
 they
 need?
 Is
 it
 as


simple
 as
 that?


Well,
 it's
 not
 as
 simple
 because
 they're


going
 across
 the
 stacks.
 Think
 of,
 you


know,
 how
 AI
 applications
 are
 deployed.


You
 need
 the
 chip,
 you
 need
 the


infrastructure,
 you
 need
 the
 cloud


because
 that's
 where
 you're
 doing
 your


inferencing.
 So
 they've
 cut
 deals
 with


different
 parts
 of
 the
 stack
 here,
 not


just
 the
 chip
 makers,
 not
 just
 the
 power


guys,
 uh
 also
 the
 cloud
 guys.
 So
 from


that
 perspective,


coreweave,
 right?


Coreweave.
 Exactly.
 And
 and
 look
 uh
 I


mean
 to
 my
 mind
 they
 are
 going
 uh


aggressive
 in
 terms
 of
 adding
 more


capacity
 than
 they
 probably
 need
 because


they
 think
 if
 they
 get
 market
 share
 they


get
 the
 companies
 or
 users
 to
 use
 their


product
 then
 they
 will
 be
 able
 to


monetize
 and
 probably
 drive
 some


companies
 out
 of
 you
 know
 competing
 with


them
 because
 of
 the
 scale
 involved
 here.


Well
 are
 are
 XAI
 and
 Anthropic
 striking


similar
 deals
 or
 is
 this
 the
 open
 AAI


show?
 I
 I
 think
 right
 now
 XAI
 must
 be


thinking
 and
 they
 are
 doing
 a
 $20


billion
 deal
 uh
 with
 some
 private


financing.
 But
 look,
 when
 OpenAI


announces
 a
 10
 gawatt
 deal,
 we're


talking
 500
 billion,
 not
 20
 billion


anymore.
 So
 it's
 the
 numbers
 are
 getting


bigger
 and
 bigger.


Well,
 is
 OpenAI
 in
 this
 moment
 in
 time


on
 October
 13th
 the
 most
 important


company
 in
 the
 world?


Well,
 when
 I
 look
 at
 Mag
 7,
 your


Broadcom
 is
 not
 in
 MAG7.
 It's
 a
 $1.6
 $6


trillion
 company,
 you
 know,
 Open
 AI


probably,
 you
 know,
 it's


and
 they're
 up
 10%
 because
 of
 this.
 I


mean,
 also
 they
 the
 whole
 space
 sold
 off


on
 Friday,
 so
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 downplay


that
 too
 much,
 but
 like


they're
 not
 even
 public.
 They're
 not


even
 profitable
 as
 much
 as
 we
 know,


right?


No,
 I
 mean
 look,
 so
 right
 now
 their


gross
 margins
 would
 be
 negative
 if
 you


factor
 in
 the
 training
 costs
 inferencing


wise.
 Yes,
 they
 they
 they
 are
 making


some
 money,
 but
 clearly
 if
 you
 include


everything
 and
 just
 to
 compare
 it
 with


Google,
 Google
 has
 an
 annual
 cost
 of


revenue
 of
 around
 100
 billion
 that


powers
 all
 of
 their
 apps,
 you
 know,


Google,
 YouTube,
 everything
 that
 they


run.
 Open
 AAI's
 compute
 costs
 are


probably
 north
 of
 20
 billion
 right
 now.


And
 if
 they're
 adding
 26
 gawatt
 more


capacity,
 we're
 talking,
 you
 know,
 uh


compute
 cost
 to
 multiply
 at
 least
 25


fold.
 So
 from
 that
 perspective
 you
 have


to
 ask
 yourself
 how
 much
 incremental


revenue
 do
 you
 want
 to
 see
 from
 open
 AI


to
 justify
 this
 you
 know
 1
 trillion


potentially1
 trillion
 dollar
 in
 compute


infrastructure
 spend
 and
 that's
 where


Google's
 infrastructure
 is
 so
 efficient


because
 just
 you
 know
 less
 than
 5
 gawatt


of
 compute
 gets
 you
 to
 over
 400
 billion


in
 revenue.


That's
 pretty
 cool
 you
 know


to
 say
 the
 least
 in
 a
 nonfinancial


analysis
 uh
 terminology.
 Um
 Mandep
 thank


you
 always
 a
 gem.
 Bloomberg
 intelligence


global
 head
 of
 technology
 research


Mandep
 Singh
 uh
 AI
 spend
 and
 the


buildout
 is
 one
 read
 on
 the
 US
 economy


and
 certainly
 the
 tech
 economy.
 Now
 to


another
 great
 read
 uh
 Bailey
 on
 US


economic
 activity
 and
 we're
 talking


about
 the
 industrial
 supplier
 Fasinel


which
 reported
 earnings
 earlier
 this


morning
 and
 shares
 I
 think
 they
 were
 the


worst
 performing
 the
 S&P
 500
 at
 one


point.
 Yeah,
 right
 now
 down
 about
 6%
 and


keep
 in
 mind
 this
 is
 a
 $50
 billion


company.
 So
 this
 is
 no
 small
 uh
 small


fish
 in
 the
 again
 in
 the
 industrial


space.
 One
 of
 the
 first
 reads
 we
 get


every
 quarterly
 earning
 season
 missing


Wall
 Street
 views
 broadly
 speaking.
 So


interesting
 what's
 driving
 that?


Well,
 let's
 ask
 uh
 the
 CEO
 Daniel
 Flores


is
 with
 us.
 He
 is
 uh
 chief
 executive


officer
 of
 Fasinel.
 He
 joins
 us
 from


Winona,
 Minnesota.
 Um
 Dan,
 it
 is
 great


to
 have
 you
 back
 with
 us.
 um
 talk
 to
 us


about
 uh
 the
 quarter
 because
 it
 does


seem
 like
 analysts
 were
 noting
 that
 the


pricing
 during
 the
 quarter
 was
 weaker


than
 expected
 uh
 and
 marks
 the
 second


straight
 quarter
 of
 softer
 pricing
 and


maybe
 that's
 why
 we're
 seeing
 the
 stock


down.
 What
 do
 you
 want
 to
 say
 to


investors?


Well,
 u
 part
 of
 the
 reason
 our
 stock's


down
 is
 it's
 priced
 to
 perfection
 if
 you


look
 at
 what
 it's
 done,
 you
 know,
 year


to
 date
 and
 where
 the
 multiple
 has
 gone.


But,
 uh
 you
 know,
 we
 had
 we
 had
 a
 really


good
 quarter.
 We
 had
 uh
 we
 had
 a
 double-


digit
 quarter.
 We
 hadn't
 seen
 that
 for
 a


couple
 years.
 U
 double-
 digit
 growth,


sorry.
 And
 uh
 pleased
 with
 the
 outcome.


One
 of
 the
 one
 of
 the
 uh
 challenges
 we


had
 this
 year
 was
 there's
 a
 lot
 of


fluidity
 around
 tariffs
 and
 what
 it


means
 for
 pricing.
 And
 we
 will
 raise


price
 to
 address
 costs
 in
 our
 customer


supply
 chain.
 Um
 we
 we
 really
 don't
 want


to
 raise
 more
 than
 that
 because
 we


believe
 it
 impairs
 our
 ability
 to
 grow


as
 fast
 as
 we'd
 like.
 And
 uh
 you
 know


coming
 into
 the
 quarter
 we
 estimated
 you


know
 X
 for
 uh
 for
 impact
 of
 pricing
 came


in
 a
 little
 bit
 less.
 We
 lowered
 our


number
 for
 the
 four
 fourth
 quarter
 but


the
 most
 important
 aspect
 is
 on
 a
 price


cost
 basis
 we
 are
 neutral
 and
 that's


what
 we
 aspire
 to
 be.
 We'd
 rather
 just


grow.
 M


and
 Dan
 to
 your
 point
 uh
 fast
 and
 all


even
 with
 the
 pullback
 today
 returning


22%
 year-to-
 date
 so
 outperforming
 the


S&P
 500
 and
 uh
 comparable
 uh
 stocks
 in


the
 industrial
 space
 but
 just
 one
 more


question
 on
 pricing
 in
 terms
 of


expectations
 would
 you
 want
 to
 raise


pricing
 like
 do
 you
 get
 the
 sense
 that


consumers
 and
 customers
 would
 push
 back


just
 given
 how
 you've
 been
 shifting
 into


bigger
 customers
 spending
 much
 more


money?
 Yeah.
 Um
 customers
 always
 push


back
 on
 pricing.
 Doesn't
 matter
 the
 size


customer.
 Uh
 we
 will
 uh
 we
 we
 we
 are


having
 conversations
 with
 our
 customer.


We
 will
 be
 doing
 some
 price
 increases
 in


Q4.
 I
 suspect
 we'll
 be
 doing
 some
 price


increases
 as
 we
 move
 into
 2026.
 But


again,
 our
 first
 discussion
 with
 the


customer
 um
 they
 understand
 it.
 They're


willing
 to
 move
 on
 price.
 Our
 first


discussion
 is
 always
 what
 are


alternatives
 to
 this
 product
 that
 maybe


doesn't
 mean
 we
 have
 to
 raise
 your


prices
 5%.
 Maybe
 it
 means
 it
 only
 has
 to


be
 two.
 And
 we
 we'd
 rather
 go
 to
 two
 cuz


that's
 what
 a
 that's
 what
 a
 supply
 chain


partner
 does.


Well,
 Dan,
 how
 do
 tariffs
 fit
 into
 this


just
 given
 that
 according
 to
 analysts


across
 the
 street
 when
 we
 look
 at


certain
 industries
 now
 is
 when
 we're


going
 to
 see
 tariffs
 showing
 up
 in
 the


third
 quarter
 in
 guidance
 as
 it
 go
 as
 it


relates
 to
 2026.
 what
 are
 you
 seeing
 and


how
 are
 you
 kind
 of
 attacking
 or


addressing
 any
 pressures
 from
 tariffs?


Yeah,
 so
 for
 us
 tariffs
 been
 um
 in
 the


in
 the
 equation
 uh
 since
 the
 you
 know


early
 part
 of
 the
 second
 quarter,
 a


little
 bit
 of
 first
 quarter.
 I
 think
 in


the
 the
 individual
 that
 handles
 pricing


um
 historically
 he
 will
 provide
 us
 an


update
 once
 a
 month.
 He
 had
 gotten
 to


the
 point
 where
 he
 was
 not
 only


providing
 us
 updates,
 he
 he
 was
 up
 to


video
 number
 14
 as
 of
 July
 that
 he
 was


serving
 out
 to
 the
 field,


giving
 them
 guidance
 into
 what
 we
 were


seeing
 in
 our
 supply
 chain
 and
 u
 and
 so


we've
 been
 adding
 price
 as
 we've
 gone


through
 the
 year
 and
 these
 have
 been


discussions
 with
 customers
 and
 I
 hope


that
 answers
 your
 question.


No,
 I
 think
 it
 does.
 But
 I
 think
 the
 big


thing
 is
 are
 you
 mitigating
 the
 impact


of
 tariffs?
 Are
 you
 shifting
 your
 supply


chain?
 is
 the
 expectation
 that
 you
 can


have
 some
 kind
 of
 knock-on
 effect
 as
 it


relates
 to
 pricing
 if
 we
 do
 continue
 to


see
 threats
 from
 the
 president
 going


after
 countries
 like
 China
 or
 others.
 We


are
 going
 to
 talk
 to
 uh
 one
 of
 the


members
 of
 Levis's
 management
 team
 and


they
 called
 out
 that
 they
 had
 to
 dial
 up


their
 expectations
 for
 the
 impact
 of


tariffs
 from
 other
 countries.
 So,
 how
 is


that
 impacting
 when
 you
 look
 at
 your


supply
 chain
 and
 when
 you
 look
 at
 the


potential
 for
 pricing
 impacts
 in
 2026?


We've
 been
 moving
 supply
 chain
 around


the
 planet
 in
 earnest
 since
 2017
 2018


time
 frame.


Um,
 as
 our
 name
 would
 imply,
 we
 sell
 a


lot
 of
 fasters.


And
 most
 of
 the
 fasters
 in
 North
 America


come
 from
 either
 mainland
 China
 or
 or


Taiwan.
 And
 the
 automotive
 industry
 took


the
 production
 there
 back
 in
 the
 50s
 and


60s.
 Actually
 took
 it
 to
 Japan
 and
 South


Korea
 and
 it
 migrated
 from
 there.
 If
 I


look
 at
 our
 resources,
 we
 now
 have
 a


sourcing
 team
 in
 Shanghai,
 but
 we
 have
 a


sourcing
 team
 in
 Bangkok.
 We
 have
 a


sourcing
 team
 in
 Northern
 India.
 And
 we


have
 worked
 to
 diversify
 our
 supplier


base
 around
 the
 planet
 and
 a
 little
 bit


more
 in
 North
 America,
 but
 really
 around


the
 planet.
 So
 to
 have
 diversity
 in


supply
 so
 you're
 not
 caught
 off
 guard
 by


some
 price
 change
 or
 or
 a
 tariff
 change.


In
 addition
 to
 that,
 we've
 taken
 supply


chains
 coming
 into
 North
 America,
 which


traditionally
 came
 in
 through
 the
 west


coast
 of the
 United
 States,
 and
 then
 we


would
 redistribute
 from
 there.
 We
 have


moved
 supply
 chains,
 so
 they're
 bringing


product
 directly
 into
 the
 West
 Coast
 of


Canada
 or
 the
 West
 Coast
 of
 Mexico


because
 those
 two
 countries
 represent


about
 14%
 of
 our
 revenue.
 Now,
 you


bypass
 the
 tariff.
 However,
 it's
 more


expensive
 to
 break
 shipments
 down
 over


in
 Asia
 and
 bring
 them
 in,
 but
 it's
 a


lot
 less
 than
 a
 tariff.


One
 of
 the
 things
 I
 want
 to
 ask
 you,
 you


know,
 you
 you
 talk
 about
 supply
 chains.


Is
 the
 endgame
 um
 Dan,
 we're
 talking


with
 Dan
 Flores.
 He's
 chief
 executive


officer
 of
 Fastenol.
 Is
 it
 about
 though


largely
 reducing
 your
 exposure
 to
 China,


which
 has
 been
 a
 pretty
 big
 one?


It's
 it's
 reducing
 our
 customers


exposure
 to
 any
 market
 in
 this
 case
 uh


China
 and
 or
 Taiwan
 but
 to
 any
 market


that
 are
 on
 the
 receiving
 end
 of
 some
 of


the
 political
 winds


and
 create
 an
 unstable
 supply
 base
 for


our
 customer.
 Here
 it
 happens
 to
 be


China.
 Another
 month
 it
 might
 be
 a


different
 country.
 Another
 year
 it
 might


be
 a
 different
 country.
 It's


diversifying
 your
 supply
 chain
 so
 your


eggs
 are
 not
 all
 in
 one
 basket.


Got
 to
 be
 ready.
 So


that's
 for
 a
 customer.
 Yeah,
 whichever


way
 the
 winds
 blow.
 Hey,
 one
 of
 the


things
 I
 want
 to
 ask
 you
 just
 big


broadly,
 uh,
 the
 earnings
 update
 today,


you
 talked
 about
 the
 industrial


environment
 still
 sluggish.
 We've
 heard


similar
 commentary
 on
 this
 persistent


sluggishness,
 uh,
 elsewhere
 from


manufacturers,
 as
 well
 as
 caution
 around


project
 delays.
 At
 what
 point
 does
 this


become
 something
 more
 worrying
 than
 just


sluggishness?


For
 us,
 it's
 been
 sluggish
 since


November
 of
 2022.


Okay.
 when
 the
 we
 really
 key
 on
 what
 the


um
 industrial
 um
 institute
 for
 supply


management
 puts
 out
 the
 PMI
 index


and
 that's
 been
 sub
 50
 which
 really


plays
 into
 our
 customer
 base
 other
 than


January
 and
 February
 of
 this
 year
 that's


been
 sub
 50
 since
 November
 of
 2022
 so


we've
 been
 in
 a
 sluggish
 economy
 for
 a


long
 time
 from
 our
 perspective
 and
 you


other
 than
 living
 through
 the
 first
 part


of
 it
 where
 you
 had
 customers
 that
 were


downshifting
 what
 reason
 our
 growth
 is


shining
 through
 a
 different
 way.
 A
 I


think
 we're
 executing
 at
 a
 higher
 level


but
 B
 once
 you
 get
 through
 that


downshifting
 now
 you're
 just
 even
 if


your
 customers
 are
 at
 a
 subdued
 level


you
 can
 grow
 in
 that
 kind
 of
 environment


and
 that's
 what's
 shining
 through
 in
 our


numbers
 right
 now.
 All
 right.
 One
 thing


I
 want
 to
 ask
 you
 because
 as
 you
 would


imagine,
 I
 don't know
 how
 much
 of
 this


is
 pervasive
 in
 your
 world,
 but
 AI
 is


like
 the
 non-stop
 conversation
 that
 we


are
 having
 um
 certainly
 when
 it
 comes
 to


activity
 and
 market
 impact.
 To
 what


extent
 is
 AI
 maybe
 sucking
 up
 the
 oxygen


in
 the
 economy?
 Are
 you
 seeing
 any
 signs


of
 that
 or
 your
 world
 they're
 going
 to


still
 need
 what
 you
 guys
 supply
 no


matter
 what's
 going
 on
 with
 the
 AI
 spend


and
 enthusiasm?


Well,
 first
 off,
 we
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 we


have
 a
 meaningful
 improvement
 in
 our


revenue
 as
 it
 relates
 to
 things
 like


data
 centers
 because
 we
 sell
 into
 a
 wide


range
 of
 of
 customer
 needs
 and
 endmarket


needs,
 whether
 that
 is
 the
 actual


construction.
 I
 I
 visited
 many
 data


centers
 being
 built
 where
 we
 have
 people


on
 site
 there.
 After
 it's
 built,
 we're


supplying
 into
 that
 facility
 with
 things


like
 air
 handling
 and
 maintenance


equipment.
 In
 the
 case
 of
 a
 customers


that
 sell
 into
 that
 sector,
 that's


actually
 a
 strong
 business
 for
 us
 right


now.
 And
 then
 as
 a
 organization,
 we're


we're
 increasingly
 making
 use
 of
 AI
 in


our
 own
 business
 and
 how
 we
 go
 to
 market


and
 how
 we
 help
 our
 employees
 be
 more


efficient
 in
 what
 they
 do.


And
 Dan,
 about
 45
 seconds
 here
 with
 in


with
 keeping
 in
 mind
 uh
 data
 center


construction,
 where
 are
 those
 products


sourced
 from?
 Are
 those
 also
 heavily


sourced
 from
 China
 and
 exposed
 to


tariffs
 or
 are
 they
 different
 supply


chain
 altogether?
 there,
 you
 know,


they're
 it
 it


mostly
 a
 different
 supply
 ch
 source.
 Um,


but
 uh
 it
 it
 depends
 on
 the
 component.


If
 it's
 facility
 maintenance
 types


products,
 they're
 coming
 from
 anywhere


on
 the
 globe.
 And
 so
 they're
 they're


subject
 to
 the
 same
 type
 of
 issues
 any


product
 would
 have.
 But
 a
 lot
 of
 the


components,
 I
 know
 a
 lot
 of the


manufacturers
 that
 we
 sell
 into,
 I


visited
 one
 about
 a
 year
 ago
 in
 Michigan


where
 they
 were
 purposely
 avoiding
 China


and
 they're
 selling
 directly
 into
 the


data
 centers.


You've
 been
 at
 Fastel
 for
 a
 long
 time.


Um,
 you've
 seen
 different
 cycles.
 How
 do


you
 describe
 this
 one?
 And
 again,
 just


got
 about
 20
 seconds.
 If
 you
 could
 be


very
 quickly,
 very
 quick.
 Oh.
 Um,
 odd
 in


the
 fact
 that,
 uh,
 you
 know,
 similar
 to


what
 we
 saw
 in
 18,
 but
 odd
 with
 the
 fact


of
 it's
 just
 so
 damn
 fluid
 and
 and
 and


there's
 so
 many
 things
 that
 occur
 from


week
 to
 week,
 monthto
 month
 that
 are


outside
 the
 norm,


but
 the
 fundamentals
 still
 work.


All
 right,


serve
 your
 customer
 in
 a
 high
 level,


you'll
 grow
 your
 business.


Love
 talking
 with
 you,
 Dan
 Flores,
 CEO


of
 Fast
 and


Stay
 with
 us.

this.

All right,
 folks.
 Levi
 Stra
 shares,
 they


are
 trading
 slightly
 lower
 today
 after


dropping
 as
 much
 as
 14%
 on
 Friday.
 This


is
 after
 the
 company's
 upgraded
 earnings


guidance
 still
 fell
 short
 of
 higher


investor
 expectations
 following
 the


stock's
 more
 than
 40%
 rally
 heading
 into


that
 earnings
 sprint.
 Now,
 one
 key


disappointment,
 at least
 according
 to


analysts
 out
 on
 the
 street,
 is
 earnings


growth
 failing
 to
 match
 the
 pace
 of


sales
 expansion
 due
 to
 tariff
 and


distribution
 costs.
 Meanwhile,
 got
 to


say
 Bailey,
 you
 did
 have
 TD
 Koin
 raising


its
 price
 target
 on
 the
 stock
 to
 26
 from


22
 a
 share
 and
 they've
 got
 their
 buy


rating.
 Yeah,
 staying
 bullish
 and
 you


look
 at
 the
 street
 13
 analysts,
 10
 of


them
 buys.
 So,
 is
 it
 a
 sell
 the
 news


event
 price
 to
 perfection?


We
 see


it's
 a
 really
 good
 point.
 So,
 let's
 see


what
 uh
 one
 of
 the
 company's
 members
 of


the
 seauite
 have
 to
 say.
 Hermit
 Singh
 is


with
 us,
 chief
 financial
 and
 growth


officer
 at
 Levi
 Strauss.
 He
 joins
 us


from
 our
 San
 Francisco
 bureau.
 Harit,


it's
 so
 good
 to
 have
 you
 here
 with
 us.


How
 are
 you
 and
 how
 is
 the
 consumer


doing?


Well,
 thanks
 for
 having
 me
 Carol
 and


Bailey.
 Um,
 it's
 great
 to
 be
 here
 again.


Um,
 you
 know,
 we
 had
 a
 real
 strong


quarter,
 four
 consecutive
 quarters
 of


high
 singledigit
 growth
 and
 record
 gross


margins
 as
 well
 as
 the
 fact
 that
 we
 were


able
 to
 raise
 our
 fullear
 guidance


as
 well
 as
 gross
 margin
 and
 EPS


expectations.
 U
 overall
 as
 a
 company


we're
 a
 stronger
 and
 a
 higher
 performing


company
 defined
 by
 accelerated
 growth,


expanding
 margins
 and
 higher
 return
 on


invested
 capital.
 to
 your
 question
 about


the
 consumer,
 the
 consumer
 is
 largely


being
 resilient.
 Um,
 you
 know,
 our


products
 are
 really
 well
 segmented.
 Uh,


you
 know,
 we
 have
 blue
 tab
 which
 we


which
 is
 our
 premium
 high
 pinnacle


product
 and
 that's
 doing
 well.
 We've


introduced
 that
 in
 the
 US.
 Uh,
 so
 far
 so


good.
 We
 have a
 red
 tab
 product
 that
 is


basically
 marketed
 to
 consumers
 who
 earn


between
 100,000
 and
 over.
 And
 that's
 you


know
 based
 on
 our
 results
 really
 done


well.
 And
 then
 we
 have
 a
 you
 know
 a


signature
 product
 sold
 through
 Walmart


that
 again
 had
 a
 banner
 cord
 and
 that's


for
 you
 know
 lower
 income
 consumer.
 So


consumer
 strength
 really
 strong.
 That's


where
 we
 were
 able
 to
 raise
 the
 full


year
 guidance
 and
 our
 product
 pipeline


hasn't
 been
 stronger.
 Now
 if
 you
 go


outside
 the
 uh
 the
 US
 and
 international


business
 was
 up
 in
 the
 high
 single
 digit


and
 so
 Asia
 had
 a
 strong
 quarter


consumer
 strong
 Europe
 had
 a
 decent


quarter
 consumer
 in
 a
 better
 place
 and


so
 is
 Latin
 America.


Well
 I'm
 just
 going
 to
 lay it
 out
 for


you.
 I
 think
 I
 bought
 my
 first
 pair
 of


Levis's
 uh
 in
 a
 long
 time
 just
 a
 couple


of
 months
 ago
 and
 my
 daughter
 who's
 22


so
 much
 younger
 than
 me
 has
 been
 buying


Levis's
 for
 a
 while.
 So
 Bailey
 I
 mean


they're
 back.
 I
 go
 into
 the
 store
 in


downtown
 in
 uh
 uh
 in
 the
 village
 and


yeah,
 it's
 packed.


Well,
 you
 get
 a
 partnership
 with


Beyonce,
 all
 the
 marketing
 you
 guys
 are


spending
 in
 terms
 of
 targeting
 both


young
 and
 older
 generations.
 But
 Har,
 I


want
 to
 ask
 about
 tariffs.
 So,
 Levi


expects
 tariffs
 from
 China
 about
 30%,


but
 increased
 expectations
 to
 20%
 from


the
 rest
 of
 the
 world.
 Where
 are
 you


sourcing
 your
 genes
 materials?
 Is
 it


more
 are
 you
 more
 exposed
 to
 that


doubling
 in
 terms
 of
 are
 you
 getting


materials
 from
 Vietnam
 in
 place
 of


China?


Yeah.
 So
 overall
 we're
 taking
 a
 holistic


approach
 as
 we
 are
 able
 to
 offset
 the


tariff
 impact.
 Um
 you
 know
 as
 you
 think


about
 this
 year
 we
 raised
 guidance
 in


the
 top
 line
 and
 the
 bottom
 line
 and


gross
 margin.
 So
 you
 know
 we've
 been


able
 to
 withstand
 that.
 To
 your
 specific


question,
 Bailey,
 um
 we
 source
 about
 1%


uh
 we
 import
 into
 the
 US
 from
 China,
 a


little
 over
 a
 percent
 from
 India.
 Most


of
 and
 Vietnam
 is
 in
 the
 mid
 to
 high


single
 digit.
 So
 most
 of
 our
 imports
 are


from
 the
 Southeast
 Asian
 countries.


Think
 Bangladesh,
 think
 Pakistan
 and
 and


and
 uh
 and
 the
 rest
 of
 Asia.
 The
 way
 we


think
 about
 our
 supply
 chain,
 it's


fairly
 well
 diversified.
 We
 import
 from


about
 20
 countries
 into
 the
 US.
 60%
 of


our
 business
 is
 outside
 the
 US.
 And
 so


we're
 well
 positioned
 to
 mitigate
 and


offset
 tariffs.
 And
 the
 way
 we're


thinking
 about
 the
 holistic
 approach


given
 that
 volume
 is
 driving
 a
 big
 piece


of
 our
 um
 you
 know
 revenue
 momentum
 and


we
 have
 tenured
 um
 vendor
 relationships.


We're
 working
 with
 our
 vendors.
 We're


looking
 at
 different
 cost
 uh


efficiencies
 across
 our
 organization
 as


well
 as
 you
 know
 being
 very
 thoughtful


about
 pricing.


So
 let
 me
 just
 ask
 you
 though
 you
 guys


did
 you
 know
 you
 mentioned
 you
 raised


your
 fullear
 um
 outlook.
 You
 did
 warn


that
 tariffs
 are
 starting
 to
 bite
 profit


profitability
 to
 measure
 by
 gross


margins
 improve.
 So
 these
 are
 the
 good


stuff
 but
 again
 that
 tariffs
 are


starting
 to
 bite.
 Um
 Hermit
 can
 you
 tell


us
 what
 that
 means?
 what
 the
 bite
 of


tariffs
 um
 when
 when
 how
 much
 you
 know


any
 color
 around
 that.


Sure.
 So
 you
 know
 overall
 you
 know
 we


were
 able
 to
 raise
 topline
 and
 bottom


line
 uh
 guidance
 despite
 absorbing


tariffs
 and
 so
 we
 are
 able
 to
 mitigate


it.
 Uh
 to
 the
 question
 about
 tariffs
 um


u
 you
 know
 tariffs
 were
 introduced
 on


liberation
 day.
 We
 normally
 buy
 our


products
 you
 know
 6
 months
 in
 advance


and
 so
 um
 you
 know
 we're
 working
 through


um
 you
 know
 our
 efforts
 and
 we've
 got


different
 levers
 u
 to
 kind
 of
 position


it.
 So
 you
 take
 quarter
 three,
 the
 the


quarter
 we
 just
 reported,
 gross
 margins


are
 record.
 So
 we're
 able
 to
 offset


tariffs
 because
 we
 got
 other
 things


working
 for
 us.
 You
 know,
 as
 we
 grow
 our


women's
 business,
 our
 direct
 to
 consumer


business
 and
 international,
 all
 of
 which


are
 accreative
 to
 gross
 margins
 and


allow
 us
 to
 uh
 you
 know
 mitigate
 and
 and


offset
 some
 of
 the
 tariff
 exposure.
 uh


quarter
 four
 we
 did
 guide
 gross
 margins


to
 be
 slightly
 down
 versus
 a
 year
 ago


and
 had
 it
 not
 been
 for
 tariffs
 you
 know


we'd
 have
 grown
 gross
 margins
 but


overall
 as
 we
 think
 about
 the
 year
 we'll


we'll
 report
 again
 another
 year
 of


record
 gross
 margins
 so
 we're
 working
 on


levers
 for
 2026


the
 good
 news
 is
 we'll
 end
 the
 year


stronger
 and
 we
 believe
 we're
 well


positioned
 to
 have
 another
 strong
 year


in
 2026


and
 Carol
 we've
 talked
 with
 a
 good


friend
 Peter
 Atwater
 for
 quite
 some
 time


K-shaped
 recovery
 where
 people
 who
 are


well
 off


in
 the
 bottom
 quintile


when
 you
 look
 at
 your
 goods
 when
 you


look
 at
 the
 ability
 to
 raise
 prices
 from


the
 impact
 of
 tariffs
 which
 products
 are


you
 able
 to
 more
 easily
 raise
 prices


where
 you
 aren't
 going
 to
 see
 consumers


push
 away
 and
 how
 are
 you
 thinking
 about


that
 strategy
 as
 it
 relates
 to
 say
 the


jeans
 that
 you
 do
 sell
 through
 a
 Walmart


where
 you
 don't
 have
 that
 gross
 margin


going
 direct
 to
 consumer
 and
 you
 do
 have


likely
 uh
 at least
 when
 we
 look
 the
 data


a
 consumer
 who's
 feeling
 the
 pinch
 of


inflation
 broadly
 speaking.


Yeah.
 And
 so
 the
 first
 thing
 Bailey
 to


your
 question
 is
 our
 products
 are
 well


segmented
 depending
 on
 the
 um
 income


profile
 of
 different
 consumers.
 I
 talk


blue
 tab,
 red
 tab
 and
 signature.
 Uh


signature
 is
 what's
 uh
 sold
 into
 the


lower
 income
 consumer.
 We've
 been
 very


thoughtful
 about
 pricing.
 We're
 leading


with
 product
 innovation
 rather
 than


price.
 And
 so
 we're
 doing
 what
 we
 can
 to


maintain
 a
 price
 point.
 It
 was
 evident


in
 quarter
 3.
 Signature,
 for
 example,
 I


think
 is
 up
 in
 the
 low
 double
 digits
 for


the
 year.
 As
 we
 think
 about,
 you
 know,


our
 other
 products,
 the
 good
 news
 for
 us


is
 our
 product
 pipeline
 has
 never
 been


stronger.
 You
 know,
 we're
 leading
 with


loose
 and
 baggy
 while
 at
 the
 same
 time


selling
 a
 lot
 of
 slim
 and
 skinny.
 Uh


both
 for
 him
 and
 her.
 you
 know,
 we've


got
 wonderful
 uh
 you
 know,
 waist
 up
 uh


products
 to
 think
 trucker
 jackets,
 think


linen
 shirts,
 etc.,
 etc.
 And
 so,
 as
 a


company,
 we're
 making
 this
 uh
 pivot
 to


be
 more
 of
 a
 denim
 lifestyle
 uh
 retailer


going
 forward.
 Our
 past
 was
 all
 about


denim.
 Our
 future
 is
 going
 to
 be
 about


denim
 lifestyle.


I
 just
 want
 to
 know,
 do
 you
 really
 have


a
 pair
 of
 baggie
 barrel
 jeans?
 I
 I
 can't


get
 my
 head
 around
 them.
 I'm
 trying.
 I'm


trying.
 I'm
 just
 I
 haven't
 done
 it.
 I


haven't
 done
 it.
 Um
 Arid
 what
 I
 do
 want


to
 ask
 you
 too
 is
 you
 guys
 have
 had
 kind


of
 a
 mission
 a
 goal
 to
 get
 to
 10
 billion


in
 sales
 by
 2027.
 I
 think
 you
 may
 have


adjusted
 a
 little
 bit.
 I
 think
 also
 a


15%
 EBIT
 margin.
 Could
 you
 reach
 15%
 in


the
 next
 few
 years
 even
 if
 sales
 have


not
 hit
 that
 10
 billion?
 You
 know
 talk


to
 us
 a
 little
 bit
 about
 that
 mission.


Yeah.
 you
 know
 u
 you
 know
 we
 gave
 out


the
 expectation
 of
 10
 billion
 and
 15%
 um


on
 our
 investor
 day
 in
 the
 middle
 of


June
 2022
 u
 since
 then
 you
 know
 there's


been
 a
 lot
 of
 change
 um
 and
 a
 lot
 of


uncertainty
 as
 a
 company
 we've
 kind
 of


you
 know
 navigated
 our
 way
 through


uncertainty
 we
 haven't
 given
 a
 new
 date


on
 the
 10
 billion
 and
 the
 20
 and
 the
 and


the
 15%
 our
 our
 thinking
 is
 we'll


probably
 do
 that
 sometime
 next
 year
 but


to
 your
 question
 the
 company
 that
 we
 are


uh
 building
 and
 the
 company
 that
 is
 uh


got
 the
 foundation
 given
 where
 we
 ending


this
 year
 so
 you
 take
 20
 2025
 we'll
 end


at
 about
 6%
 organic
 growth
 last
 year
 it


was
 3%
 the
 year
 before
 that
 it
 was
 flat


um
 if
 you
 think
 in
 EBIT
 margins
 this


year
 we'll
 end
 about
 mid
 11s
 last
 year


it
 was
 in
 the
 mid-10s
 the
 previous
 year


it
 was
 about
 nine
 so
 we've
 seen
 a
 steady


progress
 and
 our
 view
 is
 we
 probably
 get


to
 the
 15%
 faster
 than
 we
 get
 to
 the
 10


billion
 but
 uh
 but
 really
 a
 company
 that


is
 steadily
 um
 delivering
 mids


singledigit
 growth
 uh
 in
 a
 category
 that


probably
 grows
 a
 little
 you
 know
 south


of
 that
 so
 our
 view
 is
 that
 we
 will
 we


are
 market
 leaders
 now
 in
 the
 US
 number


one
 in
 men's
 number
 one
 in
 women's
 and


really
 resonating
 with
 the
 youth
 and
 so


the
 question
 is
 if
 you're
 able
 to
 uh


stay
 at
 you
 know,
 and
 implement
 our


strategies.
 Our
 view
 is
 we
 can
 continue


to
 be
 market
 leader
 and
 probably
 pick
 up


a
 little
 bit
 of
 share,
 especially


because
 the
 denim
 category
 is


accelerating.
 We've
 seen
 the


acceleration
 in
 the
 US.
 We've
 seen
 the


acceleration
 outside
 and
 that's
 largely


driven
 by
 the
 world
 becoming
 more


casual.


Yeah,
 I
 have
 more
 jeans
 in
 my
 wardrobe


than
 I've
 ever
 had
 in
 like
 since
 high


school.
 Like,
 it's
 really
 kind
 of
 wild.


Anyway,
 Bailey,
 I
 know
 you've
 got


another
 question.
 I
 was
 just
 going
 to


ask
 in
 terms
 of
 geographic
 expansion


when
 you
 think
 about
 China,
 what's
 going


on
 with
 China?
 And
 also,
 what
 products


do
 the
 Chinese
 consumers
 want?
 Is
 it


that
 high-end
 good
 or
 is
 it
 more
 of
 a


bargain
 purchase?


Yeah.
 So,
 China
 for
 us
 is
 still


underpenetrated.
 Um,
 China
 represents


about
 2
 or
 3%
 of
 our
 business.
 Um,
 you


know,
 our
 business
 in
 China
 has
 been


slow
 and
 soft.
 The
 Chinese
 consumer


right
 now
 is
 going
 through
 a
 you
 know
 a


bit
 of
 a
 macro
 uncertain
 climate.
 Um
 uh


but
 the
 the
 good
 news
 for
 us
 is
 they


love
 the
 brand.
 Um
 our
 brand
 equity


scores
 are
 really
 solid.
 We
 think
 China


can
 be
 you
 know
 a
 business
 that
 grows


double
 digit
 over
 the
 long
 term.
 But
 to


your
 specific
 question,
 the
 Chinese


consumer
 is
 fairly
 discerning
 on
 the


brands
 he
 or
 she
 gravitate
 to.
 There
 is


a
 high-end
 consumer
 as
 well
 as
 a


consumer
 that
 li
 the
 mid-market


consumer.
 What
 we
 call
 the
 core
 product.


So
 if
 you
 think
 about
 our
 Asia
 strategy,


we
 really,
 you
 know,
 our
 products
 are


relevant
 for
 the
 mid-market
 consumer


while
 we
 also
 offer
 products
 for
 the
 um


higher
 premium
 end
 consumer.
 30%
 of
 the


Asian
 denim
 category
 is
 uh
 premium
 uh


and
 you
 know
 premium
 for
 example
 a


highest
 pinnacle
 product
 is
 largely


Japanese
 uh
 you
 know
 fabric
 Japanese


denim
 and
 um
 inspired
 uh
 by
 salvage
 and


so
 that's
 what
 we
 are
 selling
 and
 I


think
 over
 time
 we'll
 be
 able
 to
 start


growing
 our
 China
 business
 back
 into
 in


the
 low
 double
 digit
 range.
 Yeah,


interesting.
 Seth,
 I
 will
 say,
 Carol,
 I


know
 you
 mentioned
 you
 have
 more
 jeans


than
 ever.
 I
 have
 been
 buying
 the
 sherpa


jackets,
 the
 denim
 jackets
 like
 crazy.
 I


don't
 know
 why
 I
 have
 three
 of
 them
 in


different
 colors.


I
 bought
 a
 bunch
 of
 denim
 jackets.


That's
 what
 I'm
 in.
 I'm
 like
 I
 don't


wear
 jeans.
 I
 wear
 chinos,
 but
 I
 wear


the
 the
 denim
 jackets
 like
 crazy.


I
 know.
 I
 just
 I
 don't
 know.
 I
 love
 it.


I
 love
 it.
 It's
 like
 everybody
 I
 work


jeans
 every
 morning.


Yeah.
 And
 Bailey
 and
 and
 Carol,
 now


we've
 got
 the
 blue
 tab.
 It's
 um
 it's


it's
 a
 fuller
 jacket.
 Um
 you
 can


definitely
 wear
 it
 to
 office
 depending


on
 the
 on
 the
 on
 the
 uh
 you
 know
 uh


dress
 uh
 environment
 uh
 at
 Bloomberg.
 I


walked
 in
 here
 fairly
 casual.
 So
 you


know
 something
 that
 we
 are
 now
 beginning


to
 offer
 which
 should
 make
 your
 wardrobe


at
 some
 stage.


Um
 hey
 one
 last
 question.
 Does
 it
 feel


like
 God
 har
 the
 it's
 been
 a
 crazy
 year


uh
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 stuff
 coming
 at


everybody
 investors
 the
 world
 at
 large.


Does
 it
 feel
 like
 things
 are
 starting
 to


calm
 down
 on
 a
 day
 when
 we've
 talked


about
 what
 seems
 like
 progress
 in
 a


ceasefire
 between
 Israel
 and
 Hamas?


Yeah,
 you
 know,
 um,
 as
 I
 mentioned


earlier,
 you
 know,
 we
 have
 lived
 through


uncertainty.


Um,
 you
 know,
 the
 good
 news
 for
 us
 is


the
 category
 strong.
 We
 have
 real


business
 momentum.
 The
 brand's
 never


been
 stronger
 and
 we
 have
 a
 product


pipeline
 that
 is
 never
 been
 fuller


especially
 as
 we
 head
 towards
 holiday.


You
 know,
 our
 focus
 right
 now
 is
 making


sure
 our
 product
 is
 on
 the
 on
 the
 floor


when
 the
 because
 what
 we
 have
 seen,


Carol,
 is
 consumers
 gravitate
 to
 newness


and
 gravitate
 to
 what's
 relevant
 and
 um


you
 know
 and
 you
 know
 um
 our
 view
 is
 if


we
 can
 offer
 the
 right
 product
 and
 build


a
 brand
 experience
 and
 that's
 why
 we've


got
 real
 focus
 on
 our
 direct
 to
 consumer


business
 while
 complementing
 growth
 with


our
 wholesale
 business.
 So
 this
 quarter


um
 you
 know
 both
 DDC
 and
 wholesale
 was


up.
 We
 had
 in
 the
 US
 five
 consecutive


quarters
 of
 high
 growth
 and
 it's
 fueled


by
 both
 the
 channels.


All right.
 Well
 hermit
 when
 you
 talk


with
 your
 design
 team
 I
 like
 high
 waist


buttons
 kind
 of
 slim
 through
 the
 legs


and
 then
 a
 little
 flare.
 I'm
 just
 going


to
 put
 it
 out
 there.
 A
 little
 stretch
 in


there
 too
 is
 kind
 of
 my
 favorite.
 My


favorite
 my
 favorite.
 Um
 and


you
 are
 Jeff.
 Thank
 you.


Yeah.
 What
 I
 and
 I'll
 take
 that
 feedback


Karen.
 You
 know,
 I
 I
 sincerely
 believe


feedback
 is
 a
 is
 a
 gift
 and
 getting


feedback
 from
 consumers
 like
 yourself
 is


something
 that
 I'll
 take
 upon
 myself
 to


feed
 back
 to
 our
 designers.


All right,
 I'm
 going
 to
 hold
 you
 to
 it.


All right,
 good
 stuff.
 Thank
 you
 so


much.
