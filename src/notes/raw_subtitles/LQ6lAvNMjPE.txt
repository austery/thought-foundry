[Music]


hi
 everyone
 I'm
 Nicola
 tangan
 the
 CEO
 of


the
 Norwegian
 soan
 wealth
 fund
 and
 today


we
 have
 Thomas
 Shiner
 the
 CEO
 of
 rash


which
 is
 one
 of
 the
 leading
 healthcare


companies
 in
 the
 world
 rash
 was
 founded


in
 1896
 so
 it's
 uh
 really
 old
 lots
 of


tradition
 have
 really
 innovated
 in
 uh


Healthcare
 saved
 millions
 and
 millions


of
 people
 and
 we
 are
 proud
 that
 we
 own


2.3%
 of
 the
 company
 worth
 more
 than
 $6


billion
 so
 a
 big
 thanks
 thas
 for
 joining


us
 today
 thank
 you
 very
 much
 for
 the


invitation
 so
 Thomas
 when
 um
 you
 drive


into
 Basel
 right
 you
 have
 uh
 Rush
 on
 one


side
 of
 the
 river
 Novartis
 on
 the
 other


side
 of
 the
 river
 two
 of
 the
 leading


farma
 companies
 in
 the
 world
 so
 how
 come


that
 this
 uh
 little
 Swiss
 town
 has
 grown


to
 become
 one
 of
 the
 super
 centers
 for


biofarma
 I
 think
 it's
 all
 in
 the
 history


of
 that
 region
 uh
 starting
 with
 the


chemical
 industry
 and
 then
 later
 moving


into
 the
 farmer
 uh
 part
 of
 the
 industry


uh
 so
 I
 I
 think
 it's
 all
 basically
 in


the
 history
 of
 of
 that
 region
 and


located
 in
 the
 center
 of
 Europe
 uh
 it's


actually
 quite
 ideally
 located
 in


addition
 it
 also
 has
 an
 ecosystem
 in


terms
 of
 good
 universities
 um
 good


educational
 system
 in
 general
 and
 I


think
 this
 really
 attracts
 a
 lot
 of


people
 around
 the
 world
 really
 talented


people
 that
 then
 can
 drive
 the


Innovation
 well
 we
 love
 it
 when
 we
 see


these
 kind
 of
 um
 hubs
 of
 um
 different


types
 of
 Industries
 now
 um
 one
 of
 the


things
 with
 you
 are
 uh
 you
 know
 the


leader
 in
 in
 cancer
 and
 um
 I
 read
 this


book
 called
 The
 Emperor
 of
 all
 melodies


about
 the
 incredible
 progress
 that's


happened
 in
 cancer
 survival
 rates
 over


the
 last
 50
 years
 could
 you
 just
 briefly


take
 us
 through
 the
 main
 milestones
 in


that
 development
 so
 on
 theology
 side
 I


think
 one
 of
 the
 major
 breakthroughs
 was


uh
 clearly
 the
 understanding
 of
 a
 genome


if
 you
 look
 back
 uh
 in


2003
 it
 costs
 billions
 to
 sequence
 one


genome
 and
 took
 I
 think
 uh
 more
 than
 10


years
 to
 sequence
 a
 single
 genome
 now


you
 can
 do
 that
 within
 just
 days
 and
 it


cost
 you
 hundreds
 uh
 of
 Swiss
 Franks
 or


dollars
 whatever
 currency
 you're
 looking


into
 so
 really
 understanding
 The
 genome


was
 a
 real
 breakthrough
 and
 with
 that


you
 could
 understand
 better
 the
 drivers


uh
 of
 what
 actually
 drives
 cancer
 uh


certain
 enogen
 Etc
 and
 with
 that
 you
 can


Target
 much
 more
 precisely
 the
 root


cause
 of
 cancer
 then
 I
 think
 the
 other


breakthrough
 was
 uh
 when
 we
 found
 a
 way


on
 how
 to
 use
 antibodies
 something
 that


naturally
 occurs
 in
 our
 body
 um
 but
 to


take
 these
 antibodies
 and
 Target
 them


much
 more
 precisely
 at
 different


diseases
 including
 uh
 cancer
 and
 uh
 I


think
 cancer
 immunotherapies
 are
 a
 great


example
 of
 that
 where
 you
 can
 actually


activate
 the
 own
 immune
 system
 to
 fight


the
 cancer
 and
 I
 think
 we'll
 go
 more
 in


that
 direction
 as
 well
 uh
 one
 uh
 topic


we're
 working
 on
 is
 the
 personalized


cancer
 vacine
 so
 really
 in
 how
 you
 can


even
 more
 enhance
 your
 own
 immune
 system


to
 fight
 off
 the
 cancer
 so
 there
 are
 a


number
 of
 steps
 that
 have
 been
 happening


and
 on
 the
 other
 hand
 I
 think
 there's
 a


lot
 of
 innovation
 that
 can
 still
 happen


and
 a
 long
 way
 to
 go
 to
 really
 um


eradicate
 cancer
 how
 strong
 is
 your


leadership
 in
 cancer
 treatment
 now
 yeah


we've
 been
 uh
 one
 of
 the
 leading


companies
 uh
 in
 oncology
 for
 I
 would
 say


the
 last
 two
 decades
 at
 least
 first
 with


the
 acquisition
 of
 Genentech
 where
 we


actually
 got
 a
 lot
 of
 access
 to
 this


know
 how
 on
 how
 to
 engineer
 antibodies


to
 better
 Target
 different
 uh
 cancer
 um


you
 know
 targets
 um
 and
 at
 the
 same
 time


you
 know
 we
 need
 to
 continue
 to
 invest


in
 research
 and
 development
 oncology


right
 now
 we're
 investing
 about
 50%
 of


our
 Global
 R&D
 budget
 so
 50%
 of
 13


billion
 into
 the
 ecology
 space
 because


you
 know
 we
 want
 to
 continue
 to
 drive


Innovation
 and
 set
 the
 next
 standards
 of


care
 and
 how
 would
 you
 define
 your


Market
 positions
 in
 in
 the
 other
 uh


areas
 yeah
 so
 we
 are
 a
 leader
 in


healthcare
 overall
 uh
 if
 you
 look
 at


just
 by
 Revenue
 Raj
 is
 the
 second


biggest
 Healthcare
 company
 in
 the
 world


with
 both
 having
 Pharma
 and
 Diagnostics


Under
 One
 Roof
 on
 the
 diagnostic
 side
 uh


we're
 clearly
 the
 market
 leader
 and
 in


Pharma
 we're
 the
 leader
 in
 a
 number
 of


different
 spaces
 I
 think
 Neuroscience
 is


one
 area
 where
 we're
 clearly
 the
 market


leader
 hemophilia
 we're
 the
 market


leader
 uh
 in
 oftalmology
 we're
 in
 the


process
 of
 becoming
 the
 market
 leader
 uh


in
 enology
 we're
 now
 uh
 one
 of
 the
 top


three
 companies
 in
 the
 world
 in
 terms
 of


uh
 cancer
 medicines
 so
 you
 have
 um
 on


the
 last
 call
 you
 said
 you
 have
 20
 new


products
 in
 the
 pipeline
 of
 which
 nine


has
 been
 launched
 so
 when
 you
 look
 at


that
 pipeline
 how
 how
 excited
 are
 you


compared
 to
 what
 you
 have
 been


historically
 yeah
 if
 you
 look
 at
 the


last
 uh
 10
 years
 um
 or
 15
 years
 even


we've
 launched
 about
 two
 new
 medicines


uh
 every
 year
 and
 this
 is
 Quite
 a
 feat


uh
 if
 you
 look
 at
 the
 fact
 that
 to


develop
 a
 new
 medicine
 it
 takes
 on


average
 around
 uh
 13
 years
 and
 from
 the


beginning
 of
 development
 all
 the
 way
 to


the
 launch
 of
 medicine
 only
 about
 one


out
 of
 10
 makes
 it
 now
 this
 is
 not
 a


rough
 specific
 number
 this
 is
 just
 an


industry
 uh
 number
 so
 launching
 two


every
 year
 is
 Quite
 a
 feat


and
 uh
 and
 that's
 the
 rate
 we
 want
 to


continue
 and
 if
 you
 continue
 that
 rate


we'll
 launch
 20
 medicines
 also
 in
 in


this
 decade
 now
 in
 our
 pipeline
 we
 have


many
 many
 more
 uh
 potential
 medicines


but
 there's
 always
 nutrition
 and
 so
 you


have
 to
 work
 on
 many
 things
 to
 get
 just


two
 out
 of
 the
 out
 of
 the
 door
 at
 the


end
 now
 the
 big
 um
 the
 big
 thing
 of


course
 of
 the
 last
 couple
 years
 have


been
 the
 the
 Obesity
 space
 where
 you
 did


have
 the
 opportunity
 to
 enter
 now
 you


have
 entered
 uh
 at
 a
 late
 later
 stage


just
 what
 what
 happened
 there
 why
 were


you
 a
 bit
 late
 out
 of
 the
 boook
 yeah


actually
 uh
 Ro
 was
 also
 a
 leader
 in


cardiovascular
 metabolic
 diseases
 in
 the


past
 and
 back
 in
 2010
 2011
 we
 actually


had
 one
 of
 these
 in
 kettin
 in
 our


Pipeline
 and
 also
 chugai
 one
 of
 our


daughter
 companies
 has
 developed
 an
 oral


in
 creton
 now
 um
 you
 know
 as
 everything


in
 life
 sometimes
 you
 make
 right


decisions
 sometimes
 you
 don't
 make
 the


right
 decision
 I
 think
 we've
 made
 a
 lot


of
 very
 good
 decisions
 and
 that's
 why
 we


are
 leader
 you
 know
 in
 areas
 like


multiple
 sclerosis
 or
 hemophilia
 um
 but


I
 would
 say
 here
 clearly
 you
 know
 we


should
 have
 stayed
 in
 this
 space


throughout
 this
 phase
 of
 the
 last
 decade


um
 because
 you
 know
 uh
 the
 topic
 about


obesity
 is
 also
 a
 topic
 Beyond
 just
 you


know
 adipositas
 it's
 a
 topic
 of
 other


diseases
 if
 you
 look
 at
 uh
 what
 diseases


are
 caused
 by
 obesity
 cancer
 you
 know


there's
 a
 higher
 rate
 of
 cancer
 in
 obese


patients
 than
 non-
 obese
 patients
 if
 you


look
 at
 uh
 kidney
 diseases
 if
 you
 look


at
 different
 eye
 diseases
 if
 you
 look
 at


potentially
 neurological
 diseases
 like


Alzheimer's
 and
 Parkinson's
 so
 obesity


really
 has
 uh
 influence
 much
 broader
 and


so
 by
 tackling
 this
 uh
 we
 actually
 go


into
 prevention
 of
 diseases
 and
 this
 is


what
 Healthcare
 System
 want
 from
 us


Healthcare
 System
 want
 us
 to
 move
 more


towards
 the
 area
 of
 prevention
 are
 you


surprised
 by
 how
 many
 how
 many
 problems


are
 link
 to
 obesity
 no
 I'm
 I'm
 not


surprised
 at
 all
 it's
 uh
 if
 you
 look
 at


uh
 the
 global
 population
 about
 50%
 of


the
 world's
 population
 is
 obese
 at
 this


stage
 and
 um
 so
 in
 order
 to
 tackle
 some


of
 these
 co-morbidities
 we
 will
 have
 to


tackle
 the
 topic
 of
 obesity
 now
 you're


also
 working
 on
 um
 uh
 brain
 shuttle


technology
 which
 allows
 larger
 molecules


to
 enter
 the
 bloodb
 brain
 barrier
 what


can
 this
 do
 so
 this
 uh
 will
 be


transformative
 uh
 especially
 for


diseases
 uh
 that
 happen
 in
 the
 brain


like
 neurological
 diseases
 multiple


sclerosis
 Alzheimer
 and
 Parkinson's
 just


to
 name
 a
 few
 and
 uh
 what
 this


technology
 does
 um
 it
 actually
 helps
 the


antibody
 which
 is
 a
 big
 molecule
 to
 get


much
 more
 easily
 into
 the
 brain
 if
 you


take
 a
 normal
 medicine


uh
 only
 or
 even
 less
 than
 half
 percent


of
 this
 medicine
 that
 you
 inject
 into


the
 body
 actually
 makes
 it
 to
 the
 brain


so
 it's
 very
 hard
 to
 treat
 diseases
 that


happen
 in
 the
 brain
 and
 and
 why
 is
 that


well
 we
 have
 this
 Blood
 brain
 barrier


and
 this
 bloodb
 brain
 barrier
 is
 there


to
 protect
 our
 brain
 from
 viruses
 from


bacteria
 from
 other
 things
 that
 could
 go


into
 the
 brain
 and
 could
 damage
 our


brain
 and
 uh
 with
 this
 brain
 shuttle


which
 is
 a
 protein
 attached
 the
 antibody


we
 can
 actually
 transport
 the
 antibody


much
 more
 easily
 into
 the
 brain
 and
 with


that
 we
 can
 treat
 diseases
 that


otherwise
 could
 not
 be
 treated
 as


effectively
 in
 fact
 we
 have
 an
 very


promising
 Alzheimer
 medicine
 in
 our


pipeline
 uh
 and
 this
 uh
 antibody


actually
 uses
 exactly
 this
 uh


technology
 and
 uh
 we
 hope
 to
 launch
 that


uh
 by
 28
 29
 time
 frame
 because
 then
 we


can
 really
 tackle
 one
 of
 the
 big
 biggest


problems
 in
 healthcare
 today
 now
 you


work
 with
 a
 lot
 of
 different
 partners
 uh


in
 many
 different
 areas
 have
 you
 done


for
 a
 long
 period
 of
 time
 what
 what
 do


you
 think
 is
 the
 the
 key
 to
 forming


successful
 collaborations
 in
 the
 farma


industry
 why
 are
 some
 of
 them
 successful


and
 some
 of
 them
 are
 not
 yeah
 so
 we


invest
 about
 13
 billion
 Swiss
 Franks


every
 year
 in
 our
 research
 and


development
 and
 with
 that
 we're
 actually


the
 highest
 spender
 in
 terms
 of
 R&D
 in


the
 industry
 now
 even
 though
 that
 sounds


a
 lot
 and
 it
 is
 a
 lot
 it's
 only
 a


fraction
 of
 the
 total
 money
 spent
 uh
 in


uh
 Healthcare
 in
 in
 R&D
 so
 it's
 clear


that
 if
 you
 want
 to
 be
 at
 the
 frontier


of
 innovation
 you
 cannot
 only
 rely
 on


projects
 that
 run
 in-house
 but
 you
 also


actually
 have
 to
 tackle
 and
 uh


understand
 uh
 some
 of
 these
 projects


that
 are
 happening
 outside
 of
 our


company
 so
 Us
 and
 other
 farma
 companies


are
 constantly
 at
 the
 lookout
 to
 find


very
 promising
 projects
 compounds
 that


we
 could
 bring
 in
 house
 now
 if
 we
 look


at
 our
 Pipeline
 and
 what
 we've
 delivered


over
 the
 last
 10
 15
 years
 about
 50%
 of


the
 molecules
 that
 we've
 launched
 the


new
 medicines
 came
 from
 Raj
 and
 the


other
 50%
 came
 from
 the
 outside
 on
 the


other
 hand
 what
 I
 mentioned
 in
 the


beginning
 is
 that
 if
 you
 look
 at
 the


whole
 development
 process
 it's
 a
 long


process
 it's
 it's
 13
 years
 on
 average


for
 the
 industry
 only
 one
 out
 of
 10


medicines
 make
 it
 this
 is
 of
 course
 true


for
 our
 own
 pipeline
 but
 it's
 also
 true


for
 everything
 that
 you
 bring
 in
 from


the
 outside
 so
 this
 is
 basically
 you


know
 the
 risk
 that
 we
 have
 to
 take
 in


order
 to
 bring
 great
 Innovation
 to


patients
 that
 also
 Partnerships
 May
 Fail


during
 this
 process
 but
 if
 you
 want
 to


bring
 true
 Innovation
 this
 will
 not


happen
 without
 taking
 any
 risks
 now


there
 are
 some
 similarities
 between


between
 a
 Pharma
 pipeline
 an
 an


Investment
 Portfolio
 right
 you
 invest
 in


products
 for
 the
 long
 term
 to
 generate


returns
 now
 have
 you
 got
 a
 particular


kind
 of
 investment
 philosophy
 at
 Raj
 to


make
 this
 successful
 yeah
 so
 when
 we


look
 uh
 at
 our
 portfolio
 and
 our


potential
 new
 medicines
 we
 of
 course


look
 at
 each


medicine
 as
 an
 individual
 but
 we
 also


look
 at
 the
 portfolio


overall
 and
 uh
 similar
 to
 other


Investments
 that
 you
 would
 do
 you
 do


actually


uh
 npv
 calculation
 you
 you
 calculate
 you


know
 what
 would
 you
 have
 to
 invest
 and


what's
 the
 potential
 return
 at
 the
 same


time
 we
 look
 at
 something
 we
 call


probability
 of
 success
 and
 so
 we
 have
 to


understand
 you
 know
 what's
 the
 risk
 that


we're
 taking
 in
 terms
 of
 technical


scientific
 risk
 but
 what's
 also
 the


Financial
 Risk
 and
 then
 when
 you
 look
 at


the
 overall
 portfolio
 it
 has
 to
 make


sense
 so
 you
 know
 you
 can
 do
 a
 number
 of


projects
 that
 are
 high
 risk
 but
 also


High
 Rewards


but
 you
 also
 have
 to
 kind
 of
 combine
 it


with
 uh
 projects
 uh
 where
 the
 certainty


is
 higher
 uh
 again
 the
 high-risk
 High


reward
 projects
 there's
 a
 reason
 why


they're
 high
 risk
 and
 high
 rewards
 it's


because
 for
 example
 in
 Parkinson's


people
 have
 worked
 for
 decades
 for


decades
 to
 find
 a
 new
 medicine
 it's
 very


very
 difficult
 but
 if
 you
 make
 it
 of


course
 it's
 a
 huge
 benefit
 to
 society


but
 it's
 also
 a
 big
 benefit
 to
 our


company
 if
 you
 make
 it
 so
 you
 can
 make


individual
 such
 beds
 but
 you
 can't
 only


make
 such
 beds
 because
 we
 also
 have
 to


earn
 back
 the
 money
 in
 order
 to
 keep


investing
 in
 R&D
 we
 can't
 do
 any
 good


for
 patients
 if
 we
 don't
 uh
 are
 not
 able


to
 earn
 back
 our
 R&D
 money
 you
 mentioned


at
 the
 beginning
 your
 strong
 position
 in


Diagnostics
 what
 are
 what
 are
 the


advantages
 of
 having
 both
 Diagnostics


and
 farma
 inhouse
 I
 think
 it's
 critical


if
 you
 look
 at
 um
 where
 Healthcare
 is


going
 Healthcare
 is
 is
 going
 uh
 to


expect
 from
 us
 that
 we
 improve
 outcomes


but
 also
 reduce
 cost
 of
 care
 um
 because


we
 know
 that
 the
 healthcare
 budgets
 are


limited
 and
 I
 think
 here
 the
 combination


of
 Diagnostics
 and
 Pharma
 can
 play
 a
 big


role
 so
 we
 believe
 that
 uh
 there
 is
 much


more
 of
 a
 trend
 to
 go
 towards


prevention
 stopping
 disease
 from


progressing
 but
 also
 curing
 now
 if
 you


want
 to
 prevent
 the
 disease
 you
 actually


want
 to
 find
 the
 high-risk
 patients
 and


these
 high-risk
 patients
 you
 want
 to


treat
 preventively
 in
 order
 for
 them
 not


to
 develop
 the
 disease
 so
 you
 need
 a


good
 Diagnostics
 to
 find
 those
 patients


to
 then
 be
 able
 to
 give
 them
 the
 right


medicine
 if
 you
 want
 to
 stop
 disease


progression
 you
 really
 have
 to


understand
 the
 cause
 of
 that
 disease
 and


uh
 find
 a
 very
 targeted
 treatment
 to


make
 sure
 that
 you
 stop
 the
 progression


of
 this
 disease
 and
 the
 same
 for
 cure


for
 cure
 uh
 you
 know
 oftentimes
 there
 is


genetic
 reasons
 or
 other
 reasons
 that


cause
 a
 disease
 to
 happen
 again
 you
 need


a
 Diagnostics
 to
 understand
 that
 in


order
 to
 give
 the
 right
 kind
 of


treatment
 um
 so
 we
 see
 this
 trend
 uh


really
 happening
 over
 the
 next
 decades


this
 will
 be
 even
 stronger
 and
 having


both
 Diagnostics
 and
 Pharma
 we
 are


better
 position
 than
 any
 other
 company


to
 actually
 um
 manage
 to
 serve
 the
 needs


of
 what
 the
 Healthcare
 System
 and
 What


patients
 at
 the
 end
 need
 across
 the


world
 and
 where
 does
 Healthcare
 data


come
 in
 here
 because
 you
 were
 you
 were


early
 in
 here
 by
 acquiring
 Foundation


medicine
 and
 flaton
 among
 other
 things


why
 um
 why
 is
 this
 an
 important
 space
 to


be
 well
 Healthcare
 data
 plays
 a
 role
 uh


clearly
 across
 the
 different
 parts
 uh
 of


uh
 the
 value
 chain
 and
 uh
 it
 plays
 a
 big


part
 in
 research
 and
 development
 if
 you


want
 to
 develop
 a
 new
 medicine
 or
 new


Diagnostics
 you
 have
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 data


to
 understand
 um
 how
 to
 best
 Target


which
 molecule
 to
 design
 Etc
 so
 the
 more


data
 you
 have
 the
 better
 it
 is
 for
 you


uh
 as
 a
 starting
 point
 to
 develop
 new


medicines
 and
 and
 diagnostics
 at
 the


same
 time
 I
 think
 um
 when
 it
 comes
 to


treatment
 of
 patients
 um
 data
 plays
 a


big
 role
 uh
 for
 example
 you
 can
 use
 um


Diagnostics
 and
 understand
 you
 know
 the


cause
 of
 disease
 for
 a
 number
 of


different
 patients
 and
 then
 you
 can
 look


at
 how
 these
 patients
 were
 treated
 and


how
 these
 treatments
 worked
 now
 if
 you


can
 go
 back
 and
 you
 can
 look
 at
 this
 on


a
 bigger
 population
 level
 it
 will


actually
 help
 you
 to
 decide
 which


treatment
 to
 give
 for
 what
 kind
 of
 uh


diagnostics
 for
 What
 patients
 so
 to


combine
 that
 is
 I
 think
 very
 critical
 to


be
 even
 better
 in
 treating
 our
 patients


and
 improving
 their
 lives
 um
 and
 being


more
 precise
 in
 the
 Diagnostics
 Thomas


if
 we
 want
 to
 if
 we
 drill
 down
 a
 bit


further
 on
 on
 Innovation
 um
 like
 uh
 uh
 a


naive
 question
 why
 are
 some
 farma


companies
 better
 at
 Innovation
 than


others
 what
 what
 is
 it
 in
 particular


that
 makes
 some
 companies
 stand
 out
 I
 I


think
 one
 uh
 topic
 is
 uh
 culture
 you


know
 um
 as
 a
 company
 I
 think
 that's


something
 that
 differentiates
 us
 um
 we


are
 able
 to
 recruit
 and
 retain
 the
 most


talented
 people
 we
 have
 a
 very
 low


turnover
 um
 in
 fact
 if
 you
 Benchmark
 us


compared
 to
 other
 companies
 in
 Industry


uh
 we
 are
 one
 of
 the
 best
 if
 not
 the


best
 company
 in
 that
 aspect
 and
 given


the
 long
 nature
 and
 the
 long
 cycles
 of


our
 industry
 it's
 important
 that
 we
 have


also
 a
 certain
 level
 of
 continuity
 of


people
 working
 on
 certain
 projects
 when


people
 keep
 switching
 between
 projects
 I


think
 that's
 not
 uh
 not
 a
 very
 good
 uh


thing
 the
 second
 piece
 is
 as
 a
 company


you
 have
 to
 follow
 the
 science
 and
 you


have
 to
 see
 where
 is
 their
 new


scientific
 breakthrough
 like
 we
 did
 with


antibodies
 like
 we're
 now
 doing
 with
 uh


using
 artificial
 intelligence
 and
 using


organoids
 um
 in
 our
 research
 and


development
 um
 and
 then
 you
 have
 to
 jump


on
 those
 you
 have
 to
 have
 the
 long


breath
 for
 those
 then
 to
 become
 to


reality
 um
 and
 I
 think
 that's
 important


if
 you
 keep
 changing
 the
 course
 in
 a


business
 that
 has
 such
 long
 Cycles
 it's


actually
 not
 good
 for
 Innovation
 to


happen
 what
 is
 it
 that
 sets
 the
 rush


Innovation
 culture
 apart
 so
 I
 think
 one


is
 the
 the
 culture
 that
 we
 have
 with
 our


people
 which
 which
 is
 a
 very
 empowering


culture
 the
 second
 piece
 I
 believe
 is


also
 the
 unique
 setup
 that
 we
 have
 um
 we


have
 on
 the
 farmer
 side
 actually
 two


early
 research
 engines
 um
 one
 is
 uh
 jugi


a
 company
 in
 Japan
 that
 we
 own
 the


majority
 of
 another
 one
 is
 in
 the
 US
 uh


called
 Genentech
 research
 and
 early


development
 it
 came
 to
 us
 through
 uh
 the


acquisition
 of
 uh
 Chen
 tank
 and
 the


third
 one
 is
 farma
 research
 and
 early


development
 it
 gives
 us
 three
 unique


shots
 at
 goal
 to
 develop
 uh
 new
 uh


medicines
 they
 all
 have
 very
 different


cultures
 different
 approaches
 and
 when


you
 look
 at
 Innovation
 it's
 actually


helpful
 to
 have
 the
 kind
 of
 you
 know


different
 approaches
 and
 not
 only
 have


one
 one
 approach
 across
 how
 is
 AI
 going


to
 change
 the
 way
 you
 innovate
 so
 this


is
 actually
 an
 area
 where
 ched
 so
 gench


research
 and
 early
 development
 has
 a


huge
 focus
 on
 um
 we
 have
 an
 amazing
 team


there
 of
 uh
 uh
 people
 who
 are
 World


experts
 in
 in
 this
 area
 and
 AI
 plays
 and


will
 play
 a
 role
 uh
 in
 the
 entire
 uh


process
 process
 of
 research
 and
 and


development
 in
 the
 early
 stage
 of


research
 and
 development
 um
 for
 example


um
 what
 what
 used
 to
 be
 done
 where
 you


synthesize
 a
 lot
 of
 different
 molecules


and
 then
 you
 test
 every
 molecule
 in
 Vivo


so
 in
 the
 cell
 to
 see
 which
 one
 works


nowadays
 what
 you
 would
 do
 is
 you
 take


all
 the
 data
 that
 you
 have
 you
 uh
 let
 AI


design
 uh
 among
 thousands
 and
 thousands


of
 molecules
 those
 molecules
 that
 have


the
 best
 attributes
 and
 then
 you
 just


test
 a
 handful
 of
 different
 molecules
 um


in
 uh
 invo
 and
 what
 that
 means
 is
 that


we
 can
 actually
 be
 much
 faster
 we
 can
 be


much
 more
 coste
 efficient
 we
 can
 test
 a


lot
 more
 different
 molecules
 much
 faster


and
 uh
 and
 with
 that
 actually
 bring
 uh


medicines
 to
 patients
 much
 more
 quickly


so
 if
 you
 if
 you
 do
 speed
 for
 instance


what
 is
 it
 going
 to
 do
 to
 speed
 so
 we


set
 goals
 for


R&D
 uh
 by
 40%
 and
 it
 doesn't
 mean
 that


we
 are
 particularly
 bad
 that
 we
 have
 to


set
 a
 goal
 of
 minus
 40%
 it's
 just
 where


we
 believe
 that
 the
 industry
 will
 be
 at


the
 end
 of
 the
 Decades
 when
 we
 really


Implement
 Ai
 and
 to
 end
 and
 what
 about


costs
 how
 much
 cheaper
 will
 it
 be
 so


costs
 uh
 our
 Target
 is
 to
 reduce
 it
 by


20%
 you
 know
 on
 the
 one
 hand
 we
 can
 be


more
 effective
 but
 on
 the
 other
 hand
 we


also
 want
 to
 do
 more
 uh
 so
 potentially


we
 can
 also
 increase
 the
 number
 of


Medicine
 that
 we
 launch
 every
 year
 which


would
 be
 great
 news
 for
 patients
 but


obviously
 also
 for
 our
 company
 so
 in


addition
 to
 speed
 and
 cost
 what
 what
 do


you
 think
 it
 will
 do
 with
 the
 with
 the


final
 drug
 with
 the
 final
 product
 you


come
 up
 with
 will
 that
 be
 significantly


better
 you
 think
 yeah
 I
 I
 think
 that
 you


should
 have
 uh
 a
 lot
 more
 Innovation


happening
 in
 a
 much
 shorter
 period
 of


time
 and
 if
 you
 have
 that
 you
 will
 also


um
 obviously
 have
 better
 medicines
 uh
 I


think
 what
 it
 will
 also
 do
 actually
 AI


um
 is
 lot
 of
 the
 manual
 work
 that's


being
 done
 today
 like
 uh
 you
 know


writing
 uh
 study
 protocols
 like
 doing


all
 the
 regulatory
 submissions
 which
 are


800
 900
 pages
 of
 paper
 if
 you
 can
 use
 AI


for
 all
 of
 that
 um
 and
 of
 course
 you


need
 to
 proof
 read
 and
 you
 need
 to
 make


sure
 that
 everything
 is
 correct
 but
 it


can
 massively
 reduce
 the
 amount
 of


effort
 and
 we
 can
 use
 the
 time
 of
 those


people
 not
 to
 do
 uh
 yeah
 manual
 labor


but
 really
 invest
 the
 time
 into


developing
 new
 medicines
 so
 I
 think


there
 will
 be
 also
 shift
 in
 the
 kind
 of


work
 that
 people
 are
 doing
 so
 you
 said


that
 now
 one
 one
 out
 of
 10
 drugs
 make
 it


what
 do
 you
 think
 that
 number
 will
 be
 in


10
 years
 time
 well
 on
 on
 one
 hand
 uh
 you


will
 bring
 up
 the
 volume
 right
 so
 that


will
 be
 helpful
 um
 in
 terms
 of
 you
 know


what
 exactly
 we
 will
 achieve
 uh
 in
 terms


of
 the
 success
 rate
 I
 think
 you
 will


have
 still
 a
 lot
 lot
 that
 will
 not


succeed
 because
 ultimately
 you
 will
 have


to
 test
 it
 and
 um
 you
 know
 there
 are
 a


lot
 of
 attributes
 that
 have
 to
 work
 in


order
 for
 medicine
 to
 work
 so
 but
 can


you
 imagine
 if
 you
 just
 increase
 it
 by
 a


factor
 of
 two
 just
 to
 go
 from
 10%
 to
 20%


you
 would
 double
 the
 amount
 of
 medicines


that
 are
 being
 uh
 uh
 delivered
 to
 to


patients
 I
 mean
 that
 would
 be
 huge
 and


The
 Game
 Changer
 what
 do
 you
 think
 will


happen
 to
 cancer
 survival
 rates
 let's


say
 in
 the
 next
 10
 years


I
 I
 think
 it
 will
 continuously
 improve


um
 and
 uh
 you
 know
 the
 goal
 is
 clearly


uh
 to
 eradicate
 cancer
 and
 uh
 if
 you


know
 you
 look
 at
 the
 time
 of
 HIV
 when


the
 first
 medic
 was
 developed
 the
 second


medicine
 was
 developed
 I
 think
 the
 the


key
 uh
 of
 uh
 how
 to
 um
 basically
 achieve


the
 fact
 that
 people
 don't
 have
 to
 die


of
 HIV
 anymore
 was
 actually
 to
 combine


medicines
 and


the
 reason
 is
 if
 you
 use
 one
 medicine
 um


you
 the
 the
 virus
 will
 change
 will
 have


different
 mutations
 so
 it
 will
 escape


that
 medicine
 so
 by
 combining
 multiple


medicines
 you
 uh
 you
 know
 it's
 much
 much


harder
 for
 this
 this
 virus
 to
 escape
 and


it's
 the
 same
 for
 cancer
 for
 cancer
 you


know
 when
 you
 put
 a
 selective
 pressure


on
 it
 by
 adding
 a
 medicine
 you
 know
 the


cells
 that
 are
 you
 know
 uh
 affected
 by


this
 medicine
 they
 will
 die
 but
 if
 there


are
 certain
 mutations
 they
 will
 escape


the
 mechanism
 and
 they
 will
 find
 a


different
 mechanism
 and
 that's
 what


exactly
 we
 see
 with
 cancer
 and
 so
 by


applying
 multiple
 uh
 medicines
 you
 can


probably
 at
 one
 stage
 get
 to
 the
 same


situation
 as
 as
 we've
 done
 with
 uh


infectious
 uh
 diseases
 like
 HIV
 and
 I


believe
 the
 immune
 system
 will
 play
 a


big
 role
 you
 know
 if
 we
 can
 activate
 the


immune
 system
 to
 fight
 the
 cancer
 to


identify
 the
 cancer
 better
 um
 then
 I


think
 we
 also
 will
 make
 a
 big
 step


forward
 moving
 on
 to
 um
 Europe's
 uh


place
 in
 the
 world
 here
 so
 Europe
 is


falling
 behind
 uh
 China
 and
 the
 US
 when


it
 comes
 to
 uh
 to
 clinical
 drug
 trials


and
 I
 think
 the
 European
 share
 has
 Haled


over
 the
 last
 10
 years
 which
 is
 pretty


pretty
 dramatic
 what
 why
 is
 that
 yeah
 I


mean
 if
 you
 look
 at


Innovation
 um
 I
 I
 would
 say
 there
 are


probably
 four
 area
 regions
 in
 the
 world


where
 Innovation
 is
 uh
 really
 coming


from
 uh
 one
 is
 the


US
 one
 is
 uh
 uh


Europe
 China
 is
 really
 accelerating
 if


you
 look
 at
 the
 patent
 applications


coming
 out
 of
 China
 it's
 taking
 over


it's
 it's
 advancing
 very
 quickly
 and
 the


last
 area
 is
 is
 Japan
 now
 what
 uh
 the
 US


is
 doing
 quite
 well
 is
 um
 so
 all
 of
 them


have
 pretty
 strong
 Academia
 I
 would
 say


um
 but
 what
 the
 US
 is
 doing
 particularly


well
 is
 that
 uh
 they
 have
 a
 much
 better


environment
 for
 startups
 so
 there
 is
 a


much
 better
 access
 to
 venture
 capital


and
 with
 that
 you
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 people


actually
 moving
 to
 the
 US
 so
 they
 have
 a


lot
 of
 talent
 going
 to
 the
 US
 and
 uh
 and


you
 see
 a
 lot
 of
 the


Innovation
 which
 is
 translated
 from


Academia
 into
 the
 biotechs
 than
 actually


happen
 more
 in
 the
 US
 and
 probably
 also


China
 now
 than
 than
 for
 example
 in


Europe
 um
 so
 I
 think
 Europe
 has
 to
 get


that
 right
 the
 second
 piece
 that
 Europe


has
 to
 get
 right
 is
 uh
 they
 have
 to


reduce
 the
 amount
 of
 bureaucracy
 if
 you


look
 at
 clinical
 trials
 Etc
 um
 these
 are


done
 in
 countries
 where
 um
 you
 have
 less


bureaucracy
 if
 it
 takes
 you
 a
 year
 for


from
 the
 time
 you
 apply
 for
 clinical


trial
 to
 uh
 being
 able
 to
 start
 a


clinical
 trial
 that's
 a
 year
 of
 lost


time
 a
 year
 of
 time
 where
 we
 cannot
 save


a
 number
 of
 patients
 lives
 if
 this


medicine
 makes
 it
 um
 so
 I
 think
 Europe


really
 needs
 to
 work
 on
 on
 the


bureaucracy
 piece
 as
 well
 what


particular
 part
 of
 bureaucracy
 is


holding
 you
 back
 is
 it
 g
 is
 are
 these


gdpr
 related
 uh
 issues
 or
 what
 are
 they


gdpr
 related
 issues
 uh
 but
 uh
 in
 in


general
 you
 know
 all
 the
 approvals
 that


you
 have
 to
 get
 to
 start
 a
 clinical


trial
 um
 if
 that
 takes
 a
 year
 it's
 just


a
 year
 lost
 in
 time
 you
 said
 China
 was


um
 taking
 over
 here
 what
 could
 you
 be
 a


bit
 more
 specific
 about
 China's
 role


yeah
 so
 looking
 in
 China
 um
 first
 if
 you


look
 at
 the
 amount
 of
 patn
 uh
 that
 are


coming
 out
 of
 China
 this
 is
 going
 up


exponentially
 um
 if
 you
 look
 at
 the


talents
 that
 you
 can
 find
 in
 China
 uh


you
 I
 mean
 it's
 just
 amazing
 you
 have
 a


lot
 of
 people
 that
 studied
 in
 the
 best


universities
 in
 the
 world
 that
 have
 gone


back
 to
 China
 and
 uh
 have
 opened


biotechs
 uh
 are
 working
 in
 universities


uh
 Etc
 and
 um
 one
 has
 to
 say
 you
 know
 if


you
 look
 at
 uh
 the
 mentality
 in
 China
 is


you
 know
 they
 want
 to
 be
 a
 leader
 and


then
 they
 put
 all
 the
 efforts
 all
 the


strength
 of
 the
 country
 of
 the
 people


behind
 it
 to
 become
 a
 leader
 I
 think


sometimes
 if
 you
 look
 at
 uh


uh
 regions
 and
 I'm
 just
 going
 to
 pick


Europe
 because
 I'm
 a
 European
 so
 it's


always
 easier
 to
 pick
 on
 yourself
 um
 you


know
 maybe
 sometimes
 we've
 become
 too


comfortable
 I
 would
 say
 the
 prosperity


that
 we
 have
 is
 sometimes
 also
 a
 bit
 of


our
 enemy
 you
 know
 if
 you
 want
 to
 stay


ahead
 um
 you
 cannot
 rest
 on
 the


achievements
 from
 the
 past
 but
 you


constantly
 have
 to
 work
 at
 that
 and
 I


think
 this
 is
 where
 China
 has
 a


different
 attitude
 to
 which
 extent
 can


you
 tap
 into
 the
 talent
 in
 China
 so
 uh


China
 is
 actually
 one
 of
 our
 biggest


countries
 in
 terms
 of
 number
 of
 people


we
 have
 there
 and
 also
 in
 terms
 of
 uh
 um


uh
 you
 know
 markets
 uh
 sales


Etc
 but
 beyond
 that
 we
 don't
 only
 have


commercial
 organizations
 there
 over
 the


past
 years
 and
 partly
 decades
 we've


built
 up
 also
 a
 presence
 on
 the
 research


and
 and
 development
 side
 Pharma
 has
 been


there
 for
 a
 bit
 longer
 but
 also
 in


Diagnostics
 we've
 been
 there
 for
 the


last
 couple
 of
 years
 um
 and
 it's


important
 because
 um
 you
 know
 first
 of


all
 we
 want
 to
 tap
 into
 the
 talent
 that


is
 there
 and
 second
 if
 you
 have
 strong


R&D
 presence
 you
 also
 can
 tap
 more
 much


more
 easily
 into
 the
 biotex
 because
 you


know
 you
 have
 the


connectivity
 um
 you
 speak
 the
 same


language
 uh
 you
 can
 you
 know
 only
 assess


the
 science
 outside
 if
 you
 have
 great


scientists
 inside
 um
 and
 so
 I
 think
 from


that
 aspect
 I
 think
 we're
 in
 in
 a
 pretty


good
 shape
 and
 clearly
 China
 is
 going
 to


and
 will
 remain
 a
 big
 priority
 for
 us


simply
 also
 because
 uh
 there
 are
 1.4


billion
 people
 in
 China
 and
 a
 lot
 of


these
 people
 still
 don't
 have
 great


access
 to
 to
 healthare
 and
 so
 there's
 a


lot
 of
 work
 that
 can
 still
 be
 done
 are


you
 acquiring
 patents
 and
 companies
 in


China


so
 we've
 uh
 done
 a
 couple
 of
 Licensing


deals
 from
 biotechs
 where
 we
 licensed
 in


a
 number
 of
 molecules
 and
 I
 have
 to
 say


the
 science
 is
 great
 is
 it
 better
 now


than
 in
 the
 US
 you
 think
 I
 I
 I
 wouldn't


say
 that
 at
 this
 stage
 uh
 I
 would
 say


you
 know
 if
 you
 look
 at
 uh
 you


know
 around
 the
 globe
 us
 Europe
 China


and
 Japan
 are
 where
 most
 of
 the


Innovation
 is
 coming
 from
 us
 is
 clearly


I
 still
 in
 the
 leadership
 position
 but


China
 is
 catching
 up
 very
 quickly
 moving


on
 to
 the
 uh
 important
 uh
 topic
 of
 uh


pricing
 um
 of
 course
 there's
 always
 been


a
 trade-off
 in
 the
 farma
 industry
 about


uh
 you
 know
 how
 much
 you
 charge
 and
 how


many
 people
 will
 benefit
 from


It
 generally
 are
 drug
 prices
 too
 high


now
 across
 the
 world
 well
 if
 you
 look
 at


uh
 pricing
 you
 also
 have
 to
 look
 at
 the


model
 uh
 of
 how
 Innovation


happens
 uh
 as
 I
 mentioned
 uh
 you
 have
 in


Pharma
 uh
 cycle
 of
 about
 13
 years
 to


develop
 a
 new


medicine
 um
 and
 you
 have
 a
 risk
 profile


where
 only
 one
 out
 of
 10
 medicines
 make


it
 so
 you
 actually
 have
 to
 earn
 the


money


back
 uh
 with
 one
 medicine
 that
 you


couldn't
 with
 the
 other
 nine
 that
 failed


and
 you
 only
 have
 a
 short
 period
 of
 time


you
 only
 have
 around
 10
 years
 and
 in


some
 parts
 of
 the
 world
 this
 time
 is


shortening
 even
 um
 10
 years
 to
 earn
 back


the
 money
 and
 then
 you
 have
 the
 entry
 of


biosimilar
 you
 have
 the
 entry
 of


generics
 so
 the
 benefit
 to
 society
 is
 of


course
 already
 during
 these
 10
 years


when
 you
 have
 uh
 launched
 this
 medicine


but
 the
 benefit
 to
 society
 goes
 Way


Beyond
 if
 you
 look
 at
 if
 you
 look
 at
 uh


just
 the
 medicines
 that
 we
 have
 launched


uh
 in
 our
 history
 Now
 44
 medicines
 are


now
 on
 the
 wh
 list
 of
 essential


medicines
 like
 antibiotics
 like
 volume


um
 uh
 you
 know
 a
 number
 of
 other
 cancer


medicines
 Etc
 now
 if
 the
 Innovation


didn't
 happen
 before
 because
 there
 were


no
 incentives
 for
 Innovation
 then
 these


medicines
 would
 not
 be
 as
 widely


available
 uh
 as
 they
 are
 today
 in
 fact
 I


always
 say
 that
 um
 our
 industry
 is


actually
 the
 pipeline
 of
 the
 generics


and
 biosimilar
 Industry
 so
 if
 you
 break


that
 it
 doesn't
 work
 I
 think
 a
 good


example
 uh
 where
 you
 can
 see
 where
 if


you
 don't
 have
 that
 incentive
 and
 it


doesn't
 work
 is


antibiotics
 so
 there
 haven't
 been
 new


antibiotics
 for
 50
 years
 now
 we've
 been


uh
 developing
 antibiotics
 to
 antibiotics


because
 we
 see
 it
 as
 an
 ethical


responsibility
 and
 we
 believe
 that


unfortunately
 there
 will
 be
 more


pandemics
 that
 will
 come
 and


unfortunately
 one
 of
 the
 pandemics
 that


could
 come
 could
 be
 a
 bacterial
 pandemic


and
 then
 the
 vaccines
 will
 not
 work
 then


we
 need
 new
 new
 antibiotics
 but
 why
 is


no
 one
 especially
 not
 a
 lot
 of
 biotechs


why
 is
 no
 one
 working
 on
 this
 it's


because
 the
 business
 model
 doesn't
 work


if
 you
 know
 you
 have
 a
 company


developing
 a
 new
 antibiotic
 what
 would


happen
 is
 that
 antibiotic
 would
 not
 be


used
 it
 would
 only
 be
 used
 once
 all
 the


other
 antibiotics
 fail
 so
 there
 is
 not
 a


huge
 incentive
 for
 biotechs
 to
 go
 in
 it


they
 have
 to
 survive
 they
 have
 to


survive
 a
 company
 like
 ours
 we
 can


invest
 a
 certain
 piece
 of
 our
 money
 uh


that
 we
 have
 in
 research
 and
 development


to
 do
 this
 but
 biotechs
 cannot
 and


unfortunately
 a
 lot
 of
 innovation


happens
 in
 biotechs
 so
 you
 need
 to


create
 more
 of
 an
 incentive
 system
 for


this
 Innovation
 to
 happen


so
 in
 in
 conclusion
 if
 we
 break
 the


incentive


system
 then
 uh
 we
 will
 be
 uh
 a
 situation


there
 will
 be
 no
 more
 progress
 in
 terms


of
 innovation
 and
 that's
 why
 I
 think


it's
 important
 to
 understand
 the
 full


context
 when
 you
 think
 about
 pricing


when
 you
 think
 about
 pricing
 in
 um
 less


developed
 markets
 and
 the
 ethical


aspects
 around
 that
 do
 you
 take
 a


different
 approach
 than
 other
 farma


companies
 we
 and
 I
 think
 many
 other


Pharma
 companies
 actually
 have


differential
 pricing


yeah
 differential
 pricing
 uh
 means
 that


based
 on
 also
 you
 know
 how
 well
 the


medicine
 works
 on
 one
 hand
 but
 also


what's
 the
 affordability
 you
 try
 to


price
 it
 in
 a
 fair
 way
 and
 that
 means


that
 richer
 countries
 will
 have
 to
 pay
 a


little
 bit
 more
 on
 the
 medicine
 than


poorer
 countries
 and
 I
 think
 this
 has
 to


be
 this
 kind
 of
 contract
 between
 richer


countries
 and
 and
 poorer
 countries
 now


if
 you
 have
 you
 know
 certain


politicians
 that


want
 basically
 the
 best
 price
 in
 the


world
 which
 is
 in
 let's
 say
 a
 country
 in


Africa
 the
 danger
 is
 that
 a
 lot
 of


Pharma
 companies
 will
 say
 well
 if
 I
 have


to
 give
 to
 developed
 countries
 like
 in


Europe
 or
 the
 US
 I
 have
 to
 give
 the
 same


price
 as
 a
 country
 in
 Africa
 I
 cannot


introduce
 it
 in
 Africa
 so
 I
 think
 there


has
 to
 be
 an
 understanding
 that
 we
 have


differential
 pricing
 between
 the


different
 parts
 of
 the
 world
 and
 you


can't
 have
 world
 leaders
 asking
 for
 the


same
 price
 as
 in
 some
 country
 in
 Africa


or
 in
 Latin
 America
 so
 now
 you'll
 um
 uh


five
 year
 hence
 you
 will
 have
 reduced


your
 R&D
 cost
 by
 20%
 you
 have
 reduced


the
 time
 frame
 by


40%
 and
 instead
 of
 1
 out
 of
 10
 you
 know


have
 one
 out
 of
 five
 succeeding
 right


will
 that
 mean
 lower
 costs
 for
 patients


well
 I
 think
 that
 um
 again
 you
 have
 to


look
 at
 the
 total
 impacts
 that
 you
 have


now
 if
 you
 if
 you
 uh
 go
 to
 a
 situation
 a


where
 you
 prevent
 diseases
 from


happening
 then
 maybe
 that
 one
 medicine


costs
 more
 but
 the
 total
 costs
 because


you
 don't
 have
 to
 give
 this
 medicine
 for


the
 next
 10
 15
 20
 years
 goes
 down
 or
 you


have
 less
 treatments
 in
 hospitals


because
 people
 get
 less
 sick
 Etc
 so
 I


think
 you
 have
 to
 look
 at
 uh
 it's
 not
 as


simple
 as
 saying
 you
 know
 each
 each


medicine
 but
 you
 have
 to
 look
 at
 the


total
 impact
 on
 the
 healthcare
 system


and
 it's
 clear
 and
 that's
 our
 commitment


we
 want
 to
 help
 improve
 the
 outcome
 for


patients
 but
 we
 also
 want
 to
 reduce
 the


costs
 in
 the
 healthcare
 system
 and
 we


have
 to
 reduce
 it
 by
 going
 more
 towards


prevention
 by
 going
 towards
 treating


people
 less
 in
 the
 hospital
 but
 more
 in


the
 home


setting
 um
 because
 you
 know
 if
 people


constantly
 go
 to
 the
 hospital
 that
 also


drives
 cost
 in
 the
 system
 um
 plus
 you


know
 people
 who
 are
 sick
 also
 don't
 want


to
 be
 confronted
 with
 their
 disease
 all


the
 time
 so
 they
 they
 actually
 don't


want
 to
 go
 to
 the
 hospital
 so
 I
 think
 if


we
 can
 get
 that
 done
 we
 can
 bring
 down


the
 cost
 in
 the
 Healthcare
 System


overall
 moving
 on
 to
 leadership
 you've


been
 the
 CEO
 of
 rush
 for
 a
 bit
 more
 than


a
 year
 what's
 the
 most
 fun
 part
 being


the
 CEO
 of
 Rush
 yeah
 so
 I've
 been
 with


Ros
 for
 now
 21


years
 and
 uh
 you
 know
 I
 love
 this


company
 I
 love
 the
 culture
 in
 this


company
 and
 I
 love
 the


purpose
 uh
 of
 of
 our
 company
 and
 and
 uh


you
 know
 if
 you
 can
 see
 the
 kind
 of


innovation
 that
 we're
 working


on
 it's
 just
 uh
 amazing
 and
 you
 know
 you


can
 see
 the


impact
 that
 you
 can
 have
 on
 patients


lives
 I
 mean
 when
 when
 I
 talk
 to
 uh
 some


of
 our
 uh
 researchers
 and
 medical


doctors
 you
 know
 when
 we
 run
 a
 clinical


trial
 that
 sometimes
 takes
 3
 to
 four


years
 in
 the
 phase
 three
 and
 then
 the


day
 when
 they
 see
 the
 results
 and
 they


see
 that
 the
 results
 are
 positive
 and


what
 impact
 they
 can
 have
 on
 patients


lives
 you
 you
 have
 people
 that
 have


tears
 in
 their
 eyes
 because
 they
 see
 the


kind
 of
 impact
 they
 they
 can
 have
 and
 um


so
 I
 think
 that's
 just
 amazing
 um
 you


know
 to
 work
 on
 something
 like
 this
 the


second
 piece
 is
 and
 maybe
 that's
 also


why
 I've
 been
 with
 the
 company
 for
 21


years
 I
 really
 care
 about
 the
 people
 in


our


organization
 and
 for
 me
 it's
 fun


to
 work
 with
 these
 people
 it's
 fun
 also


you
 know
 to
 develop
 leaders
 to
 see
 them


grow
 I
 think
 that's
 also
 something
 that


is
 very
 fulfilling
 for
 me
 so
 those
 are


things
 that
 I
 really
 enjoy
 and
 that
 I


can
 do
 even
 more
 in
 the
 role
 that
 I'm
 in


right
 now
 what's
 the
 biggest
 difference


between
 you
 and
 S
 Schwan
 who
 was
 your


predecessor
 so
 I've
 been
 working
 closely


with
 him
 over
 the
 last
 uh
 four
 or
 five


years
 when
 I
 was
 Diagnostics
 CEO
 I
 would


say
 two
 things
 that
 I
 see
 one
 is
 he


studied
 finance
 and
 law
 and
 I'm
 a


scientist
 so
 you
 got
 a
 PhD
 in
 biology
 I


have
 a
 PhD
 in
 molecular
 biology
 and
 did


uh
 research
 uh
 in
 the
 area
 of
 cancer


oncology
 uh
 I
 think
 that's
 one
 element


the
 second
 piece
 is
 um
 you
 know
 if
 you


look
 at
 where
 I
 lived
 and
 grew
 up
 in
 my


life
 um
 I
 was
 born
 in
 Germany
 but
 with


the
 age
 of
 nine
 my
 parents
 moved
 to


Singapore
 to
 Asia
 and
 and
 this
 is
 where


I
 grew
 up
 I
 lived
 in
 total
 of
 12
 Years


in
 Asia
 I
 went
 to
 the
 US
 to
 study
 and


and
 work
 in
 the
 US
 so
 it's
 something


that
 I
 really
 enjoyed
 working
 in
 so
 many


different
 cultures
 and
 I
 would
 say
 those


are
 two
 elements
 uh
 that
 are
 probably
 a


bit
 different
 what
 did
 you
 take
 away


from
 your
 upbringing
 in
 Asia
 well
 first


of
 all
 uh
 Singapore
 is
 at
 the
 Equator
 so


I
 I
 loved
 the
 warm
 weather
 and
 I
 loved


the
 food
 the
 chili
 crab


for
 example
 uh
 dim
 Zam
 you
 know
 you
 name


it
 uh
 I
 I
 just
 love
 uh
 Asian
 food
 to
 the


point
 where
 you
 know
 every
 time
 we
 go


eat
 in


Switzerland
 I
 always
 say
 let's
 go
 eat


Asian
 and
 my
 family
 is
 uh
 not
 so
 happy


about
 that
 because
 I
 would
 go
 eat
 Asian


every
 day
 no
 but
 beyond
 that
 I
 think
 you


can
 learn
 something
 from
 every
 every


culture
 um
 clearly
 in
 Singapore
 the
 work


attitude
 right
 I
 mean
 they
 have
 a
 very


strong
 work
 attitude
 if
 you
 look
 at
 the


us
 uh
 the
 approach
 to
 Innovation
 I
 think


the
 culture
 is
 more
 extroverted
 than


some
 of
 the
 Asian
 cultures
 and
 I
 think


it
 helps
 me
 in
 the
 role
 that
 I'm
 in


because
 uh
 I
 work
 with
 people
 from
 all


kind
 of
 different
 parts
 of
 the
 world
 and


uh
 what
 what
 I've
 always
 seen
 and
 what


I've
 realized
 is
 you
 know
 in
 certain


culture
 like
 the
 German
 or
 the
 Dutch


culture
 people
 tell
 you
 directly
 what


the
 problem
 is
 in
 other
 cultures


sometimes
 you
 have
 to
 read
 a
 little
 bit


between
 the
 lines
 so
 to
 to
 I
 think
 one


of
 the
 things
 is
 this
 cultural


sensitivity
 to
 really
 understand
 uh
 the


other
 side
 that
 you're
 talking
 to
 and
 uh


I
 think
 it
 just
 helps
 me
 really
 working


with
 uh
 the
 different
 regions
 in
 the


world
 people
 with
 uh
 phds
 are
 often
 less


uh
 have
 less
 risk
 appetite
 are
 you
 where


are
 you
 on
 the
 risk-seeking
 scale
 I
 I


haven't
 heard
 that
 theory
 but
 I
 would


say
 I
 think


without
 taking
 risks
 you
 cannot
 be


successful
 you
 know
 in
 anything
 in
 life


to
 be
 successful
 you
 have
 to
 step
 out
 of


your
 comfort
 zone
 um
 and
 how
 do
 you
 make


decisions
 are
 you
 are
 you
 an
 intuitive


decision
 maker
 or
 are
 you
 basing


everything
 on
 analysis
 again
 you


probably
 have
 to
 have
 a
 balance
 um
 I


like
 to
 understand
 the
 data
 and
 I
 like


to
 understand
 the
 problem
 I
 think
 often


times
 um
 when
 people
 don't
 try
 to
 fully


understand
 what
 the
 problem
 is
 they
 they


come
 up
 with
 solutions
 that
 don't
 work


um
 you
 can
 only
 get
 to
 the
 right


Solutions
 and
 and
 topics
 that
 make
 life


of
 everyone
 easier
 in
 a
 company
 if
 if


you
 first
 fully
 understand
 the
 problem


and
 then
 what
 for
 me
 is
 important
 is
 to


have
 sparring
 partners
 to
 understand
 the


different
 perspectives
 uh
 on
 the
 data
 um


and
 uh
 I
 think
 that's
 important
 to
 come


to
 decision
 um
 because
 uh
 you
 may
 have


one
 perspective
 and
 other
 people
 have


different
 perspectives
 so
 to
 really


fully
 understand
 that
 but
 at
 the
 same


time
 you
 have
 to
 also
 get
 to
 a
 point


where
 you
 then
 quickly
 make
 a
 decision


you
 know
 often
 times
 people
 just
 spin


along
 on
 the
 data
 and
 then
 never
 get
 to


the
 decision
 now
 one
 of
 the
 things
 I


often
 do
 also
 is
 I
 talk
 to
 the
 different


experts
 now
 it
 depends
 is
 it
 decision
 I


have
 to
 make
 or
 is
 it
 someone
 else
 in


the
 organization
 and
 has
 to
 make
 a


decision
 but
 if
 it's
 my
 decision
 to
 make


I
 try
 to
 talk
 to
 different
 experts
 and
 I


try
 to
 understand
 you
 know
 does
 their


View
 and
 their
 decision
 conform
 with


what
 I
 believe
 if
 that
 happens
 I
 think


that
 often
 times
 these
 are
 probably
 the


easier
 decisions
 right
 if
 I
 see
 that


everyone
 else
 is
 a
 different
 opinion
 oh


then
 I
 must
 be


wrong
 and
 but
 often
 times
 it's
 something


in
 between
 you
 know
 where
 you
 have


different
 then
 I
 know
 it's
 a
 difficult


problem
 right
 when
 you
 know
 you
 have


very
 different
 opinions
 and
 then


at
 one
 point
 in
 time
 you
 have
 to
 make
 uh


B
 based
 on
 the
 facts
 based
 on
 um
 the


information
 that
 you
 have
 you
 have
 to


make
 the
 decision
 um
 and
 you
 have
 to
 go


forward
 and
 you
 know
 often
 times
 you


know
 you
 have
 to
 hope
 that
 decision
 is


right
 but
 there
 may
 be
 times
 when
 your


decision
 is
 wrong
 some
 people
 you
 can


talk
 to
 are
 CEOs
 in
 other
 companies
 who


have
 been
 educated
 at
 rush
 you
 have
 Co
 B


Marine
 uh
 buyer


astroica
 uh
 now
 why
 has
 Ros
 been
 so


successful
 in
 in
 developing
 leaders
 I


think
 on
 the
 one
 hand
 it's
 clearly
 a


sign
 that
 we
 have
 a
 good
 culture
 and
 uh


on
 the
 other
 hand
 it
 shows
 um
 that
 we


have
 been
 very
 good
 in
 hiring
 great


people
 and
 developing
 those
 people
 so
 I


think
 this
 uh
 ability
 to
 develop
 people


and
 have
 a
 strong
 focus
 on
 people
 is


what
 drives
 a
 lot
 of
 uh
 you
 know
 uh


Innovation
 and
 also
 good
 decision-


making
 because
 at
 the
 end
 Innovation
 is


also
 based
 on
 good
 decision-
 making
 so


you
 know
 investing
 in
 people
 I
 think
 is


something
 very
 critical
 and
 it's
 not


something
 that
 we've
 just
 done
 over
 the


last
 couple
 of
 years
 it's
 something
 that


we've
 done
 for
 a
 very
 very
 long
 period


of
 time
 and
 that's
 how
 you
 build
 a


strong
 base
 of
 strong
 talents
 in
 the


organization
 you
 said
 you'd
 been
 at
 uh


Raj
 for
 21
 years
 and
 if
 we
 take
 the
 last


three
 CEOs
 they
 have
 been
 there
 for
 an


average
 of
 15
 years
 as
 CEOs
 now
 you
 look


at
 the
 S&P
 500
 the
 average
 time
 is
 5


years
 so
 uh
 incredible
 incredible
 length


of
 of
 service
 what
 are
 the
 what
 are
 the


kind
 of
 the
 pros
 and
 cons
 of
 that
 so
 if


you
 look
 at
 uh
 the
 fact
 that
 we
 are
 127


years
 old
 it
 shows
 you
 you
 know
 that


we've
 been
 quite
 successful
 uh
 with
 this


kind
 of
 uh
 model
 um
 what
 the
 benefit
 is


is
 clearly
 um
 that
 given
 the
 fact
 that


we
 have
 a
 very
 long
 cycle
 of
 uh


development
 of
 you
 know
 13
 years
 on


average
 you
 also
 have
 to
 have
 a
 long


breath
 you
 can't
 uh
 change
 direction


every
 one
 two
 or
 three
 years
 because


actually
 then
 nothing
 will
 happen
 uh
 in


this
 industry
 um
 you
 have
 to
 have


determination
 you
 have
 to
 have
 stamina


you
 have
 to
 have
 resilience
 because
 you


will
 have
 Z
 bags
 um
 but
 at
 the
 same
 time


you
 need
 to
 be
 open
 to
 change
 um
 and
 uh


Drive
 change
 forward
 and
 uh
 be
 also
 very


performance
 oriented
 um
 so
 clearly
 The


Long
 View
 is
 important
 but
 also
 during


this
 Long
 View
 you
 have
 to
 deliver
 and


uh
 you
 know
 if
 you
 look
 at
 just
 the
 last


quarters
 where
 we
 had
 very
 significant


growth
 of
 9%
 each
 quarter
 I
 think
 we


also
 deliver
 in
 the
 short
 term
 it's
 not


only
 just
 longterm
 and
 weights
 we
 will


deliver
 in
 the
 long
 term
 no
 for
 us
 it's


very
 clear
 that
 you
 also
 have
 to
 deliver


on
 the
 short
 term
 what
 are
 the


advantages
 of
 having
 uh
 family
 backing


so
 the
 Raj
 family
 and
 the
 the
 Hoffman


Family
 have
 the
 majority
 of
 the
 Voting


Rights
 in
 the
 company
 what
 are
 the
 what


kind
 of
 advantages
 does
 that
 give
 you


yeah
 this
 long-term
 thinking
 you
 know
 if


you
 um
 constantly
 change
 direction
 in
 a


company
 first
 of
 all
 of
 this
 size
 I
 mean


to
 change
 direction
 of
 a
 company
 of
 more


than
 100,000
 people
 also
 takes
 a
 bit
 of


time
 um
 uh
 and
 then
 you
 look
 at
 the
 long


cycle
 of
 of
 innovation
 that
 we
 need
 so


this
 uh
 long-term
 thinking
 I
 think
 is
 is


very
 critical
 a
 part
 again
 with
 the
 in


short-term
 performance
 and
 uh
 the


structure
 we
 have
 is
 really
 beneficial


for
 that
 some
 personal
 things
 um
 Thomas


being
 a
 head
 of
 the
 uh
 an
 incredible


farmer
 company
 do
 you
 live
 a
 very


healthy
 life
 well
 uh
 I
 try
 uh
 for
 sure


um
 of
 course
 uh
 I
 think
 it's
 also


important
 because
 a
 job
 like
 this
 is


quite
 intense
 in
 terms
 of
 the
 amount
 of


time
 that
 you
 work
 etc
 so
 uh
 being
 in
 a


healthy
 uh
 space
 is
 critical
 to
 actually


deliver
 performance
 what
 do
 you
 eat
 for


instance
 uh
 extremely
 healthy
 you
 know


um
 right
 now
 over
 the
 last
 couple
 of


years
 um
 so
 at
 home
 we
 hardly
 eat
 any


carbohydrates
 uh
 we
 eat
 quite
 a
 little


amount
 of
 meat
 Etc
 so
 uh
 but
 I
 have
 to


admit
 it's
 more
 my
 wife
 than
 myself
 so


you
 know
 sometimes
 when
 I
 I'm
 on
 a


business
 trip
 I
 can
 escape
 that
 a
 little


bit
 but
 when
 I'm
 at
 home
 I
 can't
 Sports


I
 love
 sports
 uh
 but
 uh
 you
 know
 age
 is


catching
 up
 with
 me
 you
 know
 I
 I
 love


soccer
 I
 I
 used
 to
 play
 when
 I
 was
 a


child
 and
 I
 love
 squash
 squash
 uh
 I


guess
 that
 has
 to
 do
 with
 the
 fact
 that


I
 grew
 up
 in
 Asia
 and
 squash
 is
 a
 big


thing
 in
 Asia
 and
 if
 you
 look
 at
 the


amount
 of
 running
 and
 calories
 that
 you


burn
 actually
 squash
 is
 one
 of
 the
 best


sports
 you
 can
 do
 I
 don't
 think
 you
 can


say
 that
 age
 is
 catching
 up
 you
 you're


only
 49
 it's
 super
 young
 yeah
 but
 you


know
 I
 see
 it
 I
 see
 it
 when
 I
 play


soccer
 now
 with
 my
 son
 and
 and
 other


friends
 uh
 10
 years
 ago
 you
 know
 I
 could


keep
 up
 right
 now
 I
 have
 to
 say
 you
 know


playing
 with
 30y
 olds
 becomes
 quite


difficult
 for
 me
 you
 know
 sometimes
 my


head
 knows
 what
 to
 do
 but
 my
 body


doesn't
 uh
 catch
 up
 with
 my
 head
 so
 you


have
 a
 slogan
 in
 rash
 um
 that
 you
 cure


medicines
 so
 that
 people
 can
 spend
 more


time
 with
 the
 people
 they
 love
 how
 do


you
 spend
 uh
 your
 time
 with
 the
 people


you
 love
 yeah
 so
 basically
 90%
 plus
 of


my
 free
 time
 I
 spend
 uh
 with
 my
 family


and
 with
 my
 three
 kids
 um
 the
 kids
 you


know
 we
 go
 hiking
 we
 go
 do
 Sports
 uh
 uh


also
 enjoy
 going
 on
 holiday
 uh
 with
 them


um
 we
 go
 once
 a
 year
 we
 go
 um
 it's


mostly
 Easter
 we
 go
 somewhere
 into
 the


sun
 because
 you
 know
 after
 Long
 Winter


we
 need
 to
 recover
 and
 really
 get
 energy


from
 the
 Sun
 so
 we
 do
 that
 uh
 and
 and
 I


really
 like
 that
 I
 guess
 it
 also
 has
 to


do
 with
 the
 fact
 that
 I
 grew
 up
 at
 the


equator
 that
 I
 really
 long
 for
 uh
 warmth


and
 and
 Sun
 after
 Long
 Winter
 what
 do


you
 read
 um
 so
 being
 being
 a
 a
 science


geek
 I
 guess
 uh
 I
 love
 reading
 uh
 Lots


on
 science
 um
 you
 know
 actually
 still


read
 uh


Publications
 uh
 because
 I
 just
 find
 it


very
 fascinating
 um
 and
 it
 keeps
 me
 up


to
 speed
 on
 what's
 happening
 on
 the


science
 side
 um
 that's
 why
 I
 also
 love


having
 conversations
 with
 Scientists


because
 uh
 I
 learned
 something
 uh
 all


the
 time
 um
 so
 I
 like
 that
 uh
 you
 know
 I


spend
 a
 lot
 of
 time
 you
 know
 reading
 up


on
 uh
 you
 know
 politics
 uh
 also
 history


things
 like
 that
 I
 really
 enjoy
 reading


those
 things
 what
 is
 your
 advice
 to


young
 people
 yeah
 so
 having
 three
 kids


uh
 I
 guess
 I
 have
 to
 give
 uh
 advice


quite
 a
 lot
 uh
 to
 my
 children
 um
 you


know
 one
 of
 the
 things
 that
 that
 I
 tell


them
 is
 uh
 you
 know
 what
 happens
 in


social
 media
 is
 not
 the
 real
 world
 the


real
 world
 can
 actually
 be
 quite


exciting
 and
 people
 should
 spend
 more


time
 in
 in
 the
 real
 world
 um
 and
 you


know
 oftentimes
 what
 you
 see
 in
 social


media
 is
 just
 also
 not
 completely
 true


the
 other
 thing
 I
 tell
 them
 is
 uh
 you


know
 there
 are
 no
 shortcuts
 in
 life
 if


you
 want
 to
 achieve
 something
 the
 only


way
 to
 achieve
 it
 is
 through
 hard
 work


there
 is
 no
 other
 way
 than
 to
 achieve


things
 than
 other
 than
 through
 hard
 work


and
 uh
 and
 I
 think
 that's
 important
 for


people
 uh
 and
 the
 younger
 Generations


also
 to
 realize
 well
 sounds
 like
 you


work
 really
 really
 hard
 big
 thanks
 for


uh
 for
 being
 on
 the
 podcast
 big
 thanks


for
 curing
 all
 the
 diseases
 and
 uh


please
 uh
 keep
 up
 all
 the
 good
 work
 in


bastel
 thank
 you
 very
 much
 for
 the


conversation
