- This is the world's largest 3D metal printer.
It was built by Relativity Space,
a startup that aims to
print an entire rocket,
including fuel tanks and rocket
engines, in just 60 days.
I'm like looking inside
a 3D printed rocket
that is actually gonna go to space.
This giant hunk of
metal, it's unbelievable.

Offering you the chance
to win a trip to space.
More about that at the end of the show.
- There's a lot of UV
coming off the welds,
you can film it, but
don't look directly at it.
You get sunburned fast, so
it's like you're suiting up
to go in a volcano.
All right, we're gonna
go in to the 3D printer,
and see how it works.
All right, so, yep, just hold this up.
Don't look at it.
We are in the printer.
- I can see it over there.
- If we walk around here,
we can get up close.
(machinery whirring)
(machinery beating)
So that's the wire melt team,
and the print head moving around.
So that's the plasma discharge,
and it's hard to tell,
but it's doing things every
couple of milliseconds,
it's actually changing
the electric wave form,
which is how it's controlling
the deposition so well.
- Do you know the temperature of it?
Like, is it just above melt temp?
- It's just above melting for aluminum.
Yeah, probably a few
hundred degrees above.
- The melting point of aluminum
is 660 degrees Celsius.
So the whole body of the rocket
is effectively melted together
one tiny bit at a time.
- All the raw metal
for the whole rocket
that's printed is this.
It's a, you know, we kind of joke
it's like Charlotte's web.
Like a spider silk, but
this is an aluminum alloy
that's on a wire spool.
We actually print about
10 inches a second.
So this wire is really going super fast,
and then the combination of
lasers and plasma arc discharge
are working to melt both of
them together at the same time.
- So where does the wire come out?
- So it's right there, and
then the electric arc discharge
happens right at the tip of the wire too.
- This is a camera.
- Yeah, that's a camera.
- But why would you want
to 3D print a rocket?
Is it just because we can?
It's funny to me that
you had this experience with
3D printing where you're like,
oh, 3D printing is clearly the future.
Whereas, I feel like a
lot of people's experience
with 3D printers as mine has been,
it's like incredibly frustrating.
I feel like 3D printing is that thing
that seems like it should be great,
and yet whenever I try it,
I don't get a result that I'm happy with.
- Yeah, I know.
I can tell you, we had
plenty of experiences
the first couple of years,
where we ended up with a pile
of metal and it didn't work.
- But there are actually good
reasons to 3D print a rocket.
A rocket has four major systems.
Payload, guidance,
structural, and propulsion.
The bulk of the rocket is made
up of the propulsion system,
including the propellant
tanks and the rocket engines.
Cryogenic fuel and oxidizer are pumped
through an injector into
the combustion chamber
where they react, releasing
an enormous amount of heat.
This causes the exhaust gases to expand,
exiting the rocket
nozzle at high velocity.
The faster this exit velocity
and the higher the mass flow rate,
the more thrust that can be generated.
So rockets are huge, complex
engineering projects,
which up to this point have
largely been manufactured
using traditional techniques.
That means before you
can build the rocket,
you first have to build the
tools to build the rocket.
For example, to build
NASA's next huge rocket,
the Space Launch System or SLS,
they first needed to construct
the vertical assembly center or VAC.
This is a 170 foot tall
tool for welding together
the domes, rings, and barrel sections
of the rocket's fuel tanks.
- They built that like an aerospace thing,
and they've had to spin up all
these custom tooling designs
and validate that those work
before actually starts
building the rocket.
And they finally got one
being assembled on the pad
after 11 years of development.
In contrast, Relativity Space the company,
is just five and a half years old,
and they plan to launch
their first rocket this year.
- I see this as a like
old engineering style
versus Silicon valley
style of build something,
figure out what's wrong with it,
and build another thing
that fixes those, right?
The differences, I've always
done that with software.
These guys are doing it
with aerospace hardware.
- So this is the actual
rocket tank structure
of what we're gonna be launching to orbit
at the end of this year.
So this actual thing
is launching to space.
- That will go to space?
- This will go to space,
and it's by far the largest
3D printed product really,
of any type ever made that's gonna fly.
I think maybe of any type in the world.
- But it still looks 3D printed.
Like you can still see the layers.
- Yeah, yeah, you can
still see the layers.
It only adds an extra
5 to 10% of the mass
with the roughness.
When you actually cross
section the material
and look at the machine parts of it,
it looks like normal metal.
Like actually at this end,
this is printed as well.
We just machine it afterwards.
So it looks like normal
metal in the joint sections.
- Does the surface roughness
cause any aerodynamic problems?
- No, none at all.
Yeah, it's actually the
exact same aerodynamically.
This whole thing, we simulate
the print before printing,
because if you just printed,
you know, the 3D file
and said press print, you
would end up with a printer
that's warped and like material
falling all over the place
that wouldn't actually work.
So we've invented software
that reverse warps
the whole part before printing it.
So the robots are actually doing this
really wobbly, weird shape,
but then it's actually perfectly straight
within a human hair at the entire length.
- As it cools
- As it cools.
The warpy thing turns into the...
- And then we simulate all of that.
So it's a big computational solver
that simulates it, and there's
many, many other problems
we've had to solve to actually get
printing a rocket to work.
But it's all these little pieces
over the last couple of years,
and we've really started
to hit some breakthroughs,
which is also why now
you see a whole rocket.
Yeah, you can step up here actually
if you want.
- Can I?
- Yeah, yeah.
(man laughs)
- Hello.
I'm like looking inside
a 3D printed rocket
that is actually gonna go to space.
- Yes.
- This giant hunk of metal.
It's unbelievable.
There's like rings inside.
- Those are printed in stiffeners.
And so those help prevent the rocket
from buckling and crumpling.
So if you had a Coke can,
and didn't pop the tab,
if you try to step on it,
it's almost impossible
because there's pressure inside
that keeps it from buckling.
But then when you pop the tab,
there's no pressure and you
can crunch it super easy.
It's not hard at all.
So rockets are the same.
The 50 PSI of pressure,
which is about the same as a car tire,
keeps it inflated and
keeps it from crumpling,
but then the stiffeners
also help keep it rigid.
- Yeah, so believe it or not,
a rocket tank is thinner
versus its diameter
than a Coke can.
So when you look at a Coke can,
you know how big it is
and then how thin it is,
a rocket tank is actually
thinner than that.
So yeah, it's pretty light.
It has to be very light.
- Sure.
Aerospace companies started
using metal 3D printing
over a decade ago to
construct small complex parts.
For example, the injector.
- That is the most important
part of any rocket engine,
where you basically gotta
take the liquid propellant,
and turn it into a fine mist
that mixes really rapidly.
And those have actually been transitioned
to 3D printing all over the industry.
- Traditionally, something like this,
it's a bucket engine injector.
So it mixes liquid oxygen
and liquid methane propellants together,
and this is what actually
produces all the fire and flame
that is in a rocket engine.
Traditionally, it would be over
a thousand individual pieces
and it would take nine months,
but here we're 3D printing
the whole thing in one piece.
It takes two weeks and
it costs 10 times less.
- One of the big benefits of 3D printing
is reducing the number of parts.
Have you ever thought about
how inside a rockets combustion
chamber, it gets really hot.
Up to 3,500 Kelvin.
That's hot enough to
melt virtually any metal.
So how do the combustion chamber
and rocket nozzle not melt?
The answer is they're cooled by passing
the cryogenic propellants over them.
- On the Space Shuttle main engines.
I love to talk about them
because inside those engines,
it's hot enough to boil iron.
On the outside, you can freeze stuff
to the exterior of this
because you're running liquid
hydrogen through these things.
But to make those,
you basically had to take
thousands of very small pipes,
and then you would form them
into the shape of the combustion
chamber and the nozzle,
and then you would braze
weld them together.
And this was a ridiculously
labor-intensive task.
You would have 1,080 individual
pipes running up the side,
all having to be weld together
to make the combustion
chamber and the nozzle
on the Space Shuttle engines.
So you can actually 3D print these things.
- This is a rocket
nozzle being 3D printed,
and you can see the channels
for the cryogenic propellants
being printed right into the single part
instead of having to add a
thousand pipes on the outside.
Smaller parts like these
are typically 3D printed
using metal powder and lasers.
- So you can see the cooling channels
are all being built as the one piece.
So this is a nozzle.
It really just lays down a layer of powder
that's about a 20th the
thickness of a human hair.
So it's really, really fine layers
just over and over and
over and over relentlessly
for probably about a week or so,
and then out comes the rocket nozzle
all printed as one piece.
It's way cheaper than traditional.
And this has four lasers going at once.
- That's amazing.
- I get asked a lot, well,
aren't 3D printed metals
not very strong?
Or how can it actually work?
But the printed materials are stronger
than they would be built
traditionally, actually.
It's counterintuitive.
- It is.
- Because we develop our
own custom alloys in house.
So we have a whole material science team
just developing our own
alloys for 3D printing,
and the fact that it melts
and then cools and solidifies
very, very quickly, you can take advantage
of that physics principle
to get really strong alloys.
- Another major benefit of 3D printing
is that it allows for rapid iteration.
You can build a part quickly, test it,
and then redesign rapidly and print again.
- So this is a version of the engine
that's about three
years old at this point,
but what's amazing is
when you actually look
at the engine design today,
it looks entirely different than this.
So each version we build, we
can iterate and make better.
So that's the other, you know,
when we say software driven manufacturing,
that's really what it is.
Since you don't have fixed tooling,
all the part geometries
are just controlled
via the CAD model, and then
the printers just print
direct from file essentially.
It means you can actually change
the design extremely fast.
So building a whole engine
only takes us about a month.
So then a month later, you
can do a better version,
and a month later, a
better version than that.
So this particular one will actually be,
I believe one of the first flight engines
that's actually launching to
orbit on our first rocket.
- So this tubing, not 3D printed, right?
- Not today.
- Okay.
- In the future versions,
we're actually integrating that
into the printed housings.
And we're gonna have a way
that that's all printed too.
- Perhaps the biggest impact
of the 3D printing approach
could be to totally transform
what a rocket looks like.
With 3D printing,
engineers can build parts
that would be impractical or impossible
with traditional techniques.
Smooth, curvy, bio-inspired designs
are just as easy to print
as ordinary structures.
- This is actually part of
our next rocket, Terran R.
So it's even larger.
- This is like the base of a tank.
- Yeah. Yeah.
So it's gonna go out.
It's almost done printing.
It's gonna go out about to here.
So it's 16 foot diameter,
but it's almost like a shell.
- I was gonna say like,
this reminds me of suddenly
we're in The Little Mermaid or something.
- Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, it's just for stiffness though.
- It's not that you plan
to make it bio inspired.
It's like that structure is
actually the optimal structure.
- Yeah, yeah.
- We're actually designing
many features in the rocket
that could not be manufactured
unless it was 3D printed,
which is one of the secret sauces
of why you had to build a
whole company around it,
is because our rocket actually looks
entirely different 3D printed
than it does traditionally.
Like in my mind, it's been more akin
to like gas internal
combustion engine to electric.
You know, really, people
are trying to put batteries
and electric motors into
existing products for decades.
Like everyone knew electric
vehicles were the future,
but Nissan and Ford had
really not compelling products
for a long time.
It wasn't until a company
came along called Tesla
that decided, well, actually
the shift to electrification
means the batteries, the
electric motors, the factory,
the design of the product,
how we're actually
gonna scale the company,
the supply chain, all of it's different
because of electrification.
I mean, that's in some ways,
the dirty secret of electric cars
and why they're able to
be automated in production
because the part count is so much lower.
So for a fully 3D printed rocket,
we have a hundred times fewer parts,
which is what we're guiding to.
There's no fixed tooling
in our factory at all.
Unlike the rest of aerospace
that's still really, 60 years later,
even since Apollo building products
one at a time by hand
with hundreds of thousands
to millions of individual parts.
And no one's really changed that paradigm
of how an aerospace factory
actually fundamentally works.
- Yeah, this is the new
fully 3D printed rocket.
So yeah, we'll have dragon
fly wing type structures
and we're building it so.
But that's the first one,
and then that's that one for scale.
So yeah, it is definitely bigger.
Yeah, so our rocket is named
Terran One and Terran R,
and then our 3D printer's Stargate.
So all the things here at Relativity
are named after StarCraft.
So yeah, of course, the Stargate printer
was with the Protoss
used to warp in spaceships.
And so, that's what's warping
in spaceships at Relativity.
We have a system in our
avionics called the Pylon
that we have to build a lot of.
So we always joke, we have to
construct additional Pylons.
Most people don't know how rockets
are built traditionally at all anyway.
And I think a lot of
people assume it's rockets,
so shouldn't it be already very advanced
and robots everywhere and you know,
Elon's got Space X and Tesla,
so doesn't Space X just look like Tesla
with all these robots and automation?
But that's really not true.
I mean, aerospace hasn't
adopted automation at all.
- One of the issues, right,
is that you're not making
a lot of rockets?
- Right?
- So there's no incentive
to like figure out
how to tool up a factory
to like pump out rockets
like a hundred a day or something.
- Exactly.
- Like you would for cars.
- Exactly, you're not making a lot.
Even with commercial aircraft,
you're not making nearly as many
and there's orders of magnitude
more parts and complexity.
A commercial aircraft has
several million individual parts.
So to have robots assemble
several million parts
when an automobile has tens of thousands
is completely different.
It's a much harder problem.
So that's where 3D printing
is automation for aerospace
because you're not assembling
all those parts with robots
like you would with a car,
you're assembling them in the 3D file
and then the printer just
prints them assembled.
- The plan for Relativity Space,
is it low-earth orbit or is
it going further than that?
- So for Terran One, it's
mostly low earth orbit.
The first rocket.
Terran R can actually send
payload to the moon to Mars.
I mean, it's pretty, pretty huge.
I founded the company
because I really thought
that there needed to be, you know,
dozens of hundreds of
companies making Mars happen.
We're focused on taking
this 3D printing tech
and what we call the
factory of the future,
and one day shrinking it down to something
we'll actually launch to Mars
and build an industrial base.
So that's the long-term
vision of the company,
is build the industrial base on Mars.
In many ways, this factory
is just a prototype.
It's still far smaller
than a traditional factory.
It's far lighter.
And I think it's inevitable
someone has to build this company.
- I don't know that in 10, 20 years
that you will be 3D printing
rockets all the time.
Because if you are flying lots of rockets,
it becomes cheaper to have
a dedicated machine for it.
I do think that as a
company, they are well-placed
because even if Terran fails
to capitalize on the market,
even if nobody wants to
use it as a launch vehicle,
they are clearly now the world experts
on 3D printing rocket hardware,
'cause they've done everything, right?
They've tried to apply
3D printing to places
where a lot of people dismissed it.
So I think they're sort
of secure as a company.
Whether we will see rockets
being 3D printed all the time?
That's a good question.
- There've been a lot of talk recently
about billionaires going to space.
- Yeah.
- Will a 3D printed
rocket make it possible
and a lot cheaper for me to go to space?
- Yes, I mean, certainly what we're doing
is lowering the cost.
So our rockets are
costing about five times
to, you know, I believe we can get to 10
or even a hundred times cheaper
with a fully reusable rocket
than what we have today.
So it can definitely
climb down the cost curve.
But I also think, you know, going to Mars
and the first people that are going,
it really is about what is the
point of being a human being?
Like for me, why go to Mars?
If we were having this conversation
and a million people were
living on another planet,
I think it would expand the possibilities
of human experience and what
it means to be a person.
Like we'd have YouTube channels on Mars
and people sharing what life
on Mars is like versus earth.
And there'd be long distance
Amelie, like love stories.
Like I think there's
just a lot of richness
in what human culture
and society can be about.
Yes, I think there's criticism about,
you know, billionaires going to space
and I don't agree with.
You know, all of the projects
need to actually add up to
some vision that is meaningful.
I think that's really important.
But I do think going to
Mars is really just about,
you know, we've lived
for generations on earth,
so what's it all about like,
why do we want to keep
improving and getting better
and furthering society on earth?
So for me, it's pretty existential.
What it means to be a human being.
