 The answer begins with a pot
 and a hardwood fire.
 This is
 a 1,500-year-old recipe.
 Take some hardwood
 and burn it,
 not for the heat,
 but for the ash.
 Put the ash in a pot
 and add water.
 Now, there are a lot
 of different chemical
 compounds in there,
 but the one I'm after is
 water soluble,
 so it dissolves.
 Strain out the solids
 and you'll find
 the solution is slippery.
 Put it in a pan
 and let the water evaporate
 in the sun,
 and what you're left with is
 this crystalline substance.
All that work for this.
 It is one of the most
 important chemicals
 people have been making
 for centuries,
 and it's called potash
 because that is
 exactly where it comes from.
 In 1807,
 British scientist Humphry Davy
 got some damp potash
 and put electrodes into it.
 Then he connected them
 up to a battery,
 and what he observed was
 the formation
 of tiny metal globules,
 and as they burst
 through the crust
 of the potash,
 they spontaneously
 caught fire.
 Davy had discovered
 a new element,
 so naturally, he named it
 pot-ash-ium.
 Potassium.
Yes, that is where the name
of the element comes from.
It comes from the potash.
 ♪ ♪
When you hear
the word potassium,
many people think
of bananas or Gatorade,
and that's true,
these foods are
good sources of potassium,
but it's not pure potassium.
This is a piece
of pure elemental potassium.
It's a metal,
but I can squish it
with my fingers.
And this had to be created
in a lab
because it is so reactive,
it'll react with anything.
This piece was kept submerged
under oil
so it doesn't react
with the water
in the atmosphere.
It's an incredibly
reactive substance,
and to demonstrate that,
I'm going to put a piece of it
in this water.
 I'm gonna weight it down
 so the potassium doesn't
 just sit on the top
 but actually will sink down
 to the bottom.
Three, two, one.

- Oh, yeah!
- ( pops )
- Oh!

- Oh, yeah!
I did not expect it to do that.
 That is awesome!
Are you kidding me?
Yeah!
 Of course,
 I've seen this demo before,
 but never with
 such a huge explosion.
( in slow-motion )
Oh, yeah!
 I think the key was
 weighing it down
 so it didn't just spark
 on the surface.
 Potassium reacts with water,
 forming potassium hydroxide
 and hydrogen gas.
 It also releases
 a lot of heat,
 so when the hot hydrogen gas
 hits the atmosphere,
 it spontaneously combusts.
 Potassium is so reactive
 because it has one electron
 in its outermost shell,
 which is easily removed,
 and that's why we never find
 metallic potassium in nature.
Now, the word potash originally
referred to that stuff
which, chemically,
is potassium carbonate,
but potash has become
a catchall term
referring to lots of
potassium-containing compounds.
So the potash
that Davy was using
was actually
potassium hydroxide.
And this is not the last time
we're gonna hear from Davy.
 But why is potash
 so important to people?
I'm on the trail of Potash.
Look at that.
 ♪ ♪
All right.
This is bacon grease.

( laughs )
I'm getting
a real lather going here.
That's not bad.
Take a look at that.
The potash soap
actually worked.
 Potash was also used
 to make glass.
 Glass is mostly sand,
 silicon dioxide,
 but add some potash
 and you reduce
 the melting point.
 This makes glass less brittle
 and easier to work with
 in early furnaces.

That was awesome!
 Saltpeter made from potash

 and the American revolution.
( slow-motion explosion )
 Potash was by far
 the main chemical product
 of the early American colonies
 and a substantial source
 of revenue.
 By 1788,
 there were 250 potash works
 in the state
 of Massachusetts alone,
 places where wood was burned
 on a massive scale
 just for its ash.
 In 1790, the newly-independent
 U.S. government issued
 its first ever patent.
 It was for an improved process
 for making potash.
 The patent office has now
 issued over 10 million patents
 and the literal first one is
 for potash.
 It was signed
 on July 31, 1790.
 Look closely at the signature.
 It's signed by none other than
 President George Washington.
 That should give you an idea
 of how important potash was.
 The demand for potash was
 so high
 that across Europe
 and the eastern U.S.,
 forests were decimated.
 Unfortunately, it required
 a huge amount of lumber
 to create just
 a small quantity of potash.
Then in 1861 in Germany,
they started
producing potassium
from a different source.
They found it not in plants
or any living organism,
but in a rock.
This is potassium chloride
in its natural mineral form.
 Now, this also gets
 the name potash
 even though the name
 originally referred to ash
 in a pot, potassium carbonate.
 It changed everything.
 Germany established
 a near monopoly
 in the potash supply.
 They had so much of the stuff
 that they started looking
 for new uses.
Well, they did experiments
sprinkling this stuff
on farmers' fields,
finding that this acts
as an excellent fertilizer.
 That's because potassium,
 along with nitrogen
 and phosphorous,
 help crops grow far larger
 and makes them
 more drought-resistant.
 The downside was, in 1910,
 just four year before
 the start of World War I,
 the Germans cut off
 potash exports to the world.
 Their preemptive first strike
 was depriving the world
 of potassium,
 something countries had
 become dependent on
 to feed
 their growing populations.
 The U.S. became so desperate
 for other sources of potassium
 that in 1911,
 Congress appropriated money
 to find domestic sources.
 Sites discovered
 near Searles Lake, California,
 Carlsbad, New Mexico,
 and Moab, Utah,
 became potash paydirt.

 But the potash rocks weren't
 on the surface.
 They were deep underground,
 so potash had to be mined out.
 ♪ ♪
 But how did it get here
 in the first place?
 I'm meeting Mike Coronella,
 a Moab guide who knows
 the history of this area.
 ♪ ♪
So the layer
that the potash is found in
is called
the Paradox Formation,
 and it was created
 by an inland ocean
 that kept retreating,
 returning,
 retreating, and returning.
 The water would evaporate
 and leave behind salt
 and other evaporites
 like potash.
Salt in the ground is
very much like an air bubble
in water.
Geologically,
it wants to float.
 It's literally pushing up
 against the crust here.
And they used
to harvest it underground
like coal, you know?
Scraping it out, throwing it
on the narrow-gauge rail
up to the surface.
But salt also likes to trap
oil and gas,
and there's oil and gas
in this area.
And I believe it was 1963,
as they were mining the potash,
they hit a pocket of gas
and there was a big explosion,
major loss of life.
 Derek:
 This tragic explosion occurred
 at 4:40 in the afternoon
 on August 27, 1963.
 18 men died.
 Investigators concluded,
 the disaster was caused
 by the ignition
 of combustible gas
 by electric arcs, sparks,
 or an open flame.
 Miners' electric tools
 or lights
 or, back in the old days,
 candle flames
 could ignite the natural gas,
 leading to huge explosions.
( explosion pops )
 But there was
 an invention made
 to prevent such explosions,
 an ingenious lamp.
 This wire mesh disperses
 the heat from this flame
 rapidly enough to prevent
 igniting the gas
 outside the screen.
 This is called the Davy lamp
 after its inventor
 and also the discoverer
 of potassium,
 Sir Humphry Davy.
Without the Davy lamp,
the candles could ignite
methane in the mine.
And if a mine is
full of methane
and something ignites it,
well, this is
what it looks like.
Okay, guys.
Let's do it.
 Producer: In three, two, one.
Wow.
That was incredibly fast.
Can I watch that back?
 This footage is shot
 at 1,000 frames per second.
 ( tense music )
 So it ignites down here
 at the bottom,
 and once that spark
 takes hold,
 all that gas is burning,
 and as it does,
 it releases heat,
 which causes the gas
 to expand,
 and so it accelerates
 through all the shafts
 of the mine,
 getting faster and faster
 all the way up to the top.
You know, unlike out here
in the atmosphere,
where, you know,
combustion can dissipate
and there's a lot of fresh air
that can rush in,
in the mine, you just have
that methane gas.
Once there's a single spark,
 it basically sets
 the whole place ablaze.
Mining is one of the most
dangerous professions,
so if you don't have to go
down in a mine,
it's better not to.
 ( country music )
 ♪ ♪
A year after
that fatal explosion in 1963,
a mining company
based in Saskatchewan, Canada,
stumbled upon a safer way
to mine potash.
What they do at that mine is,
they pump water
from the Colorado River
deep underground.
It goes down 3,900 feet.
That is where
the potash deposits are.
Now, that water dissolves
the potash salt,
so we get a briny solution
down here.
Then they get forced
back up to the surface,
where that brine solution is
pumped into these ponds.
Here, the water evaporates
into the air,
leaving you with that potash
that you wanted to get.
In a sense, the water molecules
are like your little miners
going in there
to get the potash out
so you don't have to.
These are the ponds
that we're looking at.

Google Earth gives you
this bird's-eye view, right?
 But you're so high, it's tough
 to make sense of it.
but it's really from here
that you can see
what these ponds are all about.
 You have the hot Utah sun
 and this dry air.
 So these are
 evaporation ponds.
 They're evaporating
 the water off
 to get to that salt,
 to get to the potash
 which is in the water.
And it just looks so beautiful
from up in the air.
 There are 23 ponds
 spread over 400 acres,
 and it takes months
 for each one to evaporate.
 There are 2 billion tons
 of potash
 in the Paradox Basin alone,
 and at an average price
 of $330 a metric ton,
 the potash harvested here
 could potentially generate
 billions of dollars.
The color of these ponds
changes over time.
A full, fresh pond is
a deep blue color,
 but over time,
 as that water evaporates
 and it gets shallower,
 we see seafoam green ponds,
 and further along the line,
 you get these
 sort of tan colored ponds.
Ultimately, when all the water
is gone,
 you are left with this white
 crystalline substance.
 That is the potash,
 and they scrape it up
 with these vehicles.
 But if the potash crystals
 are white,
 then why do these ponds appear
 so blue?
The answer is in here.
It is copper sulfate.
See those
copper sulfate crystals?
Well, if I add them
to the water,
they dissolve,
dying the water blue.
So the copper sulfate is
in the water
because it prevents the growth
of algae
and other living organisms.
Plus it's this dark blue color,
which absorbs more sunlight,
more energy from the sun,
and that helps the water
evaporate faster.

 If you can believe it,
 fertilizer now supports half
 of the world's population.
Every other person owes
their existence
in part to innovations
like this:
harvesting potash
and other minerals
that are essential
for the growth of our food.
 But increasing the efficiency
 of growing food
 doesn't just mean this planets
 can support more people.
 It also means
 that they can explore
 different ways of life.
 You know, before the advent
 of agriculture,
 when our ancestors lived
 as hunter-gatherers,
 we spent all day every day
 just finding food.
 But once we could grow
 our own crops
 and these days,
 now that we can do it
 so efficiently
 with the help of fertilizer,
that totally changes the game.
It frees up most people's time
to do other things,
to be artists and musicians
and sports people
and science communicators.
 So potash itself is
 irreplaceable.
 It has helped us
 make the modern world
what it is today.
 And that's what
 these blue ponds have to do

 Humphry Davy,
 every other person
