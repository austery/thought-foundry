today
 we're
 going
 to
 talk
 about


something
 really
 interesting
 meetings


now
 G
 do
 we
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 meetings


probably
 we
 have
 more
 than
 100
 million


meetings
 every
 day
 just
 in
 the
 US
 um


many
 of
 them
 are
 great
 many
 of
 them
 are


not
 very
 good
 and
 we're
 going
 to
 talk


about
 that
 today
 how
 to
 improve
 them
 we


have
 the
 world
 leading
 specialist


Stephen
 rogelberg
 warm
 welcome
 oh
 it's


so
 good
 to
 be
 here
 great
 and
 you're


coming
 to
 Oslo
 to
 have
 this
 meeting
 I
 am


and
 this
 is
 the
 this
 is
 a
 meeting
 I


wanted
 to
 have
 that's
 good
 now
 how
 come


you
 became
 interested
 in
 this
 oh
 my
 my


gosh
 I
 have
 no
 idea
 other
 than
 just
 the


sheer
 frustration
 of
 having
 a
 day
 filled


with
 meetings
 and
 not
 feeling
 like
 I


accomplished
 anything
 and
 my
 concern
 was


is
 that
 a
 shared
 feeling
 amongst
 the


millions
 and
 millions
 of
 people
 out


there
 working
 and
 the
 answer
 is
 yes
 when


you
 have
 days
 full
 of
 meetings
 you
 just


end
 that
 day
 feeling
 more
 drained


feeling
 like
 you
 have
 yet
 more
 work
 to


do
 and
 yet
 you
 don't
 have
 that
 sense
 of


accomplishment
 what's
 what's
 the
 key
 to


a
 successful
 meeting
 because
 some
 of


them
 are
 successful
 right
 sometimes
 we


come
 out
 on
 meeting
 and
 said
 wow
 that


was
 good


what's
 the
 key
 to
 that
 so
 there's
 a


there's
 a
 host
 of
 keys
 um
 it
 starts
 with


intentionality
 so
 what
 we
 have
 found
 in


our
 research
 is
 the
 best
 meeting
 leaders


have
 something
 in
 common
 and
 what
 they


have
 in
 common
 is
 the
 mindset
 of
 being
 a


good
 Steward
 of
 others
 time
 and
 when
 you


think
 of
 yourself
 as
 a
 steward
 of
 others


time
 you
 become
 intentional
 with
 your


meeting
 choices
 you
 design
 the
 meeting


with
 intentionality
 you
 facilitate
 the


meeting
 with
 intentionality
 and
 you


close
 the
 meeting
 with
 intentionality


and
 interestingly
 we
 always
 we
 have
 have


this
 stewardship
 mindset
 when
 we're


meeting
 with
 critical
 stakeholders
 but


we
 when
 we're
 meeting
 with
 our
 team
 or


peers
 we
 tend
 to
 step
 back
 and
 not
 act


like
 a
 steward
 so
 we
 will
 talk
 about


some
 of
 that
 intentionality
 I'm
 sure
 in


terms
 of
 specific
 choices
 but
 it


definitely
 starts
 with
 this
 mindset
 that


if
 people
 leave
 your
 meeting
 saying
 that


it
 was
 a
 waste
 of
 time
 that
 is
 so


uncomfortable
 to
 you
 that
 you
 try
 to
 do


things
 to
 prevented
 when
 should
 we
 call


a
 meeting
 in
 the
 first
 place
 meeting


should
 be
 called
 when
 there's
 a


compelling
 purpose
 that
 that
 requires


interaction
 and
 engagement
 if
 you
 don't


need
 interaction
 and
 engagement
 then
 you


don't
 need
 to
 bring
 people
 together


right
 this
 should
 we
 have
 them
 regularly


in
 the
 in
 the
 diary
 should
 we
 just
 have


them
 every
 Monday
 bang
 bang
 meet
 this


person
 if
 there's
 a
 compelling
 reason
 to


do
 that
 but
 we
 just
 don't
 want
 to
 meet


out
 of
 habit
 which
 is
 what
 calendars
 are


being
 filled
 with
 right
 it's
 just
 habits


and
 habits
 are
 tough
 to
 break
 so
 we


definitely
 want
 to
 be
 more
 thoughtful


that
 we
 only
 schedule
 a
 meeting
 when


there's
 is
 absolute
 criticality
 to
 do
 so


when
 should
 we
 just
 send
 an
 email


instead
 so
 let
 me
 give
 you
 because
 some


emails
 should
 probably
 be
 meetings
 and


some
 meetings
 should
 be
 emails
 I
 think


it
 keeps
 going
 back
 to
 that
 the
 need
 for


engagement
 with
 the
 content
 that
 really


is
 what
 if
 you
 need
 engagement
 with
 the


content
 meetings
 are
 a
 perfect
 mechanism


so
 let
 me
 give
 you
 a
 technique
 let
 me


tie
 this
 to
 a
 technique
 and
 we
 all
 know


the
 importance
 of
 creating
 an
 agenda


well
 I
 have
 an
 alternative
 approach
 to


agendas
 and
 it
 speaks
 to
 when
 you
 should


have
 a
 meeting
 and
 when
 you
 should
 not


so
 instead
 of
 framing
 your
 agenda
 as
 a


set
 of
 topics
 to
 be
 discussed
 what
 I


want
 to
 challenge
 folks
 to
 do
 is
 create


an
 agenda
 as
 a
 set
 of
 questions
 to
 be


answered
 by
 Framing
 your
 agenda
 as
 a
 set


of
 questions
 to
 be
 answered
 now
 you
 have


to
 step
 back
 and
 really
 think
 why
 am
 I


having
 this
 meeting
 it's
 to
 address


these
 questions
 by
 Framing
 your
 agenda


as
 questions
 you
 have
 a
 better
 sense
 of


who
 has
 to
 be
 there
 they're
 relevant
 to


the
 questions
 by
 Framing
 your
 agenda's


questions
 you
 now
 know
 if
 the
 meeting


has
 been
 successful
 the
 questions
 have


been
 answered
 and
 if
 you
 just
 can't


think
 of
 any
 questions
 it
 likely
 means


you
 don't
 need
 a
 meeting
 absolutely
 no


you
 have
 something
 called
 a
 stur
 mindset


right
 what
 what
 what
 is
 involved
 in
 that


so
 that
 is
 just
 this
 this
 notion
 that


you
 are
 inviting
 people
 you
 are
 asking


people
 to
 give
 you
 the
 greatest
 gift


that
 we
 all
 have
 our
 time
 and
 by
 asking


for
 that
 you
 want
 to
 honor
 that
 time
 you


want
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 that
 investment


is
 Meaningful
 to
 them
 and
 to
 you
 so
 when


you
 have
 that
 stewardship
 mindset
 you


are
 trying
 to
 create
 good
 choices
 that


intentionality
 to
 elevate
 this
 meeting


time
 so
 that
 people
 feel
 at
 the
 end
 that


it
 wasn't
 a
 drain
 but
 instead
 a
 gain
 who


should
 be
 in
 a
 meeting
 the
 people
 that


should
 be
 in
 the
 meeting
 are
 critical
 to


answering
 the
 questions
 of
 interest


because
 during
 I
 think
 during
 covid
 when


we
 were
 at
 teams
 we
 kind
 of
 included


everybody
 left
 right
 and
 Center
 in
 order


not
 to
 offend
 anybody
 that's
 right


nobody
 should
 feel
 excluded
 everybody


should
 be
 part
 of
 it
 you
 know
 meeting


and
 and
 I
 think
 we
 just
 kind
 of


continued
 that
 philosophy
 exactly
 this


so
 This
 desire
 to
 increase
 meeting
 size


comes
 from
 three
 forces
 the
 first
 force


is
 a
 force
 of
 goodness
 you
 just
 want
 to


include
 people
 so
 you
 invite
 them
 right


that's
 a
 coming
 from
 a
 good
 place
 the


second
 force
 is
 laziness
 right
 it's
 very


easy
 for
 us
 just
 to
 hold
 captive


people's
 calendars
 and
 invite
 them
 to
 a


meeting
 right
 so
 we're
 not
 thoughtful
 or


deliberate
 we
 just
 say
 when
 in
 doubt


invite
 the
 third
 force
 is
 insecurity


namely
 as
 people
 became
 working
 more


remote
 leaders
 just
 didn't
 have
 that


confidence
 that
 they
 were
 actually


managing
 so
 how
 do
 they
 express
 their


management
 you
 bring
 them
 into
 a
 meeting


and
 so
 these
 meetings
 just
 keep


increasing
 increasing
 in
 size
 what's
 the


optimal
 is
 there
 um
 like
 a
 Max
 size
 of
 a


meeting
 it
 depends
 if
 you're
 trying
 to


accomplish
 genuine
 interaction
 if
 you


really
 want
 to
 create
 interaction
 you


know
 more
 than
 eight
 people
 is
 super


hard
 you
 have
 to
 be
 a
 very
 skilled


facilitator
 yeah
 how
 long
 should
 they
 be


they
 should
 be
 as
 long
 as
 absolutely


necessary
 given
 what
 you're
 trying
 to


answer
 but
 they
 tend
 to
 fill
 up
 the
 time


they
 have
 exactly
 so
 there's
 something


called
 Parkinson's
 law
 and
 Parkinson's


law
 is
 the
 idea
 that
 work
 expands
 to


fill
 whatever
 time
 is
 allotted
 to
 it
 so


a
 meeting
 scheduled
 for
 60
 minutes
 will


take
 60
 minutes
 but
 we
 can
 actually
 use


that
 science
 to
 our
 advantage
 if
 we


schedule
 a
 meeting
 for
 25
 5
 minutes
 we


will
 get
 it
 done
 in
 fact
 the
 research


shows
 that
 if
 you
 identify
 a
 meeting


time
 and
 then
 decrease
 it
 by
 around
 five


minutes
 it
 actually
 creates
 positive


pressure
 and
 more
 focus
 and
 those
 groups


perform
 better
 that's
 interesting
 now


how
 do
 you
 make
 meetings
 good
 how
 do
 you


make
 them
 engagement
 engaging
 so
 I
 it


starts
 from
 that
 agenda
 and
 that


intentionality
 so
 that
 questions
 based


approach
 when
 you
 frame
 your
 agenda
 as


questions
 to
 be
 answered
 people
 will
 be


drawn
 into
 it
 right
 we
 as
 early
 as
 young


school
 kids
 we
 are
 drawn
 to
 answer


questions
 so
 when
 we
 frame
 it
 as


questions
 and
 then
 when
 the
 leader


starts
 the
 meeting
 what
 was
 so


interesting
 in
 the
 science
 is
 that
 the


leader's
 mood
 is
 actually
 the
 best


predictor
 of
 the
 meetings
 mood
 so
 if
 you


come
 in
 there
 in
 a
 negative
 mood
 state


it
 pervades
 the
 meeting
 and
 it
 affects


engagement
 and
 openness
 to
 new
 ideas
 so


the
 meeting
 has
 to
 start
 well
 the
 leader


has
 to
 recognize
 that
 they
 are
 a
 host


they
 called
 everyone
 together
 so
 what


does
 a
 host
 do
 a
 host
 welcomes
 people
 a


host
 makes
 introductions
 a
 host


expresses
 gratitude
 and
 helps
 people


make
 separation
 from
 what
 they
 were


doing
 before
 they
 walked
 into
 the


meeting
 and
 then
 into
 the
 meeting
 itself


and
 then
 once
 that
 meeting
 is
 going
 that


leader
 is
 facilitating
 right
 if
 you


invited
 someone
 to
 this
 meeting
 it's


because
 you
 wanted
 to
 hear
 what
 they
 had


to
 say
 so
 that
 leader
 is
 dialed
 in
 and


saying
 oh
 I
 haven't
 heard
 from
 you


Gordon
 I'd
 love
 to
 hear
 your
 thoughts
 on


this
 or
 or
 Sandy
 I
 know
 you
 were
 working


on
 something
 similar
 right
 so
 they're


helping
 bring
 the
 voices
 out
 they're


encouraging
 conflict
 conflict
 of
 ideas


right
 so
 they're
 they're
 doing
 all
 that


and
 then
 when
 the
 meeting
 is
 coming
 to
 a


conclusion
 they
 help
 promote
 an
 ending


the
 common
 thing
 is
 that
 the
 most
 senior


person
 speaks
 the
 most
 right


unfortunately
 that
 is
 and
 what
 has


generally
 been
 found
 is
 these
 most


senior
 folks
 who
 talk
 the
 most


they
 are
 not
 picking
 up
 on
 the
 meeting


Dynamics
 when
 you
 do
 a
 lot
 of
 talking


you
 love
 it
 you
 think
 this
 is
 great
 the


more
 people
 talk
 the
 better
 they
 feel


about
 the
 experience
 so
 these
 leaders


and
 the
 more
 senior
 you
 are
 the
 more


endorphins
 you
 get
 from
 hearing
 your
 own


voice
 exactly
 so
 they
 leave
 the
 meeting


saying
 this
 was
 great
 but
 everyone
 else


doesn't
 feel
 the
 same
 how
 do
 you
 get
 um


what's
 good
 listening
 who's
 a
 good


listener
 I
 think
 it's
 interesting


sometimes
 you
 give
 speech
 or
 a
 seminar


or
 something
 and
 you
 some
 people
 in
 the


audience
 are
 just
 better
 listeners
 and


you
 can
 just
 see
 it
 I
 think
 it's
 the
 way


they're
 notd
 I
 guess
 uh
 so
 listening
 has


multiple
 components
 um
 so
 let
 me
 answer


that
 question
 by
 telling
 by
 telling
 you


a
 related
 piece
 of
 science
 which
 I
 think


speaks
 to
 it
 have
 you
 noticed
 that
 when


people
 make
 introductions
 you
 learn


someone's
 name
 next
 thing
 you
 know


you've
 forgotten
 it
 sure
 and
 so
 there


were
 studies
 to
 look
 at
 this
 and


basically
 one
 of
 the
 principal
 reasons


well
 there's
 a
 couple
 principal
 reasons


we
 don't
 remember
 the
 names
 is
 one
 we


don't
 really
 care
 we
 don't
 really
 care


so
 that
 now
 tells
 us
 one
 key
 clue
 to


listening
 is
 caring
 what
 that
 person


says
 Y
 the
 second
 reason
 we
 often
 forget


the
 names
 is
 because
 we
 are
 rehearsing


what
 we're
 going
 to
 say
 while
 that


person's
 introducing
 themselves
 so


active
 listening
 is
 all
 about
 caring


truly
 engaging
 with
 what
 that
 person
 has


to
 say
 say
 taking
 as
 a
 challenge
 to


truly
 fully
 engage
 with
 their
 words
 so


the
 the
 types
 of
 utterance
 such
 as
 help


me
 understand
 tell
 me
 more
 what
 are
 your


thoughts
 right
 these
 are
 all
 overt


attempts
 to
 truly
 engage
 with
 another


person's
 content
 and
 that's
 where


listening
 takes
 part
 you
 mentioned
 the


important
 of
 um
 kind
 of
 conflicts
 in


meetings
 um
 so
 we
 had
 um
 Ed
 KML
 who
 was


the
 founder
 of
 Pixar
 on
 on
 the
 podcast


and
 he
 talked
 about
 Steve
 Jobs
 I
 mean


they
 they
 co-founded
 pixa
 together
 Steve


Jobs
 he
 he
 sacked
 two
 board
 members
 at


Pixar
 because
 they
 never
 disagreed
 with


him
 in
 in
 meetings
 and
 he
 said
 you
 know


if
 you
 don't
 disagree
 you're
 not
 adding


anything
 to
 this
 company
 so
 how
 do
 you


create
 an
 environment
 where
 people
 are


feel
 okay
 to
 disagree
 yeah
 that's


great
 we
 definitely
 want
 conflict
 in


meetings
 but
 we
 want
 conflict
 of
 ideas


not
 conflict
 of
 personalities
 y
 and


to
 create
 a
 culture
 where
 conflict


occurs
 of
 ideas
 it
 starts
 with
 the


leader
 expressing
 values
 that
 this
 is


actually
 what
 they
 want
 right
 so
 so
 many


meeting
 leaders
 never
 express
 what
 their


hopes
 are
 in
 this
 meeting
 but
 if
 you


start
 the
 meeting
 saying
 we
 have
 some


important
 things
 to
 talk
 about
 that


there's
 no
 way
 we
 all
 100%
 agree
 so
 we


want
 people
 to
 go
 to
 battle
 over
 ideas


right
 so
 create
 the
 expectation
 then


once
 that
 me
 happens
 encourage
 it
 right


so
 you
 can
 make
 comments
 Sasha
 what
 is


the
 alternative
 perspective
 on
 this
 give


me
 something
 different
 right
 so
 the


facilitation
 could
 help
 keep
 promoting


alternative
 perspectives
 and
 then
 I
 want


to
 share
 one
 other
 way
 because
 this
 next


way
 is
 the
 most
 different
 one
 of
 the


greatest
 ways
 of
 creating
 conflict
 in


meetings
 is


silence
 namely
 if
 groups


interact
 with
 no
 voices
 and
 basically


are
 just
 typing
 into
 a
 document
 so
 for


example
 let's
 say
 we're
 brainstorming


around
 alternative
 approaches
 to


penetrate
 a
 market
 right
 we
 could
 do


that
 with
 our
 mouths
 or
 we
 could
 type


into
 a
 shared
 document
 with
 everyone


putting
 in
 their
 ideas
 and
 then
 adding


you
 know
 comments
 on
 others
 ideas
 when


brainstorming
 is
 done
 with
 silence
 the


range
 of
 ideas
 is
 much
 greater
 and
 you


get
 so
 many
 different
 ideas
 because
 when


you
 were
 doing
 it
 in
 silence
 everyone


could
 contribute
 at
 once
 and
 they


weren't
 being
 most
 influenced
 by
 the


first
 voice
 they
 heard
 because


everything
 occurred
 simultaneous


interesting
 how
 do
 you
 wrap
 up
 a
 meeting


that's
 such
 an
 important
 question
 we


know
 meetings
 end
 but
 meetings
 often


don't
 have
 an


ending
 and
 the
 best
 meetings
 haven't


ending
 basically
 with
 five
 minutes
 left


or
 three
 minutes
 left
 you
 stop
 you
 stop


and
 you
 say
 okay
 we've
 had
 this


conversation
 we
 now
 need
 to
 wrap
 this
 up


here's
 what
 we
 decided
 for
 each
 of
 these


things
 that
 was
 decided
 we've
 identified


the


Dr
 directly
 responsible
 individual
 so


therefore
 no
 one
 leaves
 the
 meeting


wondering
 what
 was
 decided
 and
 who's


responsible
 as
 part
 of
 that
 ending


you're
 also
 indicating
 outstanding


issues
 that
 can
 be
 picked
 up
 at
 the
 next


meeting
 so
 this
 General
 wrapup
 right


this
 closing
 is
 so
 helpful
 not
 only
 for


the
 people
 attending
 but
 also
 the
 people


not
 attending


namely
 if
 you
 document
 that
 it
 helps


those
 people
 who
 are
 not
 attending
 feel


it's
 okay
 that
 I
 wasn't
 there
 uh
 in
 this


fund
 we
 rate
 our
 meetings
 uh
 after
 the


meeting
 the
 leader
 group
 meetings
 is


that
 a
 good
 a
 there
 or
 a
 bad
 a
 there
 it


I
 lean
 good


um
 but
 how
 we
 use
 the
 data
 that
 needs
 to


be
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 Nuance
 so
 I
 I'd


have
 to
 learn
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 how
 you


leverage
 those
 data
 but
 here's
 why
 I


think
 it's
 a
 good


idea
 as
 I
 mentioned
 earlier


leaders
 think
 they're
 much
 better
 at


running
 meetings
 than
 others
 so
 there's


this
 disconnect
 there's
 a
 blind
 spot


that
 these
 leaders
 have
 and
 when
 you


have
 this
 blind
 spot
 you're
 not
 very


motivated
 to
 make
 changes
 right
 because


you
 think
 it's
 going
 well
 so
 why
 would


you
 change
 you
 constantly
 believe
 that


the
 meeting
 problem
 is
 everyone
 else
 not


you
 so
 the
 feedback
 and
 the
 data
 are


critical
 pieces
 for
 helping
 to
 provide


awareness
 and
 Enlightenment
 so
 I
 love


the
 idea
 of
 people
 getting
 some
 type
 of


aggregated
 data
 on
 how
 they're
 doing
 in


this
 role
 another
 way
 of
 carrying
 it
 out


by
 the
 way
 is
 to
 go
 to
 your
 engagement


survey
 is
 there
 any
 content
 on
 meetings


in
 that
 engagement
 survey
 and
 likely
 the


answer
 is
 no
 and
 that's
 a
 tremendous


missed
 opportunity
 to
 build
 into
 your


engagement
 survey
 Reporting
 System


content
 on
 how
 people
 are
 actually


spending
 their
 time
 at
 work
 should
 we
 be


standing
 up
 sometimes
 but
 not
 always
 so


yes
 the
 research
 generally
 shows
 that


meetings
 standing
 up
 take
 nearly
 half
 as


much
 time
 and
 produce
 the
 similar


quality
 outcomes
 so
 standing
 up
 was
 not


a
 bad


idea
 but
 certain
 meeting
 if
 a
 long


meeting
 no
 one's
 going
 to
 want
 to
 be


standing
 for
 a
 long
 period
 of
 time
 so
 we


just
 have
 to
 be
 thoughtful
 but
 I
 think


what's
 so
 important
 about
 your
 question


and
 what
 it
 speaks
 to
 is
 that
 when


you're
 leading
 a
 meeting


you
 have
 choices
 there's
 lots
 of


different
 ways
 you
 can
 run
 this
 meeting


right
 you
 can
 do
 it
 in
 silence
 you
 can


have
 people
 stand
 up
 you
 can
 have
 people


get
 into
 pairs
 before
 they
 start
 talking


as
 a
 group
 right
 you
 have
 a
 lot
 of


things
 that
 you
 can
 actually
 make


choices
 of
 that
 can
 Elevate
 The


Experience
 so
 step
 back
 and
 make
 a


choice
 at
 times
 a
 15minute
 quick
 meeting


where
 people
 are
 kind
 of
 coming
 together


a
 standup
 could
 be
 perfect
 if
 you're


having
 an8
 hour
 Retreat
 a
 standing
 up


meeting
 is
 probably
 not
 the
 best
 choice


that's
 probably
 right
 now
 how
 does
 it


differ
 um
 online
 uh
 instead
 of
 uh
 in


person
 what
 are
 the
 things
 we
 need
 to
 be


to
 be
 aware
 of
 great


question
 um
 before
 the
 pandemic
 virtual


meetings
 were
 ranked
 very
 very
 low
 right


so
 face-to-face
 meetings
 were
 considered


um
 by
 attendees
 to
 be
 a
 much
 richer


better


experience
 but
 people
 have
 gotten
 better


with
 virtual
 meetings
 we're
 seing


virtual
 meeting
 Effectiveness
 increase


over
 time
 and
 basically
 people's


perceptions
 generally
 see
 it
 around
 the


same
 now
 as
 face
 to
 face
 interestingly


virtual
 meetings
 have
 in
 some
 ways
 more


potential
 why
 because
 the
 meeting
 room


is
 inherently
 Democratic
 right
 everyone


is
 on
 an
 equal
 plane
 in
 a
 virtual


meeting
 you
 don't
 have
 head
 of
 table


effects
 right
 so
 it's
 an
 open
 for
 much


more
 accessible
 for
 people
 you
 have
 the


access
 to
 chat
 and
 chat
 has
 been
 shown


to
 be
 a
 great
 mechanism
 for
 bringing


more
 voices
 into
 the
 conversation
 you


also
 have
 these
 various
 plugins
 that


allow
 for
 quick
 voting
 and
 consensus


taking
 done
 anonymously
 so
 you're
 not


just
 influenced
 by
 the
 loudest
 voices


but
 you
 can
 quickly
 test
 consensus
 so


there's
 so
 many
 reasons
 that
 virtual


meetings
 can
 Excel
 and
 even
 be
 better


than
 face
 Toof
 face
 multitasking
 what
 do


you
 think
 what
 I
 think
 about


multitasking
 yeah
 I
 love
 multitasking
 oh


in
 meetings
 multitasking
 is
 really


intriguing
 because
 generally
 when
 people


are
 multitasking
 in
 meetings
 they're


actually
 doing
 their
 work
 they're


actually
 doing
 their
 work
 so
 it's
 a


behavior
 that
 hurts
 the
 meeting
 but


helps
 the
 organization
 it's
 crazy
 it's
 a


very
 interesting
 phenomenon
 but


multitasking
 is
 generally
 a
 symptom
 it


is
 a
 symptom
 of
 a
 bad
 meeting
 yeah
 so


it's
 just
 boring
 or
 you
 wonder
 why


you're
 there
 yeah
 Stephen
 we
 talked


about
 um
 kind
 of
 bigger
 meetings
 now
 but


you
 also
 written
 a
 book
 about
 one-on-one


meetings
 I
 have
 you
 have
 for
 sure


written
 books
 that's
 great
 now
 what
 is


um
 what
 is
 a
 one-one
 meeting
 and
 why
 are


they
 important
 thank
 you
 our
 days
 are


filled
 with
 one-on-one


encounters
 but
 I'm
 talking
 about


something
 different
 so
 this
 book
 that
 I


wrote
 It's
 called
 glad
 we
 met
 the
 Art


and
 Science
 of
 one-on-one
 meetings
 when


I'm
 talking
 about
 a
 one-on-one
 meeting


in
 that
 context
 what
 I'm
 talking
 about


is
 a
 meeting
 that's
 facilitated
 and


orchestrated
 by
 a
 manager
 with
 one
 of


her
 or
 his
 direct
 reports
 but
 it
 is
 a


meeting
 not
 for
 the
 manager
 yeah
 it
 is
 a


meeting
 for
 that
 employee
 it
 is
 a


meeting
 for
 that
 employee
 to
 be
 able
 to


express
 their
 thoughts
 and
 ideas
 and


whatever
 is
 on
 their
 minds
 the
 manager


is
 just
 reacting
 to
 what
 the
 employee


it's
 a
 dedicated
 space
 to
 truly
 see
 your


people
 and
 and
 the
 research
 on
 it
 is


amazing
 that
 when
 managers
 have
 these


regular
 one-on
 ones
 with
 their
 people


where
 they're
 not
 just
 asking
 for
 status


reports
 because
 again
 that's
 for
 them


but
 they're
 trying
 to
 understand
 your


challenges
 your
 thoughts
 your
 concerns


um
 your
 opportunities
 both
 shortterm
 and


long-term
 when
 you
 fully
 engage
 with


that
 person
 on
 their
 terms
 these


individuals
 tend
 to
 be
 more
 engaged
 they


your
 top
 talent
 tends
 to
 be
 more


retainable
 they
 feel
 more
 committed
 to


the
 team
 team
 and
 to
 the
 organization


and
 people
 are
 better
 coordinated
 and


how
 often
 should
 you
 do
 them
 well
 we


looked
 at
 that
 from
 two
 perspectives


first
 of
 all
 we
 ask
 people
 what
 is
 your


preferred
 Cadence
 to
 meet
 with
 your


manager
 in
 this
 one-on-one
 meeting
 and


by
 far
 it
 was
 weekly
 then
 we
 looked
 at


the
 outcomes
 so
 we
 examine
 how


frequently
 you
 have
 them
 and
 then


people's
 engagement
 on
 the
 job
 it
 lined


up
 perfectly
 weekly
 one-on
 ones
 or
 every


other
 week
 one-on
 ones
 where
 associated


with
 the
 best
 outcomes
 for
 the


organization
 when
 they're
 every
 month


the
 relationship
 doesn't
 have
 the


continuity
 right
 the
 the
 the


conversations
 become
 stale
 and


disjointed
 the
 story
 doesn't
 come


through
 but
 a
 manager
 how
 many
 oneon-one


meetings
 or
 how
 many
 relationships


should
 a
 manager
 Have
 and
 Have


one-on-one
 meetings
 with
 you
 think
 so


you
 should
 be
 having
 one-on
 ones
 with


every
 single
 one
 of
 your
 direct
 reports


yeah
 hopefully
 you
 don't
 have
 more
 than


10
 direct
 reports
 but
 here's
 the
 super


good


news
 it's
 less
 about
 the
 amount
 of


minutes
 in
 these
 one-on
 ons
 and
 more


about
 the
 regularity
 of
 it
 so
 if
 I
 give


you
 20
 good
 minutes
 every
 week
 that
 had


the
 same
 positive
 outcomes
 as
 even
 if
 I


gave
 you
 an
 hour
 so
 as
 a
 manager
 looks


at
 the
 calendar
 goes
 I
 don't
 have
 time


to
 do
 one-on


ones
 really
 the
 question
 is
 if
 you
 don't


have
 the
 time
 you're
 going
 to
 lose
 lose


your
 best
 people
 right
 if
 you
 don't


invest
 in
 these


relationships
 the
 team
 won't
 Thrive


we've
 all
 heard
 that
 adage
 that
 people


don't
 leave
 bad
 jobs
 they
 leave
 Bad


Bosses
 one-on
 ones
 are
 your
 opportunity


to
 prove
 to
 your
 people
 that
 you're
 not


a
 bad
 boss
 why
 do
 you
 think
 people
 are


hesitant
 to
 have
 them
 then
 if
 if
 they're


so
 no-brainer
 because
 everyone
 is
 so


pressed
 with
 time
 that
 they're


constantly
 thinking
 of
 what
 type
 of


meeting
 do
 I
 not
 not
 need
 to
 have
 and


the
 alternative
 title
 for
 my
 book
 that
 I


didn't
 use
 but
 I
 was
 tempted
 was
 the
 one


meeting
 that
 should
 never
 be
 an
 email


because
 that's
 really
 what
 a
 one-on-one


is
 I'm
 a
 big
 believer
 in
 looking
 at
 this


notion
 of
 signals
 As
 Leaders
 we
 are


always
 sending
 signals
 to
 our
 people


signals
 about
 what's
 important
 to
 us
 and


what's
 not
 think
 about
 the
 signal
 you


send
 to
 your
 people
 when
 you
 do
 not
 have


a


one-on-one
 you're
 sending
 the
 signal


that
 they
 really
 don't
 matter
 that
 much


to
 you


yeah
 well
 we
 all
 need
 to
 be
 seen
 right


so
 I
 guess
 it's
 part
 of
 that
 exactly


where
 does
 mentoring
 come
 in
 here


mentoring
 fits
 perfectly
 with
 this
 whole


concept
 of
 one-on
 ones
 because
 a
 mentor


is
 not
 someone
 generally
 that
 has
 a


Personal
 Agenda
 in
 the
 conversation


right
 a
 good
 Mentor
 a
 good
 coach
 is


helping
 to
 engage
 with
 a
 person
 on
 their


terms
 and
 so
 the
 these
 one-on
 ones
 are


absolutely
 an
 opportunity
 to
 provide


mentoring
 and
 coaching
 but
 the
 employee


is
 opening
 the
 door
 for
 it
 right
 so
 you


don't
 go
 into
 these
 meetings
 with
 a


manager
 saying
 oh
 I
 have
 some
 feedback


for
 you
 but
 the
 manager
 can
 say
 is
 there


anything
 that
 I
 can
 share
 some
 feedback


are
 there
 any
 topics
 or
 anything
 that


you
 want
 me
 to
 share
 feedback
 on
 right


so
 they
 they
 have
 the
 door
 available
 to


the
 the
 individual
 but
 the
 employee
 gets


to
 drive
 and
 the
 more
 that
 we
 drive
 and


that
 feedback
 process
 the
 more
 we
 accept


the
 feedback
 and
 internalize
 it
 right


when
 you're
 mentoring
 or
 coaching


someone
 in
 these
 one-on
 ones
 if
 the


employee
 says
 I'm
 having
 this
 particular


problem
 now
 the
 manager
 can
 say
 oh


here's
 a
 solution
 to
 the
 problem
 a


mentor
 would
 say
 well
 what
 are
 your


thoughts
 on
 how
 to
 address
 that
 problem


in
 your
 mind
 is
 a
 um
 a
 mentor
 from
 the


same
 company
 or
 an
 external
 Mentor
 the


better
 choice
 it
 could
 be
 either
 one
 um


it
 really
 depends
 on
 the
 in
 the
 role
 in


question
 um
 generally
 and
 how
 new
 the


employee
 is
 to
 the
 organization
 itself


but
 generally
 speaking
 uh
 most
 mentors


can
 emerge
 internally
 for
 some
 types
 of


High
 Senior
 roles
 where
 um
 benchmarking


with
 other
 competitors
 or
 other


organizations
 could
 be
 particularly


helpful
 an
 external
 Mentor
 could
 be


better
 Stephen
 this
 has
 been
 a
 really


really
 good
 meeting
 uh
 we
 could
 not
 have


done
 it
 by
 email
 it's
 been
 really
 really


exciting
 uh
 engaging
 I'm
 wrapping
 it
 up


uh
 hopefully
 in
 a
 good
 way
 and
 uh
 look


forward
 to
 staying
 in
 touch
 well
 I


appreciate
 it
 and
 I
 will
 say
 this
 so
 we


talked
 about
 the
 characteristics
 of
 a


great
 meeting
 and
 we
 we
 emphasize
 this


notion
 of
 stewardship
 you
 have
 been
 a


fabulous
 Steward

 you
 came
 into


this
 meeting
 you
 were
 well
 prepared
 you


read
 my
 content

 listened
 you
 engaged

 thank

 much

 and
