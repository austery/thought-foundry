[Music]


hi
 everybody
 and
 welcome
 to
 the
 podcast


in
 good
 company
 now
 when
 I
 started
 in


finance
 30
 years
 ago
 uh
 one
 of
 the
 first


companies
 I
 met
 was
 Atlas
 Copco
 in


Stockholm
 and
 wow
 what
 a
 company
 I've


been
 follow
 them
 closely
 uh
 ever
 since


and
 they
 just
 never
 seem
 to
 stop


surprising
 on
 the
 positive
 side
 and
 one


of
 the
 things
 that
 is
 driving
 this
 is


the
 unique
 corpor
 culture
 the
 way
 they


uh
 basically
 produce
 some
 of
 the
 best


cosos
 uh
 in
 the
 world
 and
 today
 we
 are


really
 lucky
 because
 we
 have
 matz


ramstrom
 joining
 us
 who's
 now
 uh


stepping
 down
 as
 a
 CEO
 so
 now
 that
 he
 is


no
 longer
 the
 CEO
 he
 can
 tell
 us
 all


about
 it
 very
 welcome
 mats
 thank
 you
 so


much
 just
 want
 to
 kick
 off
 first
 um
 how


would
 you
 describe
 the
 co
 culture
 at


Atlas
 but
 I
 think
 it's
 a
 Competitive


Edge
 for
 the
 company
 um
 it's
 not
 so


tangible
 uh
 what
 it's
 all
 about
 but
 we


are
 trying
 really
 to
 set
 high
 standards


for
 ourself
 um
 not
 so
 difficult
 really


but
 we're
 talking
 about
 you
 know
 respect


for
 people
 show
 them
 up
 showing
 up
 on


time
 prepared
 take
 ownership
 and
 we
 have


this
 new
 excuses
 uh
 culture
 where
 you


actually
 need
 to


deliver
 uh
 so
 the
 decentralized
 we
 are


recognized
 for
 that
 we
 give
 a
 lot
 of


freedom
 to
 people
 but
 we
 also
 read
 give


them
 a
 lot
 of
 accountability
 for
 to
 get


the
 job
 done
 and
 um
 to
 build
 that


culture
 you
 need
 to
 trust
 people
 uh
 and


we
 normally
 say
 that
 the
 one
 that
 is


closest
 to
 the
 problem
 or
 the


opportunity
 is
 also
 closest
 to
 the


solution
 so
 we
 work
 a
 lot
 on
 that
 to


make
 sure
 that
 we
 don't
 need
 to
 escalate


a
 lot
 in
 the
 organization
 and
 then
 I


think
 the
 customer
 focus
 that
 we
 should


really
 bring
 uh
 tangible
 values
 to
 our


customers
 and
 otherwise
 it
 might
 not
 be


worth
 doing
 as
 we
 spend
 a
 lot
 of
 time
 on


that
 we
 talk
 about
 racing
 red
 flags
 when


we
 see
 things
 going
 in
 the
 wrong
 way


that
 that
 is
 absolutely
 okay
 and
 and
 um


I
 had
 this
 job
 interview
 the
 other
 day


and
 the
 person
 I
 interview
 finalized


interview
 by
 saying
 she
 said
 to
 me
 that


I'm
 sorry
 what
 this
 but
 she
 said
 you


cannot
 your
 way
 to
 the
 top
 of


this
 company
 you
 need
 to
 deliver
 and
 I


think
 that's
 summarize
 a
 little
 bit
 what


we
 are
 trying
 to
 accomplish
 here
 with


the
 decentralized
 organization
 that


people
 actually
 are
 accountable
 to


deliver
 results
 or
 making
 changes
 that


we
 continuously
 improve
 so
 M
 when
 we
 met


in
 Stockholm
 you
 said
 um
 um
 one
 of
 the


things
 at
 Atlas
 is
 that
 uh
 there
 is


always
 a
 better
 way
 and
 I
 remember
 I
 met


the
 CFO
 long
 time
 ago
 and
 he
 said
 you


know
 what
 you
 come
 into
 our
 leader
 group


meetings
 and
 even
 when
 things
 are
 really


well
 you
 get
 the
 impression
 that
 we
 are


just
 about
 to
 go
 bust
 because
 we
 are


focusing
 in
 always
 on
 just
 how
 we
 can


improve
 things
 so
 how
 do
 you
 create
 this


kind
 of
 Relentless
 pursuit
 of
 uh


Improvement
 in
 the
 organization
 but
 this


this
 one
 saying
 by
 one
 of
 our
 owners
 I


think
 it's
 good
 the
 only
 tradition
 worth


keeping
 is
 the
 one
 of
 change
 U
 we
 talk


about
 that
 is
 always
 a
 better
 way
 and


it's
 really
 embedded
 in
 the
 in
 the


culture
 and
 sometimes
 we
 might
 be
 too


critical
 but
 they
 always
 ask
 us
 the


question
 can
 we
 do
 this
 in
 a
 better
 way


um
 so
 we
 really
 really
 encourage
 people


curiosity
 don't
 be
 afraid
 of
 change
 um


and
 we
 use
 these
 three
 Horizons
 to
 make


sure
 that
 we
 really
 look
 for
 we
 are


present
 what
 can
 we
 do
 short
 term
 um
 but


then
 we
 talk
 midterm
 but
 also
 we
 talk
 in


the
 future
 then
 and
 that
 very
 much


linked
 to
 um
 the
 global
 Trends
 you
 say


what
 what
 do
 we
 need
 to
 explore
 to


understand
 this
 in
 a
 better
 way
 um
 and


then
 the
 financial
 performance
 is


extremely
 transparent
 so
 um
 it
 seems


like
 you
 put
 numbers
 on
 everything
 and


um
 in
 order
 to
 make
 everybody


accountable
 just
 um
 tell
 me
 about
 that


process
 no
 what
 we
 are
 um


as
 I
 see
 it
 at
 least
 a
 quite
 a
 high


performance
 oriented
 company
 and
 it


might
 sound
 scary
 to
 many
 but
 I
 think


high
 performance
 people
 like
 that
 uh
 and


the
 way
 for
 us
 to
 do
 that
 in
 the


decentralized
 mod
 is
 to
 give
 the
 trust


but
 at
 the
 same
 time
 every
 month
 we
 do


up
 to
 600
 profit
 and
 loss
 and
 balance


sheets
 so
 we
 knew
 really
 to
 Benchmark
 in


between
 we
 knew
 when
 to
 call
 to


congratulate
 someone
 for
 a
 fantastic
 job


but
 we
 also
 call
 to
 see
 if
 we
 can


support
 to
 um
 to
 improve
 the
 the


business
 and
 everything
 is
 measured


against
 what
 we
 call
 a
 mission
 which
 is


the
 the
 assignment
 you
 get
 when
 you
 get


a
 new
 job
 uh
 so
 with
 the
 authority
 the


decentralized
 it
 comes
 with
 a
 very
 clear


responsibility
 and
 accountability
 for


for
 the
 result
 as
 well
 so
 that's
 how
 we


do
 it
 you
 cannot
 really
 hide
 in
 Atlas


coko
 anywhere
 tell
 me
 about
 this
 Mission


I
 thought
 that
 was
 really
 interesting
 we


don't
 have
 that
 right
 but
 when
 you
 get
 a


job
 at
 Atlas
 you
 basically
 set
 a


threeyear
 Target
 just
 how
 does
 this
 work


no
 but
 if
 let's
 assume
 that
 I
 would
 hire


you
 in
 in
 in
 in
 a
 position
 for
 something


and
 then
 we
 as
 a
 group
 um
 we
 believe


that
 maybe
 what
 is
 the
 full
 potential


plan
 for
 this
 uh
 financially
 should
 we


change
 the
 way
 we
 go
 to
 market
 is
 there


products
 missing
 so
 we
 set
 kind
 of
 a


little
 bit
 of
 a
 framework
 we
 say
 well


this
 is
 what
 comes
 with
 the
 job
 um
 but
 I


think
 the
 the
 interesting
 part
 is
 is
 the


vision
 which
 we
 say
 is
 then
 that's
 the


the
 one
 that's
 been
 employed
 in
 this


position
 gather
 his
 team
 to
 say
 how
 do


we
 accomplish
 this
 what
 kind
 of


resources
 do
 we
 need
 how
 do
 we
 get
 it


done
 and
 we
 call
 it
 the
 full
 potential


plan
 and
 then
 they
 counter
 with
 this
 and


say
 well
 if
 you
 want
 this
 you
 know
 I


need
 these
 resources
 I
 need
 a
 little
 bit


more
 of
 that
 you
 need
 to
 help
 me
 out


with
 competence
 in
 this
 area
 so
 it


becomes
 a
 very
 friendly
 handshake
 where


both
 have
 been
 part
 of
 developing
 the


plan
 and
 as
 you
 said
 it's
 normally


between
 3
 to
 5
 years
 here
 so
 I
 think


it's
 short
 enough
 to
 be
 very
 tangible


but
 maybe
 long
 enough
 to
 be
 Visionary


and
 and
 and
 some
 stretch
 goals
 there
 and


and
 we
 believe
 that
 it
 creates
 you
 know


not
 just
 the
 focus
 on
 the
 results
 but
 it


creates
 a
 focus
 on
 the
 right
 activities


to
 drive
 the
 result
 and
 activities
 must


come
 before
 uh
 the
 result
 comes
 so
 we


are
 kind
 of
 trying
 to
 create
 a
 common


view
 on
 on
 the
 activity
 that
 needs
 to


happen
 and
 in
 the
 same
 way
 you
 put
 your


management
 team
 and
 the
 in
 the
 same
 boat


and
 say
 well
 this
 is
 what
 we
 agreed
 upon


this
 is
 what
 we're
 going
 to
 try
 to
 do
 so


sometimes
 we
 have
 success
 and
 sometimes


we
 fail
 and
 then
 we
 change
 but
 I
 think


that
 togetherness
 that
 we
 have
 built


this
 plan
 together
 has
 been
 very


important
 for
 feeling
 that
 I
 own
 this


plan
 so
 when
 you
 fail
 at
 Atlas
 what


happens
 I
 mean
 we
 can
 discuss
 about


failure
 and
 if
 someone
 takes
 an


initiative
 I
 think
 business
 and
 risk


goes
 hand
 in
 hand
 you
 need
 to
 take
 new


initiatives
 to
 try
 different
 things
 and


if
 it
 comes
 with
 with
 the
 best


intentions
 and
 of
 case
 it
 doesn't


succeed
 in
 the
 way
 we
 hoped
 for
 is
 it


really
 a
 mistake
 or
 is
 it
 a
 learning
 and


we
 tend
 to
 believe
 it's
 more
 about


learning
 we
 don't
 want
 to
 repeat
 the


mistakes
 but
 do
 we
 want
 to
 penalize


someone
 for
 trying
 I
 don't
 think
 that


creates
 a
 good
 culture
 so
 for
 us
 it's


not
 so
 much
 a
 mistake
 it's
 learning
 we


move
 on
 we
 try
 something
 new
 but
 we
 will


not
 penalize
 people
 for
 being
 ambitious


and
 trying
 things
 because
 we
 need
 those


actions
 how
 do
 you
 share
 the
 mistakes


across
 the
 organization
 we're
 quite
 open


actually
 um
 uh
 we
 meet
 um
 between


general
 managers
 we
 meet
 between


divisional
 presidents
 and
 um
 the
 best


sessions
 we
 have
 is
 normally
 when
 we


share
 success
 and
 things
 that
 we
 could


have
 done
 better
 internally
 and
 people


are
 not
 afraid
 of
 sharing
 since
 we
 have


this
 culture
 or
 of
 that
 we
 need
 to
 move


forward
 all
 the
 time
 so
 it's
 kind
 of
 an


openness
 uh
 between
 them
 and
 we're


trying
 to
 build
 this
 even
 if
 you're
 kind


of
 big
 company
 we're
 trying
 to
 build
 the


networks
 between
 people
 so
 that
 they
 can


reach
 out
 without
 me
 knowing
 and
 and


learn
 from
 each
 other
 as
 well
 matz


what's
 the
 biggest
 mistake
 you
 have
 made


at
 Atlas


wow


it's
 patience
 I
 think
 I
 I'm
 very
 brought


up
 in
 this
 Swedish
 way
 that
 you
 give
 a


second
 chance
 which
 I
 think
 is
 is
 a
 good


thing
 but
 sometimes
 they
 say
 that


patients
 consider
 to
 be
 virtue
 but
 maybe


hurry
 up
 should
 be
 one
 uh
 instead
 um
 the


one
 thing
 I
 think
 that
 we
 might
 end
 up


with
 soon
 and
 you
 can
 connect
 I
 was


thinking
 about
 it
 the
 other
 day
 that
 you


can
 connect
 on
 teams
 or
 you
 can
 connect


on


Zoom
 um
 and
 I
 think
 it's
 a
 fantastic


tool
 where
 you
 can
 reach
 out
 to
 anywhere


anywhere
 in
 the
 world
 but
 if
 we
 use


those
 tools
 not
 to
 meet
 each
 other
 then


I
 think
 that
 would
 be
 probably
 my


biggest
 mistake
 because
 I
 think
 that


culture
 Innovation
 happens
 in
 this
 these


meetings
 where
 people
 actually
 get


together
 uh
 so
 I
 try
 to
 say
 well
 these


are
 the
 good
 things
 with
 these
 new
 tools


don't
 stop
 traveling
 don't
 stop
 meeting


with
 people
 don't
 stop
 you
 know
 sharing


so
 for
 me
 um
 I
 spend
 a
 lot
 of
 time
 on


that
 to
 to
 still
 to
 travel
 to
 make
 sure


that
 people
 meet
 and
 arrange
 the
 things


that
 people
 meet
 and
 uh
 I
 think
 that


could
 be
 um
 a
 challenge
 if
 you
 stop


meeting
 with
 people
 now
 how
 do
 you


celebrate
 success
 at


Atlas
 sometimes
 we
 we
 we
 don't
 stop
 and


celebrate
 um
 we're
 kind
 of
 hard
 on


ourself
 but
 uh
 yes
 we
 do
 try
 to
 stop
 um


and
 last
 year
 we
 celebrated
 150
 years


and
 uh
 I
 think
 that
 was
 a
 fantastic


event
 we
 could
 see
 throughout
 history


how
 we
 have
 constantly
 changed
 but
 the


the
 cool
 thing
 with
 the
 celebration
 was


that
 we
 spent
 all
 almost
 all
 time


looking
 into
 the
 future
 and
 making
 sure


that
 we
 really
 understand
 the


opportunities
 going
 forward
 this
 was


just
 after
 the
 covid
 years
 and
 we
 really


put
 the
 company
 in
 front
 of
 being


industrial
 but
 also
 being
 a
 technology


company
 linked
 to
 sustainability
 and
 and


some
 of
 the
 mega
 trans
 we
 see
 this


concept
 of
 Celebration
 is
 quite


interesting
 you
 know
 I
 saw
 an
 interview


with
 with
 the
 tennis
 player
 fedra
 and


they
 asked
 him
 you
 know
 how
 do
 you
 how


do
 you
 celebrate
 he
 said
 well
 when
 I
 was


young
 I
 never
 celebrated
 anything
 I
 just


you
 know
 if
 I
 won
 a
 match
 l
 on
 that
 day


I
 was
 back
 on
 the
 court
 and
 started
 to


train
 for
 the
 next
 one
 but
 now
 when
 I'm


a
 bit
 older
 if
 I
 win
 something
 big
 I


will
 actually
 take
 the
 evening
 off
 have


a
 glass
 of
 champagne
 with
 my
 wife
 we
 we


should
 really
 learn
 from
 him
 he


fantastic
 play
 isn't
 absolutely
 now
 um


just
 um
 um
 moving
 on
 to
 to
 kind
 of


career
 progression
 what
 do
 you
 look
 for


when
 you
 hire


people
 um
 myself
 um
 I
 always
 been


triggered
 uh
 by


finding
 people
 that
 are


curious
 uh
 the
 culture
 fit
 is


important
 um
 I
 don't
 you
 like
 to
 meet


people
 that
 are
 passionate
 whatever
 you


do
 I
 like
 that
 it
 it
 also
 helps
 you
 when


you
 meet
 with


customers
 uh
 the
 willingness
 to
 learn
 to


continue
 to
 learn
 new
 things
 um
 I
 think


has
 been
 extremely
 important
 and
 then


the
 basics
 for
 us
 is
 everyone
 has
 a


customer
 so
 you
 need
 to
 understand
 how


you
 create
 value
 for
 your
 internal


customer
 or
 for
 your
 external
 customer


so
 experience
 is
 comes
 with
 the
 age


normally
 you
 can
 say
 but
 I
 think
 it
 can


be
 really
 accelerated
 the
 one
 thing
 that


I
 get
 a
 lot
 of
 question
 Al
 is
 the
 work


life
 balance
 and
 I'm
 not
 so
 comfortable


with
 that
 question
 and
 the
 reason
 being


that
 it
 sounds
 almost
 like
 work
 is


something
 negative
 and
 and
 and
 the


balance
 and
 the
 spare
 time
 is
 is
 is
 is


the
 positive
 part
 of
 it
 and
 for
 me
 the


work
 I've
 done
 over
 the
 many
 years
 if
 I


wouldn't
 enjoy
 the
 work
 part
 if
 I


wouldn't
 feel
 passionate
 about
 that
 and


it
 gives
 me


energy
 maybe
 I'm
 in
 the
 wrong
 job
 so
 for


for
 me
 you
 need
 to
 of
 course
 there
 needs


to
 be
 space
 for
 other
 things
 in
 life
 but


I
 think
 it's
 important
 also
 to
 feel
 that


you
 stepped
 into
 something
 you
 believe


it's
 fun
 it's
 passionate
 and
 if
 you
 lose


energy
 every
 day
 then
 then
 I
 you
 should


look
 for
 something
 else


so
 maybe
 when
 I
 get
 that
 questions
 too


early
 in
 an
 interview
 maybe
 I
 start
 to


hesitate
 a
 little
 bit
 what's
 important


well
 we
 had
 ellon
 musk
 on
 the
 podcast


recently
 and
 uh
 he
 he
 talked
 about
 the


ultra
 hard
 culture
 where
 you
 work
 100


hours
 and
 so
 on
 for
 a
 period
 of
 two


years
 now


um
 how
 much
 do
 you
 work
 I
 mean
 the


higher
 up
 you
 go
 the
 more
 you
 think
 than


you
 actually
 do
 physical
 work
 so
 um
 I


try
 to
 be
 always


available
 um
 I
 don't
 count
 the
 hours
 and


we
 normally
 say
 that
 we
 work
 until
 we


are
 successful
 I
 I
 don't
 demand
 people


to
 you
 know
 work
 80
 hours
 a
 week
 but
 uh


I
 do
 demand
 that
 we
 are
 successful
 um
 so


that's
 what
 I
 I
 don't
 really
 measure


time
 in
 that
 sense
 um
 I
 mean
 you
 can
 you


can
 work
 a
 lot
 of
 hour
 about
 getting


nothing
 done
 so
 I
 think
 the
 result


counts
 and
 people
 can
 find
 different


ways
 of
 of
 being
 uh
 successful
 so
 for
 me


it's
 not
 the
 hours
 it's
 the
 result
 a
 lot


of
 the
 hiring
 you
 do
 is
 internal
 hires


what
 are
 the
 what
 are
 the
 pros
 and
 cons


on
 this
 yeah
 uh
 the
 experience
 that
 they


get
 with
 an
 internal
 hire
 uh
 KN


customers
 internally
 or
 externally
 I


think
 puts
 a
 foundation
 for
 Success
 um


all
 that
 said
 though
 that
 we
 could
 miss


out
 on
 on
 new
 ideas
 of
 course
 uh
 diverse


experience
 so
 we
 do
 hire
 externally
 as


well
 but
 maybe
 it
 is
 85
 15
 so
 um
 but


what
 we
 do
 get
 is
 this
 really
 good


understanding
 uh
 and
 then
 we
 open
 up
 all


jobs
 with
 exception
 on
 mine
 uh
 to
 what


we
 call
 an
 internal
 job
 market
 so
 you


need
 to
 drive
 your
 career
 yourself
 you


need
 to
 find
 what
 path
 you
 want
 to
 take


and
 and
 therefore
 we
 get
 people
 everyone


knows
 they
 have
 an
 opportunity
 I
 think


that's
 a
 very
 good
 thing
 instead
 of
 that


the
 job
 has
 been
 promised
 to
 someone


else
 um
 you
 can
 always
 apply
 but
 you


need
 to
 show
 the
 drive
 and
 the
 success


uh
 to
 actually
 be
 qualified
 to
 get
 to


the
 to
 the
 next
 level
 but
 we
 do
 both
 uh


but
 we
 do
 see
 that
 our
 customers
 are


getting
 more
 and
 more
 they
 want


expertise
 uh
 knowledge
 uh
 so
 it
 takes
 a


few
 years
 to
 build
 up
 um
 the
 competence


that
 we
 need
 you
 you
 are
 Keen
 to
 get
 uh


young
 people
 into
 big
 roles
 how
 do
 you


how
 do
 you
 make
 sure
 that
 that
 happens


yeah
 I
 do
 um
 I
 believe
 that
 people
 have


much
 greater
 potential
 than
 they
 think


themselves
 some
 time
 uh
 so
 if
 someone
 is


passionate
 and
 drive
 and
 willing
 to


learn
 I'm
 I'm
 willing
 to
 give
 them
 a


chance
 um
 I
 became
 a
 general
 manager


when
 I
 was
 33
 so
 someone
 gave
 me
 that


trust
 and
 I
 want
 to
 pay
 that
 forward
 to


the
 next
 generation
 and
 and
 so
 far
 it's


not
 so
 much
 about
 age
 it's
 more
 about


the
 the
 competence
 and
 the
 drive
 uh
 and


we
 are
 willing
 to
 help
 if
 someone
 is
 has


a
 shortcoming
 in
 some
 area
 if
 it's


Finance
 or
 sales
 whatever
 it
 might
 be
 so


we
 we
 can
 always
 help
 out
 but
 I
 also


like
 to
 work
 with
 people
 that
 has
 that


drive
 and
 energy
 uh
 and
 like
 the
 other


way
 around
 is
 is
 I
 don't
 think
 that's
 so


engaging
 with
 someone
 that
 has
 a
 lot
 of


competence
 but
 have
 a
 negative
 view
 on
 a


lot
 of
 things
 so
 I
 really
 like
 to


promote
 people
 that
 has
 the
 drive
 and


how
 do
 you
 see
 that
 a
 young
 person
 is


ready
 be
 WR
 I
 mean
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day


for
 us
 you
 you
 you're
 judged
 by
 your


results
 so
 that
 you
 are
 uh
 ready
 for
 a


new
 uh
 bigger
 rule
 is
 normally
 that
 you


have
 done
 very
 well
 for
 yourself
 in
 in


the
 present
 rule
 um
 we
 do
 not
 do
 career


planning
 uh
 but
 we
 do
 help
 people
 with


the
 gaps
 if
 they
 say
 well
 I
 like
 to
 move


into
 this
 position
 this
 is
 my
 ambition


then
 we
 have
 internal
 external
 trainings


that
 can
 help
 them
 out
 um
 to
 make
 sure


that
 they
 have
 the
 experi
 experience


that
 they
 can
 actually
 apply
 for
 the
 for


the
 next
 role
 how
 do
 you
 work
 with


mentorship
 um
 we
 do
 for
 special


categories
 we
 we
 um
 trying
 to
 help


people
 down
 to
 have
 a
 mentor
 it
 could


both
 be
 internal
 and
 external
 and
 I


think
 the
 mentors
 Ru
 in
 many
 many
 times


is
 just
 to
 to
 help
 them
 believe
 in


themselves
 that
 they
 are
 ready
 for
 for


the
 next
 step
 um
 on
 the
 other
 side
 isn't


a
 good
 leader
 isn't
 a
 good
 leader
 Mentor


almost
 every
 day
 and
 I
 think
 that's
 even


better
 if
 we
 can
 have
 good
 leadership
 on


a
 daily
 base
 to
 people
 of
 course
 I


understand
 there
 are
 things
 you
 want


don't
 want
 to
 bring
 up
 with
 your
 boss


maybe
 that
 you
 need
 a
 mentor
 for
 uh
 but


we
 use
 both
 uh
 but
 I'm
 really
 trying
 to


have
 a
 coaching
 culture
 uh
 from
 from
 our


leadership
 so
 that
 our
 our
 team
 is


available
 to
 the
 employees
 on
 on
 on
 The


Daily
 base
 and
 I
 think
 that's
 even
 more


important
 and
 the
 mentorship
 program
 is


um
 it's
 decentralized


it
 could
 be
 both
 uh
 it
 could
 be
 uh
 a


region
 that
 runs
 it
 and
 we
 normally
 then


try
 to
 go
 between
 the
 business
 area
 so


they
 get
 exposed
 to
 other
 leaders
 H
 it


could
 also
 be
 external
 proven
 that


someone
 wants
 uh
 help
 with
 something


then
 we
 can
 help
 them
 to
 find
 someone


outside
 the
 group
 but
 normally
 it's


regional
 uh
 we
 don't
 do
 so
 many
 group


programs
 but
 we
 are
 eager
 them
 to
 you


know
 Network
 between
 the
 divisions
 and


the
 business
 so
 they
 get
 to
 new
 new
 new


business
 and
 other
 people
 as
 well
 uh
 M


moving
 on
 to
 um
 leadership
 you
 mentioned


that
 um
 atas
 is
 150
 years
 old
 and
 the


incredible
 stat
 here
 is
 that
 you've
 had


only
 12
 CEOs
 during
 150
 years
 true
 um


there
 can
 hardly
 be
 a
 company
 in
 Europe


with
 those
 kind
 of
 numbers
 right
 with


that
 kind
 of
 uh
 duration
 of
 leadership


it's
 just
 um
 incredible
 what
 explains


this
 um
 when
 we
 talk
 about


uh
 good
 leadership
 we're
 talking
 about


creating
 sustainable
 results
 uh
 and
 I


think
 the
 important
 part
 is
 sustainable


that
 we
 do
 something
 that
 is
 really


really
 good
 uh
 for
 our
 customers
 that


comes
 to
 the
 benefit
 for
 our
 employees


uh
 of
 course
 uh
 Society
 but
 also
 then


the
 shareholders
 but
 we
 always
 start
 in


that
 order
 uh
 so
 I
 think
 sustainable


results
 is
 is
 one
 of
 the
 more
 important


things
 and
 the
 older
 I
 grew
 and
 higher


up
 I
 getting
 the
 organization
 you


realize
 that
 leadership
 is
 a
 lot
 about


uh
 actually
 making
 other
 people
 it's
 not


so
 much
 about
 yourself
 it's
 not
 making


making
 other
 people
 uh
 see
 their
 full


potential
 executing
 on
 their
 full
 po


really
 be
 that
 to
 ask
 the
 questions
 and


try
 to
 figure
 out
 how
 you
 can
 get
 people


to
 the
 next
 level
 so
 I
 think
 it's
 a
 lot


about
 the
 people
 caring
 about
 people


making
 sure
 that
 they
 get
 the
 resources


and
 the
 ability
 them
 to
 to
 get
 reach


their
 f
 potential
 and
 I
 think
 that
 also


with
 the
 23
 Division
 and
 four
 business


areas
 all
 divisional
 presidents
 have
 the


you
 know
 the
 full
 value
 chain
 so
 they


can
 practice
 just
 like
 a
 CU
 on


everything
 from
 R&D
 to
 to
 sales
 and


Logistics
 and
 I
 think
 that's
 a
 way
 of
 of


building
 talents
 in
 the
 organization
 as


well
 but
 good
 leadership
 for
 me
 is
 is


really
 to
 surround
 yourself
 with
 with


talent
 and
 and
 maybe
 the
 talent
 you


don't
 have
 yourself
 to
 build
 that


diverse
 team
 and
 I
 think
 as
 a
 team
 you


can
 be
 very
 very
 successful
 and
 that's


what
 we
 are
 trying
 to
 to
 do
 in
 atas
 coko


how
 has
 your
 leadership
 style
 developed


with
 experience
 and
 age
 it's
 a
 good


question
 since
 I
 had
 my
 last
 management


meeting
 uh
 last
 week
 and
 uh
 since
 my


management
 team
 they
 had
 at
 dinner
 then


we
 had
 some
 speeches
 and
 um
 if
 I


summarize
 that
 what
 came
 out
 with
 some


of
 them
 I
 am
 proud
 of
 some
 I'm
 not
 so


proud
 of
 uh
 but
 they
 also
 they
 said
 that


they
 felt
 that
 I
 always
 stand
 behind
 um


the
 people
 um
 and
 the
 promises
 uh
 that
 I


made
 to
 them
 uh
 that's
 one
 of
 the
 things


that
 they
 always
 said
 that
 okay
 you
 do


that
 you
 you
 back
 back
 us
 up
 uh
 so
 I


think
 that
 is
 one
 one
 key
 key
 things


that
 they
 liked
 about
 it
 um
 really


changing
 the
 company
 from
 industrial
 to


to
 be
 more
 of
 a
 technology
 uh
 company


has
 been
 another
 key
 for
 them
 that
 they


can
 see
 that
 uh
 which
 I
 think
 is
 is


really
 really
 good
 uh
 I
 think
 that
 is


also
 how
 we
 position
 ourself
 for
 the


future
 to
 be
 be
 link
 to
 the
 good
 microt


Trends
 um
 then
 on


the
 less
 positive
 side
 I
 think
 they
 also


said
 i'
 a
 little
 bit
 too
 stubborn
 U
 and


too
 straightforward
 sometimes
 so
 I
 I


need
 still
 to
 work
 on
 that
 um
 we
 also


talked
 a
 little
 bit
 about
 the
 setting


high
 standards
 um
 um
 focusing
 on
 the


results
 so
 I
 think
 it's
 been
 that
 was


the
 feedback
 I
 got
 and
 and
 and
 I
 I


recognize
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 things
 and
 and


um
 appreciate
 that
 they
 were
 so
 honest


with
 me
 as
 well
 to
 bring
 up
 the
 things


that
 I
 could
 do
 better
 the
 straight


talking
 how
 does
 that
 work
 when
 you're


are
 a
 global
 company
 and
 you
 have


different
 cultures
 in
 different
 parts
 of


the
 world
 I
 mean
 it's
 not
 everywhere
 you


can
 be
 a
 straight
 talker
 for
 me
 it's
 it


started
 with
 um
 uh
 when
 I
 was
 fairly


young
 uh
 I
 had
 to
 let
 someone
 go


um
 and
 I
 talk
 to
 this
 person
 and
 I
 said


well
 due
 to
 these


reasons
 uh
 I
 have
 to
 let
 you
 go
 um
 it


was
 one
 of
 my
 toughest
 discussions
 at


when
 I
 was
 at
 a
 young
 age
 and
 the
 person


was
 not
 angry
 um
 but
 he
 left
 uh
 the
 day


back
 day
 after
 he
 came
 back
 into
 me
 and


said
 you
 know
 I'm
 not
 so
 upset
 with
 you


mat
 but
 I'm
 very
 upset
 with
 my
 previous


bosses
 and
 my
 colleagues
 that
 they
 have


not
 brought
 this
 up
 to
 me
 before
 and
 and


I
 do
 realize
 that
 in
 in
 some
 part
 uh


that
 honesty
 and
 being
 straightforward


is
 an
 honest
 way
 to
 help
 people
 actually


to
 improve


performance
 uh
 so
 from
 that
 day
 on
 I


promised
 myself
 at
 least
 to
 be
 very


straight
 when
 I
 see
 something
 that's


good
 or
 something
 that
 I
 think
 should


could
 uh
 improve
 uh
 more
 or
 less
 to
 give


people
 uh
 an
 opportunity
 to
 to
 improve


and
 when
 I
 started
 2017
 with
 the
 group
 I


was
 a
 little
 bit
 afraid
 that
 I
 came
 from


Industrial
 Technologies
 and
 then
 the


compressor
 was
 the
 biggest
 business
 area


we
 had
 vacuum
 and
 also
 uh
 Power


technique
 then
 uh
 and
 I
 felt
 well
 okay


so
 how
 will
 my
 way
 of
 doing
 things
 be


accepted
 but
 when
 I
 started
 to
 meet
 our


people
 around
 the
 world
 I
 I
 realized


that
 the
 atasu
 culture
 is
 so
 strong
 it's


almost
 you
 know
 as
 strong
 as
 the
 the


local
 culture
 with
 with
 some
 adaptation


but
 it
 was
 really
 easy
 to
 feel
 at
 home


and
 and
 and
 focus
 on
 on
 a
 lot
 of
 things


that
 we
 discussed
 in
 the
 beginning
 uh
 so


for
 me
 it's
 been
 a
 fair
 EAS
 actually
 to


be
 straightforward
 and
 and
 the
 culture


is
 the
 important
 part
 that
 brings
 it's


the
 glue
 that
 brings
 us
 together


independently
 where
 we're
 from
 uh
 the


independent
 of
 gender
 or
 religion
 I


think
 that
 is
 the
 thing
 for
 us
 the


Scandinavian
 um
 Leadership
 Model
 is


quite
 consensus
 driven
 how
 does
 that


work
 for
 me
 it's
 been
 like
 I
 normally


say
 to
 people
 that
 swets
 uh
 I
 take
 us
 as


an
 example
 then
 and
 say
 that
 okay
 it


will
 take
 a
 little
 bit
 time
 until
 we
 get


to
 the
 decision
 uh
 I
 will
 listen
 to
 you


all
 but
 just
 to
 be
 clear
 at
 the
 end
 of


the
 day
 I
 I
 will
 take
 the
 decision
 um


but
 I
 think
 consensus
 takes
 a
 little
 bit


more
 time
 until
 you
 make
 your
 decision


but
 then
 on
 the
 other
 side
 then
 everyone


is
 on
 board
 they
 understand
 why
 we
 do


things
 and
 then
 execution
 in
 a
 distant


organization
 works
 much
 better
 I
 think


if
 you
 have
 the
 other
 way
 it's
 more
 top


down
 that
 the
 leader
 takes
 the
 decision


with
 without
 people
 understanding
 the


reasons
 then
 you
 need
 to
 explain
 the


reasons
 when
 you
 actually
 started
 the


process
 so
 maybe
 I
 don't
 think
 there
 is


a
 a
 winner
 among
 these
 two
 ways
 of


approaching
 things
 but
 I
 think
 you


either
 you
 gain
 speed
 in
 the
 beginning


or
 you
 gain
 speed
 in
 the
 execution
 and


and
 I
 think
 we
 are
 I
 mean
 you
 could
 say


that
 we
 are
 a
 Swedish
 head
 office


company
 but
 we
 are
 not
 so
 Swedish
 in
 the


way
 we
 do
 things
 it's
 it's
 fairly
 direct


uh
 and
 it's
 very
 very
 internatural
 the


think
 we
 do
 things
 do
 you
 think
 there's


something
 happening
 in
 the
 world
 and
 the


way
 we
 the
 way
 we
 live
 and
 work
 and


think
 which
 makes
 the
 Scandinavian


Leadership


Model
 uh
 more


advantageous
 uh
 for
 me
 it's
 been
 um
 um


independently
 I
 love
 sports
 um
 and
 when


I
 see
 U
 strong
 teams
 being
 built
 uh
 I


think
 you
 engage
 people
 I
 think
 that's
 a


way
 in
 the
 Scandinavian
 uh
 but
 that
 they


engag
 them
 we
 ask
 them
 questions
 even
 if


they
 might
 not
 have
 the
 key
 knowledge


they
 they
 are
 they
 feel
 that
 they're


part
 of
 something
 bigger
 uh
 so
 for
 me


it's
 always
 been
 an
 upside
 to
 that
 to


engage
 people
 making
 sure
 say
 hello
 you


know
 have
 respect
 for
 people
 always


return
 phone
 calls
 etc
 etc
 it
 doesn't


matter
 uh
 everyone
 is
 important
 if


you're
 in
 this
 organization
 you're


important
 otherwise
 you
 wouldn't
 be
 here


uh
 so
 for
 me
 that
 way
 of
 engaging
 people


have
 been
 fantastic
 and
 I
 just
 steal


from
 Sports
 how
 they
 can
 see
 how
 they


build
 their
 teams
 and
 you
 know
 how
 they


engage
 people
 and
 I
 love
 that
 you


returning
 calls
 when
 we
 met
 in
 Sweden


you
 talked
 about
 on
 Ru
 of
 th
 said
 you


have
 an
 atlas
 so
 when
 do
 you
 how
 how


quickly
 do
 you
 return
 calls
 and
 we


normally
 say
 that
 we
 uh
 should
 return


phone
 calls
 within
 2
 hours
 and
 and
 all


Maes
 within
 24
 hours
 sometimes
 you
 can


say
 well
 I
 will
 not
 be
 able
 to
 get
 to


your
 you
 know
 mail
 today
 I
 will
 I
 will


respond
 tomorrow
 but
 we
 we
 are
 eager


that
 the
 people
 standing
 in
 front
 of
 the


customers
 know
 that
 they
 will
 get
 an


answer
 because
 otherwise
 it
 could
 be


that
 yes
 I've
 seen
 your
 mail
 but
 I
 don't


have
 an
 answer
 answer
 so
 I
 have
 not


returned
 your
 phone
 call
 but
 at
 least


you
 need
 to
 be
 there
 you
 need
 to
 be


present
 and
 and
 that
 is
 a
 it's
 a
 very


simple
 but
 extremely
 good
 way
 to
 make


sure
 that
 you
 you
 have
 the
 speed
 in
 the


organization
 and
 you
 know
 when
 to
 to


expect
 someone
 to
 return
 a
 phone
 call
 or


a
 ma
 I
 think
 the
 returning
 uh
 of
 calls


and
 and
 mails
 is
 so
 interesting
 you
 know


if
 you
 if
 you
 return
 an
 email
 within
 one


minute
 it
 can
 be
 one
 sentence
 and
 people


are
 impressed
 that
 you
 are
 so
 quick
 yeah


if
 you
 if
 you
 return
 in
 24
 hours
 it


needs
 to
 be
 it
 needs
 to
 be
 a
 paragraph


and
 if
 you
 are
 like
 three
 days
 it
 needs


to
 be
 a
 page
 and
 so
 you
 save
 a
 lot
 of


time
 by
 being
 quick
 oh
 that's
 a
 good


that's
 a
 good
 Insight
 I
 think
 good
 do


you
 think
 there
 is
 a
 trade-off
 between


empathy
 and
 execution
 uh
 not
 at
 all
 no


why
 um
 I
 think
 you
 need
 it
 to
 be
 able
 to


execute
 quickly
 uh
 you
 need
 to
 know
 your


people
 uh
 you
 cannot
 manage
 anyone
 uh


people
 in
 the
 same
 way
 uh
 you
 really


need
 to
 understand
 what
 what
 the


situation
 they
 are
 what
 compet
 they
 have


and
 take
 advantage
 of
 of
 their
 strength


and
 making
 sure
 that
 that
 is
 part
 of
 the


execution
 so
 uh
 not
 at
 all
 I
 think


everyone
 in
 a
 high
 performance
 company


uh
 I
 had
 this
 excellent
 interview
 with


one
 of
 our
 new
 presidents
 and
 and
 and
 I


tried
 to
 explain
 to
 him
 that
 okay
 in


this
 job
 we
 we
 going
 to
 expect
 this
 and


that
 and
 that
 and
 he's
 been
 with
 the


company
 for
 quite
 a
 number
 of
 years
 and


he
 just
 looked
 at
 me
 and
 said
 you
 know


that's
 the
 reason
 why
 I'm
 in
 this


company
 I
 like
 this
 and
 I
 like
 yeah
 good


point
 uh
 so
 no
 I
 don't
 think
 there's
 a


conflict
 there
 now
 uh
 you
 are
 uh
 moving


on
 to
 become
 a
 board
 member
 of
 ABB
 which


by
 the
 way
 now
 has
 a
 Norwegian
 CEO


interestingly
 um
 but
 um
 what
 is
 what


does
 it
 take
 to
 make
 a
 good
 board
 or


what
 is
 a
 good
 board
 for
 you
 and
 when
 I


look
 at
 my
 board
 um
 it's
 um
 I
 like
 when


they're
 leaning
 forward
 they're


challenging
 me
 is
 that
 a
 better
 way
 to


do
 things
 they
 share
 their
 experience


uh
 they're
 available
 between
 the


meetings
 to
 me
 they
 respond
 quickly
 to


things
 that
 I
 like
 to
 discuss
 they
 have


the
 experience
 of
 things
 that
 that
 I


need
 and
 sometimes
 they're
 difficult


decision
 and
 you
 need
 to
 bounce
 that
 off


with
 someone
 uh
 I've
 been
 very
 lucky


with
 my
 shman
 we
 have
 always
 had
 a
 very


good
 connection
 I
 think
 we
 speak
 on
 at


least
 on
 the
 weekly
 base
 but
 the
 other


thing
 is
 that
 they
 stay
 out
 of
 the


operational
 things
 um
 which
 I
 find
 also


that
 there's
 a
 very
 clear
 line
 between


the
 giving
 advice


helping
 uh
 but
 you
 the
 one
 executing
 you


are
 the
 one
 executing
 on
 the
 strategy
 I


do
 present
 the
 strategy
 for
 them
 of


course
 and
 they
 say
 we
 like
 this
 part


but
 they
 challenge
 so
 for
 me
 it's
 been


that
 clear
 line
 between
 what
 what's
 my


responsibility
 and
 responsibility
 and


that
 I
 can
 take
 advantage
 of
 of
 the


experience
 that
 they
 have
 but
 I
 think
 we


should
 have
 boards
 that
 are
 leaning


forward
 that
 understands
 the
 business


that
 has
 time
 to
 you
 know
 visit
 our


sites
 to
 understand
 what
 we
 do
 that's


exactly
 intentional
 for
 me
 now
 and
 I


already
 have
 a
 program
 with
 ABB
 that
 I


going
 to
 visit
 sites
 and
 and
 countries


to
 understand
 the
 business
 because
 I


don't
 want
 to
 be
 just
 using
 my
 present


experience
 I
 need
 to
 understand
 what


what
 they
 do
 and
 how
 they
 accomplish


value
 for
 their
 customer
 so
 for
 me
 it's


been
 a
 very
 good
 balance
 with
 the
 board


I
 have
 had
 in
 in
 Nas
 coko
 is
 it


important
 that
 board
 members
 have
 um


industry
 knowledge
 I
 think
 you
 need
 both


um
 uh
 in
 a
 board
 um


people
 with
 industrial
 knowledge


Financial
 knowledge
 so
 on
 so
 forth
 but


the
 one
 thing
 that
 I've
 been
 thinking


about
 to
 to
 run
 and
 our
 company
 that
 172


billion
 in
 turnover
 it's
 difficult
 for


me
 as
 the
 CEO
 just
 to
 understand
 all
 the


applications
 and
 all
 the
 products
 so
 you


cannot
 expect
 that
 from
 from
 a
 board


member
 but
 to
 have
 the
 experience
 to
 be


able
 to
 without
 telling
 me
 uh
 or
 else


just
 saying
 have
 you
 thought
 about
 this


what
 do
 you
 do
 about
 pricing
 and
 is
 I


think
 that
 experience
 is
 is
 very


valuable
 to
 me
 um
 and
 that's
 the
 way
 I


see
 it
 should
 board
 members
 be


shareholders
 absolutely
 why
 yeah
 I
 think


they
 they
 are
 part
 of
 the
 future
 of
 the


company
 uh
 we
 have
 a
 commitment
 to
 our


uh
 shareholders
 uh
 and
 I
 think
 they


should
 be
 on
 on
 that
 Journey
 with
 us
 and


they
 show
 that
 they
 are
 engaged
 in
 the


company
 I
 think
 now
 you
 have
 one
 big


shareholder
 the
 wenberg
 group
 which
 has


been
 instrumental
 in
 in
 developing
 Atlas


and
 a
 lot
 of
 other
 very
 fine
 Swedish


companies
 what
 is
 the
 advantage
 of


having
 a
 big
 long-term
 shareholder
 um
 as


I
 mentioned
 in
 between
 then
 that
 in
 my


case
 I
 have
 a
 por
 Valen
 and
 and
 and
 Yan


forel
 on
 on
 my
 board
 representing
 the
 uh


the
 big
 owner
 investor
 uh
 I
 think
 they


have


177%
 and
 of
 course
 to
 be
 able
 to
 have
 a


long-term
 owner
 with
 a
 a
 long-term


interest
 in
 in
 the
 company
 makes
 it


possible
 to
 to
 make
 investments
 in
 R&D


that
 will
 pay
 off
 in
 a
 few
 years
 you


know
 to
 build
 new
 facilities
 to
 do


things
 more
 long
 term
 that
 it's
 needed


to
 be
 successful
 uh
 and
 they
 see
 it
 more


like
 when
 we
 sell
 it
 150
 years
 so
 what


do
 we
 do
 the
 coming
 150
 years
 uh
 then


they
 have
 a
 knowledge
 about
 the
 company


they're
 very
 good
 sounding
 board
 in


between
 meetings
 and
 they
 can
 s
 okay
 if


we
 look
 at
 this
 Acquisitions
 for
 example


we
 really
 support
 that
 this
 is
 where


we're
 heading
 um
 so
 so
 for
 me
 that's


been
 it's
 been
 very
 good
 to
 have
 someone


that
 is
 solid
 longterm
 and
 also
 there
 to


to
 help
 and
 give
 advice
 well
 mat
 it's


been
 um
 incredibly
 useful
 a
 lot
 of
 uh
 uh


fantastic
 advice
 here
 and
 um
 we
 look


forward
 to
 following
 the
 progress
 uh
 for


the
 next
 150
 years
 as
 well
 thank
 you


thank
 you
 so
 much
