All
 right.
 Hello
 everybody.
 Welcome
 back


to
 another
 episode
 of
 Pounder
 Weekly.
 It


has
 been
 a
 while
 since
 we've
 done


Pounder
 Weekly.
 Uh
 Arie
 cannot
 make
 it


today.
 I
 don't
 even
 know
 if
 Air
 is
 going


to
 make
 it
 today.
 He
 said
 he
 would,
 but


he
 lives
 across
 the
 world
 and
 he


honestly
 might
 not
 be
 able
 to
 just
 given


the
 time
 difference.
 which
 kind
 of


speaks
 to
 the
 first
 thing
 I
 want
 to
 talk


about,
 which
 is
 uh
 and
 we
 I've
 said
 this


publicly
 already
 and
 we
 we
 talked
 about


it
 all
 publicly,
 but
 uh
 Palenteer
 weekly


is
 likely
 not
 going
 to
 be
 weekly
 going


forward
 uh
 for
 two
 reasons.
 Number
 one,


it
 really
 is
 hard
 to
 get
 the
 schedules


to
 line
 up
 and
 get
 everything
 to
 go


weekly.
 Um
 that's
 just
 like
 the
 product


of
 life
 and
 people
 have
 kids
 and
 you


know,
 all
 this
 different
 stuff.
 Number


two
 is,
 and
 I'd
 be
 curious
 to
 get
 Matt's


thoughts
 on
 this
 as
 well,
 is
 there's
 not


as
 much
 to
 analyze
 on
 the
 company


as
 much
 as
 there
 was
 four
 years
 ago.
 It


crossed
 $200
 a
 share
 today.
 So,
 we'll


talk
 about
 that,
 but
 I
 think
 that
 in
 of


itself
 is
 indicative
 of
 the
 fact
 that


company's
 a
 bit
 more
 on
 autopilot
 and


there
 are
 things
 to
 analyze,
 but
 not
 to


the
 level
 that
 it
 was
 when
 it
 was
 six


bucks,
 which
 means
 you
 might
 not
 need
 a


weekly
 episode
 anymore.
 So,
 Matt,
 any


thoughts
 in
 general
 about
 the
 company


maturing
 and
 content
 creators
 maturing


with
 the
 company
 as
 well?
 No,
 I
 think
 uh


I
 think
 you
 hit
 it
 on
 the
 head.
 I
 mean


to
 be
 honest
 uh
 big
 shout
 out
 to
 Arie


and
 and
 Amir
 because
 even
 though
 they


would
 had
 to
 wake
 up
 at
 like
 the
 break


of
 dawn,
 they
 didn't
 complain
 nearly
 as


much
 as
 I
 would
 have
 complained.
 So,
 um,


so
 they
 they
 they're
 they're
 real


troopers
 in
 my
 eyes
 and
 they
 kept
 it


kind
 of
 going
 and,
 um,
 it's
 been
 it's


been
 a
 blast
 in
 retrospect
 to
 really


cover
 the
 company
 literally
 from


discrediting
 in
 misinformation,
 which
 I


think
 is
 the
 main
 reason
 why
 we
 were


doing
 Palunteer
 Weekly
 is
 like
 people


just
 really
 didn't
 understand
 at
 all


what
 uh
 what
 the
 heck
 was
 going
 on
 with


the
 company
 uh
 to
 now
 really


having
 a
 lot
 or
 I
 guess
 knowledge
 and


and
 now
 people
 can
 sit
 there
 and
 be


like,
 "Okay,
 this
 person
 is
 literally


just
 a
 hater
 or
 is
 probably
 a
 a
 paid


political
 shill."
 Like
 they
 don't
 know


anything
 that's
 going
 on.
 It's
 very
 easy


to
 spot
 those
 people
 now.
 Whereas
 before


there
 was
 so
 little
 information
 that
 I


think
 people
 truly
 could
 grasp
 and
 hang


their
 hat
 on
 that
 anybody
 could
 steer


the
 ship
 in
 whatever
 way
 that
 they


wanted.
 And
 so
 it
 was
 really
 relying
 on


us
 to
 to
 really
 not
 us
 all alone
 of


course
 and
 in
 tandem
 with
 the
 company


putting
 out
 great
 information
 and


Elellaniano
 and
 Chad
 and
 and
 all
 those


guys
 putting
 out
 great
 information
 to
 to


really
 help
 people
 along
 the
 way
 to


understand
 the
 true
 potential.
 And
 I


think
 now
 people
 get
 it.
 And
 so
 I'm
 I'm


with
 you
 like
 as
 as
 the
 company
 has


gotten
 into
 its
 its
 uh
 new
 stage
 I
 feel


like
 we
 don't
 have
 to
 give
 as
 much
 to


the
 community.
 Uh,
 as
 much
 as
 people


love
 for
 us
 to
 talk
 about
 it
 every
 week,


it's
 there's
 so
 many
 great
 people
 that


are
 covering
 it
 and
 we
 saw
 that
 when
 we


were
 going
 into
 New
 York,
 you
 and
 me,
 we


met
 up
 with
 a
 group
 of
 people
 and
 so


many
 great
 people
 that
 have
 been


covering
 it.
 Um,
 Amir,
 Arie,
 you
 know,


you
 don't
 necessarily
 need
 a
 weekly


episode.
 Just
 follow
 those
 guys
 and


you'll
 get
 whatever
 information
 that
 you


need.


>> Yeah,
 I
 agree.
 And
 uh,
 well,
 our
 brother


from
 Sweden
 made
 it.
 Amir,
 what's
 up?


>> Hey,
 Palanteer
 six
 monthly.
 Here
 we
 are.


What's up,
 everyone?
 Man,
 you
 guys
 rush


this
 episode.
 I
 I
 thought
 we
 used
 to
 do


this
 like
 five
 past,
 so
 my
 bad.
 I'm


here.
 Happy
 to
 see
 everyone.
 Uh,
 happen


to
 hear
 most
 of
 what
 Matt
 said
 and
 I
 can


only
 agree.


Um,
 yeah,
 Amir,
 we
 were
 just
 talking


about
 how
 we're
 going
 to


probably
 not
 even
 monthly,
 but
 this
 we


will
 likely
 be
 back
 every
 earnings
 for


for
 a
 episode
 with
 all
 of
 us,
 not
 weekly


anymore.
 So,
 just
 your
 thoughts
 on
 the


evolution
 of
 the
 need
 to
 do
 a
 weekly


episode.


>> Yeah,
 you
 know,
 um,
 probably
 every


viewer
 as
 well
 felt
 it
 for
 quite
 a
 while


at
 Palanteer.
 really
 the
 the
 thesis
 has


largely
 remained
 the
 same.
 The
 pace
 of


uh
 how
 quickly
 Palanteer
 actually


reached
 where
 we
 thought
 that
 they


ultimately
 would
 be
 able
 to
 reach.
 I


mean
 they
 probably
 blew
 past
 everyone's


expectations
 including
 mine.
 But
 you


know
 when
 when
 the
 thesis
 starts
 to
 play


out
 it
 kind
 of
 feels
 sort
 of
 autopilot


in
 a
 way.
 Of
 course,
 you
 have
 to
 keep


track
 of
 the
 company,
 make
 sure
 that


they're
 on
 on
 the
 right
 track,
 but
 you


know,
 doing
 a
 weekly
 episode
 for


Palanteer,
 especially
 when
 they


themselves
 didn't
 really
 feel
 the
 same


need
 to
 prove
 themselves.
 You
 know,
 in


historically,
 they
 would
 have
 all
 these


uh
 frequent
 press
 releases.
 There
 was
 a


lot
 to
 try
 to
 uncover,
 try
 to
 understand


what
 each
 Palunteer
 product
 does.
 like


uh
 there
 was
 a
 lot
 to
 dig
 into,
 but
 you


know,
 as
 of
 late,
 I'm
 I'm
 sure
 um
 a
 lot


of
 people
 felt
 the
 same
 way
 that
 well,


we're
 kind
 of
 talking
 about
 the
 same


things.
 Maybe
 the
 stock
 reached
 a
 new


all-time
 high.
 It
 felt
 like
 like


bi-weekly.
 Uh
 so,
 so
 we
 would
 talk
 about


the
 stock
 price.
 We
 would,
 you
 know,


give
 some
 comments
 about
 the
 valuation,


but
 you
 know,
 there
 wasn't
 really
 much


meat
 to
 to
 the
 bone,
 so
 to
 speak.
 So,
 I


I
 think
 it
 makes
 a
 lot
 of
 sense.
 I
 mean


even
 you
 know
 the
 first
 idea
 was
 to
 you


know
 okay
 well
 weekly
 might
 be
 a
 bit
 too


much
 how
 about
 monthly
 but
 even
 on
 a


monthly
 basis
 I
 mean
 it's
 still
 kind
 of


the
 same
 thing
 so
 I
 think
 this
 makes
 a


lot
 of
 sense
 that
 would
 make
 it
 like


quarterly
 maybe
 if
 something
 big
 happens


you
 you
 know
 we
 can
 do
 an
 episode
 to


discuss
 that
 you
 know
 just
 do
 it
 you


know
 play
 it
 by
 ear
 like
 when
 when


there's
 something
 to
 talk
 about
 when


there
 is
 value
 to
 provide
 when
 there's


stuff
 to
 discuss
 as
 a
 community
 then
 it


makes
 sense
 you
 know
 to
 um


uh
 get
 together
 and
 talk
 about
 it,
 but


just,
 you
 know,
 making
 the
 weekly


episodes.
 There's
 simply
 not
 the
 same


need
 for
 it.
 I
 mean,
 we
 all,
 you
 know,


Amit
 covers,
 I'm
 sure,
 Palanteer
 like


daily
 anyway
 on
 his
 show.
 I'm
 sure
 um


Matt
 gives
 out
 comments
 frequently.
 I
 I


do
 that
 as
 well,
 just
 like
 Matt
 was


talking
 about
 before
 I
 joined
 in.
 So,
 to


me,
 it
 it
 makes
 a
 lot
 of
 sense
 to
 do
 it


this
 way.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah,
 even
 though
 I'll
 miss
 um


talking
 to
 you
 guys
 so
 often,
 but


>> you're
 not
 going
 to
 whis
 up
 making
 up.


You're
 not
 going
 to
 miss
 waking
 up


early,
 which
 you
 know,
 so
 it's
 like
 it


makes
 sense.
 It
 was
 a
 big
 burden
 on
 you


and
 Arie,
 but
 the
 fact
 that
 you
 showed


up
 basically
 for
 the
 past
 year
 and
 a


half,
 both
 of
 you,
 it's
 a
 testament
 to


how
 much
 this
 journey
 has
 mattered.
 Um,


all
 right,
 folks.
 Let's
 get
 into
 it.
 Big


day
 as
 we
 head
 into
 earnings.
 Palenteer


$200


a
 share.
 I
 don't
 even
 know
 how
 to


describe
 it.
 I
 mean,
 kind
 of
 felt
 like


it
 just
 happened.
 Even
 a
 hundred
 just


felt
 like
 it
 happened.
 Then
 a
 hundred


got
 normalized.
 I
 mean,
 I
 guess
 we'll


start
 with
 you,
 Matt.
 Like,
 what
 was


your
 reaction
 when
 you
 saw
 this?
 And
 how


are
 you
 thinking
 of
 a
 stock
 now
 that
 is


uh
 $200
 a
 share
 and
 reaching
 half
 a


trillion
 in
 market
 cap?


>> I
 mean,
 it's
 um
 it's
 insane.
 I
 mean


I
 when
 I
 first
 purchased
 it's
 kind
 of
 a


milestone
 um
 for
 me
 because
 my
 bullcase


when
 I
 was
 first
 kind
 of
 purchasing


Palunteer
 back
 in
 September
 2020
 was


like
 a
 $500
 billion
 market
 cap
 at
 that


point.
 Right
 now,
 obviously
 that
 target


has
 moved,
 but
 initially
 it
 was
 like
 a
 a


$500
 billion
 market
 cap
 was
 like,
 oh,


two,
 you
 know,
 150,
 250,
 maybe
 500,


right?
 It's
 going
 to
 take
 forever
 and
 uh


it'll
 eventually
 get
 there,
 you
 know,
 by


mid
 2035
 or
 something
 like
 that.
 It's


going
 to
 have
 to
 prove
 itself
 and
 just


it's
 just
 obviously
 took
 uh
 about
 a


third
 of
 the
 amount
 of
 time
 that
 I
 was


really
 expecting
 it
 to.
 Um
 and


you
 know
 partly
 I
 think
 is
 because
 the


people
 see
 the
 true
 potential
 of
 it
 and


you
 know
 institutions


uh
 really
 see
 what
 what
 it
 can
 do
 for


enterprise
 software
 but
 I
 think
 also
 it


is
 in
 it
 continues
 to
 demonstrate
 itself


to
 be
 a
 huge
 part
 of
 the
 economy
 and
 the


backbone
 and
 I
 think
 it's
 only
 going
 to


get
 even
 more
 so
 uh
 as
 as


numbers
 get
 released
 and
 deals
 get


released
 in
 26
 and
 27.
 I
 mean,
 just
 the


amount
 of
 political
 leaders
 that
 the


company
 just
 continues
 to
 work
 with,


it's
 insane.
 So,
 to
 me,
 it
 makes


complete
 sense
 um
 that
 we're
 here
 and,


you
 know,


not
 not
 uh
 not
 that
 scary
 now
 that
 I


know
 some
 of
 the
 things
 that
 have
 been


going
 on
 and
 some
 of
 the
 deals.
 It
 just


it's
 insane.


>> Amir,
 uh
 same
 question
 to
 you.
 And
 you


know
 you
 have
 been
 someone
 who's
 really


helped
 us
 understand
 valuation.
 You
 are


someone
 who
 really
 understands
 Excel


sheets,
 DCFs,
 etc.
 Uh
 I
 think
 all
 of
 us


got
 humbled
 over
 the
 past
 year
 and
 a


half
 because
 at
 some
 point
 all
 of
 us


agreed,
 hey
 this
 thing
 is
 getting


expensive
 and
 it
 well
 it
 continues
 to


get
 expensive.
 the
 growth
 continues
 to


go
 up.
 But
 if
 the
 stock
 continues
 to


grow
 up
 and
 the
 growth
 continues
 to
 go


up,
 you
 know,
 the
 multiple
 still
 expands


versus
 comes
 down
 because
 at
 the
 end
 of


the
 day,
 the
 the
 rate
 of
 growth
 of
 the


market
 cap
 is
 so
 exponential
 compared
 to


the
 rate
 of
 growth
 of
 the
 company
 that


you
 know
 now
 it
 continues
 to
 trade
 above


100
 times
 sales.
 How
 are
 you
 thinking
 of


the
 market
 cap,
 the
 valuation,
 and
 have


you
 kind
 of
 given
 up
 on
 this
 whole
 idea


of
 saying,
 "Hey,
 maybe
 it's
 too


expensive
 because
 they've
 proved
 the


growth
 story
 to
 such
 an
 extent
 that
 you


just
 believe
 they're
 going
 to
 keep


growing
 into
 it."


>> You
 know,
 it
 is
 quite
 a
 humbling


experience
 in
 a
 in
 a
 big
 way.
 And
 I
 I
 I


don't
 think
 that
 many
 like
 everyone


listening
 today,
 I
 don't
 think
 you
 will


experience
 something
 like
 this
 like
 very


often
 or
 perhaps
 even
 ever
 again
 in
 your


investing
 lifetime.
 You
 know,
 it
 felt


like
 it
 was
 yesterday
 that
 Palanteer
 was


like
 $50
 billion
 market
 cap.
 Now
 we
 are


past
 half
 a
 trillion
 like
 well
 on
 our


way
 to
 that
 one
 trillion.
 Now
 when
 I
 say


humbling
 experience
 is
 because


the
 way
 intrinsic
 valuation
 works
 is


that
 you
 need
 to
 revalue
 the
 business


every
 time
 you're
 given
 a
 reason
 to


Palunteer
 like
 each
 quarter
 that
 has


been
 passing
 like
 the
 intrinsic


valuation
 on
 my
 end
 has
 just
 like
 been


exponentially
 increasing.
 I
 mean,
 prior


to
 last
 quarter's
 earnings,
 my
 fair


value
 was
 something
 like
 75
 and
 we
 were


trading
 like
 at
 130
 um
 140,
 you
 know,


pushing
 150.
 Q2
 earnings
 come
 out
 come


out
 and
 corp
 is
 like,
 yeah,
 we're
 going


to
 10x
 like
 US
 revenues
 like
 in
 five


years.
 And
 you're
 like,
 damn,
 okay,
 what


does
 that
 mean
 for,
 you
 know,
 intrinsic


value?
 And
 my
 intrinsic
 value
 almost


doubled
 to
 135
 just
 just
 in
 a
 quarter.


And
 even
 prior
 to
 that
 quarter,
 you


know,
 75,
 you
 know,
 as
 of
 Q1,
 it
 also


like
 increased
 a
 lot
 like
 from
 the


quarter
 prior.
 So
 each
 quarter
 that
 that


passes,
 Palanteer
 just,
 you
 know,
 keeps


proving
 everyone
 wrong.
 Like
 that
 my


expectation,
 I'm
 sure
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 on


Wall
 Street
 expectations
 are
 just
 simply


too
 low.
 Uh
 like
 uh
 the
 company
 is


executing
 at
 a
 way
 faster
 pace
 than
 you


know
 anyone
 really
 expected.
 So
 it's


it's
 it's
 quite
 humbling
 when
 you
 know


each
 quarter
 that
 passes
 you
 like
 almost


double
 the
 the
 valuation
 each
 quarter


because
 you
 learn
 so
 much
 new
 you
 get


new
 and
 higher
 expectations
 and
 those


expectations
 like
 if
 if
 we
 just
 rewind


like
 two
 quarters
 people
 would
 have
 said


that
 like
 yeah
 we're
 expecting
 a
 lot


from
 this
 business
 because
 you
 know
 as


you
 mentioned
 it's
 been
 expensive
 like


all
 throughout
 you
 know
 for
 quite
 a


while
 we
 we
 all
 felt
 like
 h
 probably


expensive
 the
 P
 is
 up
 there
 the
 price
 to


sales
 is
 up
 there.
 Fair
 value
 is


probably,
 you
 know,
 way
 below
 where
 the


stock
 code
 is.
 But
 the
 market
 humbled


all
 of
 us.
 You
 know,
 the
 the
 market
 has


actually
 probably
 been
 giving
 Palunteer,


you
 know,
 letting
 it
 trade
 around,
 you


know,
 what
 is
 actual
 fair
 value.
 It's


just
 that
 we're
 all
 trailing
 it.
 You


know,
 we
 we
 just
 don't
 see
 it
 yet.
 So
 I


think
 this
 quarter
 might
 be
 similar


where
 you
 know
 um
 I
 raised
 my


expectations
 from
 the
 company
 but
 I


wouldn't
 be
 surprised
 if
 I'm
 still
 you


know
 way
 too
 bearish
 and
 I
 would
 have
 to


revise
 my
 fair
 value
 again.
 So
 as
 as
 I


mentioned
 as
 of
 right
 now
 it
 is
 around


135
 and
 that
 is
 like
 by
 a
 lot
 of
 growth


you
 know
 given
 Karp's
 own
 quotes


but
 yeah
 I
 mean
 this
 company
 is
 quite


magical
 in
 that
 sense
 you
 like
 you
 never


know
 like
 even
 um


like
 seeing
 uh
 you
 know
 I'm
 sure
 we


we're
 going
 to
 get
 get
 into
 it
 but
 you


know
 if
 you
 go
 back
 like
 a
 year
 ago


people
 would
 would
 have
 told
 you
 yeah


data
 bricks
 is
 going
 to
 eat
 Palanteer's


lunch
 and
 like
 all
 of
 these
 things
 and


then
 you're
 like
 no
 it's
 not
 actually
 a


completely
 different
 different
 playing


field
 actually
 these
 people
 all
 want
 to


partner
 up
 with
 Palunteer
 and
 that
 is


what
 what
 has
 happened
 now
 you
 know
 the


data
 bricks
 partnership
 snowflake


partnership
 another
 one
 that
 that
 was


going
 to
 you
 know
 eat
 Palanteer's
 lunch


if
 we
 go
 back
 to
 the
 early
 days
 like


these
 aren't
 given
 like
 the
 same
 kind
 of


companies
 so
 yeah


>> yeah
 I
 think
 it's
 a
 fair
 point
 I
 have


like
 five
 simple
 reasons
 why
 I
 think
 the


valuation
 has
 continued
 to
 expand
 the


way
 it
 has.
 Number
 one,
 OpenAI
 is
 worth


a
 trillion,
 not
 profitable.
 Foundation


model
 company,
 potentially
 commodity.


Uh,
 Pounder
 is
 seen
 as
 the
 actual
 use


cases
 for
 AI
 in
 the
 real
 world.
 So,
 the


street's
 like,
 hey,
 if
 OpenAI
 gets
 a


trillion,
 then
 Pounder
 probably
 has
 to


get
 something
 that's
 maybe
 not
 a


trillion,
 but
 definitely


>> Where's
 the
 the
 trillion
 from?
 Is
 that


like
 the
 expected
 IPO
 now?
 Because
 the


race


>> Oh,
 yeah.
 Yeah,
 that's
 Sorry,
 that's


what
 I
 meant
 to
 say.
 Yeah,
 that's
 what
 I


meant
 to
 say.
 OpenAI
 is
 500
 billion
 but


whenever
 they
 go
 public
 it
 will
 have
 to


be
 at
 around
 that
 trillion
 dollar
 range.


So
 I
 guess
 the
 streets
 kind
 of
 come
 like


that
 but
 you
 know
 OpenAI
 was
 350
 billion


when
 Palenter
 was
 100
 billion.
 So
 now


Pounder
 is
 catching
 up
 to
 it
 but
 yeah
 I


guess
 the
 expected
 value
 of
 OpenAI


obviously
 is
 in
 the
 trillions
 and
 you


would
 argue
 Palunteer
 is
 more
 valuable.


Number
 two
 is
 the
 option
 market.
 So,
 I


know
 I
 was
 talking
 about
 this
 a
 couple


months
 ago,
 but
 the
 amount
 of
 liquidity


in
 options,
 Palunteer
 is
 a
 top
 10
 traded


stock
 in
 the
 entire
 stock
 market


globally
 every
 single
 day.
 We're
 talking


about
 minimum
 of
 a
 million
 calls
 and


puts
 traded.
 So,
 when
 you
 have
 that
 many


people
 just
 trading
 the
 name
 in
 and
 of


itself,
 there's
 going to
 be
 a
 floor
 to


the
 stock
 because
 there's
 going to
 be
 a


lot
 of
 people
 ready
 to
 buy
 the
 dip
 and


then
 ready
 to
 sell
 or
 put
 puts
 and
 calls


on
 it
 uh
 simultaneously.
 So
 from
 that


perspective
 I
 think
 algorithmically
 the


name
 has
 gotten
 such
 a
 big
 presence
 in


the
 community
 for
 investors
 retail
 and


institutional
 that
 has
 led
 to
 the


sustained
 momentum.
 Uh
 number
 three


piggyback
 piggybacks
 off
 that
 if
 there


is
 a
 dip
 now
 people
 want
 to
 buy
 right
 so


if
 it
 falls
 from
 200
 to
 180
 like
 one


could
 argue
 180
 is
 still
 really


aggressive
 but
 people
 will
 buy
 just
 like


when
 it
 fell
 from
 180
 to
 142
 when
 Citron


said
 they
 were
 short
 and
 I
 don't
 know


they
 haven't
 said
 anything
 in
 the
 past


couple
 months
 now
 but
 uh
 when
 that
 dip


happened
 people
 bought
 and
 people
 bought


aggressively
 so
 I
 think
 now
 the
 name


also
 has
 kind
 of
 that
 Tesla
 Nvidia
 type


of
 attitude
 towards
 it
 where
 if
 you
 get


a
 dip
 you
 have
 people
 that
 are
 just


salivating
 for
 the
 opportunity
 to
 get


exposure
 and
 that
 creates
 a
 floor
 to
 the


price.
 Fourth
 reason,
 they're
 growing


faster
 than
 everybody,
 right?
 So,
 this


is
 the
 only
 SAS
 company
 on
 the
 planet


that
 has
 guided
 50%
 growth
 for
 Q3
 and


45%
 growth
 for
 2026.
 No
 other
 SAS


company,
 I
 think
 the
 fastest
 you
 have
 is


like
 32%
 by
 some
 of
 the
 cyber
 security


names,
 but
 none
 of
 them
 are
 growing
 this


fast.
 I
 mean,
 there's
 a
 world
 in
 which


we
 could
 grow
 faster
 in
 Q3
 than
 Nvidia


grows
 faster.
 and
 you
 know
 it's
 a


different
 scale
 but
 the
 point
 is
 in
 the


age
 of
 AI
 if
 growth
 is
 what
 matters
 and


counter
 can
 sustain
 it
 especially
 with


their
 free
 cash
 flow
 margins
 um
 it
 will


likely
 continue
 getting
 the
 the
 premium


and
 then
 finally
 Karp's
 meeting
 with


people
 in
 Poland
 carps
 meeting
 with


people
 in
 Ukraine
 I
 mean
 just


internationally
 the
 level
 of
 his
 brand


and
 the
 the
 rockstar
 that
 he
 has
 become


the
 amount
 of
 inbound
 that
 Palanter
 is


getting
 from
 world
 leaders
 governments


institutions
 US
 commercial
 clients
 now


international
 commercial
 clients
 that


also
 adds
 the
 premium
 to
 the
 talk.


People
 want
 to
 bet
 on
 a
 leader.
 Karp
 has


an
 autobiography
 coming
 out
 in
 a
 week.
 I


actually
 interviewed
 the
 author
 of
 the


autobiography
 and
 that
 video
 will
 come


out
 on
 my
 channel
 tomorrow.
 But
 like
 the


fact
 that
 there
 are
 literally
 books


being
 written
 about
 this
 guy,
 it's
 going


to
 add
 a
 premium.
 And
 I
 think
 again


the
 stock
 price
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day
 of


any
 company
 is
 how
 much
 someone
 is


willing
 to
 pay
 for
 it.
 And
 if
 there's


all
 these
 other
 reasons
 besides
 just
 the


growth,
 which
 the
 growth
 is
 incredible,


that
 adds
 to
 why
 people
 are
 willing
 to


pay
 for
 it.
 That's
 why
 you've
 got
 the


stock
 trading
 today.
 Yeah,
 I
 mentioned


it,
 you
 know,
 quite
 often
 on
 on
 these


episodes,
 but
 I
 think
 like
 Palanteer
 is


the
 ultimate
 momentum
 stock
 because
 it's


been,
 you
 know,
 almost
 like
 a
 year
 and
 a


half
 now
 where
 there's
 like
 no
 negative


catalyst
 attached
 to
 the
 name.
 Like


every
 single
 thing
 is
 just
 like
 super


super
 positive
 for
 the
 company.
 Like


every
 news
 that
 comes
 out
 like
 each


earnings
 is
 is
 is
 better
 than
 than
 the


last.
 all
 the
 news
 surrounding
 the


company
 like
 this
 just
 like
 positive


catalyst
 after
 positive
 catalyst
 like


there
 there
 hasn't
 been
 anything
 like


tying
 this
 company
 down
 which
 is
 why
 I


believe
 like
 it
 was
 able
 to
 reach
 like


all
 these
 new
 highs
 continuously
 like
 uh


so
 I
 think
 that
 also
 plays
 a
 big
 um
 you


know
 part
 part
 of
 how
 we
 were
 able
 to


reach
 200
 so
 quickly
 I
 don't
 think


anyone
 really
 expected
 Valentine
 to
 be


at
 200
 by
 this
 point
 you
 know
 uh
 but


yeah
 you


all
 positive
 news
 all
 the
 time
 for
 like


a
 year
 and
 a
 half,
 then
 yeah,
 you
 you


reach
 these
 kind
 of
 pricing
 multiples,


you
 know,
 after
 a
 while.


>> Yeah,
 agreed.
 All
 right,
 so
 let's
 get


into
 earnings.
 Uh
 the
 company
 is
 guided


for
 about
 1.03


or
 08
 billion
 in
 revenue.
 I'll
 get
 the


exact
 number.
 The
 street's
 expecting


1.09.
 So
 that
 would
 be
 about
 50%
 growth.


Uh,
 exactly
 50%
 growth.
 And
 so
 I
 guess


we'll
 start
 with
 there.
 Amir,
 I'll
 give


it
 to
 you.
 Um,
 what
 do
 you
 think


Palanteer
 is
 going to
 put
 up?
 What


numbers
 are
 you
 the
 most
 concerned


about?
 And
 now
 that
 the
 stock
 has
 made
 a


run
 of
 about
 20
 bucks
 before
 the


earnings,
 how
 are
 you
 thinking
 of
 the


price
 going
 into?


Uh
 well,


I
 think


maybe
 like
 it
 kind
 of
 feels
 like
 uh


you're
 kind
 of
 like
 uh
 softball
 balling


it
 like
 me.
 Uh
 I
 I
 feel
 like
 I'm


softballing
 but
 I
 I
 have
 them
 doing
 112.


So
 that's
 like
 54.5ish


and
 um
 like
 the
 split
 is
 uh
 620


government
 500
 commercial
 but
 you
 know


that
 is
 you
 know
 by
 expecting
 that
 net


dollar
 retention
 is
 going
 to
 reach
 you


know
 130%
 which
 means
 that
 you
 know
 30%


of
 these
 54
 are
 like
 from
 existing


customers.
 So
 like
 the
 whole
 scalability


is
 still
 like
 playing
 a
 major
 part
 and


gives
 you
 a
 lot
 of
 like
 kind
 of
 free


growth
 in
 in
 in
 that
 sense.
 So
 I
 have


doing
 112
 54.5
 kind
 of
 feels
 low


lowballing
 it
 but
 uh
 that's
 still
 um
 you


know
 where
 I'm
 at.
 Uh
 and
 we
 know


historically
 Palanteer
 kind
 of


um
 when
 when
 they
 give
 out
 their


guidance
 they're
 like
 kind
 of
 guaranteed


to
 beat
 it
 and
 quite
 often
 by
 quite
 a


margin.
 So
 115
 maybe
 too
 low
 but
 that's


where
 where
 I'm
 at.
 But
 that's
 still


like
 really
 impressive
 54.5
 and
 that
 is


as
 I
 mentioned
 off
 off
 the
 back
 of
 you


know
 net
 retention
 of
 130%.


Which
 also
 if
 they
 just
 retain
 their


current
 operating
 margins
 which
 I


actually
 expect
 them
 to
 you
 know
 improve


that
 would
 mean
 a
 rule
 of
 40
 score


surpassing
 100
 like
 for
 the
 for
 the


first
 time.
 You
 know,
 we're
 all
 been


like
 memeing
 about
 even
 Karp
 himself


like,
 "Yeah,
 we
 should
 rename
 the
 rule


of
 40
 to
 rule
 of
 80,
 then
 rule
 of
 90."
 I


think
 they're
 going
 to
 actually
 surpass


100
 this
 quarter.
 So,
 that's
 uh
 where


I'm
 at
 with
 those,
 you
 know,
 major


numbers.
 But
 the
 one


the
 one
 number
 that
 I'm
 really
 looking


forward
 to
 is
 actually
 uh
 the
 customer


count
 growth.
 I
 think
 this
 might
 be
 the


first
 triple
 digit
 increase
 in
 uh


existing
 customers.
 So
 if
 they
 can
 do


more
 more
 than
 100
 added
 customers
 for


this
 quarter
 then
 that's
 like
 the
 main


number
 that
 I'm
 very
 very
 hyped
 about


because
 we
 already
 know
 how
 they're
 able


to
 scale
 their
 current
 customers
 you


know
 with
 the
 especially
 now
 with
 you


know
 AI
 um
 FD
 is
 coming
 out
 all
 of
 these


new
 AI
 agents
 that
 they've
 been


unveiling
 so
 you
 know
 scalability
 is


probably
 there
 with
 existing
 customers


so
 it
 remains
 like
 the
 number
 one
 metric


to
 track
 like
 how
 many
 new
 customers
 can


they
 add
 and
 if
 they
 can
 do
 hundred
 and


then
 100
 rule
 of
 40
 then
 pretty
 high
 but


yeah
 my
 actual
 revenue
 numbers
 54.5ish


which
 is
 1.12


Matt
 same
 question
 to
 you
 what
 are
 you


expecting
 and
 before
 you
 go
 I
 just
 want


to
 say
 I
 think
 one
 of the
 reasons


Pounder
 keeps
 beating
 on
 earnings
 is


that
 they
 guided
 revenue
 of
 1.087
 which


is
 basically
 1.09
 the
 street
 has
 them
 at


1.09
 09.
 And
 this
 is
 not
 the
 same
 for
 a


lot
 of
 companies.
 Companies
 will
 give


out
 a
 guide
 and
 then
 the
 street
 will
 be


overly
 enthusiastic
 about
 uh
 what
 they


can
 put
 up
 because
 the
 street
 knows
 that


companies
 tend
 to
 go
 lower
 than
 what


they
 can
 put
 up
 and
 they
 raise
 the


estimate
 which
 means
 the
 company
 has
 to


beat
 the
 estimate.
 I
 think
 almost
 for


the
 past
 seven
 quarters,
 the
 street
 has


not
 really
 raised
 the
 estimate
 against


what
 the
 company
 guided
 because
 every


time
 they
 kept
 thinking
 there's
 no
 way


they're
 going
 to
 be
 able
 to
 actually


accelerate
 at
 the
 level
 that
 they
 say


they
 will
 and
 they
 don't
 want
 to
 get
 too


optimistic
 and
 then
 pounder
 beats
 by
 a


wide
 margin
 and
 the
 stock
 goes
 crazy


because
 perception
 is
 reality
 and
 the


expectation
 or
 the
 perception
 of
 the


growth
 ends
 up
 not
 being
 reality
 when


pounder
 overdelivers.
 So
 Matt,
 do
 you


think
 that
 is
 something
 we
 could
 get


again
 going
 into
 Q3?


I
 think
 so.
 I
 mean,
 I'm
 I'm
 thinking


that
 they
 continually
 know
 where
 they're


at
 and
 they
 want
 to
 knowingly
 beat


analyst
 expectations.
 Um,
 and
 so
 I
 think


that
 they
 always
 try
 to
 be
 reasonable


and
 I
 think
 to
 their
 own
 surprise,
 I


think
 they
 see
 a
 lot
 of
 efficiency
 gains


in
 quarter.
 And
 I
 know
 there's
 a
 lot
 to


there's
 there's
 not
 a
 lot
 you
 can
 do.


The
 quarters
 are
 baked
 in
 years
 ahead
 of


time
 if
 you
 think
 about
 it.
 like
 the


things
 that
 you're
 doing,
 you
 have
 to


set
 in
 motion
 quarters
 upon
 quarters


ahead
 of
 time
 and
 and
 there
 are
 some


small
 tweaks
 that
 you
 can
 do
 to
 make


some
 numbers
 uh
 come
 forward
 a
 little


bit.
 But
 so
 I
 feel
 like
 they
 always
 have


a
 very
 good
 grasp
 as
 to
 what
 the
 numbers


look
 like.
 And
 as
 we've
 kind
 of
 seen,


it's
 not
 a
 very
 cyclical
 business.
 It's


a
 very,
 you
 know,
 subscriptionbased


business.
 So
 you
 can
 kind
 of
 see
 where


things
 are
 trajectory,
 the
 trajectory
 of


things
 very
 far
 in
 advance
 if
 if
 things


come
 in
 as
 expected.
 I
 personally
 am


thinking
 that
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 a
 52%


revenue
 growth
 quarter.
 Um,
 so
 to
 give


people
 some
 some
 notes,
 I
 think
 we
 were


at
 seven,
 believe
 it
 or
 not,
 725
 million


uh
 in
 the
 year
 ago
 quarter.
 I'm
 thinking


we're
 going to
 get
 to
 1.1
 billion
 uh


which
 is
 crazy
 to
 even
 think
 about,
 but


possible.
 The
 things
 I
 think
 I
 agree


with
 Arie,
 he
 he
 posted
 something


specifically
 like
 he
 he
 also
 I
 think
 was


sinking
 north
 of
 50%.
 Definitely
 a
 five


handle,
 but
 I'm
 with
 him.
 I'm
 I'm


curious
 to
 see
 how
 the
 margins
 show
 up


because
 the
 cash
 flow
 ops
 margin
 and
 the


income
 margin
 and
 everything
 showed
 up


so
 strong
 last
 quarter
 and
 I'm
 used
 to


seeing
 it
 kind
 of
 waver
 a
 little
 bit.


So,
 I'm
 curious
 to
 see
 if
 they
 stay


where
 they're
 at
 because
 the
 thing
 that


blew
 my
 mind
 last
 quarter
 was
 we
 entered


a
 new
 territory
 for
 cash
 flow
 margin.
 we


entered
 a
 new
 territory
 for
 ops
 margin
 I


think
 being
 like
 54
 and
 46
 respectively


or
 swap
 them.
 Um


my
 thought
 process
 is
 is
 like
 if
 that's


able
 to
 be
 maintained
 then
 my
 trajectory


for
 the
 company
 and
 its
 market
 cap
 needs


to
 be
 readjusted
 because
 I
 was
 always


thinking
 we'd
 top
 out
 at
 like
 a
 40
 45%.


But
 if
 we're
 already
 this
 much
 in
 its


infancy
 of
 where
 the
 company
 is
 and
 they


haven't
 even
 really
 tried
 to
 optimize


for
 that
 stuff
 yet,
 then
 you
 could
 see


something
 potentially
 growing
 into
 the


the
 mid50s
 and
 high
 60s
 in
 terms
 of
 free


cash
 flow
 margin.
 And
 in
 that
 case,


you're
 talking
 about,
 hey,
 when
 you
 get


to
 10
 billion
 a
 year
 run
 rates,
 you're


talking
 about
 potentially
 five
 to
 six


billion
 dollars
 of
 free
 cash.
 Uh
 we


already
 know
 it's
 a
 very
 capital-like


business.
 Um,
 so
 I
 don't know,
 just
 very


interesting


uh
 thoughts
 about
 where
 margins
 might
 go


um
 going
 into
 to
 next
 year.


>> Yeah,
 you
 know,
 uh
 first
 of
 all,
 I
 I


don't
 know
 why
 Wall
 Street
 never


actually
 adjusted
 to,
 you
 know,
 Palenter


continuously
 outperform
 like
 they
 never


learned.
 Like
 even
 if
 you
 go
 back
 and


you
 watch,
 we
 have
 two
 analysts
 that
 are


frequently
 invited.
 Hopefully
 there
 will


be
 more
 uh
 this
 quarter.
 I
 say
 that
 for


each
 quarter.
 Hopefully
 we
 have
 more


analysts
 on
 the
 call.
 But
 you
 know
 we


have
 two
 we
 have
 Mariana
 and
 Dan
 Ies.


They
 have
 proven
 themselves
 to
 actually


understand
 the
 business
 like
 off
 pallet


here.
 But
 if
 you
 look
 at
 their


projections,
 they're
 also
 like
 you
 know


kind
 of
 you
 know
 they're
 they're
 not


like
 extremely
 above
 consensus
 at
 all.


Like
 they're
 quite
 in
 line
 with


consensus.
 So
 even
 those,
 you
 know,
 kind


of
 experts
 on
 Palunteer,
 they
 still
 like


kind
 of
 lowball
 the
 numbers,
 like
 even


though
 Palunteer
 keeps
 outperforming


like
 massively
 when
 you
 read
 their


equity
 research
 reports,
 you
 know,
 and


and
 their
 estimates,
 they're
 still,
 you


know,
 kind
 of
 timid
 about
 the
 the


numbers
 as
 a
 whole.
 And
 um


yeah,
 I
 think
 the
 major
 thing
 that
 has


been
 lost
 you
 know
 in
 the
 valuation
 of


Palanteer
 you
 know
 people
 used
 to
 try
 to


do
 DCFS
 for
 Palunteer
 and
 there
 the


range
 of
 you
 know
 free
 cash
 flow
 margins


as
 Matt
 was
 talking
 about
 like
 people


would
 see
 something
 like
 yeah
 they're


probably
 going
 to
 you
 know
 stay
 around


like
 you
 know
 like
 30
 maybe
 35
 in
 a


bully
 scenario
 of
 free
 cash
 flow
 to
 the


firm
 margins
 but
 you
 know
 as
 we've
 been


learning
 I
 mean
 they've
 far
 long


surpassed
 that.
 I
 mean
 last
 quarter
 they


did
 uh
 basically
 50%
 free
 cash
 flow
 to


the
 firm
 margins
 and
 you
 know
 uh
 56.7%


free
 cash
 flow
 margins.
 I
 think
 as
 as


Matt
 is
 like
 talking
 about
 like
 if
 you


can
 reach
 you
 know
 I
 think
 this
 business


can
 actually
 have
 something
 like
 you


know
 60
 to
 65%
 long-term
 consistent
 free


cash
 flow
 to
 the
 firm
 margins.
 And
 when


you
 then
 try
 to
 do
 a
 DCF
 with
 those


margins
 like
 it
 changes
 the
 model


completely.
 That's
 how
 you
 reach
 you


know
 uh
 these
 you
 know
 100
 plus
 kind
 of


fair
 values
 and
 in
 my
 case
 it's
 at
 135


but
 that's
 how
 you
 reach
 you
 know
 all


these
 like
 super
 high
 uh
 valuations
 for


Palanteer
 is
 that
 yeah
 you
 actually


expect
 them
 to
 reach
 like
 some
 crazy


levels
 of
 you
 know
 there's
 like
 no
 major


SAS
 business
 that
 has
 you
 know
 60
 plus


free
 cash
 flow
 to
 the
 firm
 margins
 so


that's
 why
 like
 it
 kind
 of
 never
 entered


the
 conversation
 but
 when
 you
 introduce


that
 that's
 when
 you


the
 stock
 price
 kind
 of
 starts
 to
 make


sense.
 I
 still
 think
 like
 200
 plus
 is
 a


is
 a
 bit
 early,
 but
 I'm
 I'm
 ready
 to
 be


humbled
 by
 this
 quarter
 again.
 Like
 I've


as
 I've
 been
 humbled,
 you
 know,
 previous


quarters,
 but
 yeah,
 like
 it
 it
 starts
 to


make
 more
 sense
 when
 you
 actually
 adjust


the
 free
 cash
 flow
 to
 the
 firm
 margins,


you
 know,
 to
 those
 extremes
 that's
 kind


of
 like
 unheard
 of
 in
 the
 market.
 And


Palanteer
 is
 the
 kind
 of
 business
 that


does
 unheard
 of
 things,
 you
 know.


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 um,
 I
 think
 you're
 right


and
 I
 I
 agree.
 I
 also
 think
 200's
 a
 lot


from
 where
 we
 are
 today.
 I
 mean,
 I
 I
 do


think
 net
 income
 will
 show
 up
 north
 of


500.
 So,
 if
 you
 think
 about
 it,
 if
 if


they're
 able
 to
 annualize
 that,
 that's


that's
 two
 $2
 billion
 a
 year.
 That's


that's
 pretty
 good,
 right?
 Um,
 I
 can't


complain
 with
 $2
 billion
 a
 year,


especially
 with
 having
 a
 product
 that's


just
 kind
 of
 come
 out,
 you
 know,
 really


over
 the
 past,
 you
 know,
 eight,
 nine


years.
 It's,
 you
 know,
 and
 they
 they've


really
 only
 been
 hitting
 it
 hard
 for
 I'd


say
 the
 last
 three.
 Uh,
 so
 to
 me,
 yeah,


I
 know
 it's
 a
 20ome
 year
 old
 company,


but
 they've
 really
 been
 focusing


particularly
 on
 the
 commercial
 side,
 you


know,
 rather
 recently.
 And
 I
 think
 that


the
 reason
 why
 it
 is
 at
 200
 is
 a
 lot
 of


what
 you
 said
 like
 it's
 this
 new
 margin


exploration
 phase
 that
 we're
 kind
 of
 in


and
 all
 you've
 been
 seeing
 even
 if
 you


saw
 net
 dollar
 retention
 going
 down


right
 and
 and
 the
 growth
 slowing
 down


you
 still
 saw
 these
 margins
 going
 up
 and


to
 the
 right
 and
 now
 that
 you're
 in
 a


profitable
 stage
 it's
 like
 where
 where


does
 the
 buck
 stop
 and
 I
 think
 until
 you


see
 it
 roll
 over
 or
 flatten
 I
 think


we're
 going
 to
 continue
 to
 be
 in
 this


discovery
 phase
 for
 the
 price.
 Um


because
 people
 don't
 know
 what
 to


expect,
 right?
 They're
 they're
 they're


able
 to
 grow
 50%
 year-over-year.
 And
 if


they're
 able
 to
 get
 the
 margins
 up
 to


the
 60s,
 like
 you
 said,
 then
 Jesus,
 like


I
 don't,
 you
 know,
 it
 completely
 blows


out
 what
 everyone's
 market
 cap


expectations
 were
 for
 the
 company.
 Um,


and
 so
 it
 won't
 take
 much
 if
 you
 think


about
 it
 of
 in
 terms
 of
 revenue
 and
 we


already
 know
 how
 beneficial
 this
 company


has
 been
 for
 every
 company
 that's
 worked


for,
 the
 majority
 of
 the
 companies
 it's


worked
 for.
 Um,
 and
 and
 generally


speaking,
 the
 only
 reason
 why
 from
 the


the
 stories
 that
 I've
 seen
 uh
 in
 the


paper
 is
 generally
 speaking,
 people


don't
 renew
 the
 contract
 because
 it


works
 too
 well
 and
 they're
 afraid
 of


like
 finding
 out
 too
 much
 about
 the


company
 or
 getting
 rid
 of
 whole
 parts
 of


the
 organization
 or
 being
 too
 reliant


upon
 one
 company.
 I've
 seen
 that.
 Um,
 I


think
 some
 people
 get
 afraid
 of
 how


powerful
 the
 software
 is,
 uh,
 because
 it


really
 requires
 you
 to
 trust
 and
 partner


with
 Palunteer
 to
 to
 be
 able
 to
 get
 the


true
 true
 gains.
 But
 I
 think
 until
 we


start
 to
 see
 something
 roll
 over,
 like
 I


think
 that
 that's
 why
 the
 price
 has
 gone


to
 200,
 and
 I
 don't
 think
 that
 until
 you


until
 you
 see
 net
 dollar
 retention,


until
 you
 see
 revenue
 year-over-year,


all
 that
 grow.


>> Um,


>> I
 think
 that's
 my
 key
 to
 stop.


>> Sorry.
 Sorry.
 Sorry.
 I
 was
 pulling
 up.


I
 was
 like,
 "What?"


>> He
 was
 on
 fire.
 He
 was
 on
 fire.
 No,
 but


Matt
 Matt,
 the
 point
 you're
 broadly


making
 about
 how
 they're
 doing
 two


billion
 in
 net
 income
 potentially
 a


quarter
 uh
 or
 potentially
 a
 year
 on
 a


company
 that's
 realistically
 had
 their


product
 in
 the
 market
 commercially
 for


eight
 years
 and
 gone
 pedal
 to
 the
 metal


in the
 past
 three
 years.
 I
 think
 that's


a
 big
 deal.
 Now,
 the
 problem
 is
 people


will
 say,
 "Well,
 okay,
 it's
 a
 $500


billion
 company
 doing
 two
 billion
 in
 net


income.
 That's
 a
 bit
 egregious."
 And


like
 yeah,
 you
 can
 say
 that's
 fair,
 but


then
 it
 comes
 down
 to
 what
 Amir
 has
 been


saying,
 which
 is
 this
 whole
 margin


profile
 thing.
 I
 mean,
 like
 Amir,
 can


you
 speak
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 to
 this


question
 of
 growth
 in
 margins?
 Because


do
 you
 think
 there's
 a
 world
 where
 they


can
 get
 free
 cash
 flow
 margins
 above
 65%


or
 do
 you
 think
 the
 sustainability
 of


that
 65%
 is
 realistic?
 Because
 if
 it
 is,


is
 it
 kind
 of
 the
 street
 just
 saying


we've
 never
 seen
 a
 a
 company
 like
 this


in
 the
 history
 of
 software
 and
 therefore


yeah,
 we're
 giving
 it
 a
 600
 PE,
 but


we're
 not
 that
 afraid
 to
 give
 it
 that


type
 of
 multiple.


>> Look,
 the
 the
 thing
 with
 with
 multiples


is
 that
 you
 know
 they
 don't
 really
 work


for
 this
 kind
 of
 hyperrowth
 company
 and


they've
 never
 done
 it
 uh
 you
 know


historically
 either.
 So
 trying
 to


rationalize
 like
 uh
 let
 me
 see
 currently


Palanteer
 is
 trading
 at
 665
 times
 PE


150
 times
 price
 to
 sales.
 Now
 those
 are


you
 know
 looking
 at
 a
 trailing
 12


months.
 Even
 if
 you
 look
 a
 year
 out
 with


you
 know
 uh
 analyst
 expectations
 that


have
 been
 proving
 you
 know
 too


pessimistic
 historically
 it
 will
 still


not
 make
 sense
 because
 the
 company's


growing
 at
 50%
 like


these
 multiples
 you
 know


they
 um
 they
 grow
 just
 too
 quickly
 where


like
 it
 doesn't
 really
 matter
 if
 the
 uh


PE
 is
 600
 500
 400
 like
 these
 are
 all


expensive
 like
 if
 if
 Palanteer
 was
 you


know
 cut
 in
 half
 at
 300
 PE
 that
 will


still
 be
 expensive.
 So
 you
 can't


rationalize
 this
 kind
 of
 company
 by
 u


the
 multiples.
 You
 can
 rationalize
 it


you
 know
 uh
 by
 doing
 an
 evaluation
 where


you
 look
 okay
 what
 is
 this
 company
 going


to
 be
 doing
 for
 the
 you
 know
 next
 10


years.
 Oh
 I
 mean
 what's
 our
 best
 guess


as
 of
 right
 now
 and
 then
 you
 can
 start


to
 make
 sense
 of
 it
 because
 you're


looking
 at
 okay
 what
 are
 they
 going
 to


do
 you
 know
 far
 out
 into
 the
 future
 and


and
 you
 know
 you
 bring
 it
 back
 today.
 So


valuation
 wise
 you
 can
 try
 to
 you
 know


see
 okay
 what
 is
 palunteer
 work
 but
 when


you
 try
 to
 price
 it
 you
 know
 with
 the
 PE


and
 and
 price
 of
 sales
 it
 will
 never


make
 sense
 for
 this
 kind
 of
 company


historically
 you
 you
 wouldn't
 be
 able
 to


buy
 any
 of
 these
 you
 know
 uh
 super
 large


you
 know
 to
 today's
 you
 know
 top
 10
 top


five
 companies
 when
 when
 they
 were
 in
 in


this
 phase
 because
 they
 all
 had


expensive
 multiples
 may
 maybe
 not
 to
 to


this
 degree
 but
 at
 the
 same
 time
 like


which
 company
 was
 expected
 to
 grow
 you


um
 continuously
 at
 50%
 at
 this
 size,
 you


know,
 while
 improving
 margin.
 So,
 you


know,
 you
 can
 make
 all
 these
 arguments


for
 is
 the
 premium
 in
 the
 pricing


justified
 or
 not.
 But
 even
 like
 if
 you


cut
 the
 stock
 price
 in
 half,
 it
 still


doesn't
 make
 sense.
 Like
 you
 would
 have


to,
 you
 know,
 drop
 it
 by
 80%
 to,
 you


know,
 kind
 of
 make
 sense
 of
 it.
 And
 I


think
 even
 the
 biggest
 bears
 would
 agree


that
 yeah,
 Palunteer
 is
 probably
 worth


more
 than
 if
 it
 was,
 you
 know,
 going
 to


drop
 80%
 to
 a
 place
 where
 the
 PE
 makes


sense.
 You
 know,
 pricing
 will
 not
 make


sense
 for
 a
 while
 in
 Palunteer.
 So,
 you


know,
 hyperfocusing
 on
 it
 doesn't
 really


make
 sense
 to
 me.
 Now,
 if
 you
 tell
 me


that
 you
 value
 the
 company
 and
 you


looked
 at,
 okay,
 here
 are
 my


expectations
 for
 the
 business,
 you
 know,


for
 the
 growth,
 cash
 flow,
 and
 risk


associated
 with
 that
 growth
 and
 cash


flows.
 and
 then
 you
 tell
 me,
 "Yeah,
 I


think
 it's
 worth
 this."
 And
 then
 you
 try


to,
 you
 know,
 reason
 around
 it,
 then
 we


can
 have
 an
 actual
 conversation.
 But
 if


if
 your
 argument
 is
 just
 like,
 "Yeah,


the
 P
 is
 too
 high."
 Well,
 like
 it
 won't


make
 sense
 for
 this
 kind
 of
 company,
 not


for
 a
 long
 while
 yet.
 So,
 um,
 those
 kind


of
 investors,
 you
 know,
 they
 will
 always


exist
 where
 they,
 you
 know,
 try
 to
 make


sense
 of
 the
 pricing
 and
 yeah,
 the
 the


the
 the
 stock
 is
 is
 not
 for
 you.
 And


that's
 not
 like
 living
 in
 bubble


territory.
 It's
 just
 like
 the
 mechanics


of
 the
 business
 in
 is
 in
 this
 stage.
 It


will
 not
 make
 sense
 like


ever
 for
 any
 company
 that's
 you
 know
 at


this
 size
 growing
 you
 know
 at
 this
 space


like
 the
 pricing
 will
 will
 never
 make


sense
 for
 you
 and
 and
 it's
 fine
 like
 if


you're
 not
 the
 kind
 of
 investor
 that's


comfortable
 you
 know
 by
 looking
 at
 a


high
 PE
 and
 not
 really
 beyond
 that
 then


you
 know
 the
 stock
 is
 simply
 not
 not
 for


you.
 Keep
 in
 mind
 like
 pricing
 is
 just


near-term
 or
 like
 uh
 trailing
 12
 months


like
 it
 won't
 capture
 the
 whole
 growth


narrative
 of
 Palanteer.
 For
 that
 you


need
 to
 value
 it
 and
 that's
 completely


different.


That's
 that's
 the
 way
 I
 view
 it.
 Anyway,


>> I
 think
 that's
 a
 really
 good
 point.
 I


think
 the
 the
 most
 important
 thing
 you


said
 right
 there
 is
 like
 if
 you
 were
 to


cut
 the
 pounder
 PE
 in
 half
 and
 it
 goes


from
 600
 to
 300,
 that's
 a
 pretty


expensive
 stock
 trading
 at
 three
 300


times
 earnings.
 So
 it
 almost
 becomes


like
 the
 numbers
 are
 irrelevant.
 And


it's
 like
 it's
 not
 to
 say
 that
 to


undermine
 the
 sophistication
 of
 looking


at
 those
 multiples,
 but
 it's
 rather
 to


say
 on
 a
 hyperrowth
 company
 and
 Tesla,


Amazon,
 these
 are
 very
 clear
 examples
 of


it.
 Uh
 the
 multiple
 always
 seems


aggressive,
 but
 if
 the
 company
 actually


is
 able
 to
 put
 up
 the
 growth,
 things


change,
 narrative
 changes,
 and
 then


obviously
 the
 companies
 can
 grow
 into


those
 valuations.
 And
 over
 the
 life


cycle
 of
 Palun's
 business,
 at
 some
 point


it's
 going
 to
 become
 very
 mature.
 It's


not
 going
 to
 be
 able
 to
 grow
 like
 it's


growing
 today,
 but
 that
 doesn't
 mean


that
 it's
 a
 bad
 company
 to
 buy
 in
 those


early
 days
 of
 growing
 based
 on
 not
 being


able
 to
 see
 what
 the
 future
 is
 going
 to


entail.
 It
 also
 discounts
 all
 the


innovation,
 all
 the
 R&D,
 all
 the
 new


products
 Pounder
 might
 be
 able
 to
 come


out
 with
 over
 the
 next
 decade
 that,
 you


know,
 a
 lot
 of
 us
 don't
 even
 know
 about


yet.


>> Yeah.
 Like
 I
 I
 was
 just
 just
 gonna
 say


that
 like
 pricing
 makes
 sense
 for
 a


business
 that
 that
 is
 mature.
 I
 mean,


Palunteer,
 we
 can't
 even
 guess
 the
 next


quarter
 correctly.
 They
 like
 blow
 it
 out


of
 the
 world.
 like
 what
 what
 what
 are


you
 talking
 about
 here?
 Like
 um
 like
 it


yeah
 it
 will
 not
 make
 it
 does
 make
 sense


and
 it
 is
 a
 great
 shortcut
 for
 you
 know


business
 that
 are
 mature
 when
 you
 where


you
 actually
 have
 a
 comparative
 because


you
 know
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day
 pricing


you
 know
 PE
 and
 and
 price
 to
 sales
 it


makes
 sense
 when
 you
 have
 a
 comparison


like
 who
 can
 you
 compare
 Palunteer
 to


today
 like
 is
 200p
 in
 general
 expensive


or
 not?
 Well,
 it
 depends
 what
 are
 the


different
 companies
 trading
 at
 within


the
 same
 industry.
 Like
 what
 are
 the


peers


>> to
 that
 company
 trading
 at?
 Then
 you
 you


you
 can
 assess
 okay
 two
 20
 is
 high
 or
 or


20
 is
 low.
 Like
 maybe
 they
 they
 should


come
 up
 to
 to
 35
 or
 whatever.
 Like
 you


need
 to
 have
 a
 comparison.
 There's
 no


comparison
 to
 palenteer
 and
 they
 are
 so


far
 from
 maturity
 that
 it
 simply
 makes


no
 sense
 to
 look
 at,
 you
 know,
 pricing.


That
 doesn't
 mean
 that
 you
 you
 you


should
 stick
 your
 head
 into
 the
 sand
 and


just
 ignore
 where
 Palanteer
 is
 trading


and
 be
 like,
 "Yeah,
 buy
 at
 all
 cost."


That's
 not
 what
 what
 I'm
 saying
 at
 all.


I'm
 I'm
 saying
 if
 you
 want
 to
 have
 a


valuation
 approach,
 then
 you
 actually


need
 to
 do
 an
 intrinsic
 valuation
 if
 you


want
 to
 make
 sense
 of
 it
 because
 it
 will


not
 make
 sense
 until
 Palanteer
 is
 mature


on
 a
 on
 a
 you
 know
 uh
 pricing
 side
 of


things.
 That's
 the
 way
 I
 view
 it.


Yeah,
 I
 agree.
 That
 makes
 a
 lot
 of


sense.
 Matt,
 your
 last
 point
 was
 about


revenue
 growth
 and
 how
 that's
 likely


going
 to
 scale
 up,
 which
 is
 why
 the


multiple
 continues
 to
 be
 where
 it
 is.


Uh,
 part
 of
 that
 revenue
 growth


eventually
 is
 going
 to
 have
 to
 be


customer
 count.
 Uh,
 how
 are
 you
 thinking


about
 this
 metric?
 Amir
 said
 that
 this


is
 going
 to
 be
 one
 of the
 more
 important


ones.
 Is
 this
 something
 where
 you
 want
 I


mean
 they
 have
 850
 customers.
 Is
 like
 is


there
 a
 number
 in
 your
 mind
 that
 you


want
 to
 see
 for
 this
 quarter
 on
 customer


account?


>> Yeah,
 I
 think
 I
 was
 around
 925.
 Let
 me


see.
 Um,
 so
 I
 think
 air
 you
 said
 100


quarter
 over
 quarter,
 which
 I
 think


>> Yeah,
 I
 mean
 I
 would
 agree.
 I
 think
 that


would
 be
 awesome.
 I
 They
 got
 80
 last


quarter,
 so
 they
 went
 from
 769
 to
 8.49.


Oh,
 there
 it
 is.
 Yeah.
 Um,


I
 don't
 know.
 I
 think
 10%
 quarter
 over


quarter
 is
 is
 pretty
 aggressive.
 But


even
 still,
 even
 at
 the
 925,
 that's
 47%


growth
 year-over-year.
 Uh
 because
 that's


going
 from
 a
 what
 629
 I
 think
 is
 the


yeah,
 the
 third
 quarter
 last
 year.
 So


from
 629
 to
 925,
 which
 is
 where
 I'm


forecasting
 that
 it's
 still
 47%


year-over-year,
 9%
 about
 quarter
 over


quarter,
 76
 growth
 in
 customers.
 I
 mean,


I
 I'm
 hope
 I'm
 like
 hopeful
 that
 they'll


beat
 the
 80
 from
 from
 last
 time
 because


I
 just
 seen
 so
 many
 different
 contracts,


but
 at
 the
 same
 time,
 I
 feel
 like
 what


we're
 seeing
 is
 more
 expansion
 of


existing
 contracts.
 There
 have
 been
 new


contracts,
 don't
 get
 me
 wrong,
 but
 I


think,
 and
 this
 is
 actually
 going
 to
 be


a
 question
 that
 I
 had
 for
 air,
 is
 one


thing
 that
 I
 don't
 track
 in
 my


spreadsheet
 is
 I
 think
 that
 you
 probably


do
 is
 that
 top
 10
 or
 maybe
 it's
 top
 20


customer
 um
 and
 and
 how
 that's
 growing.


But
 going
 back
 to
 your
 statement
 about


revenue
 growth,
 I
 mean,
 you're
 coming


off
 of
 a
 base
 of
 I
 think
 it
 was
 over


128%
 net
 dollar
 retention
 last
 quarter.


And
 if
 you're
 able
 to
 maintain
 that,


then
 you
 really
 don't
 have
 to
 move
 the


dial
 much
 in
 terms
 of
 getting
 new


customers
 to
 have
 total
 revenue
 expand


massively.
 But
 overall,
 I
 still
 think


you're
 going
 to
 have
 a
 a
 very
 good


growth
 overall
 from
 from
 about
 45
 to
 50%


year-over-year
 customer
 growth.


>> So,
 uh
 let's
 let's
 talk
 about
 the
 the


the
 customer
 count
 for
 a
 bit
 because


that
 is
 one
 metric
 that
 I've
 uh
 felt
 has


been
 trailing
 the
 actual
 growth
 a
 bit.


So
 you
 know
 the
 like
 net
 increase
 in


customers
 hasn't
 really
 matched
 my


expectation
 like
 when
 you
 just
 look
 at


revenues
 and
 you
 just
 ignore
 how
 many


customers
 are
 there
 and
 then
 you
 were


like
 to
 apply
 you
 know
 okay
 how
 are
 the


customer
 count
 likely
 growing
 based
 on


you
 know
 the
 growth
 that
 Palanteer
 is


seeing
 you
 know
 I
 I
 would
 have
 expected


it
 to
 be
 a
 lot
 more
 you
 know
 that
 hasn't


really
 exploded
 in
 the
 same
 way
 that


revenues
 and
 everything
 else
 has
 so
 I
 I


I
 agree
 that
 it
 is
 a
 big
 jump
 you
 know


um
 you
 know
 they
 they
 did
 80
 I
 expect


that
 to
 increase
 to
 you
 know
 100
 but
 my


reasoning
 is
 that
 you
 know
 Palanteer
 is


continuously
 increasing
 their
 presence


you
 know
 on
 a
 you
 know
 global
 and
 public


scale
 and
 also
 their
 attractiveness
 you


know
 each
 quarter
 that
 that
 that
 passes


the
 results
 of
 Palunteer
 integrations


keep
 taking
 a
 lot
 more
 attention
 in


media
 on
 earning
 calls
 there
 are
 more


and
 more
 customers
 saying
 that
 oh
 my
 god


it's
 like
 the
 testing
 that
 happened
 to


our
 business
 like
 for
 each
 quarter
 that


passes
 like
 the
 the
 whole
 presence
 of


Palunteer
 keeps
 growing
 and
 that's
 why
 I


think
 like
 they
 are
 increasingly
 more


attractive
 on
 the
 market
 and
 that's
 why


I
 expect
 you
 know
 customer
 account
 to


actually
 start
 to
 boom
 a
 bit
 now
 I
 know


that
 you
 know
 quarter
 to
 quarter
 as
 you


mentioned
 like
 this
 quarter
 result
 as


you
 mentioned
 that's
 like
 the
 cumulative


results
 of
 you
 know
 way
 back
 when
 like


it's
 not
 like
 yeah
 they
 did
 this
 in
 one


quarter
 and
 then
 all
 of
 the
 sudden


they're
 going
 to
 sign
 all
 of
 these
 deals


out
 of
 out
 of
 nowhere.
 No,
 it's
 like
 a


continuous
 process
 to
 to
 build
 up
 to,


you
 know,
 a
 quarterly
 result.
 But
 I


still
 think
 that
 it
 has
 been
 trailing
 a


bit.
 So
 I
 kind
 of
 expect
 that
 to


accelerate
 a
 lot
 more.
 Uh
 so
 that's
 why


I
 like
 kind
 of
 feel
 like
 a
 100
 I
 I
 don't


know
 where
 Amit
 is
 is
 on
 this
 where
 you


feel
 like
 where
 customer
 count
 growth


should
 be
 at
 but
 I
 think
 like
 100
 is
 not


too
 unreasonable
 given
 you
 know
 how
 big


Palunteer
 has
 gotten
 you
 know
 and
 how


much
 attention
 Palunteer
 has
 been


getting.
 So
 I'm
 curious
 where
 you're
 at


on
 on
 this
 one.
 Amit


>> I
 agree.
 I
 think
 it's
 time
 for
 them
 to


be
 adding
 triple
 digit
 customers
 every


single
 quarter.
 Um,
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 it's


going
 to
 happen
 and
 I
 think
 they
 can
 get


away
 with
 a
 couple
 more
 quarters
 of
 not


doing
 that
 simply
 because
 their
 margins


are
 good
 and
 the
 average
 deal
 size
 is
 so


large
 that
 it
 wouldn't
 really
 affect


revenue.
 But
 I
 agree
 with
 you
 given
 the


level
 of
 momentum
 we
 are
 seeing


particularly
 in
 US
 commercial.
 It
 would


be
 I
 mean
 they're
 already
 guiding
 for


45%
 of
 year
 growth
 right
 that
 they
 up


the
 guide.
 So
 how
 do
 you
 get
 that


growth?
 You
 have
 to
 be
 confident
 that


the
 customer
 acquisition
 cycle
 is


working.
 And
 so
 from
 that
 perspective,


it's
 like
 you
 would
 imagine
 the
 deals


start
 closing
 more
 immediately
 and
 uh


the
 customer
 count
 scales.
 Also
 again
 I


I
 think
 we
 are
 all
 underestimating
 the


level
 of
 brand
 awareness
 the
 company
 has


gotten
 and
 just
 from
 like
 my
 visits
 to


AIPCON
 the
 the
 these
 customers
 are
 are


coming
 to
 the
 conference
 because
 they


want
 to
 be
 associated
 with
 Palunteer


like
 they
 like
 we
 didn't
 even
 talk
 about


the
 Nvidia
 partnership
 yet
 we'll
 get


into
 that
 but
 like
 the
 fact
 that
 Nvidia


and
 Jensen
 Wong
 the
 most
 important
 guy


in
 the
 world
 says
 that
 this
 is
 the
 most


important
 software
 company
 in
 the
 world


for
 the
 enterprise
 like
 what
 what
 does


that
 do
 for
 the
 sales
 and
 marketing
 of


all
 these
 customers
 that
 want
 to
 develop


a
 relationship.
 So,
 if
 we
 don't
 see
 it


this
 quarter,
 that's
 fine,
 but
 I
 would


imagine
 by
 Q4
 and
 onward,
 we
 should
 be


adding
 triple
 digit
 customers.
 I
 think


you're
 100%
 correct
 on
 that.


Um,
 having
 said
 that,
 let's
 transition


to
 the
 Nvidia
 partnership.
 Um,
 let
 me


play
 the
 clip
 right
 here.
 It
 was
 pretty


iconic
 seeing
 this
 at
 the
 GTC
 conference


from
 Nvidia
 in
 DC.
 Jensen
 and
 Karp
 also


took
 the
 stage
 to
 do
 CNBC
 together,


which
 was
 quite
 incredible.
 But
 this
 was


Jensen
 on
 Tuesday.


discussing
 the
 partnership
 with
 Pounder.


>> This
 is
 the
 single
 fastest
 enterprise


enterprise
 company
 in
 the
 world.


Probably
 the
 single
 most
 important


enterprise
 stack
 in
 the
 world
 today.


Palunteer
 ontology.


Anybody
 from
 Palunteer
 here?
 I
 was
 just


talking
 to
 Alex
 earlier.


This
 is
 Palunteer
 ontology.
 They
 take


information,


they
 take
 data,
 they
 take
 human
 judgment


and
 they
 turn
 it
 into
 business
 insight.


We
 work
 with
 Palanteer
 to
 accelerate


everything
 Palanteer
 does
 so
 that
 we


could
 do
 data
 processing,
 data


processing
 at
 a
 much
 much
 larger
 scale


and
 more
 speed
 whether
 it's
 structured


data
 of
 the
 past
 and
 of
 course
 we'll


have
 structured
 data,
 human
 recorded


data,
 unstructured
 data
 and
 process
 that


data
 for
 our
 government,
 for
 national


security
 and
 for
 enterprises
 around
 the


world.
 process
 that
 data
 at
 speed
 of


light
 and
 to
 find
 insight
 from
 it.
 This


is
 what
 it's
 going
 to
 look
 like
 in
 the


future.
 Palunteer
 is
 going
 to
 integrate


NVIDIA
 so
 that
 we
 could
 process
 at
 the


speed
 of
 light
 and
 at
 extraordinary


scale.


Okay,
 Nvidia
 and
 Palanteer.


>> They
 go
 on
 to
 do
 a
 demo
 uh
 that
 was


uploaded
 as
 well
 about
 Lowe's
 and
 how


they
 were
 integrating
 NVIDIA
 models
 into


pounder
 AIP.
 Uh
 Matt,
 let's
 start
 with


you.
 What
 was
 your
 reaction
 to
 just


seeing
 that
 partnership
 and
 impact
 do


you
 think
 it
 has
 on
 the
 company
 long


term?


>> Yeah,
 I
 mean
 I
 think
 it's
 uh
 it's
 vital,


right?
 I
 mean,
 Compute
 is
 is
 obviously
 a


huge
 piece
 of
 being
 able
 to
 get
 things


up
 and
 running
 and
 it
 matches
 entirely


with
 a
 great
 partnership
 with
 with
 both


of
 them,
 right?
 I
 mean
 without
 being


able
 to
 structure
 things
 in
 an


appropriate
 manner
 and
 have
 them


automated
 in
 an
 appropriate
 manner
 um


which
 is
 obviously
 putting
 it
 in
 an


order
 and
 in
 a
 a
 manner
 that
 makes
 sense


then
 you
 know
 why
 compute
 it
 at
 all


right
 I
 mean
 this
 does
 doesn't
 make


sense
 in
 terms
 of
 being
 able
 to
 do
 so


now
 if
 you're
 able
 to
 have
 things


running
 much
 faster
 and
 having


calculations
 set
 up
 that
 are
 automated


you're
 going
 to
 be
 able
 to
 get
 things


that
 run
 much
 smoother
 um
 time
 series


data
 that
 shows
 up
 in
 a
 faster
 manner.


Um
 the
 ability
 to
 to
 come
 up
 with
 models


that
 showed
 that
 your
 digital
 twin
 needs


to
 be
 optimized
 here
 or
 there
 or


elsewhere.


It'll
 shrink
 the
 amount
 of
 uh
 or
 shrink


the
 amount
 of
 time
 it
 takes
 for
 each


individual
 say
 calculation
 to
 take
 place


and
 or
 it'll
 increase
 the
 amount
 of


model
 runs
 that
 you
 can
 use
 to
 see
 if


more
 optimization
 needs
 to
 be
 done.


Sometimes
 what
 ends
 up
 happening
 is


people
 will
 say,
 "Well,
 I'll
 only
 run


100
 iterations
 of
 this
 calculation
 which


might
 have
 thousands
 of
 different
 nodes


in
 it
 because
 of
 the
 time
 it
 takes."


Well,
 if
 you're
 able
 to
 integrate


collectively
 with
 with
 an
 Nvidia
 chip
 or


or
 system,
 then
 you
 might
 do
 a
 thousand.


You
 might
 be
 able
 to
 find
 one
 or
 two


additional
 steps
 that
 you
 could
 take


that
 might
 lead
 to
 thousands
 of
 dollars


of
 additional
 uh
 opportunity
 that


otherwise
 you
 might
 have
 just
 skipped


over
 for
 time
 purposes,
 right?


Amir,
 your
 thoughts
 on
 the
 partnership?


>> Yeah,
 you
 know,
 I'm
 I'm
 not
 an
 engineer


to
 actually
 understand
 fundamentally


what
 a
 partnership
 with
 Nvidia
 in
 this


capacity
 actually
 means
 like
 what's
 the


difference,
 you
 know,
 prior
 to
 the


partnership
 and
 after.
 So
 from
 my


perspective,
 the
 biggest
 takeaway
 here


is
 that
 Nvidia
 reiterates
 you
 know
 what


Corp
 and
 the
 team
 has
 been
 you
 know


banging
 on
 on
 the
 table
 for
 you
 know


continuously
 and
 that
 is
 you
 know
 that


ontology
 is
 like
 the
 most
 important
 part


and
 that
 is
 what
 you
 will
 need
 in
 order


to
 you
 know
 bring
 AI
 properly
 into
 the


enterprise.
 you
 know
 being
 able
 to


assign
 properties
 to
 any
 kind
 of
 data


you
 know
 uh
 and
 contextualize
 everything


in
 in
 a
 way
 that
 you
 can't
 do
 without
 an


ontology.
 So
 the
 my
 biggest
 takeaway


from
 this
 you
 know
 partnership
 is
 uh


Jensen
 Huang
 reiterating
 that
 ontology


is
 the
 most
 important
 part
 and
 you
 do


need
 it
 you
 know
 then
 in
 terms
 of
 like


what
 the
 actual
 partnership
 does
 how
 it


accelerates
 everything
 like
 I
 I
 don't


understand
 that
 part
 uh
 yet
 like
 I
 would


have
 to
 have
 it
 broken
 down
 to
 me
 to


actually
 make
 sense
 of
 it.
 So,
 I
 don't


know
 about
 that
 part,
 but
 I
 still
 think


like
 Nvidia
 is
 now
 the
 biggest
 company


in
 the
 world,
 $5
 trillion
 market
 cap.


They've
 been
 at
 the
 forefront
 of
 this


whole
 AI
 re
 revolution.
 Everyone
 pays


attention
 to
 them.
 And
 them
 coming
 out


and
 saying,
 as
 you
 mentioned,
 like,


yeah,
 it's
 probably
 the
 most
 important,


you
 know,
 uh,
 enterprise
 software


company
 in
 the
 world.
 Like
 that
 speaks


volumes
 and
 reiterating
 like
 everything


that,
 you
 know,
 Carpenter
 team
 has
 been


saying
 about
 ontology
 in
 general.
 So


that's
 like
 my
 biggest
 takeaway
 from
 all


of
 this
 and
 uh
 um
 as
 you
 mentioned
 I


also
 think
 that
 it
 will
 be
 kind
 of


wakeup
 call
 to
 a
 lot
 of
 businesses
 out


there.


>> Yeah,
 I
 agree.
 Just
 having
 Jensen


reinforce
 that
 Palenter
 is
 the
 most


important
 software
 company
 in
 the
 world


from
 an
 enterprise
 stack
 perspective.
 I


think
 that's
 what's
 really
 really


important
 and
 obviously
 uh
 Nvidia
 has
 an


incentive
 to
 do
 this
 because
 they
 want


to
 make
 sure
 that
 all
 these
 GPUs
 and
 all


this
 compute
 that
 they're
 selling
 all


the
 hyperscaler
 capex
 like
 it
 has
 to


have
 a
 use
 case
 and
 Palanteer
 has
 been


saying
 all
 the
 value
 is
 going
 to
 be
 in


chips
 and
 ontology
 chips
 is
 the
 hardware


that
 makes
 the
 value
 get
 created


ontology
 is
 the
 is
 what
 allows
 the
 value


to
 be
 actualized
 in
 the
 real
 world
 and


so
 to
 have
 someone
 who's
 creating
 the


chips
 partner
 with
 the
 other
 company


that's
 saying,
 "Hey,
 we're
 the


beneficiaries
 of
 the
 chip.
 We're
 the


impact
 of
 the
 chips
 in
 the
 first
 place,


not
 just
 like
 the
 the
 the
 the
 the


models,
 but
 the
 integration
 of
 the


models
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day."
 That
 is
 a


really
 powerful
 partnership.
 And
 I
 think


that
 could
 lead
 to
 more
 increased


customer
 account
 with
 the
 increased


brand
 awareness.


>> Yeah.
 you
 you
 know
 I
 I
 was
 going
 to


mention
 you
 know
 how
 um
 the
 quarter


prior
 like
 all
 of
 the
 hyperscalers


started
 coming
 out
 and
 you
 know


mentioning
 Palanteer
 for
 example


Microsoft
 was
 mentioning
 Palunteer
 in


their
 own
 earning
 calls
 and
 as
 you


mentioned
 like
 it
 has
 to
 make
 sense
 uh


to
 the
 hyperscalers
 and
 ultimately
 to


Nvidia
 like
 because
 you
 are
 building


like
 you
 are
 investing
 so
 much
 capex


into
 all
 of
 this
 compute
 but
 if
 you


can't
 you
 know
 justify
 the
 cost
 like
 if


that
 compute
 isn't
 being
 utilized
 then


you
 can't
 justify
 you
 know
 spending
 all


of
 that
 capex.
 So
 it
 is
 in
 the


hyperscaler's
 interest
 that
 their


clients
 find
 a
 way
 to
 utilize
 all
 of


that
 compute
 and
 which
 is
 why
 I
 I
 think


like
 all
 this
 partnerships
 with


Palunteer
 you
 know
 with
 with
 Google,


Microsoft,
 Amazon
 like
 they
 have
 kind
 of


to
 push
 Palanteer
 because
 like
 they
 have


all
 of
 this
 dormant
 computer
 they
 keep


like
 uh
 investing
 so
 much
 capex
 uh
 they


need
 to
 ensure
 that
 their
 customers


actually
 start
 to
 utilize
 it
 in
 order
 to


justify
 you
 know
 all
 of
 that
 spending.


So
 I
 think
 similarly
 Jensen
 Huang
 like


kind
 of
 pushes
 Palanteer
 because
 you


know
 it
 has
 to
 make
 sense
 out
 there
 in


in
 the
 AI
 world
 like
 okay
 we
 have
 all
 of


this
 compute
 but
 when
 do
 we
 actually


start
 to
 see
 value
 from
 it
 because
 if


there's
 no
 value
 on
 it
 from
 it
 then


people
 are
 going
 to
 stop
 buying
 chips


like
 it
 it
 makes
 no
 sense
 if
 you
 can


start
 extracting
 value
 so
 it
 makes
 sense


that
 the
 hyperscalers
 were
 pushing


Palanteer
 probably
 still
 are.
 It
 makes


sense
 that
 Jensen
 Huang
 now
 even
 himself


starts
 pushing
 you
 know
 talent
 here


because
 once
 you
 know
 people
 start


seeing
 like
 oh
 my
 god
 we're
 actually


extracting
 huge
 amounts
 of
 value
 from
 AI


now
 it
 makes
 sense
 that
 we're
 spending


so
 much
 capex
 now
 it
 makes
 sense
 you


know


uh
 uh
 in
 that
 regard
 so
 you
 know
 that's


the
 way
 I
 view
 it.


Yeah,
 I
 agree.
 There's
 got
 to
 be
 an


impact
 to
 that
 capex
 and
 it
 looks
 like


Palunteer
 is
 creating
 that
 impact
 with


their
 use
 cases.
 Um,
 last
 question
 for


you
 guys.
 Again,
 thank
 you
 everybody
 for


joining.
 We
 will
 be
 live
 at
 3:30
 p.m.


Eastern
 on
 Monday
 as
 we
 get
 into


earnings
 and
 uh
 we'll
 be
 covering
 it


throughout
 the
 course
 of
 Monday


afternoon
 once
 we
 get
 those
 earnings.


Uh,
 Rob,
 thank
 you
 for
 the
 super
 chat.
 I


just
 hit
 four
 million
 after
 going
 golden


on
 Paler
 back
 in
 2023.
 Keep
 the
 keep
 up


the
 good
 work,
 fellas.
 Congratulations.


I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 have
 similar


stories
 and
 uh
 it
 really
 has
 been
 the


journey
 of
 a
 lifetime.
 Uh
 Rob,
 you
 have


some
 other
 super
 chats
 here
 with
 some


questions.
 I
 think
 the
 last


uh
 discussion
 we're
 going to
 have
 will


will
 sum
 up
 a
 lot
 of
 your
 questions
 and


and
 and
 that
 comes
 down
 to
 what
 should


Palanteer
 do
 with
 their
 cash.
 So
 they


have
 six
 billion
 in
 cash.
 They're


probably
 going
 to
 have
 6.2
 to
 6.3


billion
 in
 the
 next
 quarter.
 No
 debt.
 Uh


a
 lot
 of
 rumors
 of
 a
 stock
 split,
 a
 lot


of
 rumors
 of
 acquisition.
 Should
 they
 be


investing
 the
 money
 in
 different
 venture


companies?
 I
 mean,
 I'm
 curious
 what
 you


guys
 are
 thinking.
 I'll
 just
 give
 my


thoughts
 real
 quick.
 I
 do
 not
 think


there's
 going to
 be
 a
 stock
 split.
 I


think
 that's
 a
 weird
 rumor
 that
 got


started.
 I
 mean,
 you're
 going
 to
 need


the
 stock
 to
 be
 a
 bit
 higher
 than
 200


for
 them
 to
 justify
 splitting
 it.
 Also,


there's
 already
 2.5
 billion
 shares


outstanding.
 I
 don't
 think
 Pounder
 wants


to
 have
 8
 10
 billion
 shares
 outstanding.


So,
 I
 really
 don't
 think
 that's
 going
 to


happen.
 Terms
 of
 their
 cash,
 I
 don't


think
 they
 should
 do
 anything
 with
 their


cash.
 I
 don't
 think
 they
 should
 buy
 back


stock.
 And
 I
 don't
 think
 they
 should


invest
 it
 in
 crypto.
 I
 don't
 think
 they


should
 buy
 gold.
 I
 think
 they
 should


keep
 it
 on
 the
 balance
 sheet,
 get
 a
 nice


three
 and
 a
 half%
 return
 from
 money


market
 funds
 and
 just
 let
 that
 cash
 sit


there
 because
 other
 than
 investing
 it
 in


sales
 and
 marketing,
 maybe
 hiring
 people


to
 increase
 growth.
 I
 mean,
 like
 that


stuff
 is
 great.
 I
 don't
 think
 they


should
 be
 taking
 that
 much
 risk
 with


that
 cash.
 I
 think
 having
 that
 cash
 and


having
 a
 fortress
 balance
 sheet
 is


really
 balance
 sheet
 is
 really


important.
 Matt,
 how
 are
 you
 thinking
 of


the
 the
 six
 billion
 in
 cash?


I
 mean,
 I
 don't
 I
 don't
 necessarily


think
 that
 they
 should
 be
 spending
 it


like
 crazy
 either,
 but
 I
 do
 think
 that


there's
 a
 place
 to
 utilize
 some
 of
 it


for
 venture
 capital
 and
 uh
 I
 think
 that


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 that
 leave


unfortunately
 Palanteer
 because
 they


have
 the
 entrepreneurial
 spirit
 and
 some


of
 that
 money
 could
 go
 to
 help
 starting


up
 some
 of
 their
 companies
 or
 at least


fe
 feeding
 or
 fueling
 some
 of
 them
 if


they
 leave
 on
 amicable
 terms
 of
 course.


uh
 and
 and
 you
 know,
 Palanteer
 doesn't


necessarily
 want
 to
 embed
 whatever


they're
 working
 on
 into
 into
 the
 broader


product
 uh
 line
 of
 of
 what's
 going
 on
 at


at
 Palanteer.
 I
 also
 think
 that
 one
 of


the
 key
 things,
 which
 you
 know,
 I
 I
 I


wrestle
 with
 myself,
 so
 I'm
 going
 to
 say


it
 and
 I'm
 sure
 people
 will
 poke
 holes


on
 it
 and
 it's
 something
 I've
 been


saying
 for
 quite
 some
 time.
 There's
 a


lot
 of
 partnerships
 that
 go
 on
 with
 the


cloud
 businesses
 like
 AWS,
 Azure,
 Google


Cloud,
 and
 that's
 good.
 I
 think
 that


that
 should
 be
 fine
 because
 that
 that


allows
 Palanteer
 to
 get
 up
 and
 running


very
 quickly.
 But
 I
 think
 one
 of the


things
 that
 could
 be
 done
 at
 a
 premium


that
 Palanteer
 could
 control
 more
 so


especially
 if
 there's
 very
 proprietary


data
 uh
 that
 they
 want
 to
 make
 sure
 you


know
 is
 very
 isolated
 and
 and
 maybe
 kept


away
 from
 say
 other
 companies.
 They


could
 create
 their
 own
 disperate
 um


cloud
 product
 that
 is
 allowing
 them
 to


potentially
 control
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 of


the
 process.
 Granted,
 I
 know
 it
 will


requires
 a
 lot
 of
 infrastructure
 and


capital,
 but
 I
 think
 in
 the
 long
 run,


we've
 seen
 how
 good
 of
 a
 multiple
 that's


generated
 for
 value
 for
 some
 of
 these


other
 companies
 like
 AWS
 and
 or
 sorry,


Amazon,
 Microsoft,
 and
 Google.
 Maybe


it's
 something
 that's
 useful,
 but
 I


think
 I
 would
 rather
 go
 the
 venture


capital
 route
 before
 doing
 something


like
 that
 because
 I
 think
 venture


capital
 investing
 in
 stuff
 like
 Ouija


and
 and
 some
 of these
 other
 things
 that


unfortunately
 may
 or
 may
 not
 pan
 out.
 I


think
 in
 the
 long
 run
 helps
 propel
 us


into
 the
 next
 uh
 the
 next
 decade
 or
 or


two
 of
 new
 industries
 that
 can
 arise.
 So


that's
 where
 I
 would
 hope.
 Of
 course,
 I


would
 like
 to
 see
 some
 buyback
 because


of
 the
 the
 sharebased
 compensation.
 As
 a


shareholder,
 I'm
 always
 trying
 to


acquire
 more
 of
 the
 company.
 Um,
 so
 I'm


still
 buying
 to
 this
 day.
 Um,
 and
 uh,
 I


I
 took
 a
 long
 pause
 for
 a
 long
 while,


but
 you
 know,
 since
 we
 since
 we
 met
 up


in
 New
 York,
 it
 made
 sense
 to
 just


continue
 to
 buy
 more
 and
 more
 of
 the


company.
 I
 think
 it's
 a
 phenomenal


company
 I
 want
 to
 hold
 for
 a
 long
 term.


So,
 I
 am
 somewhat
 selfish
 that
 not


necessarily
 use
 it
 all
 for
 buybacks,


right?
 don't
 don't
 exceed
 cash
 flow
 from


operations
 but
 I
 do
 think
 that
 there


should
 be
 5
 to
 10%
 maybe
 closer
 to
 10%


of
 that
 cash
 flow
 from
 operations
 to
 be


used
 for
 for
 buybacks
 to
 at least
 offset


and
 I
 know
 stay
 at
 10%
 that's
 fine
 but


eventually
 you'll
 hopefully
 be
 able
 to


to
 fully
 offset
 sharebased
 compensation


which
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 have
 been


complaining
 about
 for
 the
 last
 several


years
 is
 that
 expansion
 of
 of
 share


count
 because
 of
 sharebased
 compensation


>> thoughts
 on
 the
 cash
 pile


Yeah,
 it's
 it's
 a
 it's
 a
 great
 problem


to
 have
 as
 a
 company,
 you
 know,
 no
 debt


and
 ever
 increasing
 cash
 pile.
 Uh


that
 is
 an
 interesting
 thought
 that
 Matt


made
 about
 having,
 you
 know,
 own
 cloud


infrastructure
 that
 you
 can
 offer
 you


know
 in
 highly
 sensitive
 stuff.
 But
 the


problem
 the
 the
 only
 problem
 I
 see
 is


that
 that
 will
 compress
 you
 know


margins.
 it
 will
 you
 know
 go
 from
 a


capital
 light
 business
 to
 you
 know
 quite


capital
 uh
 intense
 business
 where
 you


have
 to
 you
 know
 because
 the
 the
 problem


is
 that
 we're
 seeing
 is
 that
 you
 know


each
 new
 generation
 of
 chip
 you
 know


increasingly
 more
 expensive
 and
 you
 need


to
 like
 keep
 upgrading
 that's
 why
 you


see
 like
 these
 capex
 cycles
 you
 know


like
 for
 for
 every
 quarter
 that
 passes


like
 these
 hypers
 scales
 are
 like


increasing
 yeah
 we're
 going
 to
 be
 need


spending
 like
 hundreds
 more
 than
 we


expected
 you
 know
 over
 the
 over
 the


coming
 periods.
 So
 I
 I
 don't
 really
 want


Palunteer
 to
 enter
 that.
 I
 think
 they


have
 like
 kind
 of
 infinite
 scalability


with
 their
 current
 capital
 light
 model


where
 they
 can
 have
 like
 extreme


margins.
 So
 I
 I
 don't
 know
 necessarily


like
 the
 whole
 implications
 of
 what
 you


know
 doing
 that
 would
 mean
 for
 Palunteer


and
 its
 cash.
 I
 don't
 think
 they
 have


enough
 cash
 to
 do
 that
 properly.
 they


would
 have
 to
 take
 on
 that
 mo
 most


likely
 you
 know
 $6
 billion
 I
 don't
 know


like
 how
 much
 you
 know
 building
 out
 the


whole
 data
 center
 with
 the


infrastructure
 and
 stuff
 would
 mean
 but


it
 is
 an
 interesting
 thought
 and
 maybe


there
 is
 such
 a
 scenario
 in
 the
 future


where
 it
 does
 make
 sense
 currently
 you


know
 we
 always
 mention
 like
 well


palanteer
 has
 some
 of
 the
 best
 investors


you
 know
 on
 its
 board
 you
 know
 the


co-founders
 you
 know
 Peter
 Kil
 uh
 one
 of


the
 most
 famous
 investors
 in
 the
 world,


most
 successful
 investors
 in
 the
 world,


Alex
 Karp
 himself
 ran
 a
 hedge
 fund.
 So


we
 we
 always
 thought
 that
 it
 was
 kind
 of


strange
 that
 they
 didn't
 really
 go
 the


venture
 route,
 you
 know,
 earlier,
 you


know,
 um


uh
 even
 you
 know
 other
 co-founders
 like


Joe
 Ldale
 also
 like
 involved
 in
 uh


investments
 for
 a
 long
 time.
 I
 would


have
 liked
 to
 see,
 you
 know,
 probably


they're
 going
 to
 go
 public
 soon,
 but
 it


always
 made
 sense
 to
 me,
 you
 know,
 if


they
 would
 have
 a
 stake
 in
 Andre
 and
 it


would
 have
 made
 sense
 for
 Andre
 to
 have


a
 stake
 in
 Palanteer
 considering
 how


tightly
 knit
 they
 are.
 H,
 you
 know,
 on


the
 hardware
 plus
 software
 side
 of


things,
 there's,
 you
 know,
 tiny
 tiny
 o


overlap.
 you
 know,
 Andre
 does
 some


software
 and
 I
 guess
 Palanteer
 in
 a
 very


limited
 capacity
 does
 some,
 you
 know,


hardware
 as
 well,
 but
 you
 know,
 not


anything
 major.
 Uh,
 so
 it
 would
 have


made
 sense
 to
 have
 a
 stake
 in
 Andrew.
 I


would
 have
 liked
 that,
 you
 know,


mutually,
 you
 know,
 to
 propel,
 you
 know,


the
 West
 into
 the
 next
 generation
 of


warfare
 kind
 of
 thing.
 But
 yeah,
 I
 to
 to


be
 honest,
 I
 don't
 really
 know
 and
 it's


not
 really
 a
 problem
 that
 they
 have
 to


address
 quite
 yet,
 you
 know,
 while
 um


you
 know
 interest
 rates
 are
 where
 where


they
 are
 just
 keep
 farming
 that
 cash.


But
 that
 is
 a
 conversation
 that
 will


become
 more
 and
 more
 important
 you
 know


as
 rates
 come
 down
 as
 the
 yield
 that


they
 they're
 able
 to
 get
 you
 know
 from


um
 buying
 treasury
 instruments
 and
 stuff


like
 that
 will
 come
 down
 over
 time
 most


likely.
 So
 it
 is
 something
 to
 consider.


I
 don't
 really
 have
 an
 answer
 like
 what


makes
 most
 sense.
 As
 I
 mentioned,
 it
 is


kind
 of a
 nice
 problem
 to
 have.
 They


shouldn't
 really
 burn
 cash
 for
 the
 sake


of
 burning
 cash
 either.
 Um,
 so
 as
 long


as
 you
 can
 farm
 yield
 do
 that


afterwards,
 then
 yeah,
 we
 can
 have
 a


conversation.
 But,
 you
 know,
 Corp
 has


said
 on
 on
 multiple
 occasions
 now
 that


they're
 they're
 not
 cash
 constrained
 in


terms
 of
 their
 growth.
 like
 piling
 in


more
 cash
 like
 uh
 burning
 more
 more
 cash


won't
 ne
 necessarily
 mean
 meaningful


increase
 in
 growth.
 So
 for
 now,
 you


know,
 it's
 not
 really
 something,
 you


know,
 that
 I'm
 concerning
 myself
 with


too
 much,
 but
 a
 stake
 in
 Andre,
 maybe


some
 other
 very
 prominent
 uh
 players
 in


the
 space,
 you
 know,
 especially
 con


considering
 they
 have
 um


uh
 um
 what's
 the
 gov
 ramp?
 What's
 the


product
 name?
 It's
 too
 early.


>> Fed
 start.


>> Fed
 start.
 Yeah.
 like
 considering
 they


have
 fed
 start
 they
 have
 quite
 a
 bit
 of


insight
 into
 the
 field
 and
 we've
 been


seeing
 and
 hearing
 a
 lot
 you
 know
 about


all
 of
 these
 new
 companies
 trying
 to


compete
 you
 know
 in
 the
 government
 space


you
 know
 enabled
 by
 Palanteer
 so
 they


have
 early
 visibility
 into
 you
 know


which
 companies
 might
 be
 winners
 there


so
 it
 would
 make
 sense
 to
 you
 know
 to


kind
 of
 acquire
 stakes
 in
 what
 they


believe
 you
 know
 are
 aligned
 with
 their


values
 and
 their
 core
 core
 missions
 you


know
 and
 stuff
 like
 that
 so
 Maybe
 that's


something
 that
 we
 will
 see
 in
 the


future,
 but
 for
 now,
 you
 know,
 it's
 not


a
 big
 problem
 to
 concern
 ourselves
 with


as
 long
 as
 rates
 are,
 you
 know,
 as


attractive
 as
 they
 are.


All
 right,
 there
 we
 go,
 folks.
 Thank
 you


all
 for
 joining
 once
 again.
 Uh
 very


excited
 to
 be
 here
 again.
 Uh
 we
 are


likely
 not
 going
 to
 be
 doing
 this
 weekly


anymore,
 and
 we
 talked
 about
 why
 in
 the


beginning,
 but
 we
 will
 be
 here
 every


single
 quarter.
 I'll
 be
 on,
 you
 know,


every
 single
 day
 talking
 about
 pounder.


Matt
 and
 me
 are
 tweeting
 about
 it.
 So,


it's
 not
 like
 we're
 stopping
 the


coverage.
 It's
 just
 the
 weekly
 edition


of
 this
 likely
 is
 not
 needed
 anymore.


And,
 you
 know,
 that's
 a
 really
 good


thing
 to
 be
 honest
 because
 it
 was
 needed


for
 four
 years
 and
 the
 company
 executed.


I
 don't
 think
 any
 of
 us
 expected
 450


billion
 when
 it
 was
 $6.
 But
 I
 I
 I
 also


agree
 with
 what
 Amir
 said
 as
 well


earlier
 in
 the
 show
 that
 I
 don't
 think


we're
 ever
 seeing
 this
 again
 in
 our


lifetimes.
 I
 mean,
 I
 really
 don't.
 It's


it's
 Matt,
 I'm
 curious
 your
 thoughts
 on


it,
 but
 I
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 we're
 ever


going
 to
 see
 a
 name
 go
 from
 six
 to
 200


in
 less
 than
 three
 years
 in
 the
 way
 that


it
 has.
 And
 we
 should
 really
 all
 cherish


the
 journey
 we're
 on
 because
 we're
 going


to
 look
 back
 on
 this
 20,
 30
 years
 from


now
 being
 like,
 man,
 we
 all
 across
 the


world
 as
 strangers
 got
 to
 experience


because
 of
 YouTube
 and
 Twitter
 and
 these


live
 streams,
 uh,
 witnessing
 history
 for


a
 company
 that
 will
 be
 talked
 about


probably
 centuries
 from
 now
 in
 terms
 of


how
 they
 became
 the
 most
 important


company
 in
 the
 world.


Yeah,
 it's
 tough.
 Uh
 you
 don't
 think
 I


don't
 think
 uh
 you'll
 see
 this
 very


regularly.
 Um
 I
 mean
 maybe
 you
 you
 have


a
 good
 lens
 on
 it
 too
 because
 you
 you


had
 hood
 at
 quite
 cheap
 valuations
 as


well.
 So
 um
 but
 it's
 rare
 and
 few
 and


far
 between
 and
 I
 think
 one
 of the


things
 is
 is
 some
 companies
 might
 do


something
 like
 this.
 They
 might
 move
 in


a
 manner
 like
 this,
 but
 a
 lot
 of
 them


will
 be
 all
 hype
 and
 then
 something


never
 really
 comes
 to
 fruition.
 This


company's
 actually
 executing.
 They're


doing
 really
 well.
 Um,
 so
 in
 that


respect,
 you
 know,
 I
 feel
 confident
 that


yeah,
 maybe
 the,
 you
 know,
 people
 might


say,
 "Oh
 my
 god,
 they're
 celebrating


$200."
 Maybe
 it
 does
 retrace.
 That's


fine.
 I
 get
 it.
 It
 is
 overvalued.
 But
 in


the
 long
 term,
 we're
 talking
 about
 a


company
 that's
 going to
 be
 one
 and
 a


half
 to
 two
 trillion
 dollars
 in
 my
 mind


easily.
 And
 so,
 you
 know,
 sure,
 you


know,
 t
 take
 your
 victory
 lap.
 If
 it


drops
 to
 150
 bucks,
 that's
 fine.
 I'm


still
 gonna
 be
 buying
 and
 uh
 eventually


it'll
 be
 worth
 uh
 you
 know,
 $500,
 $600
 a


share
 easily,
 probably
 more.
 And
 um
 you


know
 it'll
 be
 at
 some
 point
 paying


dividends
 at
 some
 point
 buying
 back
 a


crap
 ton
 of
 stock
 and
 I'll
 be
 able
 to


borrow
 against
 it
 or
 write
 covered
 calls


and
 continue
 to
 to
 live
 and
 and
 go
 about


my
 merry
 way.
 But
 yeah,
 it's
 going
 to
 be


very
 difficult
 to
 to
 find
 something
 like


we
 did
 um
 at
 at
 such
 a
 a
 cheap
 valuation


that
 uh
 was
 so
 misunderstood


and
 uh
 got
 to
 where
 it
 is.
 Yeah,
 I
 I


kind
 of
 blame
 Amit,
 you
 know,
 because
 uh


we,
 you
 know,
 we
 all
 used
 to
 get
 the


question,
 oh,
 okay,
 Palunteer
 it
 uh
 like


uh
 you
 know,
 50x
 whatever.
 I
 don't
 even


know
 like
 from
 where
 people
 had
 their


averages
 and
 they're
 like,
 "Okay,
 okay.


So,
 uh
 Palunteer
 like
 is
 is
 over
 now.


What's
 the
 next
 Palanteer?"
 I'm
 like,


"Dude,
 Palanteer
 is
 just
 getting


started.
 Like,
 we're
 not
 even
 at
 1,000


customers.
 Salesforce
 200,000


customers
 like
 Palunteer
 like
 just


getting
 started
 like
 this
 is
 nothing


like
 Palanteer's
 story
 is
 not
 over
 like


by
 far.
 Uh
 okay.
 So
 people
 are
 like
 okay


well
 what's
 the
 next
 talent
 here?
 Amit


he
 went
 and
 did
 the
 same
 with
 Robin
 Hood


like
 two
 companies
 doing
 the
 same
 thing


like
 normalizing
 this
 kind
 of
 thing
 like


like
 oh
 so
 so
 what's
 next
 Palunteer
 and


Hood
 like
 you
 see
 you
 seem
 to
 pick
 them


so
 often
 I
 mean
 so
 tell
 us
 what's
 next


Palanteer
 Hood
 like
 people
 he
 he
 he
 has


normalized
 this
 thing
 where
 people
 don't


actually
 realize
 how
 extremely
 rare
 it


is
 to
 find
 these
 kind
 of
 high
 quality


businesses
 that
 are
 executing
 to
 this


degree
 growing
 the
 way
 they
 are
 like
 uh


so
 I
 fully
 blame
 Amit
 every
 time
 I
 get


that
 question
 like
 what's
 the
 next


palenteer
 because
 you
 know
 he
 just
 seems


to
 keep
 making
 more
 and
 more
 of
 these
 so


let
 us
 know
 amit
 when
 you
 find
 the
 next


one
 and
 then
 we
 can
 do
 a
 weekly
 for
 that


company
 as
 well


>> well
 also
 Matt
 I
 mean
 Rocket
 Lab
 4
 to
 60


right
 like
 it's
 been
 a
 really
 strong


good
 three
 years
 and
 thankfully
 we
 a
 lot


of
 us
 used
 our
 insights
 from
 Poundier
 to


hopefully
 find
 that
 next
 one
 and
 uh
 you


know
 Robin
 Hood's
 worked
 out.
 Rocket
 Lab


has
 worked
 out,
 but
 it's
 just
 not
 easy.


And
 and
 and
 Rock
 Lab
 and
 and
 Robin
 Hood


are
 phenomenal
 and
 they
 both
 have
 their


own
 journeys.
 Uh
 but
 they
 also
 haven't


cultivated
 the
 type
 of
 community
 that


Pounder
 cultivated.
 I
 mean,
 the
 Pounder


those
 early
 days
 when
 everyone
 hated
 it,


media,
 Wall
 Street,
 etc.
 And
 a
 handful


of
 us
 online
 came
 together
 to
 do
 the


streams
 or
 the
 Substack
 articles
 and
 the


podcasts
 and
 the
 tweets
 like


Robin
 Hood
 was
 never
 hated
 like
 that.


Rocket
 Lab
 wasn't.
 and
 they
 like
 they


weren't
 really
 believed
 that
 they
 could


be
 the
 companies
 they
 are
 today
 which
 is


why
 they've
 been
 so
 asymmetric
 but


Palanteer
 was
 just
 thrown
 in
 the
 gutter


and
 you
 have
 this
 fierce
 community
 that


believed
 in
 it.
 So
 it's
 like
 I
 don't


know
 if
 we're
 getting
 that
 journey
 again


because
 you
 got
 to
 ask
 yourself
 you
 know


this
 is
 argument
 Tom
 Lee
 makes
 a
 lot
 but


one
 of
 the
 ways
 he
 justifies
 the
 stock


market
 premium
 is
 that
 there's
 not
 that


many
 public
 companies
 out
 there.
 Not


many
 companies
 go
 public
 anymore
 because


they're
 afraid
 to
 deal
 with
 the


ramifications
 of
 going
 public.
 So
 all


this
 money
 that's
 trying
 to
 escape


inflation
 has
 gold,
 Bitcoin,
 real
 estate


and
 then
 the
 stock
 market.
 And
 then
 in


the
 stock
 market,
 there's
 really
 50


companies
 that
 matter.
 One
 could
 argue


there's
 only
 25
 companies
 that
 matter


out
 of
 4,000
 public
 names.
 And
 I
 would


say
 Pounder
 is
 on
 that
 list.
 So
 it


really
 has
 been
 an
 incredible
 journey.


So
 much
 of
 the
 audience
 has
 been
 along


for
 this
 journey,
 which
 has
 just
 made
 it


so
 much
 cooler.
 And
 as
 you
 said,
 Amir,


if
 this
 journey
 is
 just
 starting,
 even


though
 we're
 at
 where
 we're
 at,
 uh
 this


could
 be
 a
 journey
 that
 goes
 on
 for
 a


very
 long
 time.


There
 you
 go.
 Thank
 you
 everybody.


Appreciate
 it.
 Fats,
 thank
 you
 for
 the


super
 chat.
 Happy
 Halloween.
 Congrats
 on


the
 conviction.
 The
 good
 and
 bad
 times


well
 deserved.
 Callie,
 thank
 you
 for
 the


100
 super
 chat
 as
 well.
 Very,
 very
 kind


of
 you.
 Absolutely
 means
 the
 world
 when


I
 meet
 these
 two
 guys.
 I'll
 make
 sure
 to


get
 them
 a
 drink
 from
 these
 super
 chats.


And
 uh
 yeah,
 hopefully
 everyone
 has
 a


great
 weekend
 and
 we'll
 see
 you
 guys
 on


Monday
 for
 per
 pounder
 earnings.


>> Good
 seeing
 you
 both
 and
 happy
 200.


>> Yeah,
 likewise.
 See
 you
 guys
 on
 Monday.


Gonna


>> Yeah,
 it'll
 be
 fun.
 Oh,
 real
 quick.


Amir,
 you
 got
 a
 super
 chat
 on
 your


channel.
 Amir,
 you
 are
 one
 of
 my


favorite
 quants.
 Appreciate
 your
 high


quality
 research
 work.
 Please
 keep
 them


coming.


>> Wait,

 channel?


>> That's

>> It's
 definitely
 I'm I'm
 gonna
 buy
 Matt


and
 Amit
 a
 drink
 on
 your
 dime
 next.


Like,
 I'm
 gonna
 share.
 Thank
 you
 so
 much


for
 the
 kind
 word
 kind
 words,
 Kro.
 I


don't
 I
 don't
 even
 know
 how
 to
 like
 uh


damn
 100
 bucks.
 What
 the
 [ __ ]


>> Thank
 you
 so
 much.


>> That's
 half
 a
 pound
 here
 now.


>> That's
 half
 a
 share,
 man.
 Thank
 you
 so


much.


>> Real
 real
 quick.
 Real
 quick,
 just
 before


we
 leave,
 first
 of
 all,
 Matt's
 Twitter,


I'm
 putting
 that
 in
 the
 chat.
 So,
 please


make
 sure
 if
 you're
 on
 my
 channel
 that


you
 are
 following
 him
 there.
 And
 then,


uh,
 Amir
 does
 have
 a
 website
 called


TypeF
 Capital.
 That's
 where
 he
 does


proprietary
 research
 reports.
 He
 also


has
 a
 Substack.
 So,
 please
 make
 sure
 to


check
 that
 out.
 Amir
 has
 done
 just
 an


exceptional
 job
 over
 the
 past
 couple


years
 specifically
 on
 valuation
 models


to
 analyze
 public
 companies.
 So
 if
 you


want
 a
 custom
 valuation
 model,
 you
 can


order
 one
 on
 his
 website.
 And
 if
 you


want
 to
 overall
 subscribe
 to
 his


newsletter,
 you
 can
 check
 him
 out
 there.


>> Yeah,
 thank
 you
 so
 much.
 Uh
 and
 also


check
 out
 Amit's
 Substack.
 He
 started
 he


posted
 two
 great
 analysis
 already.
 Um
 I


think
 it's
 just
 a
 matter
 of
 time
 until


Matt
 also
 creates
 a
 Substack.
 So
 look


forward
 to
 that.
 I'm
 to
 write
 on
 seeking


alpha.
 We
 got
 to
 get
 him
 into
 the


newsletter
 game.


>> May
 I
 think
 he
 still
 does,
 right?


>> I've
 been
 slacking.
 Steve
 reminds
 me


every
 day.


>> The
 problem
 is
 Matt's
 gotten
 too
 rich,


bro.
 Some
 of the
 parts
 of
 the
 community


have
 gotten
 too
 rich.
 You
 know,
 they're


thinking
 of
 just
 going
 on
 a
 beach
 like


so.
 It
 is
 what
 it
 is.
 It
 is
 what
 it
 is.


>> Yep.
 Yep.


>> All right.
 Thank
 everybody.
 Appreciate


it.
 We'll
 be
 back
 Monday
 for
 pound


earnings.
 Good
 night
 everybody.


>> Good
 night
 everybody.
 Thank
 you
 so
 much


again.
 K.
 Roger.
