the
 man
 himself,
 CEO
 of
 YouTube.


>> I
 didn't
 realize
 that
 when
 I
 took
 over


the
 CEO
 gig,
 a
 big
 part
 of
 my
 job
 would


be
 being
 a
 straight
 man.
 For
 a
 lot
 of


YouTubers
 out
 there,


>> YouTube
 is
 now
 by
 far
 the
 biggest


streamer
 in
 the
 world.


>> Shorts,
 I
 think,
 has
 just
 surpassed
 70


billion
 views
 a
 day.


>> Mohan
 was
 one
 of
 the
 pioneers
 of


internet
 advertising
 and
 keeping
 the


world's
 largest
 creator
 economy
 afloat.


We
 think
 we're
 really
 still
 in
 the
 early


days
 of
 our
 growth
 story
 and
 fulfilling


what
 our
 mission
 is,
 which
 is
 to
 give


everyone
 a
 voice
 and
 show
 them
 the


world.


>> Ladies
 and
 gentlemen,
 please
 welcome


YouTube
 CEO
 Neil
 Mohan.


How
 are
 you?
 Good
 to
 see
 you,
 brother.


Thanks.


Nice
 to
 see
 you,


>> David.
 How
 are
 you?
 Nice
 to
 see you.


>> All
 right.
 Welcome,
 Neil.


Neil


>> and
 I
 could
 have
 done
 that
 together.


>> I
 mean,
 you
 could
 have.


>> What
 did
 you
 think?
 Um,
 we
 talked
 to
 him


a
 little
 bit
 about
 which
 platform
 is
 the


most
 important.
 He
 said
 the
 one
 that


pays
 us
 the
 most.
 You
 don't
 pay
 for


content
 upfront.
 You've
 done
 some


experiments.
 You
 do
 it
 all
 with
 the
 55%


revenue
 split.
 You
 sweep
 45%.
 Seems
 like


you're
 doing
 pretty
 well.
 Are
 you
 taking


too
 much
 money
 from
 creators?


>> Let's
 get
 into
 it.


>> Can
 we
 get
 that
 down
 to
 30%?


Um,
 well,
 first
 of
 all,
 thank
 you
 all


for
 having
 me.
 It's
 a
 privilege
 to
 be


with
 you
 guys.
 Like
 they
 say,


>> uh,
 longtime
 listener,
 first-
 time


caller.
 So,
 it's
 great
 to
 be here
 with


all
 of
 you.


>> Do
 you
 listen
 to
 the
 podcast?
 Yeah.


>> Uh,
 I
 watch
 it.


>> Oh,
 you
 watch
 it?
 Where
 do
 you
 watch
 it?


Where
 did
 you
 you
 like
 Spotify?


>> On
 YouTube?


>> Oh,
 on
 YouTube.
 Yes,
 we're
 there
 now.
 We


are
 there
 now.
 Yes.


>> Can
 you
 please
 be
 prepared?


>> Yes.
 Yes.


>> I
 didn't
 know
 we
 had
 a
 YouTube
 channel.


Really?
 How's
 it
 doing?


>> How
 many
 folks
 watch
 it
 on
 watch
 it
 on


YouTube?
 Just
 out
 of
 cur.
 There
 we
 go.


All right.
 Okay.


>> It's
 about
 half.
 Yeah,


>> the
 channel
 is
 growing.
 You
 guys
 are


close
 to
 a
 million
 subs,
 watch
 time,


views,
 all
 up
 and
 to
 the
 right.
 So,


congrats
 to
 congrats
 to
 all
 of
 you
 guys


on
 that.
 But
 on
 your
 question,
 um,
 uh,


Jason,
 so
 we
 we've
 paid
 out
 in
 the
 last


3
 years
 over
 $70
 billion
 to
 the
 creator


economy.
 We
 are
 the
 we
 are
 the
 original


and
 world's
 largest
 creator
 economy.
 Um,


and
 so,


well
 done.
 And
 um
 that
 innovation
 which


is
 called
 the
 YouTube
 partner
 program
 is


well
 over
 a
 decade
 now.
 The
 the
 5545


that
 you're
 referring
 to.
 And
 um
 so
 we


pay
 out
 billions
 to
 creators
 creators


our
 media
 company
 partners
 the
 music


partners
 etc.
 Uh
 I'm
 using
 that
 term


creator
 and
 I'll
 use
 it
 for
 the
 la
 next


30
 minutes
 sort
 of
 in
 the
 broadest
 sense


of
 the
 term.
 Um
 it's
 just
 that
 the
 way


that
 we
 do
 it
 is
 very
 different.
 I
 mean,


we're
 we're
 a
 creator
 economy
 in
 the
 in


the
 true
 entrepreneurial
 sense
 of
 the


word,
 which
 is
 if
 you're
 a
 creator
 on


YouTube,
 um,
 contrasts
 to
 the


traditional
 model,
 you're
 betting
 on


yourself,
 which
 is,
 um,
 kind
 of
 the


opposite
 of
 sort
 of
 the
 way
 that


traditional
 media
 models
 have
 worked.


And
 as
 you
 grow,
 as
 your
 audience
 grow,


as
 your
 success
 grows,
 um,
 your


monetization
 grows,
 your
 business
 grows


as
 well.
 And
 not
 every
 creator
 on
 our


platform
 is
 going
 to
 become,
 you
 know,


Mr.
 Beast
 or
 Dude
 Perfect,
 but
 there


are,
 you
 know,
 north
 of
 3
 million


creators
 that
 are
 in
 that
 partner


program
 today
 earning
 revenue.


>> Back
 to
 my
 question,
 I
 feel
 like
 you've


created
 all
 these
 stars
 and
 you
 look
 at


the
 Tuckers,
 you
 look
 at
 the
 Megan's,


you
 know,
 we'll
 put
 ourselves
 maybe


right
 behind
 them.
 We
 all
 choose
 to
 turn


off
 monetization
 because
 the
 take
 rate's


too
 high
 and
 we
 can
 do
 it
 better


ourselves.
 Should
 you
 not
 start
 to
 think


about
 two
 classes
 of
 folks?
 The


upandcomers
 who
 don't
 have
 sales
 teams,


who
 don't
 have
 distributions,
 maybe


it's,
 you
 know,
 it's
 more
 about
 building


an
 audience
 and
 then
 maybe
 looking
 at


the
 folks
 like
 us
 slightly
 differently.


And
 this
 seems
 to
 be
 a
 weakness
 in
 your


game.
 Um,
 your
 take?


>> Um,
 I
 would
 I
 would
 say
 that,
 you
 know,


the
 way
 I
 think
 about
 he
 doesn't
 speak


for
 us
 just


for
 myself.
 No,
 but
 the
 point
 is


>> I
 just
 want
 to
 be
 clear
 that
 I
 love
 you.


No,
 no,
 but
 it's
 clear
 that
 people
 who


are
 at
 this
 level
 take
 it
 on
 themselves


because
 the
 45%
 is
 just
 an
 absurdly
 high


take
 rate
 for
 that
 level
 of
 person,
 the


Tuckers,
 the
 Megan,
 they'd
 rather
 just


bake
 their
 ads
 in.
 So,
 how
 do
 you
 think


about
 that
 level
 of
 folks?
 They


participate,
 but
 you
 don't
 monetize


them.


>> I
 think
 that
 that's
 um
 that's
 not
 the


way
 I
 would
 characterize
 it.
 First
 of


all,
 I
 think
 the
 the
 the
 way
 that
 I


think
 about
 it
 is
 all
 of
 these


monetization
 models
 should
 be
 available


to
 you
 depending
 on
 what
 your
 business


objectives
 are
 and
 what
 they're
 not.
 And


I've
 talked
 to
 a
 bunch
 of
 you
 guys
 about


sort
 of
 how
 you
 think
 about
 that


monetization
 question
 and
 what's


important
 versus
 audience
 building
 and


not.
 And
 by
 the
 way,
 it's
 the
 same
 type


of
 conversation
 that
 happens
 with
 sports


leagues
 or
 studios
 or
 what
 have
 you


there.
 And
 so
 my
 my
 vision
 on
 all
 of


this
 is
 whatever
 model
 works
 for
 you
 as


a
 creator
 podcast
 or
 what
 have
 you


should
 be
 the
 model
 that
 you
 adopt.
 And


so
 for
 example,
 you
 take
 um
 you
 know


what
 Tucker's
 doing
 and
 Megan's
 doing


and
 they
 you
 know
 they
 have
 had
 enormous


success
 on
 our
 platform
 um
 mostly
 driven


because
 they're
 incredibly
 talented
 at


what
 they
 do
 and
 the
 audience
 and
 the


algorithm
 have
 figured
 that
 out.
 But
 it


might
 be
 that
 the
 monetization
 model


that
 works
 best
 is
 something
 where


they're
 representing
 their
 inventory


themselves.
 And
 that
 I
 think
 is
 less


about
 sort
 of
 take
 rate
 or
 what
 have


you,
 but
 sort
 of
 the
 best
 way
 to


actually
 package
 it
 up.
 And
 so
 that's


that's
 really
 the
 way
 that
 I
 think
 about


it.
 But
 if
 you're
 a
 creator
 getting


started
 today,
 you're
 not
 even
 concerned


with
 that
 at
 all
 because
 the
 the


monetization
 is
 really
 only
 a
 byproduct


of
 what
 you've
 been
 able
 to
 do
 from
 an


audience
 engagement
 standoint.


>> The
 net
 is
 what
 matters,
 right?
 At
 the


end
 of the
 day.


>> That's
 my
 point.
 Yeah,
 take
 rates
 55,


20,
 90.
 If
 you're
 making
 more
 money


doing
 this
 than
 other
 things,


>> I
 mean,
 a
 great
 example
 again
 just


>> because
 the
 algorith
 and
 maybe
 you
 can


speak
 to
 the
 the
 quality
 of
 the


algorithm
 and
 the
 ads
 placement.
 You


come
 from
 the
 ads
 business.
 You're
 a


double
 click.


>> Yeah.


>> How
 good
 YouTube's
 ad
 placement
 and
 ad


quality
 is
 relative
 to
 other
 platforms


and
 how
 that
 actually
 increases.


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 I
 think
 I
 think
 what
 I'd


say
 on
 that
 is
 it's
 it's
 really
 it's
 two


things.
 One
 is,
 you
 know,
 obviously
 we


invest
 very
 heavily
 in
 making
 it
 so
 that


the
 advertising
 you
 see,
 whether
 you're


watching
 YouTube
 on
 a
 television
 screen


or
 on
 your
 phones
 or
 or
 your
 laptops
 is


relevant.
 It's
 targeted.
 The
 creative


formats
 are
 there.
 We
 are
 a
 platform


that
 caters
 to
 advertisers
 that
 are


brand
 advertisers,
 brand
 builders
 as


well
 as,
 you
 know,
 direct
 response.
 And


so
 that
 is
 a
 big
 area
 of
 investment.
 But


the
 reason
 why
 from
 and
 I
 spend
 a
 lot
 of


time
 talking
 to
 advertisers
 why
 they're


all
 so
 excited
 about
 the
 ROI
 is
 that
 uh


the
 the
 engagement
 is
 differentiated
 and


that
 turns
 into
 ROI
 for
 advertisers.
 And


what
 I
 mean
 by
 that
 is
 if
 you
 go
 to


YouTube,
 you
 are
 really
 leaned
 in
 into


what
 you're
 watching.
 You
 are
 a
 Mr.


Beast
 superfan.
 You're
 a,
 you
 know,


Michelle
 Kari
 superfan.
 You
 are
 a
 name


your
 favorite
 creator
 super
 fan.
 And


that
 is
 a
 different
 type
 of
 engagement


that
 actually
 translates
 into
 different


ROI
 regardless
 of
 where
 your
 objectives


are
 in
 the
 marketing
 funnel.
 And
 that's


that's
 our
 secret
 sauce.
 That's
 where


that's
 where
 this
 $70
 billion
 that
 we


pay
 out
 to
 the
 creator
 economy
 and
 all


these,
 you
 know,
 hundreds
 of
 thousands


of
 jobs
 that
 we
 create
 in
 the
 creator


ecosystem
 on
 a
 daily
 basis
 come
 from.


>> Let
 me
 uh
 just
 uplevel
 this
 in
 a
 more


general
 question.
 10
 years
 ago,
 15
 years


ago,
 the
 cable
 channels
 and
 you
 know,


the
 way
 that
 we
 consumed
 content
 was


largely
 live.
 You
 know,
 we
 would
 tune
 in


for
 shows
 and
 one
 of
 the
 byproducts
 of


that
 was
 national
 culture,
 right?
 There


would
 be
 these
 things
 that
 would
 enter


the
 zeitgeist
 and
 you
 we'd
 all
 talk


about
 it
 and
 we
 would
 be
 unified
 by
 it.


And
 on
 the
 plus
 side
 of
 all
 of
 this


infinite
 distribution
 is
 you
 get
 to


watch
 what
 you
 want.
 The
 downside
 of
 it


is
 there's
 really
 no
 connective
 thread


almost
 that
 we
 all
 talk
 about
 that's
 the


same.
 Um,
 how
 does
 YouTube
 view
 that


problem?
 Is
 it
 a
 problem?
 Like
 is
 there


a
 responsibility
 or
 are
 there
 things


that
 you
 can
 do
 to
 kind
 of
 make
 things


that
 are
 a
 little
 bit
 less
 on
 demand,
 a


little
 bit
 more,


you
 know,
 appointment
 viewing
 that
 kind


of
 builds
 identity
 and
 culture?
 Yeah,
 I


think
 it's
 I
 think
 it's
 a
 really


interesting
 question
 and
 again,
 you


know,
 the


one
 of
 the
 consequences
 of
 what
 you're


talking
 about
 visav
 the
 algorithm
 or


what
 have
 you
 is,
 you
 know,
 you
 you
 guys


open
 up
 your
 phones
 right
 now,
 that


YouTube
 feed
 of
 yours
 is
 going
 to
 look


like
 you,
 right?
 Like
 it
 really
 is
 about


what
 you're
 genuinely
 interested
 in
 and


and
 watching.
 And
 that
 does
 lead
 to
 it


can
 lead
 to
 that
 type
 of
 that


fragmentation
 that
 you're
 describing.


Having
 said
 that,
 you
 know,
 if
 you
 ask


um
 you
 know,
 someone
 a
 Gen
 Z
 or
 you


know,
 a
 millennial
 sort
 of
 what
 were
 the


top
 four
 or
 five
 sort
 of
 really
 big
 sort


of
 breakout
 pop
 culture
 trends.
 A
 lot
 of


them
 are
 actually
 an
 aggregation
 of
 a


lot
 of
 these
 types
 of
 things
 and
 you


know
 um
 they
 they
 could
 be
 trends
 that


might
 be
 not
 the
 most
 relevant
 to
 all
 of


us
 or
 this
 audience,
 but
 they
 are
 for
 a


particular
 sort
 of
 age
 group.
 And
 so
 we


do
 so
 the
 answer
 is
 that
 we
 do
 see
 a
 lot


of
 those
 sort
 of
 national
 and
 in
 many


cases
 because
 YouTube's
 a
 global


platform
 two
 billion
 people
 come
 to
 it


every
 single
 day
 there's
 enough


aggregation
 even
 amongst
 these
 sort
 of


niche
 areas
 where
 you
 do
 see
 some
 of


that.
 The
 other
 thing
 that
 I
 will
 say


about
 about
 um
 sort
 of
 how
 I
 think
 about


it
 is
 I
 do
 think
 that
 um
 live
 and
 sort


of
 like
 those
 water
 cooler
 type
 moments


are
 really
 important.
 you
 saw
 uh
 you


know
 you
 saw
 the
 biggest
 one
 of
 those


happen
 on
 YouTube
 just
 two
 days
 ago.
 Um


that
 Brazil
 game
 that
 Ari
 was
 mentioning


was
 on
 YouTube.
 Yeah.


>> And
 the
 reason
 why
 it
 was
 such
 such
 a


success
 I
 would
 argue
 is
 because
 of
 that


aperture
 what
 YouTube
 can
 obviously
 do


from
 a
 reach
 standpoint.
 But
 the
 other


reason
 and
 to
 the
 NFL's
 credit
 was
 you


guys
 saw
 how
 relevant
 we
 were
 trying
 to


make
 it
 for
 kind
 of
 this
 YouTube


generation.
 And
 again,
 you
 obviously
 saw


the
 integration
 with
 things
 like


Destroying
 and
 Mr.
 Beast
 in
 the
 actual


live
 stream
 of
 the
 game
 itself,
 but
 that


sort
 of
 creator
 engagement
 through
 the


lens
 of
 creators
 is
 something
 that


sports
 leagues
 are
 leading
 to,
 which
 is


sort
 of
 like
 what
 I
 describe
 as
 a
 new


water
 cooler
 moment.


>> What
 percent
 of
 watched
 media
 minutes
 do


you
 guys
 have?
 Do
 you
 think
 if
 you
 look


at
 all
 media
 broadcast
 movies?


>> I
 mean,
 you
 guys
 know
 we're
 we're
 we're


the
 number
 one
 streaming
 platform
 here


in
 the
 US.
 So
 I
 think
 the
 latest


Neielson's
 number
 was
 and
 we've
 been
 the


number
 one
 streamer
 in
 the
 US
 here
 for
 2


years
 and
 I
 think
 the
 number
 the
 latest


Neielson
 number
 was
 I
 think
 something


about
 about
 roughly
 about
 13
 13
 14%
 of


the
 of
 the
 TV
 watching
 audience.
 Um
 uh


but
 remember
 that
 number
 doesn't
 include


YouTube
 on
 mobile
 uh
 and
 so
 it's
 a


television
 number.


>> But
 to
 Ari's
 point
 do
 you
 see
 that


growing?
 Are
 people
 spending
 more
 time


consuming
 media
 because
 it's
 more


personalized,
 it's
 more
 engaging,
 and


they're
 finding
 perhaps
 more
 free
 time?


>> I
 mean,
 I
 I
 do
 I
 mean,
 look,
 our
 numbers


are
 growing.
 I
 think
 other
 streaming


platforms
 are
 growing.
 Other,
 you
 know,


mobile
 platforms
 are
 growing.
 I
 think
 if


you
 look
 at
 sort
 of
 the
 totality
 of
 sort


of
 human
 time,
 it's
 still
 sort
 of
 a


relatively,
 you
 know,
 small
 portion
 of


that.
 Um,
 yeah.


>> Let
 me
 shift
 gears
 um
 to
 a
 different


topic
 for
 a
 second.
 I
 think
 during
 co


there's
 a
 real
 sense
 that
 the
 censorship


was
 out
 of
 control
 on
 social
 media,
 not


just
 YouTube
 but
 Twitter,
 Facebook,
 all


of
 them.
 Uh
 if
 you
 question
 the
 efficacy


of
 vaccines
 or
 social
 distancing
 or
 even


on
 topics
 like
 the
 trans
 agenda
 or
 even


uh
 climate
 change,
 there
 was
 a
 risk
 that


you
 could
 be
 censored
 or
 shadowbanned
 or


demonetized.
 It
 feels
 like
 we've
 the


industry's
 kind
 of
 pulled
 back
 from
 that


and
 um
 things
 have
 opened
 up
 again
 and
 a


lot
 of
 that's
 I
 think
 due
 to
 what
 Elon


did
 in
 terms
 of
 um
 buying
 Twitter
 and


opening
 things
 back
 up.
 I
 guess
 my


question
 is
 has
 the
 industry
 actually


learned
 from
 that
 or
 is
 censorship
 just


on
 pause
 during
 the
 Trump
 years.


>> There's
 another
 fast
 get
 into
 it.
 Right.


I
 like
 it.
 That's
 why


>> Good
 question.


>> It's
 a
 great
 question.
 Yeah.
 Yeah,
 you


know,
 I
 I
 think
 that
 actually
 I'll
 just


say
 a
 couple
 things
 about
 that
 and
 one


of
 them
 will
 sound
 it's
 it's
 sort
 of


actually
 connecting
 the
 the
 dots
 between


the
 questions
 that
 you
 guys
 asked,
 which


is,
 you
 know,
 the
 way
 I
 answered
 David's


Dave's
 question
 is
 um


first
 of
 all,
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of these


plat
 all
 of
 these
 platforms
 are
 are


actually
 pretty
 different,
 right?
 Like


what
 Twitter
 does
 is
 different
 than
 what


you
 know,
 some
 of
 the
 meta
 platforms
 do,


which
 of
 course
 is
 very
 different
 than


what
 YouTube
 does.
 And
 you
 could
 argue


um
 as
 witnessed
 from
 the
 rest
 of
 this


conversation
 that
 we
 probably
 have
 a
 lot


more
 similarity
 with
 you
 know
 a


streaming
 platform
 than
 we
 do
 with
 a


social
 media
 platform.
 So
 that
 that's


one
 point
 but
 I
 think
 it's
 an
 important


context
 into
 what
 I'm
 about
 to
 say.
 And


the
 reason
 I
 say
 that
 is
 because
 you


know
 99%
 of
 what
 happens
 on
 YouTube
 is


all
 the
 creators
 that
 I
 talked
 about
 all


the
 podcasters
 you
 know
 the
 Taylor


Swifts
 of
 the
 world
 all
 the
 music.


Obviously
 music
 is
 our
 largest
 and
 you


know
 most
 important
 vertical
 for
 example


we're
 a
 music
 platform
 so
 that
 that
 is


like
 even
 during
 co
 that
 is
 where
 a
 lot


of
 the
 watch
 time
 on
 YouTube
 versus
 a


discourse
 that
 might
 be
 happening
 in
 a


social
 feed
 somewhere.
 Um
 that
 doesn't


mean
 that
 we
 don't
 have
 comments
 on
 our


videos
 and
 all
 that
 sort
 of
 piece
 which


is
 where
 some
 of
 this
 you
 know
 discourse


that
 you're
 alluding
 to
 David
 might
 have


happened.
 Um
 I
 I
 do
 think
 yeah
 I
 so
 I


think that
 at
 the
 highest
 level
 I
 do


think
 that
 there
 is
 something
 about
 the


fact
 that
 that
 was
 a
 very
 different


time.
 I
 remember
 kind
 of
 March,
 April
 of


2020
 where
 like
 oh
 my
 god
 like
 do
 you


get
 this
 this
 way
 or
 is
 it
 this
 way
 or


mask
 or
 this
 or
 I
 mean
 I
 literally
 woke


up
 one
 day
 and
 there
 were
 like
 people


climbing
 uh
 5G
 cell
 towers
 and
 falling


from
 cell
 towers
 because
 now
 it
 was
 like


you
 could
 literally
 get
 the
 thing
 from


cell
 towers.
 It
 sounds
 cell
 towers
 but


it
 sounds
 crazy
 uh
 today
 but
 that
 was


the
 nature
 of
 sort
 of
 the
 types
 of


things
 that
 were
 popping
 up.


>> So
 some
 lessons
 learned
 or
 regrets


there.
 Let
 me
 let
 me
 just
 finish.
 So
 So


that
 that's
 the
 context
 in
 which
 you


know
 we
 were
 having
 to
 sort
 of
 make
 some


of
 these
 decisions.
 Fast
 forward
 to


today
 like
 obviously
 in
 a
 completely


different
 world
 but
 just
 in
 terms
 of
 the


nature
 of
 the
 disease
 and
 all
 that
 sort


of
 a
 thing.
 So
 all
 of
 those
 sort
 of


policies
 that
 existed
 back
 then
 are


non-existent
 today.
 And
 it's
 my
 way
 of


answering
 your
 question
 of
 like
 well
 is


it
 a
 temporal
 thing
 or
 not?
 I
 would


argue
 that
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 sort
 of
 like


and
 by
 the
 way
 YouTube
 in
 particular
 was


ex
 was was
 criticized
 to
 an
 extreme


amount
 because
 of
 all
 the
 content
 that


we
 left
 up
 on
 the
 platform
 around
 you


know
 the
 Wuhan
 virus
 controversy
 around


like
 you
 know
 whatever
 um
 all
 sorts
 of


other
 things
 that
 we
 were
 leaving
 up


that
 other
 places
 were
 were
 acting


differently
 on
 and
 so
 we
 got
 beat
 up
 a


lot
 sort
 of
 from
 one
 side
 of
 the


spectrum
 then
 Um,
 and
 I
 think
 that
 our


approach
 really
 just
 has
 to
 be


flexible
 to
 the
 environment
 in
 the


context
 of
 it.
 I
 think
 we're
 always


going
 to
 get
 criticized
 by
 being
 an
 open


platform.
 There's
 a
 lot
 of
 magic
 that


happens
 because
 of
 the
 open
 platform.


All
 these
 amazing
 creators
 wouldn't


exist
 if
 we
 didn't
 have
 an
 open
 platform


and
 we
 didn't
 stand
 for
 for
 free
 speech.


But
 there's
 also
 a
 lot
 of


>> Hold
 I
 want
 to
 follow
 up
 on
 this
 if
 I


may.
 There
 there
 are
 two
 categories
 that


I
 um
 I
 have
 in
 my
 feed
 because
 of
 the


algorithm.
 firearms
 and
 uh
 poker.
 Both


of
 those
 groups
 of
 creators
 are
 um
 a


little
 bit
 up
 in
 arms
 uh
 no
 pun
 intended


because
 they
 are
 being
 demonetized.
 So,


how
 do
 you
 make
 a
 decision
 on
 who's


allowed
 to
 earn
 and
 who's
 not
 allowed
 to


earn
 uh
 and
 be
 part
 of
 the
 ad
 network?


Poker
 folks
 and
 people
 who
 do
 firearm


safety
 and
 and
 firearm
 training
 uh
 and


best
 practices,
 they're
 demonetized
 um


and
 they're
 complaining
 about
 it
 now.


How
 do
 you
 make
 those
 kind
 of
 decisions?


Um,
 a
 lot
 of
 them
 are
 incredibly


successful
 creators
 on
 our
 platform,


Jason,


>> but
 not
 monetized.


>> No,
 some
 of
 them
 are
 monetized
 as
 well.


So,
 we
 we
 do
 have
 a
 clear
 set
 of
 rules


and
 we've
 had
 these
 for
 a
 long
 time
 in


terms
 of
 sales
 of
 firearms
 and
 those


types
 of
 things.
 And
 obviously,
 there's


there's
 legal
 frameworks
 and
 all
 those


types
 of
 things
 around
 it.
 But
 I
 think,


you
 know,
 in
 terms
 of


firearms
 community
 and
 learning
 about


firearms
 and
 safety,
 which
 obviously
 is


an
 important
 thing,
 especially
 for
 for


young
 people,
 um
 we're
 one
 of
 the


largest
 places
 where
 those
 audiences


exist,
 as
 well
 as
 monetization
 of
 that


type
 of
 content.
 Now
 the
 balance
 and
 you


know
 obviously
 and
 some
 of
 this
 comes


from
 um
 you
 know
 experts
 that
 we've


worked
 with
 in
 that
 vertical
 itself


around
 something
 might
 be
 appropriate


for
 an
 adult
 user
 of
 that
 type
 of


content
 that
 may
 not
 be
 appropriate
 for


a
 child
 and
 those
 types
 of
 things.
 So


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 nuance
 behind
 it,
 but


the


>> poker
 I
 don't
 I
 mean
 are
 we
 like
 there's


probably
 something
 around


>> sports
 gambling
 legality
 and
 all
 that


sort
 of
 stuff
 but
 generally
 speaking
 as


you
 guys
 know


>> there's
 an
 enormous
 amount
 of
 poker


content
 that's
 incredibly
 successful
 in


our
 platform
 is
 back
 to
 what
 Chimath
 was


saying
 which
 is
 like
 whatever
 niche


there
 is
 out
 there
 however
 big
 or


however
 small
 you're
 going
 to
 find
 a
 set


of
 creators
 that
 are
 just
 as
 passionate


about
 it
 as
 as
 you
 are.
 I
 think
 the


interesting
 question
 is
 how
 do
 you


organize
 yourself
 across
 all
 the


different
 countries
 in
 you're
 in
 and
 the


scale
 that
 you're
 at
 to
 deal
 with
 the


cultural
 nuances
 of
 every
 different


country
 and
 then
 to
 deal
 with
 the
 laws


of
 every
 different
 country
 and
 then
 to


deal
 as
 David
 said
 sometimes
 the


vicissitudes


of
 social
 policy
 in
 every
 country.
 How


do
 you
 deal
 with
 that
 organizationally?


Like
 what
 does
 that
 actually
 look
 like?


>> Yeah,
 it's
 the
 part
 that
 turns
 my
 hair


hair
 white.
 But
 uh
 look
 I
 think
 part
 of


it
 I
 say
 this
 to
 my
 team
 all
 the
 time


which
 is


it
 is
 a
 challenge
 right
 because
 we
 but
 I


think
 it's
 a
 challenge
 that
 honestly


like
 I
 view
 it
 as
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 privilege


in
 the
 sense
 that
 it
 wouldn't
 be


important
 if
 we
 weren't
 such
 an


important
 place
 especially
 for
 young


people
 to
 uh
 connect
 get
 information


entertain
 themselves
 learning
 we're
 the


largest
 learning
 platform
 uh
 in
 the


world.
 We
 know
 that
 obviously
 um
 just


given
 all
 the
 use
 cases
 and
 the
 watch


time
 etc.
 And
 so


at least
 from
 my
 standpoint
 I
 try
 to
 be


as
 global
 as
 we
 possibly
 can
 in
 terms
 of


principles.
 You
 know
 one
 of
 the
 things


that
 I
 always
 say
 about
 um
 YouTube
 is


like
 you
 know
 our
 northstar
 principle


and
 you
 know
 uh
 has
 always
 been
 um
 give


everyone
 a
 voice
 and
 show
 them
 the


world.
 That's
 our
 mission
 statement.
 Uh


it
 stands
 for
 freedom
 of
 expression,


freedom
 of
 speech.
 We
 are,
 you
 know,
 an


American
 company
 and
 that
 that
 notion


that
 sort
 of
 value
 of
 freedom
 of
 spee


speech
 is
 core
 to
 our
 ethos
 and
 we


really
 do
 try
 to
 start
 with
 that
 as
 a


global
 position.
 Having
 said
 that,


you're
 right
 like
 there
 is
 an
 enormous


patchwork
 of
 legislation
 and
 regulation


that
 exists
 in
 every
 country.


>> Are
 there
 people
 that
 are
 writing


policies
 that
 then
 some
 folks
 just
 have


to
 understand
 and
 they're
 manually


trying
 to
 react
 to
 here's
 how
 we
 deal


with
 this
 issue
 in
 India.
 here's
 how
 we


deal
 with
 this
 issue
 in
 Brazil.
 Here's


how
 we
 deal
 with
 it
 in
 France.


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 look,
 the
 answer
 is
 um


>> or
 is
 it
 algorithmic
 or
 is
 it
 a


combination?


>> It's
 it's
 always
 some
 combination


because
 you
 know
 the
 scale
 of
 YouTube
 is


you
 know
 hundreds
 of
 hours
 of
 content
 is


uploaded
 to
 YouTube
 every
 single
 minute


of
 every
 single
 day.
 Um
 we
 want
 to
 be
 um


as
 core
 to
 that
 north
 star
 as
 possible.


You
 know,
 frankly,
 there's
 there's


situations
 where
 we
 have
 to
 push
 back
 on


that
 that
 core
 uh
 push
 back
 on
 sort
 of


what
 might
 be
 um
 an
 encroachment
 on
 that


sort
 of
 a
 principle.
 Having
 said
 that,


we
 also
 of
 course,
 you
 know,
 have
 to


legally
 operate
 in
 all
 of
 these


countries
 just
 like
 any
 other
 platform.


>> There's
 three
 products,
 Neil,
 I'm
 super


obsessed
 with
 and
 I
 just
 would
 love
 to


get
 your
 your
 take
 on
 them
 in
 terms
 of


priorities
 for
 you.
 YouTube
 TV,


unbelievable.


>> Unbelievable.
 YouTube
 Red.


>> That
 is
 a
 great
 product.


>> Uh
 YouTube
 Red,
 which
 I
 think
 is
 YouTube


Premium
 taking
 the
 ads
 off.


Unbelievable.
 And
 then
 I
 think
 a
 sleeper


is
 you've
 kind
 of
 built
 in
 Patreon
 like


functionality
 subscriptions.
 So
 maybe


you
 can
 walk
 us
 through
 the
 footprint
 of


each
 of
 those
 and
 the
 prioritization
 of


those
 because
 they
 do
 seem
 to
 have
 had
 a


a
 significant
 impact
 on
 engagement
 and


how
 people
 look
 at
 the
 platform.


>> Yeah.
 No,
 and
 I'm
 super
 proud
 of
 all


three
 of
 those
 products.
 as
 a
 product


guy
 myself,
 like
 that's
 that's
 the
 fun


part
 of
 the
 job
 is
 actually
 building
 all


of
 these
 amazing
 products
 and
 um
 uh
 you


know
 the
 the
 their
 origin
 story
 on


YouTube
 TV.
 I
 I'm
 a
 sports
 nut.
 I'm
 like


I'm
 and
 actually
 the
 the
 people
 on
 my


team,
 a
 lot
 of
 them
 who've
 been
 involved


with
 YouTube
 TV
 since
 the
 very
 early


days
 are
 also
 big
 sports
 guys
 and
 I'm


also
 a
 news
 junkie
 and
 that's
 the
 core


use
 case
 of
 YouTube
 TV
 in
 many
 ways.
 if


you
 think
 about
 sort
 of
 the
 the
 features


that
 we
 built,
 multiv-
 view,
 key
 plays,


even
 some
 of
 the
 fantasy
 integrations


that
 you
 see.
 So,
 that's
 the
 lens


through
 which
 you
 should
 think
 about
 how


we're
 going
 to
 continue
 to
 develop
 that


product.
 Uh,
 and
 the
 thought
 and
 the


question
 I
 would
 always
 get
 is
 like,


well,
 why
 are
 you
 guys
 doing
 this?
 Like,


look
 at
 what's
 happening
 to
 that
 part
 of


the
 the
 the
 the
 paid
 ecosystem,
 right?


Like,
 why
 are
 you
 diving
 into
 this
 thing


that's
 like
 this
 sort
 of
 like,
 you
 know,


shrinking
 shrinking
 thing?
 And
 our


thought
 was
 like,
 well,
 a
 lot
 of
 it
 has


to
 do
 with
 the
 fact
 that
 like


reinventing
 that
 whole
 experience
 from


the
 standpoint
 of
 a
 fan
 or
 a
 consumer.


And
 so
 that's
 the
 YouTube
 TV
 um
 origin


and
 sort
 of
 where
 it's
 going.
 The
 one


thing
 that
 you
 should,
 you
 know,
 pay


attention
 to
 is
 um
 something
 that
 we


call
 prime
 time
 channels
 in
 YouTube,


which
 is


a
 lot
 of
 those
 same
 sort
 of
 linear


channels
 or
 sort
 of
 traditional
 media


channels,
 but
 that
 you
 can
 buy
 all
 a


cart
 in
 the
 main
 YouTube
 app.


>> Uh
 and
 so
 that
 that
 there's
 connectivity


between
 those
 two
 products.


>> Yeah,
 I
 was
 wondering
 when
 that
 would


happen
 because
 for
 me
 it's
 just
 CNBC.
 I


want
 to
 have
 it
 inside
 of
 YouTube,
 but
 I


have
 to
 load
 it.
 And
 then
 when
 I
 travel,


it's
 always
 like,
 "Oh,
 what
 region
 are


you
 in?"
 Premium,
 how
 many
 premium


subscribers
 are
 there
 now?
 How
 is
 that


growing?
 How
 does
 that
 affect
 the
 ad


business?
 Because
 for
 me,
 the
 ads
 are


death.
 I
 just
 I
 need
 my
 time
 back.
 So,


how
 do
 you
 think
 about
 that?


>> Yeah.
 Um
 I
 do
 think
 that
 for
 our


business
 um
 advertising
 is
 going
 to


remain
 ha
 is
 today
 and
 will
 remain
 the


predominant
 way
 through
 which
 we


monetize
 on
 behalf
 of
 creators.
 That
 70


billion
 number
 that
 I
 mentioned
 most
 of


it
 comes
 from
 ads
 and
 the
 reason
 is


because
 you
 know
 at
 at
 a
 fundamental


level
 we
 are
 a
 platform
 of
 scale
 two


billion
 two
 billion
 people
 come
 to
 it


every
 single
 day.
 Having
 said
 that,
 like


giving
 consumer
 choice,
 you
 know,


uninterrupted
 experience
 uh
 is


important.
 There's
 about
 125
 million
 uh


subscribers


um
 25
 million


>> pay
 uh
 YouTube
 premium.


>> Amazing.


>> How
 does
 that
 money
 get
 split
 with
 the


creators?
 So,
 if
 I'm
 watching
 Mr.
 Beast


without
 ads,
 how
 do
 you


>> There
 there's
 there's
 a
 kind
 of
 roughly


sort
 of
 engagement
 watchtime
 type


calculation.


>> Is
 TV
 basically
 the
 biggest
 cable


subscriber
 base
 equivalent?


Are
 we
 are
 you
 um
 you
 know


>> where
 do
 you
 guys
 rank
 in
 cable


subscribers?


>> Actually,
 you
 know,
 it's
 interesting
 the


way
 that
 even
 the
 way
 you
 guys
 are


talking
 about
 it
 is
 like
 well
 that's


like
 your
 uninterrupted
 sort
 of
 TV


subscription
 tier,
 which
 is
 how
 I
 think


lots
 of
 people
 think
 about
 it.


>> The
 origin
 uh
 of
 YouTube
 Premium
 was


actually
 a
 music
 premium
 music


subscription
 service,
 right?
 It
 was
 like


called
 YouTube
 Music
 and
 Premium.
 And
 so


a
 lot
 of
 those
 125
 million
 subs
 are
 not


just
 people
 who
 are
 watching
 it
 just
 the


way
 that
 they
 would
 watch
 like
 you
 know


Netflix
 or
 Amazon
 without
 ads.
 There's
 a


lot
 of
 that
 but
 a
 lot
 of
 it
 is
 just


actually
 music
 fans
 too.
 Like
 people
 who


>> for
 whom
 their
 music
 service
 is
 actually


Spotify
 is
 YouTube
 right?
 Like
 where


they
 discover
 music
 where
 they
 listen
 to


you
 know
 watch
 their
 favorite
 videos
 is


YouTube.
 So
 how
 do
 you
 have
 like
 a


uninterrupted
 music
 service


>> when
 you
 have
 all
 these
 incredible
 AI


models
 all
 over
 the
 place?
 People
 will


be
 generating
 all
 kinds
 of
 content.
 Some


of
 that
 content
 could
 be
 news
 content,


topical
 content.
 You
 know,
 it
 could
 talk


about
 a
 vaccine.
 It
 could
 talk
 about


whatever.
 Do
 you
 guys
 feel
 you
 have
 a


responsibility
 to
 figure
 out
 whether


that's
 real
 or
 not?
 Do
 you
 think
 that's


the
 role
 of
 the
 actual
 creators?
 Do
 you


think
 it
 should
 be,
 you
 know,
 the
 CDC


should
 have
 a
 YouTube
 channel
 where
 they


watermark
 the
 stuff
 that
 they
 put
 out?


And
 then
 so
 like
 whose
 responsibility
 is


this
 going
 to
 be?


>> Yeah,
 I
 think


>> and
 how
 much
 of
 it
 is
 our
 responsibility


as
 a
 consumer?
 I
 mean,
 look,
 I
 think


that,
 um,
 here's
 how
 I
 think
 about
 it.


First,
 um,


with
 the
 growth
 of
 these
 AI
 enablement


tools,
 um,
 you're
 going
 to
 see
 that
 like


the
 distinction
 between
 like
 was
 it


completely
 AI
 generated,
 was
 it
 AI


assisted,
 etc.
 is
 going
 to
 be
 a


continuum.
 So,
 that's
 that's
 the
 first


piece.
 Um,
 and
 we're
 already
 seeing


that.
 We
 see
 that
 on
 YouTube
 obviously.


you
 know,
 you
 open
 up
 the
 YouTube
 app,


you
 hit
 that
 plus
 button,
 um
 you
 can


type
 in
 a
 text
 prompt
 and
 it
 will


generate
 a
 video
 for
 you
 using
 our
 VO


models,
 right?
 Um
 so
 that
 that
 is


already
 happening.
 One
 of
 the
 things


that
 we
 do
 um
 is
 um
 there
 is
 a
 label


that
 says
 that
 you
 know
 you
 know
 #
 AI


generated
 and
 um
 we
 will
 put
 that
 sort


we
 call
 it
 sort
 of
 front
 of
 the
 box.
 We


will
 literally
 put
 that
 on
 the
 video
 and


in
 some
 cases
 usually
 it's
 in
 the


metadata.
 Um
 that's
 obviously
 not


foolproof.
 Um,
 but
 I
 I
 think
 the
 way
 at


least
 from
 a
 principal
 standpoint,
 the


way
 I
 think
 about
 it
 is,
 you
 know,


YouTube
 has
 these,
 you
 know,
 community


guidelines.
 We
 try
 to
 be
 transparent


about
 them.
 We
 publish
 them
 on
 our


website.
 And
 I
 think
 that
 sort
 of
 like
 a


a
 priory
 distinction
 between,
 well,
 it


was
 AI
 generated,
 therefore
 it
 must
 be


violative
 versus
 not
 actually
 is
 not
 the


way
 to
 do
 it.
 Um,
 and
 it's
 really
 just


about
 giving
 as
 much
 transparency
 to
 the


users
 as
 possible.


Um,
 and
 then
 the
 other
 thing
 that's


really
 important
 is
 in
 the
 creator


business,
 in
 the
 creativ
 creativity


business,
 whether
 you're
 a
 Hollywood


celebrity
 or
 a
 YouTuber
 or
 or
 an
 artist,


the
 the
 thing
 that
 I
 hear
 over
 and
 over


that
 they
 really
 care
 about
 is
 their


likeness.
 And
 so
 if
 you're
 Taylor
 Swift,


it's
 your
 voice.
 If
 it's
 if
 you're,
 you


know,
 Marquez
 Brownley,
 it
 is
 your
 face


like
 your
 live.
 It's
 your


>> No,
 I
 mean
 it's
 there
 are
 people
 doing


live
 chimoth
 things
 to
 give
 Bitcoin
 away


and
 I
 send
 it
 to
 him
 and
 I
 report
 it


sometime.


>> I
 send
 it
 to
 Neil.
 I
 send
 it
 to
 Neil
 and


I'll
 tell
 you
 the
 AI
 slop
 issue
 is


getting
 bad.


>> Send
 it
 to
 me
 directly
 instead
 of


tagging
 me.
 Um
 the
 the


no
 the
 issue
 really
 is
 like
 um
 I'm
 a


Corvette
 fan
 and
 um
 the
 the
 incentive
 is


so
 perverse
 I've
 had
 to
 ban
 a
 bunch
 of


these
 channels
 that
 show
 me
 thumbnails


of
 this
 is
 the
 new
 Corvette,
 this
 is
 the


new
 prototype
 and
 it's
 AI
 slop
 and
 it's


obvious
 what
 they're
 doing
 is
 they're


trying
 to
 insert
 themselves
 into
 the


algorithm
 and
 then
 I
 just
 ban
 them.
 So


you
 do
 give
 control,
 but
 I
 do
 think


really
 labeling
 them
 is
 import
 I
 don't


want
 to
 put
 the
 burden
 on
 you
 to
 do


that.
 I
 think
 the
 labeling
 is
 one
 piece


but
 the
 the
 thing
 that
 I
 was
 going
 to


say
 is
 the
 other
 thing
 and
 we
 have
 a


track
 record
 of
 content
 ID
 which
 is


basically
 the
 rights
 management
 system


that
 you
 could
 argue
 basically
 created


that
 whole
 creator
 economy
 in
 the
 first


place
 YouTube
 success.
 It
 saved
 YouTube.


So
 content
 ID
 is
 think
 about
 that


metaphor
 as
 it
 applies
 to
 AI.
 Yeah.


>> Wonderful.
 So
 we
 are
 working
 on
 this


notion
 of
 I
 call
 it
 sort
 of
 likeness


detection
 where
 if
 it's
 a
 chimoth
 face


um
 the
 algorithm
 should
 be
 good
 enough


to
 actually
 detect
 that
 and
 then
 give


you
 a
 choice
 as
 to
 whether
 that
 should


come
 down


>> right


>> is
 that
 does
 that
 come
 down
 or
 you
 know


there
 might
 be
 some
 creators
 that
 choose


to
 monetize
 it
 and
 give
 so
 giving


creator
 we
 can
 take
 ownership
 of
 it


>> you
 can
 take
 ownership
 of
 it


>> so
 people
 take
 our
 clips
 make
 versions


of
 us
 as
 dogs
 or


>> and
 it
 for
 us
 it's
 not
 just
 words
 we


actually
 have
 a
 tracker
 record
 of
 doing


that
 because
 of
 something
 like
 content


ID.


>> Ladies
 and
 gentlemen,
 Neil
 Mo,


thanks
 for
 being
 here.
 Thanks,
 brother.


Appreciate
 it.


Thank
 you.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Of
 course.
