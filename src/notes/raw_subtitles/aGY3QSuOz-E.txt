To
 be
 honest,
 like
 our
 first
 product


looks
 really
 rough.
 We
 actually
 only


used
 two
 weeks.
 One
 day
 we
 have
 over


like
 100
 people
 just
 flowing
 this


product.
 Our
 users
 actually
 just
 you


know
 like
 doubled.
 There
 is
 huge


increase
 in
 the
 user
 and
 there's
 huge


increase
 in
 the
 revenue.
 That
 is
 a
 time


we
 know
 okay
 we
 hit
 something
 right.
 We


have
 over
 10
 million
 downloads
 in
 a
 year


and
 we
 now
 have
 over
 10
 million


annualized
 revenue
 within
 a
 year.
 It's


not
 just
 about
 fantastic
 UI,
 UX
 or
 how


you're
 marketing
 it,
 right?
 It's
 more


like
 what
 result
 users
 are
 get.
 You


don't
 need
 to
 wait
 for
 the
 product
 to
 be


perfect
 to
 launch
 it.
 Most
 of
 the
 time


in
 the
 AI
 era,
 things
 will
 change
 every


day.
 If
 you
 wait
 too
 long,
 you
 may
 never


be
 able
 to
 launch
 your
 product.
 So,
 you


just
 need
 to
 launch
 it,
 develop
 it,


learn
 from
 it
 at
 the
 same


time.
 Hi,
 I'm
 Ella.
 I'm
 the
 founder
 and


the
 CEO
 of
 CRY
 AI.
 Criti
 is
 the
 agentic


AI
 to
 augment
 your
 marketing
 video
 at


scale.
 Just
 drop
 one
 product
 image
 and


Criti
 write
 your
 script,
 shoot
 your


video
 and
 even
 do
 the
 processing
 for


your
 marketing
 video
 without
 the
 need
 of


full
 media
 crew.
 Cringy
 is
 growing


pretty
 fast.
 We
 have
 over
 10
 million


downloads
 in
 a
 year
 and
 we
 now
 have
 over


10
 million
 annualized
 revenue
 within
 a


year
 thanks
 to
 our
 network
 effect


between
 the
 influencer
 and
 the


[Music]


brands.
 I
 started
 my
 career
 as
 actually


a
 hardware
 engineer
 at
 Apple.
 We
 are


building
 the
 first
 generation
 of


AirPods.
 We
 don't
 even
 know
 what
 product


people
 actually
 need.
 So
 we
 invite
 a
 lot


of
 users
 to
 our
 small
 interview
 room
 and


we
 ask
 them
 a
 lot
 of
 questions
 like
 what


do
 you
 need
 actually
 for
 the
 earpods?


What
 do
 you
 actually
 have
 the
 pinpoints


for?
 Uh
 things
 like
 that.
 At
 Apple
 when


we
 conduct
 the
 interviews
 instead
 of


just
 doing
 online
 surveys
 we
 actually


more
 prefer
 to
 invite
 the
 users
 to
 the


interview
 room
 and
 conduct
 like


face-toface
 interviews.
 Right?
 When
 you


ask
 people
 to
 fill
 out
 the
 survey


online,
 people
 most
 of
 time
 they
 just,


you
 know,
 click
 the
 first
 one,
 whatever


they
 see
 there,
 right?
 Because
 they
 want


to
 just
 jump
 to
 the
 end.
 No
 one
 really


want
 to
 get
 their
 feedback.
 So
 you
 may


get
 the
 wrong
 answers.
 And
 another
 more


important
 thing
 actually
 is
 when
 you
 are


talk
 to
 your
 users
 face
 to
 face,
 you


actually
 get
 more
 than
 what
 you
 want
 to


ask,
 right?
 Like
 people
 they
 always
 have


some
 assumption
 that
 okay
 maybe
 user


need
 A
 b
 and
 C
 but
 actually
 user
 don't


care
 about
 them
 like
 at
 all
 right
 like


they
 only
 care
 about
 what
 they
 care


about
 like
 D
 but
 you
 don't
 have
 that
 on


your
 survey
 so
 you'll
 get
 the
 wrong


answer
 that's
 the
 reason
 actually
 Apple


prefer
 to
 have
 face-to-face
 user


interview
 when
 they
 are
 building
 a
 new


product
 and
 one
 important
 thing
 we
 learn


at
 Apple
 is
 you
 know
 you
 really
 need
 to


understand
 people's
 pain
 points
 you
 need


to
 really
 know
 why
 people
 need
 it
 when


you
 are
 building
 it.
 We
 have
 our
 like
 a


lot
 of
 fantastic
 ideas
 or
 imagination


but
 those
 are
 not
 solving
 the
 pain


points
 of
 real
 customers
 and
 that's
 not


we
 want
 right
 so
 meeting
 people
 or


knowing
 people's
 pain
 points
 actually
 is


the
 first
 step
 when
 you
 need
 to
 create
 a


great
 product.
 The
 AirPods
 project
 is


like
 it's
 amazing
 uh
 experience
 for
 me.


Many
 people
 said
 I
 should
 stay
 there
 for


longer.
 But
 the
 thing
 is
 that
 I
 always


pursue
 for
 building
 something
 new
 or


building
 something
 I
 think
 I
 feel
 most


excited
 for.
 When
 I
 was
 a
 child,
 I
 found


I
 get
 information
 much
 easier
 when
 I
 get


it
 in
 the
 form
 of
 video
 instead
 of
 like


long
 text
 or
 like
 blog
 post
 or
 things


like
 that.
 So
 it
 is
 always
 my
 dream
 that


in
 the
 childhood
 that
 if
 one
 day
 we


could
 turn
 a
 lot
 of
 communication
 the


learning
 the
 information
 gathering
 just


in
 the
 video
 format
 that
 will
 be
 really


helpful
 for
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 sometimes


you
 know
 it's
 it's
 pretty
 pretty
 hard


for
 people
 from
 the
 giant
 company
 to


actually
 quit
 and
 really
 doing
 the


startup
 when
 I
 looking
 back
 I
 really


miss
 the
 time
 there
 at
 big
 company


enjoying
 with
 my
 friends
 and
 my
 family


Still
 I
 think
 I
 don't
 regret
 uh
 because


I
 am
 doing
 what
 I
 really
 passionate


about
 and
 I
 believe
 that
 will
 help
 a
 lot


of
 people
 that
 is
 more
 important
 to


me
 when
 I
 saw
 the
 generative
 AI
 even


it's
 back
 in
 2020
 I
 believe
 that
 one
 is


will
 change
 the
 world
 and
 it
 will
 be
 the


future
 because
 at
 that
 time
 I
 saw
 a
 lot


of
 people
 they
 spend
 over
 80%
 of
 their


time
 just
 online
 instead
 of
 offline,


right?
 So
 there
 is
 a
 huge
 trend
 that


people
 actually
 are
 shifting
 from


offline
 to
 online
 and
 then
 people
 will


definitely
 need
 much
 much
 higher
 demand


for
 the
 great
 content
 online.
 But
 on
 the


offset
 that
 I
 saw
 it's
 pretty
 pretty


hard
 for
 people
 to
 create
 great
 content


right
 the
 requirement
 for
 great
 content


actually
 growing
 higher
 and
 higher.
 The


supply
 of
 the
 great
 content
 actually
 uh


have
 a
 huge
 gap
 between
 the
 supply
 and


the
 demand.
 I'm
 pretty
 certain
 that
 you


know
 it's
 only
 the
 technology
 which


could
 like
 merge
 the
 gap
 and
 help
 people


with
 that.
 That's
 a
 time
 that
 I
 think


okay
 even
 though
 I
 am
 not
 experts
 I


don't
 know
 a
 lot
 about
 software
 or
 I


don't
 know
 a
 lot
 about
 AI
 but
 you
 know
 I


can
 always
 learn
 once
 I
 find
 the


motivation
 I
 would
 know
 what
 I
 want
 to


do
 and
 I
 can
 shift
 to
 that
 and
 I
 can


learn
 that
 pretty
 quickly
 to
 be
 honest


like
 our
 first
 product
 looks
 really


rough.
 We
 don't
 have
 really
 fantastic
 UX


or
 UI.
 We
 even
 don't
 have
 the
 batch
 mode


in
 the
 beginning.
 But
 that's
 totally


okay.
 You
 know,
 like
 sometimes
 when
 the


product
 is
 really
 rough,
 but
 users


still,
 you
 know,
 like
 willing
 to
 use
 it,


that
 means
 something.
 If
 you
 have
 a


really
 like
 bad
 design
 product,
 but


people
 are
 still
 using
 it.
 They're
 like,


okay,
 there's
 some
 real
 value
 thing
 in


that
 one.
 It's
 not
 just
 about
 fantastic


UI,
 UX,
 or
 how
 you're
 marketing
 it,


right?
 It's
 more
 like
 what
 result
 users


are
 get
 whether
 they
 can
 use
 it
 to
 get


the
 benefit
 they
 want.
 You
 don't
 need
 to


wait
 for
 the
 product
 to
 be
 perfect
 to


launch
 it
 because
 you
 know
 like
 most
 of


the
 time
 in
 the
 AI
 era
 like
 things
 will


change
 every
 day.
 If
 you
 wait
 too
 long


you
 may
 never
 be
 able
 to
 launch
 your


product.
 So
 you
 just
 need
 to
 launch
 it,


develop
 it,
 learn
 from
 it.
 At
 the
 same


time,
 there's
 one
 lesson
 I
 learned
 as
 a


founder
 or
 I
 will
 say
 the
 most
 painful


lesson
 I
 learned.
 Our
 first
 product


actually
 is
 called
 ZMO.ai.
 At
 the
 time
 I


was
 building
 Zmo.
 I'm
 not
 sure
 like
 why


I'm
 building
 this
 like
 why
 people
 need


this.
 The
 thing
 is
 at
 the
 time
 me


journey
 is
 super
 hot.
 Everyone
 is


chasing
 that
 right.
 So
 just
 like
 so
 many


other
 founders,
 I'm
 like,
 "Okay,
 text
 to


image
 is
 so
 popular.
 We
 definitely
 need


to
 enter
 this
 domain.
 So
 let's
 do
 it."


But
 I
 don't
 really
 know
 why
 people
 are


generating
 those
 images.
 So
 I
 don't


really
 understand
 the
 users
 need.
 When
 I


was
 building
 the
 product,
 we
 actually


don't
 know
 what
 the
 business
 model
 will


be
 and
 we
 even
 don't
 know
 what
 the
 next


step
 will
 be,
 right?
 So
 the
 revenue


actually
 doesn't
 go
 that
 high
 as
 the


users
 grow,
 right?
 and
 we
 suddenly
 just


get
 lost
 right
 we
 don't
 know
 like
 why


people
 are
 using
 it
 like
 why
 some
 people


pay
 why
 some
 people
 don't
 pay
 for
 it


when
 we
 have
 this
 difficulty
 the
 only


thing
 I
 can
 think
 about
 is
 talking
 to


your
 customers
 right
 that
 is
 a
 thing
 I


learned
 from
 Apple
 we
 do
 email
 our
 users


or
 most
 active
 users
 email
 them
 like


over
 500
 and
 finally
 we
 get
 300
 actually


we
 have
 the
 face
 toface
 conversation


with
 them
 because
 I
 believe
 talk
 to
 the


users
 is
 the
 only
 way
 we
 can
 find


whether
 there
 is
 a
 true
 need
 or
 what
 do


they
 really
 need
 after
 talking
 to
 more


than
 like
 300
 users
 we
 find
 that
 a
 lot


of
 people
 they
 create
 the
 images
 it's


just
 out
 of
 curiosity
 the
 AI
 is
 so
 new


to
 them
 they
 just
 want
 to
 try
 it
 out
 but


they
 do
 a
 small
 group
 of
 people
 they


they
 actually
 do
 have
 the
 need
 for
 it


not
 designers
 they
 don't
 know
 how
 to


create
 all
 those
 cool
 images
 they
 do


need
 actually
 those
 content
 for


themselves
 for
 their
 company
 uh
 for


marketing.
 So
 we're
 like
 okay
 we
 finally


find
 people
 who
 have
 real
 needs
 for


that.
 Most
 of
 them
 who
 are
 on
 Amazon
 or


eBay
 or
 Etsy
 they
 actually
 use
 their


phone
 directly
 to
 take
 the
 photos
 of


their
 product.
 So
 they
 hope
 that
 okay


the
 social
 media
 is
 also
 on
 the
 phone


photos
 and
 the
 videos
 are
 also
 on
 the


phone.
 it
 will
 make
 him
 much
 more
 sense


if
 you
 just
 build
 the
 product
 on
 the


model.
 After
 talking
 to
 them,
 we
 finally


made
 the
 decision.
 Okay,
 we
 will


reposition
 this
 product
 and
 we
 will


build
 it
 for
 people
 who
 really
 have
 the


needs
 which
 is
 marketing
 and
 we
 will


also
 shift
 it
 actually
 from
 the
 PC
 side


to
 mobile.
 That's
 the
 time
 when
 the


pivot
 is
 happening.


We
 are
 building
 the
 mobile
 version
 of


creati
 in
 a
 way
 that
 it's
 not
 actually


just
 a
 tool
 but
 it's
 more
 like
 a


community
 for
 both
 influencers
 and
 the


brands.
 The
 reason
 actually
 we
 have


features
 or
 templates
 for
 both


influencers
 and
 brands
 is
 actually
 we


find
 if
 some
 brands
 they
 want
 to
 do


marketing
 it's
 impossible
 actually
 to


avoid
 uh
 the
 influencers
 contribution


because
 influencers
 they
 are
 the
 people


who
 actually
 know
 best
 about
 the
 social


media
 who
 actually
 know
 much
 better


about
 what
 content
 is
 more
 engaging
 and


more
 attractive
 to
 users.
 So
 when
 we
 are


building
 creat
 from
 day
 one
 we
 know
 okay


we
 need
 to
 create
 the
 actually
 the


network
 effect
 between
 the
 influencers


and
 the
 brands
 they
 they
 know
 the


internet
 so
 well
 after
 they
 create
 the


template
 they
 will
 also
 will
 post
 those


videos
 uh
 on
 their
 own
 channel
 on
 the


social
 media
 and
 if
 that
 video
 templates


actually
 is
 a
 great
 one
 that
 video
 will


actually
 go
 viral
 it
 will
 actually
 get


millions
 or
 tens
 of
 millions
 of
 views


right
 and
 Those
 viral
 videos
 actually
 is


the
 best
 marketing
 strategy
 for
 us
 to


acquire
 more
 and
 more
 brands
 because


when
 the
 video
 go
 viral
 that
 will
 bring


a
 lot
 of
 lot
 of
 users
 to
 the


createl
 the
 end
 of
 funnel
 there
 will
 be


the
 brands
 that
 will
 really
 use
 this


video
 templates
 to
 create
 their
 engaging


ads
 video.
 So
 the
 brands
 actually
 when


they
 are
 using
 those
 brands
 as
 video


they
 will
 pay
 more
 uh
 to
 create
 this


platform
 so
 that
 we
 can
 hire
 more


influencers
 in
 the
 community
 and
 the


influencer
 can
 create
 more
 viral
 video


templates
 for
 the
 brands.
 So
 it's


actually
 a
 very
 nice
 flywheel
 actually


we're
 building
 between
 the
 influencers


and
 the
 brands
 and
 we
 believe
 that
 is


the
 key
 differentiation
 CR
 is
 have


compared
 to
 all
 other
 like
 AI
 marketing


tools
 is
 because
 we
 believe
 the


ecosystem
 actually
 need
 both
 sides.
 We


need
 both
 influencers
 and
 brands
 to
 help


them
 to
 grow
 marketing
 at
 scale.


The
 AI
 world
 just
 changed
 daily.
 Every


day
 you
 wake
 up,
 there
 will
 be
 new


technology
 and
 new
 product,
 right?
 And
 I


think
 building
 in
 the
 AI
 era
 is
 quite


different
 from
 like
 20
 to
 30
 years
 ago


when
 people
 are
 just
 enter
 the
 mobile


boom.
 The
 thing
 is
 actually
 I
 believe


maybe
 99%
 or
 maybe
 all
 the
 products
 that


you
 saw
 today
 maybe
 not
 the
 final


version
 of
 what
 they
 will
 be
 at
 the
 end


of
 AI
 evolution.
 The
 requirement
 for
 the


founder
 in
 the
 AI
 era
 for
 AI
 startup


actually
 is
 kind
 of
 different
 from


previously
 because
 those
 founders
 really


need
 to
 adapt
 really
 quickly
 and


flexibility
 to
 those
 changes.
 And
 one


thing
 we
 think
 actually
 is
 helping
 us
 to


adapt
 to
 all
 those
 changes
 is
 we
 talk
 to


our
 users
 every
 day
 and
 to
 learn
 what
 is


the
 key
 thing
 that
 won't
 change
 even
 if


the
 technology
 change.
 So
 the
 thing
 that


we
 find
 out
 you
 know
 is
 what
 kind
 of


content
 will
 go
 pretty
 like
 viral
 on
 the


social
 media
 is
 all
 the
 things
 that
 our


users
 or
 our
 customers
 care
 about.
 Even


though
 technologies
 change,
 the


important
 thing
 is
 once
 you
 get
 those


industry
 insider
 data
 and
 knowledge
 uh


for
 that
 vertical
 that
 will
 build
 your


mode
 and
 that
 will
 actually
 be
 your
 key


value
 along
 with
 those
 all
 technology


changes
 daily
 or
 those
 technology
 change


will
 just
 help
 you
 instead
 of
 you
 know


like
 disrupted
 to
 your
 product.
