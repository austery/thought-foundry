Hello
 and
 welcome
 TED
 members.
 I
 am


Elise
 Hugh.
 I'm
 the
 host
 of
 TED
 Talks


Daily
 podcast
 and
 I
 am
 so
 glad
 to
 be


here
 with
 you
 today
 for
 the
 latest


edition
 of
 the
 TED
 Talks
 Daily
 Book


Club.
 Welcome.
 Along
 with
 this
 live


event,
 this
 is
 a
 special
 series
 on
 the


TED
 Talks
 Daily
 podcast.
 And
 if
 you


don't
 already
 know,
 it's
 a
 show
 where
 we


deliver
 ideas
 that
 inspire
 daily.
 And


now
 I'm
 so
 excited
 to
 introduce
 our


special
 guest,
 Sarah
 Kay.
 Sarah
 is
 a


writer,
 performer,
 educator,
 and
 a


beloved
 member
 of
 the
 TED
 community.
 She


was
 just
 in
 her
 early
 20s
 when
 her
 first


TED
 talk
 went
 viral.
 You've
 probably


seen
 it.
 Um
 she
 has
 since
 given
 four


more
 TED
 talks
 and
 was
 the
 host
 of
 the


TED
 podcast,
 Sincerely
 X.
 Sarah
 is
 the


author
 of
 five
 books
 of
 poetry
 and
 her


new
 fulllength
 collection,
 A
 Little


Daylight
 Left,
 which
 just
 came
 out
 in


April.
 Sarah
 has
 performed
 her
 work
 all


over
 the
 world.
 From
 the
 cornfields
 in


Iowa
 to
 a
 ship
 on
 a
 fjord
 in
 Norway
 to
 a


nightclub
 in
 Singapore
 to
 Carnegie
 Hall


to
 many
 middle
 school
 gymnasiums,
 the


back
 rooms
 of
 dive
 bars
 and
 more.
 She
 is


the
 founder
 and
 co-director
 of
 Project


Voice,
 an
 organization
 that
 uses
 poetry


to
 entertain,
 educate,
 and
 empower


students
 and
 educators
 worldwide.


Sarah's
 poems
 invite
 us
 to
 consider
 what


it
 might
 look
 like
 to
 boldly
 face
 the


hard
 things
 we
 so
 often
 run
 from
 and
 to


celebrate
 what
 we
 hold
 dear.
 I
 love
 her


work.
 The
 result
 has
 been
 described
 as


quote,
 "a
 blueprint
 for
 discovering


beauty
 in
 all
 that
 makes
 us
 human."


Sarah
 Kay,
 welcome
 and
 thank
 you
 so
 much


for
 joining
 us
 today.
 Oh,
 thank
 you
 for


having
 me.
 Thank
 you
 for
 that
 kind


intro.
 Of
 course.
 Well,
 I
 am
 amazed
 and


long
 have
 been
 amazed
 at
 the
 way
 you're


able
 to
 bring
 together
 such
 vast
 and


sometimes
 overwhelming
 topics
 into
 a


space
 that
 really
 feels
 safe
 and


relatable.
 You
 wrote
 in
 your
 poem
 Orange


about,
 I'm
 quoting
 now,
 the
 invisible


thread
 of
 poetry
 that
 so
 many
 people
 are


holding
 on
 to
 even
 and
 especially
 people


who
 may
 not
 have
 anything
 else
 in


common.
 In
 your
 view,
 what
 makes
 poetry


so
 powerful
 that
 so
 many
 people
 are


drawn
 to
 it
 and
 hold
 on
 to
 it?
 Oh,


that's
 a
 big
 question.
 Um,


well,
 I
 think


my
 relationship
 to
 poetry
 has
 evolved


over
 my
 living,
 but
 one
 of
 the
 reasons
 I


love
 reaching
 for
 poetry
 is
 when
 I


am
 feeling
 an
 emotion
 or
 going
 through


an
 experience
 or
 revisiting
 a
 memory


that
 feels
 unllanguageable.


And
 then
 I
 discover
 that
 someone
 has


found
 language
 for
 it
 in
 the
 form
 of
 a


poem.
 And
 that
 is
 one
 of
 the
 most


magical


experiences.
 And
 poetry
 has
 provided


language
 certainly,
 but
 also


um
 like
 camaraderie
 or
 um
 belonging
 or


reassurance
 or
 community
 or
 a
 lot
 of


things.
 Poetry
 offers
 a
 lot
 of
 things.


So
 I
 reach
 for
 it
 for
 a
 lot
 of
 reasons.


And
 then
 I
 get
 to
 see
 the
 way
 that
 other


people
 also
 build
 lives
 around
 poetry


for
 healing,
 for
 processing,
 for
 um
 for


activism,
 for
 education,
 for
 uh


collective
 experience,
 for
 live


performance.
 I
 mean,
 it
 goes
 on
 and
 on.


That's
 my
 whole
 thing.


Let's
 talk
 a
 little
 bit
 about
 your
 life


and
 where
 you
 began.
 You
 grew
 up
 going


to
 see
 spoken
 word
 poetry,
 I
 believe,


being
 performed
 in
 New
 York
 City.
 Um,


New
 York
 City
 is
 a
 big
 part
 of
 your


latest
 collection.
 Um,
 tell
 us
 a
 little


bit
 about
 how
 you
 became
 a
 poet.
 Sure.


So
 I
 think
 the
 first


if
 I'm
 going
 to
 tell
 my
 story
 and
 my


relationship
 to
 poetry,
 it
 actually
 has


to
 start
 earlier
 than
 that,
 which
 is


that
 when
 I
 was
 in
 elementary
 school,
 my


parents
 on
 a
 daily
 basis
 would
 pack
 me


lunch
 and
 they
 would
 take
 turns.
 They


would
 trade
 off
 writing
 a
 poem
 and


putting
 it
 in
 my
 lunch
 box.
 And
 neither


of
 my
 parents
 consider
 themselves


writers.
 Neither
 of
 them
 consider


themselves
 poets.
 This
 was
 not
 part
 of
 a


grand
 plan.
 They
 definitely
 did
 not


think
 this
 was
 going
 to
 happen.


But
 that
 is
 something
 they
 did
 as
 one
 of


many
 things
 that
 they
 did
 to
 show
 me


magic
 and
 wonder
 and
 care
 and
 love.
 And


inadvertently
 they
 therefore


introduced
 me
 to
 what
 a
 poem
 was.
 And


through
 that
 version
 of
 poetry,
 my


definition
 for
 a
 poem
 was
 something
 that


was
 a
 surprise,
 something
 that
 was
 a


secret,
 something
 that
 was
 as
 dependable


as
 clockwork,
 something
 that
 someone
 who


cared
 about
 me
 had
 made
 for
 me.
 Like


that's
 what
 I
 understood
 a
 poem
 was
 from


a
 very
 early
 age.
 Um,
 and
 so
 that's
 what


I
 treated
 poems
 as.
 I
 wrote
 them
 in
 a


notebook.
 they
 were
 a
 a
 secret
 and
 they


were
 a
 small,
 you
 know,
 unit
 to
 present


to
 someone
 I
 loved,
 usually
 my
 parent.


Um,


and
 then
 when
 I
 was
 around
 13,
 14
 years


old,
 I
 got
 an
 a
 letter
 in
 the
 mail,
 this


is
 before
 email
 times,
 I
 got
 a
 physical


letter
 in
 the
 mail
 that
 said,


"Congratulations,
 you've
 been
 registered


to
 compete
 in
 the
 New
 York
 City
 Teen


Poetry
 Slam."
 And
 a
 poetry
 slam
 was
 a


competition
 for
 poetry
 that
 was


performed,
 which
 I
 did
 not
 know.
 I
 had


never
 seen
 a
 poetry
 slam.
 I
 had
 never


heard
 of
 a
 poetry
 slam.
 I'm
 an
 elder


millennial,
 so
 we
 didn't
 have
 YouTube


back
 then,
 so
 I
 couldn't
 look
 it
 up.
 All


I
 knew
 about
 this
 event
 was
 that
 it
 was


for
 teenagers
 in
 New
 York
 City
 who
 liked


poems,
 and
 that
 was
 me.
 And
 so,
 I
 went


to
 this
 event
 and
 it
 was
 a
 room
 full
 of


teenagers
 sharing
 poems
 that
 they
 had


written
 and
 listening
 to
 each
 other.
 and


applauding
 each
 other
 and
 making
 room


for
 each
 other.
 And
 I
 had
 never


experienced
 something
 like
 that.
 And


the
 the
 lightning
 moment
 was
 in


discovering
 that
 poetry,
 which
 had


previously
 been
 a
 solitary


secret


moment,
 could
 also
 be
 a
 communal


experience.
 And
 that
 is
 what
 lit
 my


wick.
 And
 um
 this
 particular
 event,
 they


had
 rented
 out
 a
 dive
 bar
 on
 the
 Lower


East
 Side
 for
 this
 teen
 competition.


Yeah.
 And
 I
 was
 so
 taken
 with
 the
 whole


event.
 I
 thought,
 "This
 is
 the
 best


thing
 I've
 ever
 seen.
 I
 want
 to
 come


back
 next
 week
 and
 the
 week
 after.
 I


want
 to
 keep
 coming
 back
 and
 keep
 seeing


more
 and
 keep
 doing
 this
 forever."
 And


there
 was
 a
 little
 bar
 flyer
 on
 the
 way


out
 that
 said
 Thursday
 night
 poetry


slam.
 And
 I
 said,
 "Perfect,
 perfect.


I'll
 come
 But
 I
 didn't
 understand
 that


364


days
 a
 year
 it
 was
 a
 dive
 bar.


And
 so
 I
 came
 back
 the
 next
 week
 as
 a


14-year-old
 and
 I
 was
 like,
 "Hello,
 I'm


here
 for
 the
 poetry."
 And
 they
 were


like,
 "Uh,
 okay.
 Sit
 over
 there
 and


don't
 order
 any
 alcohol."


And
 um
 my
 parents


were
 a
 little
 baffled
 because
 again


they're
 not
 writers
 and
 they're
 not


performers,
 but
 they
 were
 like,
 "Okay,


this
 is
 a
 thing
 she
 seems
 excited
 about.


Um
 we're
 not
 going
 to
 let
 her
 go
 by


herself,
 but
 we
 will
 go
 and
 sit
 on
 the


other
 side
 of
 the
 room
 to
 not
 cramp
 her


style."
 And
 that
 is
 where
 I
 went
 to
 see


poetry.
 And
 I
 kept
 coming
 back.
 And
 so
 I


I
 spent
 all
 four
 years
 of
 high
 school


going
 to
 this
 dive
 bar
 and
 watching


poets
 perform.
 Mainly
 adult
 performers,


mainly
 poets
 who
 were
 at
 least
 a
 decade


my
 senior,
 but
 it
 meant
 that
 um


sometimes
 when
 I'm
 feeling
 cheeky,
 I
 say


I
 didn't
 fall
 in
 love
 with
 poetry
 in
 a


book.
 I
 fell
 in
 love
 with
 poetry
 in
 a


dive
 bar,
 which
 is
 true.
 And
 it
 also


meant
 that
 I
 learned
 poetry


almost
 in
 an
 apprentichip
 form.


So,
 by
 watching
 what
 was
 possible
 and


seeing
 all
 of
 these
 different
 styles
 and


people
 who
 either
 lived
 in
 New
 York
 or


were
 coming
 through
 New
 York,
 I
 got
 to


experience


such
 a
 wide
 range
 of
 what
 was
 possible


in
 poetry.
 And
 I
 got
 the
 unbelievable


gift
 of
 a
 room
 full
 of
 adults
 making


room
 for
 me
 and
 my
 poetry
 and
 taking
 it


seriously
 and
 taking
 me
 seriously,
 which


became
 the


the
 thing
 that
 I
 wanted
 to
 share
 with


everybody
 else.
 Yeah.


Speaking
 of
 a
 room
 full
 of
 adults,
 by


the
 time
 you
 were
 22,
 you
 were
 on
 stage


giving
 your
 first
 TED
 talk.
 This
 was


2011
 and
 you
 began
 your
 talk
 with
 If
 I


Should
 Have
 a
 Daughter,
 which
 was
 the


name
 of
 your
 first
 collection
 of
 poetry.


That
 talk
 went
 super
 viral
 and
 has
 been


watched
 literally
 millions
 of
 times.
 If


I
 should
 have
 a
 daughter,


instead
 of
 mom,
 she's
 going
 to
 call
 me


point
 B
 because
 that
 way
 she
 knows
 that


no
 matter
 what
 happens,
 at
 least
 she
 can


always
 find
 her
 way
 to
 me.
 and
 I'm
 going


to
 paint
 the
 solar
 systems
 on
 the
 backs


of
 her
 hands.
 So,
 she
 has
 to
 learn
 the


entire
 universe
 before
 she
 can
 say,
 "Oh,


I
 know
 that
 like
 the
 back
 of
 my
 hand."


And
 she's
 going
 to
 learn
 that
 this
 life


will
 hit
 you
 hard
 in
 the
 face.
 Wait
 for


you
 to
 get
 back
 up
 just
 so
 it
 can
 kick


you
 in
 the
 stomach.
 But
 getting
 the
 wind


knocked
 out
 of
 you
 is
 the
 only
 way
 to


remind
 your
 lungs
 how
 much
 they
 like
 the


taste
 of
 air.
 There
 is
 hurt
 here
 that


cannot
 be
 fixed
 by
 band-aids
 or
 poetry.


So
 the
 first
 time
 she
 realizes
 that


Wonder
 Woman
 isn't
 coming,
 I'll
 make


sure
 she
 knows
 she
 doesn't
 have
 to
 wear


the
 cape
 all
 by
 herself.
 Cuz
 no
 matter


how
 wide
 you
 stretch
 your
 fingers,
 your


hands
 will
 always
 be
 too
 small
 to
 catch


all
 the
 pain
 you
 want
 to
 heal.
 Believe


me,
 I've
 tried.
 And
 baby,
 I'll
 tell
 her,


don't
 keep
 your
 nose
 up
 in
 the
 air
 like


that.
 I
 know
 that
 trick.
 I've
 done
 it
 a


million
 times.
 You're
 just
 smelling
 for


smoke.
 So
 you
 can
 follow
 the
 trail
 back


to
 a
 burning
 house
 so
 you
 can
 find
 the


boy
 who
 lost
 everything
 in
 the
 fire
 to


see
 if
 you
 can
 save
 him.
 Or
 else
 find


the
 boy
 who
 lit
 the
 fire
 in
 the
 first


place
 to
 see
 if
 you
 can
 change
 him.
 But


I
 know
 she
 will
 anyway.
 So
 instead,
 I'll


always
 keep
 an
 extra
 supply
 of
 chocolate


and
 rain
 boots
 nearby
 because
 there
 is


no
 heartbreak
 that
 chocolate
 can't
 fix.


Okay,
 there's
 a
 few
 heartbreaks
 that


chocolate
 can't
 fix,
 but
 that's
 what
 the


rain
 boots
 are
 for.
 Because
 rain
 will


wash
 away
 everything
 if
 you
 let
 it.
 I


want
 her
 to
 look
 at
 the
 world
 through


the
 underside
 of
 a
 glass
 bottom
 boat.
 To


look
 through
 a
 microscope,
 at
 the


galaxies
 that
 exist
 on
 the
 pinpoint
 of
 a


human
 mind,
 because
 that's
 the
 way
 my


mom
 taught
 me,
 that
 there'll
 be
 days


like
 this.
 There'll
 be
 days
 like
 this.


My
 mama
 said,
 when
 you
 open
 your
 hands


to
 catch
 and
 wind
 up
 with
 only
 blisters


and
 bruises.
 When
 you
 step
 out
 of
 the


phone
 booth
 and
 try
 to
 fly
 and
 the
 very


people
 you
 want
 to
 save
 are
 the
 ones


standing
 on
 your
 cape.
 When
 your
 boots


will
 fill
 with
 rain
 and
 you'll
 be
 up
 to


your
 knees
 in
 disappointment.
 And
 those


are
 the
 very
 days
 you
 have
 all
 the
 more


reason
 to
 say
 thank
 you.
 Cuz
 there's


nothing
 more
 beautiful
 than
 the
 way
 the


ocean
 refuses
 to
 stop
 kissing
 the


shoreline
 no
 matter
 how
 many
 times
 it's


sent
 away.
 You
 will
 put
 the
 wind
 in


winome,
 lose
 some.
 You
 will
 put
 the
 star


in
 starting
 over
 and
 over.
 And
 no matter


how
 many
 landmines
 erupt
 in
 a
 minute,
 be


sure
 your
 mind
 lands
 on
 the
 beauty
 of


this
 funny
 place
 called
 life.
 And
 yes,


on
 a
 scale
 from
 one
 to
 overrusting,
 I
 am


pretty
 damn
 naive.
 But
 I
 want
 her
 to


know
 that
 this
 world
 is
 made
 out
 of


sugar.
 It
 can
 crumble
 so
 easily.
 But


don't
 be
 afraid
 to
 stick
 your
 tongue
 out


and
 taste
 it.
 Baby,
 I'll
 tell
 her.


Remember,
 your
 mama
 is
 a
 worrier
 and


your
 papa
 is
 a
 warrior.
 And
 you
 are
 the


girl
 with
 small
 hands
 and
 big
 eyes
 who


never
 stops
 asking
 for
 more.
 But


remember
 that
 good
 things
 come
 in
 threes


and
 so
 do
 bad
 things
 and
 always


apologize
 when
 you've
 done
 something


wrong.
 But
 don't
 you
 ever
 apologize
 for


the
 way
 your
 eyes
 refuse
 to
 stop


shining.
 Your
 voice
 is
 small,
 but
 don't


ever
 stop
 singing.
 And
 when
 they
 finally


hand
 you
 heartache,
 when
 they
 slip
 war


and
 hatred
 under
 your
 door
 and
 offer
 you


handouts
 on
 street
 corners
 of
 cynicism


and
 defeat,
 you
 tell
 them
 that
 they


really
 ought
 to
 meet
 your
 mother.


Thank
 you.


Thank
 you.


Thank
 you.


And
 you
 have
 since
 described
 that
 TED


talk
 as
 the
 start
 of
 an
 accidental


ambassadorship.


What
 do
 you
 mean
 by
 that?
 Well,
 I
 was
 22


when
 I


was
 given
 that
 opportunity.
 And
 so
 all
 I


knew
 was
 I
 was
 invited
 to
 a
 cool


conference
 and
 maybe
 I'll
 I'll
 learn


some
 smart
 things.
 And
 that's
 about
 as


much
 as
 I
 understood.
 And
 I
 love


performing
 poetry
 in
 lots
 of
 strange


spaces.
 That's
 a
 huge
 part
 of
 my
 joy.


And
 to
 me,
 this
 is
 just
 another
 strange


space
 to
 share
 poems.
 And
 of
 course,
 we


didn't
 know
 that
 the
 TED
 platform
 would


become
 so
 global
 and
 would
 become
 so


widespread.
 And
 after
 I
 gave
 the
 talk,


the
 video
 did
 go
 viral.
 And
 I
 started
 to


receive
 emails
 from
 people
 all
 over
 the


world,
 many
 of
 whom
 would
 say,
 "Not
 only


was
 that
 video
 my
 introduction
 to
 you


and
 your
 art,
 but
 that
 video
 was
 my


introduction
 to
 this
 art
 form.
 I
 did
 not


know
 poetry
 was
 performed.


Are
 there
 more
 people
 like
 you?
 Can
 I
 do


this?
 Could
 you
 come
 here
 and
 show
 me


how
 to
 do
 it?"
 And
 it
 became


this
 unbelievable
 adventure
 of
 getting


invited
 to
 so
 many
 surprising
 corners
 of


the
 world
 to
 share
 poems
 and


help
 people
 figure
 out
 how
 this
 art
 form


could
 be
 useful
 in
 their
 communities
 and


in
 their
 classrooms.
 And
 uh
 and
 that's


the
 the
 accidental
 ambassadorship
 that
 I


certainly


did
 not
 know
 was
 coming.


You
 mentioned
 using
 poetry
 in
 the


classroom.
 So
 let's
 jump
 to
 poetry
 as


education
 and
 in
 education.
 You
 have


been
 an
 educator
 for
 much
 of
 your
 adult


life
 now,
 having
 started
 Project
 Voice


when
 you
 were
 in
 college.
 Can
 you
 share


some
 of
 your
 experiences
 with
 poetry
 in


the
 classroom
 and
 what
 it's
 like
 just


teaching
 poetry
 um
 and
 the
 benefits
 of


younger
 folks
 learning
 it?
 I
 guess
 they


don't
 have
 to
 be
 younger
 even.
 Certainly


not.
 I
 believe
 you
 are
 never
 too
 young


or
 too
 old
 for
 poetry.
 I
 have
 taught


workshops
 that
 are
 pre
 kindergarten
 and


I
 have
 taught
 workshops
 with
 the
 elderly


and
 everybody
 in
 between.
 Yeah.
 Um,
 I


really
 love
 working
 in
 schools
 probably


because
 I
 fell
 in
 love
 with
 poetry
 as
 a


young
 person
 and
 I
 think
 it
 was


instrumental
 in
 my
 formation
 of
 self.


And


I
 love
 getting
 to
 help
 facilitate
 and


witness
 someone
 else
 falling
 in
 love


with
 poetry
 and
 discovering
 that
 there


is
 room
 for
 them
 in
 the
 house
 of
 poetry.


And
 so
 that's
 the
 drive.
 That's
 what


continues
 to


bring
 me
 to
 all
 these
 different
 schools


and
 and
 corners.
 And


I've
 been
 doing
 this
 work
 for
 now
 a
 long


time.
 And
 so
 trying
 to
 think
 of,
 you


know,
 examples
 or
 stories
 from
 the


classroom.
 There's
 I
 could
 we
 could
 just


talk
 about
 that
 for
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 the


time
 together.
 But
 I'll
 tell
 you


something
 that
 just
 happened.
 uh
 this


week
 is
 um
 well
 it
 started
 longer
 ago
 in


back
 in
 2014.


Uh
 I
 was
 teaching
 at
 a
 school
 in
 rural


Georgia
 with
 uh
 another
 poet
 named


Franny
 Choy
 who
 I
 love
 and
 who
 was


working
 with
 me
 at
 Project
 Voice
 for
 a


while.
 And
 um
 we
 were
 we
 did


performances
 and
 we
 did
 workshops
 and


then
 after
 school
 we
 were
 invited
 out
 to


dinner
 by
 some
 of
 the
 English
 teachers


which
 often
 happens.
 And
 at
 the
 dinner


they
 had
 brought
 along
 two
 high
 school


boys,
 two
 students
 and
 that's
 unusual.


Usually
 after
 hours
 the
 students
 are


home,
 but
 they
 brought
 them
 along
 to


dinner
 and
 we
 had
 a
 lovely
 dinner,
 all


of
 us
 together.
 And
 after
 dinner,
 um,


one
 of
 the
 students
 who
 I
 want
 to
 say


was
 maybe
 even
 like
 on
 the
 high
 school


football
 team
 or
 I
 think
 he
 was
 an


athlete,
 um,
 but
 he
 asked
 he
 was
 like
 a


polite
 uh,
 you
 know,
 southern
 gentleman


and
 he
 asked
 if
 he
 could
 walk
 us
 from


the
 restaurant,
 the
 three
 blocks
 to
 our


hotel
 to
 make
 sure
 we
 got
 home
 safe,


which
 we
 thought
 was
 very
 sweet.
 And


when
 he
 walked
 us
 home,
 he
 handed
 me


this
 letter
 that
 he
 had
 written
 on


notebook
 paper.
 And
 the
 letter
 was
 about


how
 much
 my
 poetry
 had
 meant
 to
 him
 and


how
 excited
 he
 was
 about
 poetry.
 And
 he


used
 lines
 from
 my
 poems
 in
 the
 letter.


Wow.
 And
 I
 have
 a
 line
 in
 an
 old
 poem


that
 the
 last
 line
 of
 my
 poem
 is
 uh


there
 is
 a
 girl
 who
 still
 writes
 you.


She
 doesn't
 know
 how
 not
 to.
 and
 he


ended
 his
 poem
 by
 saying,
 "There
 is
 a


boy
 who
 still
 writes
 poems.
 He
 doesn't


know
 how
 not
 to."
 And
 there
 was


something
 about
 the
 the
 letter
 that
 just


really
 got
 me.
 And
 it
 was
 sort
 of
 like
 I


don't
 write
 poems
 when
 I'm
 writing


poems.
 I
 don't
 think
 I'm
 writing
 poems


for
 an
 a
 high
 school
 senior
 on
 the


football
 team
 in
 rural
 Georgia.
 But


also,
 maybe
 I
 am.
 And
 maybe
 you
 never


know
 who
 needs
 a
 poem
 that
 you're


writing
 and
 you
 never
 know
 who
 is
 on
 the


other
 side
 of
 a
 door
 that
 you
 can
 open


for
 them
 into
 poetry.
 And
 it
 was
 so


meaningful
 to
 me
 that
 I
 kept
 the
 letter


and
 I,
 you
 know,
 push
 pinned
 it
 onto
 my


the
 bulletin
 board
 in
 my
 bedroom
 and


figured
 I'd
 never
 see
 this
 kid
 ever


again,
 but
 was
 grateful
 to
 him.
 And
 last


week,
 uh,
 not
 even
 on
 on
 Friday,
 uh,
 I


had
 a
 show,
 um,
 about,
 uh,
 30
 minutes


south
 of
 Atlanta
 for
 my
 new
 book
 and,


um,
 I
 was
 at
 the
 table
 signing
 books


afterwards.
 And
 this
 young
 man
 walked
 up


holding
 his
 phone
 in
 front
 of
 him
 to


show
 me
 a
 photograph,
 and
 he
 was
 like,


"Hi,
 I'm
 sure
 you
 don't
 remember,
 but


um,
 I
 actually
 met
 you
 a
 long
 time
 ago.


you
 came
 to
 perform
 at
 my
 school
 with


Franny.
 And
 I
 looked
 at
 the
 photograph


and
 I
 was
 like,
 "Wait,
 did
 you
 write
 me


a
 letter?"
 And
 he
 was
 like,
 "Yeah,
 I
 I


did."
 And
 I
 was
 like, "Of
 course
 I


remember
 you."
 And
 he
 was
 like, "I
 can't


believe
 I
 can't
 believe
 you
 remember


that."
 And
 I
 was
 like, "I
 can't
 believe


you're
 a
 whole
 grown-up."
 And
 he
 was


like,
 "I'm
 I'm
 a
 medical
 doctor."


Oh.
 So
 he's
 a
 family
 doctor.
 His
 wife


was
 there.
 I
 got
 to
 meet
 her.
 She's
 a


third
 grade
 teacher.
 They're
 like,
 you


know,
 both
 wonderful
 humans.
 And
 um
 it


was
 it
 was
 so
 lovely
 because
 when
 I


teach
 poetry
 workshops,
 I'm
 not
 teaching


them
 with
 the
 belief
 that
 I'm
 that
 all


of
 these
 kids
 are
 going
 to
 become
 poets,


you
 know,
 and
 maybe
 some
 of
 them
 will


never
 write
 a
 poem
 ever
 again,
 although


that
 would
 make
 me
 sad.
 But
 even
 if
 they


don't,
 even
 if
 it
 was
 just
 the
 time
 that


I
 got
 to
 have
 with
 them,
 one
 of
 the


things
 that
 I
 love
 about
 poetry
 is
 that


teaching
 poetry
 or
 facilitating
 poetry


is
 a
 way
 of
 teaching
 so
 many
 other


things
 that
 is
 useful
 to
 you
 no
 matter


what
 you
 end
 up
 doing.
 Right?
 Like
 when


I'm
 working
 in
 a
 classroom
 with
 young


people,
 really
 what
 I'm
 doing
 is
 helping


them
 figure
 out
 what
 they
 really
 care


about,
 what
 is
 important
 to
 them,


helping
 them
 find
 language
 to
 talk
 about


it
 in
 a
 manner
 that
 is
 authentic
 to
 how


they
 actually
 communicate,
 how
 to


present
 it
 with
 joy
 and
 confidence
 and


um
 in
 to
 to
 a
 room
 of
 their
 peers.
 uh
 to


be
 able
 to
 bear
 witness
 to
 each
 other,


to
 be
 able
 to
 be
 a
 good
 listener,
 to
 be


able
 to
 learn
 empathy
 for
 a
 foreign


narrative,
 to
 be
 able
 to
 collaborate,
 to


be
 able
 to
 receive
 criticism
 and
 give


helpful
 feedback.
 And
 all
 of
 those


things
 are
 going
 to
 be
 useful
 even
 if


you
 do
 end
 up
 a
 a
 family
 doctor,
 right?


Yeah.
 What
 a
 beautiful
 story.


Let's
 get
 practical
 then.
 How
 do
 you


think
 readers
 should
 engage
 with
 poetry?


Do
 you
 have
 a
 preferred
 way
 of
 teaching


folks
 how
 to
 approach
 a
 text?
 Oh,
 wow.


I
 love
 that
 question.
 Um,
 I
 think


because
 I


use
 the
 metaphor
 of
 having
 been
 welcomed


into
 the
 house
 of
 poetry
 myself
 and
 how


I'm
 always
 thinking
 of
 ways
 to
 try
 to


open
 doors
 for
 other
 people
 into
 the


house
 of
 poetry.
 To
 me,
 I
 also
 think


there's
 no
 wrong
 way
 in.
 And
 so,


whatever
 door
 feels
 open
 to
 you
 into


poetry,
 try
 that
 door.
 Okay?
 And
 I'm


also
 always
 thinking
 of
 or
 trying
 to


think
 of
 new
 doors.
 So,
 for
 example,
 if


you're
 the
 kind
 of
 person
 who
 is
 never


going
 to
 pick
 up
 a
 book
 of
 poems,
 that's


fine.
 Maybe
 you're
 the
 kind
 of
 person


who
 would


listen
 to
 an
 audio
 book.
 I
 made
 one
 of


those
 for
 you.
 And
 if
 you're
 like,
 "No,


thank
 you.
 I
 don't
 want
 a
 whole


audiobook
 to
 listen
 to,
 but
 I
 would


maybe
 watch
 a
 YouTube
 video
 of
 a
 three


minute
 live
 performance."
 I've
 got
 a
 few


of
 those
 for
 you.
 And
 if
 you're
 like,


"No,
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 watch
 a
 live


performance
 video,
 but
 I
 would
 maybe


watch
 a
 beautiful
 animation."
 I
 actually


got
 to
 collaborate
 with
 the
 folks
 at
 TED


Ed
 a
 few
 years
 ago
 and
 we
 made
 this


beautiful
 web
 series
 that
 I'm
 still


really
 proud
 of
 which
 is
 called
 There's


a
 Poem
 for
 that
 and
 it's
 a
 collaboration


between
 animators
 and
 poets.
 Um,
 and
 so


maybe
 you
 would
 watch
 an
 animation.
 And


if
 you're
 like,
 "No,
 thank
 you.
 I
 would


like
 to
 read
 a
 poem."
 But
 maybe
 that's


new
 to
 you
 and
 you're
 a
 little
 nervous


about
 how
 to
 read
 a
 poem
 on
 the
 page
 and


it
 looks
 different
 than
 you're
 used
 to


and
 you're
 worried
 that
 there's
 a
 wrong


way
 of
 doing
 it
 and
 you'd
 like
 someone


to
 show
 you.
 Um,
 there's
 also
 a


beautiful
 web
 series
 that
 I
 helped


curate
 which
 is
 called
 Ours
 Poetica.
 And


the
 the
 visual
 is
 the
 text
 on
 the


screen,
 but
 the
 audio
 is
 either
 the
 poet


who
 wrote
 that
 poem
 or
 somebody
 who


loves
 that
 poem
 so
 much
 reading
 it
 for


you.
 And
 so
 you
 get
 to
 see
 how
 this


person
 would
 read
 this
 text
 on
 page.
 Um,


and
 and
 so
 I'm
 I'm
 always
 trying
 to


figure
 out


what
 where
 can
 I
 meet
 you


person
 who
 perhaps
 doesn't
 know
 that


poetry
 might
 be
 for
 you
 yet.
 I
 love


that.


Let's
 talk
 a
 little
 bit
 about
 the


writing
 process.
 You
 now
 have
 five


collections
 of
 poetry
 out.
 You're
 very


prolific.


What
 does
 the
 process
 of
 writing
 and


gathering
 or
 curating
 a
 collection
 of


poetry
 look
 like
 for
 you?


Well,
 two
 different
 things.
 The
 writing


looks
 different
 from
 the
 collection


uh
 creation.


The
 writing


of
 each
 individual
 poem


is


I
 think
 for
 me


I
 have
 learned
 that
 I
 have
 been
 reaching


for
 poetry
 my
 entire
 life
 and
 the


reasons
 I
 reach
 for
 it
 are
 sometimes
 new


and
 the
 moments
 in
 which
 I
 reach
 for
 it


sometimes
 new
 but
 the
 reaching
 is
 not


and
 that
 might
 be
 one
 of the
 oldest


parts
 of
 me
 and
 I
 think
 I
 a
 common


denominator
 of
 the
 instances
 in
 which


I'm
 reaching
 is
 often
 when
 I
 have


something
 that
 I
 am
 trying
 to
 figure
 out


and
 I
 often
 think
 of
 poem
 as
 a
 verb
 and


sometimes
 when
 I
 can't
 understand


something
 and
 I'm
 wrestling
 with
 it,
 I


have
 to
 poem
 my
 way
 through
 it
 and
 then


I
 get
 to
 the
 end
 of
 the
 poem
 and
 I
 go,


"Oh,
 that's
 what
 was
 going
 on."
 And


sometimes
 I
 get
 to
 the
 end
 of the
 poem


and
 I
 still
 don't
 know
 what's
 going
 on,


but
 at least
 I
 have
 a
 new
 poem
 out
 of


the
 situation.
 Yeah.
 And
 so
 for
 me,
 it's


it's
 not
 super
 romantic.
 It's
 not
 like,


oh,
 I'm
 inspired
 and
 the
 muse
 visits
 and


out
 comes
 a
 poem.
 It's
 more
 like
 math.


It's
 more
 like
 I'm
 doing
 a
 math
 equation


in
 another
 language.
 And
 as
 soon
 as
 I


poem
 my
 way
 through
 it,
 that's
 the


that's
 the
 puzzling.
 And
 um
 so
 I
 write


the
 poems
 for
 my
 own
 brain
 and
 heart.


It's
 a
 navigation
 tool
 is
 what
 it
 is.
 It


helps
 me
 maneuver
 my
 way
 through
 my
 own


living.
 And
 sometimes
 that's
 what
 the


poem
 is
 for.
 Sometimes
 I
 write
 a
 poem


and
 I
 just
 needed
 to
 write
 it
 and
 then
 I


go,
 "Thank
 you
 for
 your
 service
 and
 I


put
 it
 in
 the
 drawer
 and
 that's
 the
 end


of
 that."
 And
 sometimes
 I
 write
 a
 poem


and
 there's
 something
 about
 the
 poem


that
 I
 think
 I
 think
 someone
 else
 might


get
 something
 out
 of
 this
 poem.
 And
 then


I
 get
 to
 decide,
 okay,
 well,
 does
 this


poem
 want
 to
 live
 on
 the
 page?
 Does
 does


this
 poem
 want
 to
 live
 out
 loud
 in
 front


of
 people?
 Um,
 am
 I
 thinking
 about
 what


the
 words
 are
 doing
 physically
 on
 the


page
 and
 the
 way
 my
 eye
 is
 pulled
 across


the
 words
 or
 am
 I
 thinking
 about
 what
 my


face
 and
 my
 voice
 and
 my
 um
 intonation


and
 my
 hand
 gestures
 are
 going
 to
 be?


what
 are
 the
 tools
 at
 my
 disposal
 when
 I


start
 to
 think
 about
 um
 sharing
 this


poem
 with
 other
 people
 if
 I
 decide
 to


share
 it
 and
 then
 if
 I
 get
 all
 the
 way


to
 and
 now
 we're
 building
 a
 collection


then
 it's
 a
 whole
 different
 set
 of


questions
 uh
 which
 for
 me
 is
 I
 write


lots
 of
 poems
 not
 all
 of
 them
 are
 going


to
 be
 in
 this
 collection
 and
 so
 what
 is


this
 collection
 for
 what
 is
 this


collection
 doing
 is
 there
 an
 arc
 and


what
 poems
 serve
 the
 ark.
 And
 I
 want
 a


person
 reading
 this
 collection
 to
 go
 on


a
 journey
 that
 they
 are
 rewarded
 for


reading
 poems
 in
 the
 order
 in
 which
 I


place
 them.
 Well,
 let's
 apply
 those


questions
 to
 your
 latest
 collection,
 A


Little
 Daylight
 Left.
 What
 are
 those


poems
 for?
 What
 are
 they
 doing?
 What
 is


the
 arc?


Great.
 Great.
 Uh,
 don't
 be
 theoretical


about
 it.
 Be
 specific.


So
 yeah
 for
 this
 collection
 so
 you
 are


correct
 that
 I
 have
 five
 books
 but
 I


actually
 three
 of
 those
 books
 are
 single


poem


hardcover
 books.
 Yeah
 that
 I
 made
 with


my
 lifelong
 collaborator
 Sophia
 Janowitz


who
 provided
 beautiful
 art
 for
 them
 and


they
 um
 so
 so
 three
 of
 them
 are
 like
 one


poem
 each
 but
 I
 actually
 only
 have
 two


collections.
 Uh
 the
 first
 one
 um
 came


out
 11
 years
 ago
 and
 then
 this
 one
 just


came
 out
 in
 April.
 And
 so
 it's
 been
 a


decade
 of
 time.
 Totally
 different
 fade.


Totally
 different
 era,
 if
 you
 will.


Different
 era,
 different
 everything.


Yeah.
 And
 you
 write
 a
 lot
 of
 poems
 in
 10


years.
 And
 so
 when
 I
 started
 looking
 at


all
 of
 those
 poems
 and
 um
 with
 my


amazing
 editor
 Maya
 Millet
 um


she
 is
 the
 one
 together
 we
 we
 noticed


this
 theme
 of
 a
 person


reaching
 for
 poetry
 to


process


whatever
 was
 happening
 at
 that
 moment.


in


her
 life.
 Yeah.
 So,
 this
 book
 ended
 up


being
 sort
 of
 like
 a
 chronology
 of
 my


reaching
 for
 poetry.
 And
 the
 book
 is
 in


three
 sections.
 And
 the
 first
 section


shows


the
 way
 that
 I
 reached
 for
 poetry
 as
 a


young
 person
 moving
 out
 of
 childhood
 and


specifically
 to
 help
 me
 process


violence.
 I
 think
 the
 introduction
 of


violence
 into
 my
 consciousness
 and
 my


life.
 Um
 personal
 violence,
 gendered


violence,
 systemic
 violence.
 Um
 and
 then


the
 second
 section
 is


um


processing
 using
 poetry
 to
 process


falling
 in
 love
 and
 spoiler
 alert


heartbreak
 and
 um
 and
 also
 reaching
 and


searching
 in
 the
 way
 that
 um
 you
 I
 did


as
 a
 young
 person.
 And
 then
 the
 third


section
 of
 the
 book
 um
 is
 a
 reflection


of
 where
 I
 am
 now,
 which
 is
 reaching
 for


poetry
 to
 help
 me
 process
 aging
 and


mortality
 and
 um
 and
 the
 the
 sort
 of


newer
 moments
 in
 which
 I
 reach
 for


poetry.
 And
 that
 became
 the
 project
 of


the
 book.
 And
 once
 I
 found
 that
 sort
 of


spine,
 then
 I
 was
 able
 to
 see
 which
 of


all
 these
 poems
 help
 show
 that


chronology
 like
 little
 ticks
 on
 a


timeline.
 Okay.
 Well,
 as
 we
 talk
 about


this
 timeline,
 we
 have
 a
 really
 great


question
 from
 Miriam
 Kay,
 who's
 one
 of


our
 TED
 members,
 who
 asks,
 "If
 you
 Sarah


in
 2025
 who
 just
 gave
 her
 fifth
 TED


talk,
 could
 give
 advice
 to
 the
 Sarah
 in


2011
 who
 was
 about
 to
 give
 her
 first,


what
 would
 that
 advice
 be?"
 Oh,
 you
 know


what's
 so
 funny?
 I
 wouldn't
 I
 wouldn't


say
 a
 single
 thing
 to
 her
 because
 the


only
 reason
 it
 worked
 is
 that
 I
 knew


absolutely
 nothing
 about
 what
 was
 going


to
 happen.
 I
 was
 so
 naive
 and
 I
 was
 so


genuinely
 present
 and
 just
 delight
 just


happy
 to
 be
 there
 and
 you
 can
 see
 it


when
 you
 watch
 the
 video.
 You
 can
 see
 it


a
 Yeah.
 who's
 just
 like,
 "Wow,


here
 I
 am,
 what
 a
 day."


And
 I
 think
 if
 I
 tried
 to
 say
 anything,


it
 would
 it
 would
 betray
 too
 much
 to


that
 kid
 and
 it
 would
 uh
 it
 would


trample
 it.
 And
 so
 I
 wouldn't
 I
 wouldn't


say
 a
 thing.
 I
 would
 just
 I
 would
 just


watch.


And
 in
 your
 acknowledgements,


you
 wrote,
 "Thank
 you
 to
 the
 many
 poets


who
 provided
 doorways
 through
 which
 I


could
 and
 needed
 to
 walk
 in
 order
 to


find
 these
 poems
 of
 my
 own."
 Which
 leads


me
 to
 ask,
 what
 is
 your
 relationship
 to


your
 ancestors,
 your
 teachers,
 both


alive
 and
 no
 longer
 living?
 And
 why
 is


their
 influence
 so
 important
 to
 your


poetry?


Well,
 poetry
 is
 this
 ancient
 ancient
 art


form.
 It's
 as
 old
 as
 we
 are.
 And


there
 are
 so


there
 are
 so
 many
 poets


who


were
 maybe
 even
 not


allowed


the
 title
 of
 poet
 or


were
 not


concerned


with
 the
 title
 of
 poet.
 And
 we're
 still


reaching
 for
 language


for
 the
 un
 languageable.
 Yeah.
 And


I
 think
 because
 I
 fell
 in
 love
 with


poetry
 in
 a
 dive
 bar,


so
 much
 of
 my
 love
 of
 poetry


comes
 from


its
 communal
 possibilities.


both
 as


shared
 experience
 of
 live
 performance


but
 also
 opportunity
 for


community
 building,
 opportunity
 for


healing,
 opportunity
 for
 naming,


opportunity
 for


um


calling
 out,
 opportunity
 for
 um
 calling


in,
 for
 showing
 each
 other


um
 ourselves
 and
 our
 vulnerable


humanness
 and
 our
 bravery.
 And
 I


I
 would
 not
 be
 here
 if
 a
 room
 full
 of


adults
 had
 not
 taken
 me
 seriously
 as
 an


artist
 before
 I
 took
 myself
 seriously
 as


an
 artist.
 And


so
 I'm
 so
 aware
 of


the
 many


shoulders
 upon
 which
 I
 stand.
 Yeah.
 Many


of
 whom
 are,
 you
 know,
 also
 standing


next
 to
 me.
 You
 know,
 I
 there's
 a
 lot
 of


um
 like


horizontal


mentorship
 too
 that's
 really
 important


to
 me.
 Um,
 and


because
 I
 get
 to
 work
 in
 schools
 and


because
 I
 get
 to
 work
 with
 young
 people,


um,
 I
 learned
 so
 much
 from
 them
 as
 well.


I
 think
 an
 accidental


incredible
 gem
 of
 a
 gift
 of
 being
 in


that
 dive
 bar
 is
 it
 allowed
 me
 to
 have


intergenerational
 friendship,
 which
 is


rare.
 But
 because
 I
 was
 14
 in
 a
 dive


bar,
 I
 became
 friends
 with
 people
 who


were
 at
 least
 a
 decade
 my
 senior,


sometimes
 more,
 but
 they
 were
 my


friends.
 They
 weren't
 my
 parents'


friends.
 And
 so
 even
 just
 even
 just


having
 intergenerational
 friendship
 from


the
 beginning
 then
 became
 so
 ingrained


in
 me
 as
 important
 as
 a
 way
 to
 learn


from
 someone
 whose
 life
 is
 at
 a


different
 stage
 than
 yours.
 And
 so
 now
 I


also
 have
 uh
 friendships
 with
 people
 who


are
 you
 know
 generationally
 younger
 than


me
 and
 um
 yeah
 so
 I
 I
 don't
 know
 I
 we


are
 both


descendants
 of
 and
 ancestors
 too


at
 the
 same
 time
 all
 the
 time.
 Um,
 and
 I


hold
 that
 both
 of
 those
 roles
 with
 great


esteem
 and
 um,
 importance
 and


responsibility.
 Yeah.


Okay.
 So,
 for
 someone
 listening
 to
 this


and
 um,
 maybe
 they're
 feeling
 inspired


to
 write
 or
 create
 but
 doesn't
 know


where
 to
 start,
 what
 would
 you
 tell


them?
 I
 would
 tell
 them
 the
 best
 thing


about
 poetry
 is


there
 are
 no


locked
 doors
 in
 front
 of
 you
 for
 trying.


There's
 so
 often
 barriers
 or
 um


obstacles
 or
 equipment
 standing
 between


you
 and
 the
 art
 you're
 curious
 about.


Right.
 Right.
 Not
 so
 with
 poetry.


The
 starting
 is


in
 your
 pocket.
 It
 is
 it
 is
 waiting
 for


you.
 And
 the
 great
 news
 is,
 you
 know,
 if


you
 wanted
 to
 be
 a
 filmmaker,
 you
 would


watch
 a
 lot
 of
 movies.
 If
 you
 wanted
 to


be
 a
 novelist,
 you
 would
 read
 a
 lot
 of


books.
 Um,
 movies
 and
 novels
 take
 a
 long


time.
 But
 poems,
 they're
 quite
 small
 and


you
 can
 read
 many
 of
 them
 pretty
 quickly


and
 you
 can
 watch
 many
 of
 them
 pretty


quickly.
 And
 um
 so
 watching
 and
 reading


and
 listening
 and
 seeing
 all
 you
 know
 as


many
 different
 kinds
 of
 poems
 from
 as


many
 different
 kinds
 of
 people
 as


possible
 is
 the
 best
 way
 to
 just
 learn


about
 what
 is
 possible
 and
 then
 you
 can


expand
 on
 what
 is
 possible.


Great
 advice.
 And
 now
 we're
 going
 to


transition
 into
 the
 closing
 section
 of


this
 conversation,
 which
 I'm
 super


excited
 about.
 We're
 going
 to
 do
 a


version
 of
 something
 that
 you
 used
 to
 do


with
 the
 Paris
 Review,
 which
 I
 think
 is


pretty
 brilliant.
 So,
 before
 we
 get


started,
 can
 you
 tell
 us
 a
 little
 bit


about
 what
 we're
 about
 to
 do?
 What


poetry
 RX
 means,
 where
 the
 idea
 came


from,
 and
 what
 it
 means
 when
 you
 say
 to


reach
 for
 a
 poem?
 So,
 Poetry
 RX
 was
 a


column
 that
 I
 got
 to
 co-write
 with
 two


other
 poets,
 my
 dear
 friends
 Kava
 Akbar


and
 Claire
 Schwarz
 for
 a
 little
 while
 at


the
 Parish
 Review
 online.
 I
 think
 all


the
 archives
 are
 still
 online,
 so
 you


can
 still
 find
 it.
 And
 it
 was
 sort
 of
 a


faux
 advice
 column.
 Yeah.
 But
 really


what
 it
 was
 is
 people
 would
 write
 in
 and


tell
 us
 about
 their
 very
 specific


heartache
 and
 then
 we
 would
 prescribe


them
 a
 poem
 for
 their
 troubles.
 And


again,
 I
 think
 because
 one
 of
 my


favorite
 moments
 of
 living
 is
 when
 a


poem
 reaches
 me
 at
 the
 exact
 moment
 I


needed
 it.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 and
 I
 go,
 "Oh,
 I


didn't
 even
 know
 I
 needed
 language
 for


this
 and
 they
 found
 it
 and
 now
 it's
 in


my
 hands."
 Nothing
 feels
 more
 lucky
 or


aligned
 for
 me
 personally.
 And
 so
 I
 love


the
 challenge
 of
 trying
 to
 create
 that


or
 something
 close
 to
 it
 for
 other


people.
 And
 so
 we
 asked
 folks
 to
 write


in
 with
 their
 very
 specific
 current


heart
 ache
 or
 heart
 question.


and
 um
 I
 tried
 to
 find
 them
 a
 poem
 for


their
 troubles.
 We
 had
 so
 many


thoughtful
 submissions
 when
 we
 asked
 you


all
 to
 write
 in
 to
 Sarah.
 So
 here
 is
 the


first
 one
 I
 have
 for
 you
 Sarah
 K
 from


Angela
 S.
 They
 are
 asking
 about
 how
 to


manage
 an
 immigrants
 distress
 in
 the


current
 state
 of
 America.


Angela
 writes,
 "It's
 hard
 to
 feel


grateful
 for
 the
 opportunities
 this


country
 has
 given
 while
 also
 feeling


afraid
 and
 unwelcomed.
 That
 kind
 of


emotional
 conflict
 is
 hard
 to
 explain
 to


people
 who
 haven't
 lived
 it.
 It's
 like


holding
 your
 breath
 in
 a
 place
 that's


supposed
 to
 be
 home."
 Thank
 you
 for


writing
 this
 prompt.


The
 poem
 that
 I
 chose
 for
 you
 is
 one
 of


my
 favorite
 poems.
 It's
 by
 the
 poet


Safia
 Elhillo,
 who's
 a
 Sudin
 American


poet,
 and
 her
 poem
 is
 called


Self-Portrait
 with
 No
 Flag.


I
 pledge
 allegiance


to
 my
 homies,


to
 my
 mother's
 small
 and
 cool
 palms,


to
 the
 gap
 between
 my
 brother's
 two


front
 teeth,
 and
 to
 my
 grandmother's


good
 brown
 hands.
 Good,
 strong
 brown


hands
 gathering
 my
 bare
 feet
 in
 her
 lap.


I
 pledge
 allegiance
 to
 the
 group
 text.
 I


pledge
 allegiance
 to
 laughter
 and
 to
 all


the
 boys
 I
 have
 a
 crush
 on.
 I
 pledge


allegiance
 to
 my
 spearmint
 plant,
 to
 my


split
 ends,
 to
 my
 grandfather's
 brain


and
 gray
 left
 eye.


I
 come
 from
 two
 failed
 countries
 and
 I


give
 them
 back.
 I
 pledge
 allegiance
 to


no
 land,
 no
 border
 cut
 by
 force
 to
 draw


blood.
 I
 pledge
 allegiance
 to
 no


government,
 no
 collection
 of
 white
 men


carving
 up
 the
 map
 with
 their
 pens.


I
 choose
 the
 table
 at
 the
 Waffle
 House


with
 all
 my
 loved
 ones
 crowded
 into
 the


booth.
 I
 choose
 the
 shining
 dark
 of
 our


faces
 through
 a
 thin
 sheet
 of
 smoke.


Glowing
 dark
 of
 our
 faces,
 slick
 under


layers
 of
 sweat.
 I
 choose
 the
 world
 we


make
 with
 our
 living,
 refusing
 to
 be


unmade
 by
 what
 surrounds
 us.
 I
 choose
 us


gathered
 at
 the
 lakeside,
 the
 light


glinting
 off
 the
 water
 and
 our
 laughing


teeth
 and
 along
 the
 living
 dark
 of
 our


hair.
 And
 this
 is
 my
 only
 country.


Thank
 you
 so
 much
 for
 sharing
 that.


We
 only
 have
 time
 for
 one
 more,
 but
 we


again
 we
 received
 so
 many
 incredible


prompts.
 So,
 thank
 you
 to
 everyone
 who


took
 the
 time
 to
 submit
 something.
 Um,


our
 last
 prompt
 for
 today
 is
 from
 Robin


S.
 who
 shared
 with
 us,
 "When
 I
 get
 a


whiff
 that
 something
 beautiful
 is


happening,
 my
 mind
 automatically
 warns


me
 that
 it
 will
 not
 last
 or
 that
 maybe
 I


am
 mistaken.


What
 is
 your
 advice?"
 And
 just
 full


disclosure,
 I'
 I
 totally
 relate
 to
 this.


I'm
 always
 like,
 is
 there
 another
 shoe


about
 to
 drop?
 So,
 give
 us
 a
 poem
 for


this,
 Sarah.


Certainly.


Um,


this
 is
 a
 poem
 by
 Palestinian
 American


Hala
 Alion
 that
 I
 love
 called
 Spoiler.


Can
 you
 diagnose
 fear?


The
 red
 tree
 blooming
 from
 my
 uterus
 to


throat.
 It's
 one
 long
 nerve,
 the
 doctor


says.
 There's
 a
 reason
 breathing
 helps.


The
 muscles
 slackening
 like
 a
 dead


marriage.
 Mine
 are
 simple
 things.
 Food


poisoning
 in
 Paris,
 hospital
 lobbies,
 my


husband
 laughing
 in
 another
 room,
 the


door
 closed.
 For
 days
 I
 cradle
 my
 breast


and
 worry
 the
 cyst
 like
 a
 bead.
 There's


nothing
 to
 pray
 away.
 The
 tree
 loves
 her


cutter.
 The
 nightmares
 have
 stopped.
 I


tell
 the
 doctor.
 I
 know
 why
 they
 stopped


because
 I
 baptized
 them.
 This
 is
 how
 my


mother
 and
 I
 speak
 of
 dying.
 The
 thing


you
 turn
 away
 by
 letting
 in.
 I'm
 tired


of
 April.
 It's
 killed
 our
 matriarchs.


And
 in
 the
 backyard,
 I've
 planted
 an


olive
 sapling
 in
 the
 wrong
 soil.
 There


is
 a
 droopiness
 to
 the
 branches
 that


reminds
 me
 of
 my
 friend.
 The
 one
 who


calls
 to
 ask,
 "What's
 the
 point?"
 Or
 the


patients
 who
 come
 to
 me
 swarmed
 with


misery
 and
 astonishment.
 Their
 hearts


like
 newborns
 after
 the
 first
 needle.


What
 now?
 They
 all
 want
 to
 know
 what
 now


I
 imagine
 it
 like
 a
 beach.
 There
 is
 a


magnificent
 sand
 castle
 that
 has
 taken


years
 to
 build.
 A
 row
 of
 pink
 seashells


for
 gables.
 Rooms
 of
 pebbles
 and


driftwood.


This
 is
 your
 life.


Then
 comes
 the
 affair.
 Nagging
 blood


work.
 A
 freeway
 pileup.
 The
 tide
 moves


in.
 The
 water
 eats
 your
 work
 like
 a


drove
 of
 wild
 birds.
 There
 is
 debris,
 a


tatter
 of
 seaggrass
 and
 blood
 from
 where


you
 scratched
 your
 own
 arm
 trying
 to


fight
 the
 current.


It
 might
 not
 happen
 for
 a
 long
 time.
 But


one
 day
 you
 run
 your
 fingers
 through
 the


sand
 again,
 scoop
 a
 fistful
 out
 and
 pat


it
 into
 a
 new
 floor.


You
 can
 believe
 in
 anything.
 So
 why
 not


believe
 this
 will
 last?
 The
 sea
 shell


rafter
 like
 eyes
 in
 the
 glowing.
 I'm


here
 to
 tell
 you
 the
 tide
 will
 never


stop
 coming
 in.
 I'm
 here
 to
 tell
 you


whatever
 you
 build
 will
 be
 ruined.
 So


make
 it
 beautiful.


Thank
 you
 so
 much
 for
 that.
 By
 the
 way,


I
 feel
 like
 you
 know
 what
 a
 what
 a


special
 and
 sacred
 time
 that
 we
 all
 get


to
 spend
 together
 in
 community.
 Thank


you
 to
 everybody
 who
 wrote
 in.
 Before
 we


wrap,
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 have
 been
 asking


questions
 and
 submitting
 questions,
 too.


So,
 I
 want
 to
 just
 end
 our
 hour
 with
 as


many
 questions
 as
 we
 can
 get
 to.
 First


from
 Zanap,
 I
 feel
 hopeless
 as
 a
 young


person
 living
 in
 a
 world
 that's
 going


through
 wars,
 genocide,
 inequality,


uncertainty,
 capitalism,
 in
 a
 world


that's
 in
 a
 state
 of
 despair.
 What
 do
 I


do
 as
 an
 individual?
 What
 does
 art
 stand


in
 here?


Well,


I
 think


large
 systemic


fires


cannot
 be
 put
 out
 by
 individuals,


but
 individuals


can
 be
 responsible


for


offering
 what
 they
 have
 to
 offer.


The
 poet
 Eve
 Luing
 has
 this
 beautiful


call
 to
 action
 which
 is


to
 always
 be
 teaching
 someone
 and


learning
 from
 someone.
 And
 so
 to
 ask


yourself,
 what
 do
 I
 know
 how
 to
 do
 that


I
 could
 teach
 someone
 else
 how
 to
 do?


That
 education,
 we
 often
 put
 education


in
 only
 formal
 settings,


but
 learning
 is
 lifelong
 and
 happens


outside
 the
 classroom
 all
 the
 time.


sometimes
 in
 a
 dive
 bar,
 but
 it
 happens


everywhere.
 Happens
 in
 your
 community,


happens
 with
 your
 neighbors,
 happens


with
 your
 nieces.
 What
 are
 the
 things


you
 know
 how
 to
 do,
 how
 to
 see,
 how
 to


um
 explain,
 and
 how
 can
 you
 teach
 people


what
 you
 know?
 That's
 something
 you


uniquely
 are
 qualified
 to
 do
 and
 can


offer.
 and
 then
 always
 also
 trying
 to


learn
 from
 other
 people
 what
 they
 can


uniquely
 teach
 you.
 I
 think
 that's


something
 that
 feels
 actionable
 and


focusable.


Yeah.


Um


this
 might
 be
 tricky
 to
 just
 list
 off,


but
 Laura
 asks,
 "Which
 poems
 are
 on
 your


life
 soundtrack?
 Which
 poems
 could
 be


credited
 with
 moving
 or
 changing
 you
 the


most?"
 Oh,
 good
 heavens.
 Uh
 yeah.
 Okay.


Well,
 an
 easy
 one
 um
 is
 one
 of
 there's


two
 epigraphs
 at
 the
 beginning
 of
 a


little
 daylight
 left.
 One
 is
 a
 quote


from
 the
 poet
 Laura
 Lamb
 Brown
 Lavoy
 and


it
 comes
 from
 her
 poem
 that
 the
 whole


title
 is
 on
 this
 the
 100th
 anniversary


of
 the
 sinking
 of
 the
 Titanic
 we


reconsider
 the
 buoyancy
 of
 the
 human


heart
 which
 is
 one
 of
 my
 favorite
 poems


and
 you
 can
 find
 a
 video
 of
 me
 reading


it
 online.
 Um,
 that's
 that's
 a
 poem
 that


I
 revisit
 multiple
 times
 a
 year.
 From


Cat
 H,
 is
 there
 a
 moment
 when
 your


poetry
 gave
 you
 a
 revelation
 or
 offered


you
 a
 revelation
 that
 frightened
 you?
 H


um
 I'm
 thinking
 of
 there's
 uh
 the
 poet


and
 and
 writer
 Hanifurakib


uh
 has
 a
 story
 in
 one
 of
 his
 books
 where


I
 think
 it's
 in
 there's
 always
 this
 year


where
 he
 talks
 about
 getting
 to
 meet
 um


an
 astronaut
 as
 a
 child.
 he
 got
 a
 chance


to
 meet
 um
 a
 famous
 astronaut
 and
 he
 got


to
 to
 ask
 one
 question
 and
 his
 question


was
 when
 you
 were
 up
 there
 um
 were
 you


were
 you
 scared
 and
 his
 answer
 was
 yes


of
 course
 but
 never
 more
 than
 I
 was


curious


and
 I
 think
 that
 that's
 really
 helpful


as
 a
 guideline
 for
 me
 like
 yeah
 things


realizations
 and
 um
 self-realizations


and
 and
 discoveries
 about
 the
 world
 can


be
 scary
 and
 I
 am
 so
 curious
 about


myself
 and
 the
 world
 that
 I
 live
 in
 um


and
 letting
 that
 curiosity
 take
 the


steering
 wheel
 like
 fear
 can
 be
 in
 the


car
 but
 it
 doesn't
 get
 to
 drive.


Yeah.
 Okay.
 This
 is
 very
 TED
 question


from
 Mari
 Angela
 A.
 How
 will
 AI
 change


the
 way
 we
 make
 poetry?


I
 don't
 know.
 I
 you
 know
 that's
 a


predictive
 question
 that
 I
 a
 prediction


I
 I
 won't
 make.
 But
 um
 I
 think


I
 would
 caution


or
 what
 I
 would
 say
 is
 it
 makes
 me
 sad.


It
 it
 makes
 me
 sad
 when
 people
 delegate


their
 the
 parts
 of
 themsel
 that
 make


them
 human


to


the
 nonhumans


because
 it's
 a
 it
 means
 you're
 robbing


yourself


of
 those
 opportunities


to
 be
 as
 human
 as
 possible.
 And
 so
 like


um
 you
 know
 when
 people
 are
 like,
 "Oh,


you
 can
 just
 get
 the
 AI
 to
 write
 your


wife
 a
 love
 letter,
 I
 guess."
 But
 do
 you


think
 your
 wife
 wants
 like
 a
 well


scripted
 AI
 written
 love
 letter
 or
 do


you
 think
 your
 wife
 wants
 like
 you
 to
 be


vulnerably
 stumbling
 through
 trying
 to


find
 language
 for
 your
 feelings
 for
 her?


You
 know,
 like
 that's
 the
 human
 part.


and
 to
 give
 it
 away
 robs
 you
 of
 that


opportunity.
 Um,
 so
 I
 think
 you
 know
 you


could
 read
 AI
 poems
 I
 guess
 but
 I
 think


when
 we
 read
 a
 poem
 written
 by
 a
 human


we
 feel
 their
 humanness
 through
 the


language
 and
 it
 is
 their
 mortality
 and


it
 is
 their
 unique
 life
 and
 living
 that


is
 only
 theirs
 that
 made
 that
 poem


possible.
 That's
 what
 we're
 interested


in
 and
 excited
 about.
 not
 um


predicting
 what
 words
 belong
 in
 what


order.
 Right.
 Well,
 Sarah
 K,
 that
 brings


us
 to
 the
 end
 of
 our
 time
 together.


Thank
 you
 so
 much
 for
 this
 incredibly


moving
 and
 soul
 nourishing
 conversation.


Thank
 you,
 Elise,
 so
 much.
 Thank
 you
 to


everybody
 at
 TED.
 Thank
 you.
 Bye
 y'all.
