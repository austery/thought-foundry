Guys,
 guys,
 guys.
 Welcome
 to
 Tech
 Bros.


Deeply,
 deeply
 appreciate
 everyone


taking
 the
 time
 out
 of
 their
 the


valuable
 time
 out
 of
 the
 valuable
 time


out
 of
 their
 life
 because
 we're
 talking


about
 life
 at
 the
 end
 of the
 day.
 So,


the
 time
 you
 spend
 with
 people
 quite


frankly
 dictates
 the
 relationships
 and


the
 basis
 for
 humanity.
 It
 quite


honestly,
 it's
 the
 existential
 reality


for
 how
 we
 understand
 existence.
 And
 I


am
 so
 sorry
 that
 Tanner
 ended
 up
 wasting


everybody's
 time.


>> Decided,
 you
 know,
 I
 just


>> I
 really
 wish
 this
 guy
 would
 I
 really


wish
 this
 guy
 would
 give
 a
 crap
 about


people's
 time.
 I
 really


>> Oh
 god.


>> I
 had
 to
 I
 I
 literally
 have
 a
 DM.
 I'm


going
 to
 start
 exposing
 DMs
 here
 because


I
 literally
 said


>> at
 9:31
 that
 I'm
 backstage
 and
 waiting


for


>> 9:31.


>> No,
 no.
 I
 was
 here
 on
 time.
 I
 was


surprised
 that
 it
 ticked
 into
 being


late.


>> You
 guys
 see
 that?


>> Tanner,
 I
 know
 you're
 from
 Canada,
 but


can
 you
 read
 time?
 9:31.
 We
 start
 at


9:30.


>> But
 I
 was
 not
 expecting
 you
 to
 be
 late,


sir.
 I
 was
 here
 for
 multiple
 minutes
 at


that
 point
 and
 then
 I
 saved
 your
 ass
 by


telling
 you
 that
 we
 had
 a
 show.
 Okay.
 He


was
 powernapping
 at
 his
 desk.


>> I
 don't
 know
 why
 you're
 gaslighting


everybody.
 I
 just
 I
 really
 don't
 think


that's
 the
 right.


>> We
 all
 know
 who
 made
 us
 late.
 So,


>> we
 all
 know.


>> Roy,
 tell
 the
 truth.


>> I
 already
 did.


>> You
 already
 did.


>> There's
 two
 axioms.
 There's
 two
 axioms


that
 you
 can
 always
 count
 on.
 One
 is
 the


bricks
 are
 real
 and
 the
 second
 is
 Tanner


is
 late.


>> Your
 your
 mic's
 also
 uh
 decently
 quiet


by
 the
 way.
 Roy,


>> is
 this
 better?


>> Yeah,


>> it's
 definitely
 better.


>> This
 is
 better,
 too.


>> Yeah,
 I
 think
 your
 gain
 was
 probably


just
 lower.


>> Yeah,
 I
 can
 turn
 it
 up
 over
 here,
 too.


Is
 this
 too
 loud?


>> Don't
 call
 me
 Tantrum
 Tanner.
 I
 can't


believe
 these
 names
 come
 out
 of
 nowhere,


bro.


Okay,
 guys.
 In
 all
 reality,
 it


definitely
 was
 my
 fault.
 I
 was
 doing


like
 a
 million
 things
 and
 I
 was
 like,


"Oh
 crap,
 it's
 9:31."
 But
 the
 fact
 that


he
 text
 I
 I
 actually
 didn't.
 Your
 text


didn't
 trigger
 me
 remembering.
 I
 just


saw
 the
 time
 and
 I
 remembered.
 But
 the


fact
 that
 you
 texted
 9:31
 means
 you
 were


You
 didn't
 text
 at
 9:28.


Okay,
 buddy.
 Texted
 at
 9:30.


>> Well,
 I
 was
 I
 was
 backstage
 at
 9:28.
 So,


>> well,
 you
 texted
 at
 9:31.


>> Yeah,
 but
 you
 wouldn't
 know
 it


regardless.
 Like,
 I
 mean,


>> all right,
 we
 got
 a
 lot
 to
 talk
 about.


Thank
 you
 everybody
 for
 being
 here
 for


another
 week
 of
 Tech
 Bros.
 I
 think
 we


missed
 last
 week
 because
 Oh,
 yeah.
 It


was
 Dvali.
 So,
 I
 couldn't
 make
 it
 last


week,
 but
 uh
 we
 are
 back
 and
 I
 think


let's
 get
 started
 off
 with
 raw
 thoughts


on
 the
 market.
 We
 got
 SoFi
 earnings


tomorrow.
 We'll
 talk
 about
 that.
 Got


some
 hood
 updates,
 some
 Nvidia
 stuff,


but
 I
 mean
 Roy,
 we'll
 start
 with
 you.
 Uh


S&P
 alltime
 highs.
 How
 are
 you
 feeling?


>> Yeah,
 I
 mentioned
 this
 in
 in
 your


birthday
 stream.


>> Roy,
 that's
 a
 little
 that's
 a
 little
 too


Yeah.


>> How's
 it
 better?


>> Pull
 my
 speakers
 away.


>> That's
 better.
 Yes,


>> it's
 okay.
 All
 right.


>> Sorry.
 I
 I
 don't
 know
 what
 happened
 in


the
 setting.
 Like
 nothing
 changed.
 We


just
 had
 a
 power
 outage
 and
 it
 just


knocked
 everything
 out.
 So,
 okay.
 Um
 it


is
 shocking
 to
 me
 and
 I
 pointed
 this
 out


with
 uh
 with
 you
 earlier
 that
 we
 are
 at


all-time
 highs
 in
 the
 fear
 and
 greed


index.
 I'll
 I'll
 throw
 this
 up
 here
 or


I'll
 I'll
 ask
 you
 to
 throw
 it
 up
 is


fear.
 Now,
 this
 can
 move
 and
 probably


will
 move
 to
 neutral
 and
 then
 to
 greed,


you
 know,
 if
 if
 we
 continue
 moving
 up.


But
 in
 an
 uptrend,
 it's
 not
 too
 uncommon


to
 see,
 you
 know,
 be
 an
 extreme
 fear
 of


fear
 for
 a
 little
 while.
 But
 at
 all-time


highs,
 it's
 a
 little
 bit
 surprising.
 Of


course,
 there's
 there's
 real
 catalysts.


Uh
 tariff
 stuff
 is
 a
 big
 thing.
 I
 do


feel
 like
 that
 the
 market
 might
 be


ignoring
 or
 overlooking
 some
 potential


near-term
 pain
 uh
 with
 specifically
 with


the
 government
 shutdown,
 SNAP
 benefits,


student
 loans,
 and
 that
 sort
 of
 thing,


too.
 But,
 uh
 I
 mean,
 it's
 a
 fun
 day.
 A


lot
 of
 these
 companies
 too
 uh
 that
 are


getting
 uh
 the
 bids
 are
 massive


companies
 posting
 good
 earnings
 today.


This
 week
 uh
 Tanner
 pointed
 out
 Seth


Gild
 also
 did
 on
 Robbo
 2
 that
 40


something%
 of
 companies
 in
 the
 S&P
 500


uh
 are
 reporting
 earnings
 this
 week.
 So


did
 I
 get
 that
 right
 Tanner?


>> It
 might
 be
 that
 high.
 I
 was
 just
 saying


that
 it
 was
 24%
 in
 just
 the
 five


companies.
 I
 didn't
 even
 I
 didn't
 even


uh
 look
 at
 all
 the
 other
 companies
 that


are
 reporting.
 It
 probably
 is
 40%.


>> Yeah.
 Let
 me
 let
 me
 find
 that.
 Yeah,
 42%


of
 S&P
 companies
 by
 market
 cap
 reporting


earnings.
 So,
 it's
 by
 market
 cap,
 not
 by


number
 of
 companies.
 So,
 it's
 it's
 I
 I


miss
 that
 part.


>> But
 yeah,
 this
 this
 ultimately
 there


will
 always
 be,
 you
 know,
 the
 roller


coaster
 still
 in
 effect,
 but
 this
 week


really
 is
 what
 determines
 how
 good


earnings
 actually
 are
 with
 42%
 S&P
 500.


If
 the
 um
 narrative
 is
 like,
 hey,


they're
 crushing
 it.
 The
 AI
 is
 real,


which
 we
 we'll
 hear
 that
 again,
 of


course.
 Uh
 companies
 are
 growing.
 no


real
 concerns
 with
 consumers,
 company


here
 and
 there
 will
 try
 to
 blame
 that.


But
 when
 you're
 in
 isolation,
 the
 market


just
 ignores
 you
 and
 says,
 "You're


terrible.
 We're
 gonna
 actually
 believe


these
 companies
 that
 are
 killing
 it."


And
 I
 expect
 that's
 probably
 what
 we're


going
 to
 get.
 So,
 uh,
 we
 may
 continue
 on


on
 a
 uptrend
 and
 rally
 all
 the
 way


through
 Santa
 Claus
 time.


>> Um,


so
 before
 you
 speak,
 Tanner,
 I'm
 going


to
 give
 my
 quick
 thoughts
 on
 this.
 I


think
 there's
 three
 elements
 of
 what's


going
 on
 right
 now.
 Number
 one,
 you
 have


rate
 cuts
 coming
 up
 on
 Wednesday.
 Number


two,
 you
 have
 earnings
 on
 Wednesday,


Microsoft,
 Metagoo,
 then
 Apple,
 and


Amazon
 on
 Thursday.
 I
 think
 all
 those


companies
 hopefully
 crush
 and
 continue


the
 trend
 to
 show
 that
 we
 should
 be


trading
 at
 the
 multiples
 we're
 trading


at.
 Um,
 so
 those
 are
 two
 really


important
 things.
 And
 then
 number
 three,


which
 I
 think
 is
 something
 that
 it


really
 is
 important
 to
 to
 to
 double
 down


on,
 and
 I'm
 curious
 on
 your
 thoughts
 on


this
 as
 well,
 guys.
 We
 had
 a
 3%
 draw


down.
 And
 that
 3%
 draw
 down
 was
 the


first
 draw
 down
 in
 five
 months.
 I
 think


all
 of
 us
 can
 say
 we
 needed
 it.
 And


maybe
 it
 was
 because
 of
 the
 Trump
 China


tweets
 or
 whatever
 it
 was,
 crypto


leverage,
 but
 it
 we
 needed
 it
 like


August
 and
 September,
 we
 we
 avoided


barely
 even
 a
 1%
 draw
 down.
 And
 so
 you


needed
 to
 get
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 froth
 out


of
 the
 system.
 A
 lot
 of
 the
 names
 that


were
 running
 to
 30
 40
 billion
 dollar


market
 caps
 that
 are
 not
 delivering
 any


earnings
 growth,
 any
 even
 revenue,


forget
 earnings.
 They
 ended
 up
 getting


hit.
 Now,
 they
 didn't
 get
 hit
 to
 the


point
 where
 they're
 going
 to
 zero.
 And
 I


don't
 think
 they're
 going
 to
 zero,
 but


they
 did
 get
 hit.
 I
 mean,
 for
 goodness


sakes,
 we
 had
 a
 meme
 stock
 ETF
 come
 back


before
 we
 had
 this
 3%
 draw
 down
 over
 the


past
 couple
 weeks.
 Last
 time
 that


happened
 was
 literally
 the
 top
 in
 2021.


So,
 I
 think
 there
 was
 a
 lot
 of


uneasiness
 over
 the
 past
 couple
 weeks


from
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 around,
 hey,
 this


feels
 frothy.
 Are
 we
 topping?
 Is
 there


too
 much
 euphoria?
 Is
 there
 too
 much


excitement?
 And
 all
 of
 that
 got
 wiped


out
 over
 the
 past
 couple
 weeks.
 Now,
 you


still
 have
 companies
 trading
 at
 pretty


aggressive
 multiples.
 And
 I
 think
 the


stock
 market's
 very
 rewarding
 if
 you
 put


up
 the
 growth
 to
 expand
 your
 multiple.


It's
 very
 gut-wrenching
 if
 you
 can't
 put


up
 the
 growth.
 But
 I
 don't
 think
 it's
 a


clown
 market
 the
 way
 it
 was
 a
 couple


weeks
 ago
 where
 things
 were
 just
 going


up
 for
 the
 hell
 of
 going
 up.
 And
 I
 think


that
 along
 with
 the
 fact
 that
 the
 S&P
 is


back
 to
 all-time
 highs
 in
 a
 pretty


steady
 way,
 you've
 got
 rate
 cuts
 coming.


You've
 got
 earnings
 growth
 hopefully


from
 big
 tech
 coming
 this
 week
 and


you've
 got
 some
 of
 that
 froth
 shaken


out.
 I
 think
 this
 is
 one
 of
 the
 more


healthier
 markets
 we've
 been
 in
 in
 all


of
 2025.
 And
 I'm
 curious
 on
 your


thoughts
 on
 that
 as
 well.


>> No,
 I
 I
 think
 you
 summarized
 that
 well.


I
 mean,
 I
 think
 I
 feel
 very
 confident
 in


the
 position
 that
 we're
 in.
 Um,
 I
 like


the
 trade
 deals
 that
 are
 coming
 through.


I
 don't
 think
 that
 anyone
 uh
 any
 of
 the


large
 market
 movers
 are
 here
 to
 blow
 up,


you
 know,
 the
 the
 the
 S&P
 500
 right
 now.


So,
 everyone
 wants
 to
 get
 deals
 done.


They
 want
 good
 economies.
 you
 know,


there
 there's
 no
 uh
 well,
 I
 mean,


there's
 always
 a
 war
 brewing
 for
 sure,


but
 there's
 no
 real
 um
 looming
 events


that
 I
 think
 is
 going
 to
 draw
 anything


down
 globally
 right
 now.
 Um
 obviously


things
 can
 change
 very
 quickly,
 but
 rate


cuts
 are
 going
 to
 help.
 the
 continued


rate
 cuts,
 even
 talk
 about
 an
 additional


rate
 cut
 in
 2026
 is
 something
 for
 a
 lot


of
 um
 loan
 book
 purchasers
 especially,


we'll
 talk
 about
 SoFi,
 but
 but
 that's


very
 exciting
 going
 forward
 that
 this
 is


not
 just
 going
 to
 be,
 you
 know,
 one
 rate


cut
 that
 we're
 talking
 about.
 This
 is


potentially
 three
 more
 two
 this
 year,


but
 but
 continuing
 into
 2026.


That's
 a
 very
 exciting
 uh
 ordeal
 that's


happening.


And


>> and and
 then
 you
 got
 the
 Chinese
 that


are
 deescalating
 with
 the
 US,
 right?


>> Yeah.


Roy.


>> No,
 I
 I
 mean
 I
 agree
 with
 you
 guys.
 Like


there's
 these
 are
 real
 catalysts.
 Uh
 the


the
 companies
 that
 are
 healthy
 and


growing
 continue
 to
 do
 well.
 There
 are,


you
 know,
 there's
 cracks
 and
 you
 can


always
 point
 and
 and
 if
 you
 look
 hard


enough,
 you
 can
 find
 bearish
 things.


Bears
 always
 manage
 to
 do
 that.
 You


Amazon
 layoffs
 is
 not
 happy
 news
 for


anybody
 that's
 affected,
 but
 I
 mean
 the


reality
 is
 they've
 done
 similar
 layoffs


over
 the
 last
 uh
 two
 or
 this
 will
 be
 the


third
 time
 in
 the
 last
 four
 years.
 So,


um,
 but,
 uh,
 yeah,
 I
 think
 that
 the


earning
 season,
 uh,
 is
 going
 to
 be
 the


same
 as
 what
 we've
 seen
 the
 last
 few


quarters
 with
 everything's
 healthy.
 We


already
 saw
 banks
 report.
 Consumers
 seem


like
 they're
 in
 a
 healthy
 place
 except


with
 some
 very
 isolated
 uh,
 maybe


there's,
 you
 know,
 Jamie
 Diamond
 said


there's
 there
 might
 be
 when
 you
 see
 one


cockroach
 that
 there's
 probably
 more,


but
 I
 don't
 know
 how
 many
 more
 we
 see
 at


least
 this
 earnings.
 I
 think
 that
 might


be
 something
 that
 waits
 until
 next
 year


uh,
 after
 the
 Christmas
 season
 and


holiday
 spend.
 Um
 but
 yeah,


>> and
 my
 understanding
 is
 the
 two
 um
 you


know,
 regional
 banks
 that
 ended
 up


seeing
 problems
 also
 were
 both
 tied
 to


the
 same
 uh
 company
 that
 was
 doing


fraudulent
 actions.
 I
 don't
 remember
 the


name
 of
 the
 the
 business.
 Maybe
 a
 MIT


will,
 but
 it
 might
 be
 an
 isolated
 issue.


It
 might
 not
 be
 uh
 a
 cockroach
 situation


at
 all.


>> Go
 ahead,
 Roy.
 I
 was
 going
 to
 say


Diamond
 Diamond
 is
 pretty
 bearish
 in
 a


lot
 of
 his
 comments.
 I
 think
 banker
 CEOs


maybe
 are
 just
 by
 nature,
 but


>> yeah,
 they
 they
 have
 to
 be
 cautious,


right?
 It's
 it's
 risk
 aversion.


>> Yeah,


I
 I
 I
 don't
 remember
 the
 exact
 name
 of


the
 companies,
 but
 I
 I
 do
 agree
 that


look,
 I
 think
 it's
 isolated.
 I
 mean,


every
 other
 regional
 that
 reported
 after


that
 um
 Zion
 and
 Western
 Alliance


report,
 which
 by
 the
 way,
 when
 Zion
 that


wasn't
 even
 Zion's
 earnings,
 that
 was


just
 like
 a
 preliminary
 thing
 they
 had


to
 put
 out
 there.
 their
 earnings
 crushed


and
 their
 provision
 for
 credit
 losses,


which
 is
 what
 determines
 kind
 of
 how


healthy
 the
 consumer
 is,
 how
 healthy


your
 loans
 are.
 I
 mean,
 all
 these


regionals
 came
 in
 better
 than
 expected


by
 like
 almost
 100
 to
 $150
 million.
 So,


the
 private
 credit
 fears
 don't
 seem
 to


be
 that
 aggressive,
 and
 maybe
 they
 will


be,
 but
 we
 don't
 have
 that
 much
 evidence


yet
 to
 say
 that
 they're
 super


aggressive.
 Uh,
 the
 China
 stuff
 seems


like
 it's
 starting
 to
 get
 relaxed.
 A
 lot


of
 froth,
 although
 it's
 still
 in
 the


market,
 has
 been
 taken
 out,
 which
 I


think
 people
 are
 feeling
 a
 bit
 more
 uh


healthy
 about.
 earnings
 growth
 is
 here


and
 then
 you've
 got
 rate
 cuts.
 I
 mean,
 I


don't
 see
 I
 agree
 with
 Roy.
 There's


definitely
 things
 to
 be
 bearish
 about


like
 the
 labor
 market
 and
 potential


cracks
 in
 the
 economy
 with
 with
 the


lower
 end
 of
 the
 consumer.
 But
 on
 a


broader
 macro
 trend,


I
 don't
 see
 the
 massive
 bare
 case.
 And


then
 you
 have
 seven
 half
 trillion


dollars
 on
 the
 sidelines,
 which


inevitably
 is
 going
 to
 want
 to
 find
 a


home.


>> What
 are
 we
 seeing
 for
 endofear
 S&P
 500


price
 targets?


See
 what
 was
 fun.


>> You
 know,
 actually
 people
 now
 it's


7,000,
 but
 orig
 in
 January
 was
 6,600.


>> Yeah.


>> So
 they
 raised
 it
 going
 into
 the
 end
 of


the
 year,
 but
 originally
 he
 was
 not,
 you


know,
 bowled
 up
 to
 7,000.
 There's
 only
 a


couple
 people
 that
 were
 bowled
 up
 to
 to


that
 level.


>> Well,
 I
 don't
 know.
 But
 we're
 less
 than


2%
 away
 from
 7,000.
 So
 I
 don't
 think


it's
 crazy.


>> Yeah.


>> His
 his
 comments
 on
 Friday
 was
 pretty


interesting.
 He
 said
 uh
 7,000
 is
 what
 he


thinks
 by
 end
 of
 year
 because
 there's


usually
 a
 4%
 average
 move
 in
 November


and
 December.
 But
 the
 amount
 of
 times


that
 the
 Federal
 Reserve
 has
 began
 to


cut
 rates
 in
 the
 year
 by
 September
 or


later
 usually
 has
 that
 end
 point
 of
 the


year
 actually
 uh
 closer
 to
 about
 a
 10%


run.
 It's
 only
 happened
 twice
 in
 the


last
 50
 years.
 So,
 um,
 he
 actually


thinks
 we
 could
 be
 as
 high
 as
 a
 10%


additional
 move
 or
 putting
 the


year-toate
 or
 or
 full
 year
 2025
 move
 on


the
 S&P
 500
 of
 around
 27%.


If
 that
 happens,
 like
 this
 is
 an


all-time
 bull
 market.
 I
 mean,
 that's
 a


2019
 run
 of
 the
 last
 decade
 only
 that


only
 2019
 has
 done
 better
 than
 that
 at


28%.
 You
 know,
 that
 that's
 doing
 better


than
 2021.


But
 oh,
 also
 that
 puts
 us
 at
 7,400
 and


something.


>> Yeah.


>> Yeah.
 I
 I
 I
 don't
 know
 that
 we
 get


there.
 There's
 not
 really
 a
 lot
 of
 time


left.
 Uh
 and
 there
 might
 be
 a
 little
 bit


of
 chop,
 but
 I
 mean
 it
 wouldn't
 be
 it


wouldn't
 be
 too
 too
 shocking
 at
 this


point.
 Like
 next
 year
 definitely
 seems


like
 it
 could
 be
 as
 long
 as
 a
 bull


market
 and
 macros
 intact.
 But
 yeah,
 I


think
 7,000
 is
 I
 mean
 nothing's


guaranteed,
 but
 it
 feels
 like
 7,000
 is


inevitable
 at
 this
 point.
 We
 just
 need
 a


few
 more
 days
 like
 today
 and
 uh
 it'll


compound.


>> Yeah,


>> today
 was
 a
 good
 day.
 Well,
 also
 there's


not
 that
 many
 times
 we've
 had,
 as
 Tanner


said,
 a
 rate
 cut
 into
 alltime
 highs.


That
 was
 back
 in
 2019ish,
 right?
 In


2018,
 it
 was
 the
 opposite.
 We
 were
 rate


hiking
 into
 a
 trade
 war.
 That's
 why
 2018


was
 Q4
 sucked
 so
 much.
 This
 is
 the


opposite.
 And
 if
 you
 guys
 have
 read


anything
 that
 China
 has
 been
 saying
 over


the
 past
 48
 hours,
 they've
 been
 very


friendly,
 like
 very
 amicable
 in
 terms
 of


now
 hopefully
 the
 Xi
 meeting
 ends
 up


leading
 to
 like
 some
 real
 real
 deals


which
 could
 be
 very
 bullish
 for
 Nvidia.


We
 can
 finally
 get
 these
 chips
 to
 China,


but
 I
 don't know
 the
 bare
 case.


October
 10th
 wasn't
 a
 bare
 case.
 Trump


and
 China
 beefing.
 I
 mean,
 it
 was
 the


single
 biggest
 day
 for
 inflows
 in
 stock


market
 history
 as
 per
 Bank
 of
 America.


So,
 no
 one
 really
 felt
 that
 was
 bearish.


Everyone
 was
 just
 like,
 "All
 right,


whatever.
 it's,
 you
 know,
 we
 have
 to


have
 a
 draw
 down.
 I'm
 wondering
 what
 is


that
 actual
 structural
 bare
 argument
 and


again
 it's
 just
 not
 the
 easiest
 to
 see


given
 the
 data
 that
 we
 have
 right
 now.


>> Yeah.
 And
 like
 the
 China
 softening
 it
 it


seemed
 like
 that
 that
 came
 uh
 right


around
 the
 same
 time
 where
 it
 was


beginning
 to
 be
 public
 knowledge
 about


trade
 deals
 in
 the
 region
 as
 well
 moving


forward.
 Of
 course,
 rare
 earth


agreements
 as
 well
 or
 potential
 ones.


And
 uh
 that's
 that's
 kind
 of
 why
 like


April
 was
 so
 shocking
 was
 it
 was
 like


trade
 war
 with
 everybody
 at
 the
 same


time
 which
 that
 doesn't
 work
 and
 it


worked
 out
 okay
 but
 uh
 like
 this
 is
 a


little
 bit
 different
 where
 United
 States


is
 like
 okay
 if
 you
 don't
 play
 ball


we'll
 figure
 it
 out.
 Um
 I
 so
 yeah
 I


think
 that
 we'll
 probably
 at least
 have


one
 more
 head
 fake
 before
 they
 actually


meet.
 Um,
 nothing
 settled,
 but
 uh
 I
 I


don't
 know.
 Uh,
 it's
 a
 that's
 a
 fun
 time


to
 be
 in
 the
 market.
 And
 are
 you
 fully
 I


know
 that
 Tanner
 you
 said
 that
 you're


fully
 invested.
 I'm
 like
 very
 close
 like


1%
 cash
 or
 something.
 Emit,
 are
 you


fully
 invested?


>> I
 have
 like
 two
 to
 3%
 right
 now.


A
 good
 chunk
 of
 this
 on
 buying
 this


freaking
 SoFi
 shares.
 So
 Tanner
 better


be
 right.
 We're
 going
 to
 talk
 about
 it.


You
 too,
 Roy.
 You
 can't
 get
 away
 from


it.
 His
 name
 is
 attached
 to
 you
 as
 well.


So


>> yeah.
 Yeah.
 No,
 I
 mean
 we've
 been
 right


like
 we
 we
 were
 pounding
 the
 table
 when


it
 was
 single
 digits.
 We
 talked
 to
 you


about
 the
 loan
 platform
 business
 and
 uh


yeah,
 it's
 it's
 nice
 that
 the
 market


actually
 appreciates
 something
 course
 is


moving
 after
 hours,
 too.
 So


me
 and
 you
 have
 been
 friends
 for
 a
 long


time.
 Um
 you
 know
 that
 I
 my
 conviction


on
 SoFi
 is
 not
 tied
 to
 the
 stock
 price.


I
 mean,
 I
 don't
 know
 what
 they're
 going


to
 do
 tomorrow,
 but
 I
 hope
 that


fundamentally
 that
 they
 outperform.


>> And
 I
 think
 people
 have
 enjoyed
 your


content
 for
 the
 past
 four
 years
 because


you've
 been
 very
 consistent
 saying,
 "I


don't
 care
 about
 the
 stock."
 Now,
 you


care
 about
 the
 stock,
 but
 you
 don't


care.


>> You
 care
 about
 the
 company's
 execution,


and
 the
 stock
 usually
 catches
 up
 to
 it.


>> I
 care
 about
 the
 stock
 on
 the
 long
 term,


but
 on
 a
 day-to-day
 basis,
 I
 mean,
 the


market's
 going
 to
 do
 what
 it's
 going
 to


do.


>> Yeah.


>> But,
 um,
 you
 were
 talking
 about
 rate


cuts.
 If
 you
 could
 bring
 up
 my
 screen


really
 quick,
 you've
 probably
 already


seen
 this
 tweet.
 Many
 of
 us
 have.
 But
 uh


since
 1980,
 the
 Fed
 had
 cut
 rates
 20


times
 while
 the
 S&P
 500
 was
 in
 within
 2%


of
 its
 all-time
 highs.
 100%
 of
 rate
 cuts


since
 1980
 within
 the
 S&P
 at
 record


highs
 led
 to
 more
 record
 highs
 12
 months


later.
 100%
 of
 times


um


obviously
 we're
 already
 seeing
 that
 new


highs,
 but
 uh
 do
 you
 think
 that
 that's


going
 to
 continue?
 I
 mean,
 history
 says


100%
 of
 times
 that
 it's
 usually
 a
 good


thing.
 And
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 continuous


rate
 cuts.
 That
 that
 was
 from
 the


original
 rate
 cut.
 Now
 we're
 about
 to


see
 two
 more.
 Original
 meaning


September.


Now
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 two
 more.
 Does


that
 sort
 of
 reset
 the
 100%
 rate
 cut


clock,
 you
 know,
 in
 order
 to
 see
 even


higher
 highs
 after
 Wednesday?
 Even


higher
 highs
 after
 December
 10th.
 When


is
 it?
 December
 10th.


So


I'm
 just,
 you
 know,
 statistics
 say
 that


that
 we
 should
 be
 very
 bullish
 right


now.


But
 then
 I
 mean
 there's
 so
 many
 charts


you
 can
 look
 at.
 You
 can
 emit
 can
 bring


up
 the
 the
 Buffett
 indicator
 and
 then


see
 why
 maybe
 we
 shouldn't
 be
 bullish.


But
 that's
 the
 hard
 part
 about
 markets.


That's
 why
 markets
 is
 not
 an
 easy
 game


is
 because
 there's
 a
 thousand
 different


data
 points
 and
 you
 could
 look
 at
 500
 of


them
 to
 point
 to
 bullish
 signs
 and
 500


of
 them
 to
 point
 to
 bearish
 signs
 and


you
 have
 to,
 you
 know,
 sort
 through
 the


crap.


Yeah,
 the
 the
 one
 thing
 that's
 like
 kind


of
 in
 the
 back
 of
 my
 mind,
 it
 it's
 not


changing
 like
 the
 way
 that
 I'm
 investing


with
 being
 very
 light
 on
 cash
 right
 now.


Um
 but
 uh
 if
 tariff
 uh
 woes
 are
 resolved


like
 they
 have
 an
 agreement
 with
 China


and
 everything
 market's
 going
 to
 pump.


It's
 going,
 you
 know,
 might
 frontr
 run


that
 as
 well.
 But
 uh
 I
 think
 that
 at


that
 point
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 other
 underlying


cracks
 and
 issues
 which
 some
 people
 have


been
 noting
 but
 by
 and
 large
 the
 market


has
 just
 completely
 ignored
 any


bearishness
 except
 for
 tariffs
 that's


maybe
 when
 it
 starts
 looking
 at
 other


issues
 as
 well.
 So
 government
 shutdown


being
 the
 the
 most
 pressing
 one
 but


there's
 several
 others
 out
 there
 too.
 So


it
 could
 be
 that
 you'll
 start
 seeing


headlines
 look
 very
 different
 uh
 if
 we


have
 an
 agreement
 uh
 and
 then
 there's
 a


pullback
 after
 that
 continuous
 alltime


it
 too.
 I'm
 not
 trying
 to
 time
 it.
 I
 I


think
 that's
 a
 mistake
 a
 lot
 of
 people


that
 are
 newer
 in
 the
 market,
 if
 you're


not
 a
 trader,
 try
 to
 do.
 And
 it's
 the
 I


don't
 know if
 it's
 Buffett
 or
 Lynch.
 One


of
 the
 old
 greats
 said
 uh
 time
 of
 time


in
 the
 market
 beats
 timing
 the
 market.


Uh
 and
 case
 in
 point
 today.


>> Yeah,
 I
 agree.
 And
 and
 I
 I
 I
 would
 love


for
 people
 in
 the
 chat
 to
 also
 give


their
 perspective
 here,
 but
 doesn't


everyone
 who
 is
 low
 on
 cash
 right
 now,


aka
 you're
 more
 fully
 invested
 than
 not.


I
 mean,
 don't
 you
 feel
 over
 the
 past


couple
 weeks,
 it
 has
 been
 healthier
 to


take
 advantage
 of
 the
 dip.
 It
 has
 not


been
 a
 clown
 market.
 It
 has
 not
 been


you're
 you're
 buying
 into
 crazy
 crazy


levels
 of
 FOMO
 or
 momentum.
 I
 know


there's
 pockets
 of
 that
 that
 are
 there


in
 the
 market,
 but
 it
 just
 feels
 a


little
 bit
 better
 after
 the
 three
 weeks


of
 pain,
 right?
 You
 got
 to
 go
 through


the
 pain
 to
 get
 the
 gains.
 And
 this
 S&P


500
 move
 from
 from
 673
 to
 647
 to
 685


feels
 way
 healthier
 than
 673
 to
 685.


And
 if
 that
 if
 that
 just
 happened
 in
 a


straight
 line
 up
 without
 getting
 rid
 of


some
 of
 the
 more
 fundamental
 structural


issues,
 I
 I I
 don't
 think
 we
 would
 have


been
 able
 to
 challenge
 our
 broader


assumptions
 of
 this
 bull
 market.
 And


again,
 the
 the
 market
 set
 up
 really
 well


for
 the
 companies
 that
 have
 executed
 on


earnings
 to
 continue
 proving
 why
 they


deserve
 a
 multiple.
 And
 if
 you
 don't,
 if


you
 don't
 prove
 it,
 you
 get
 you
 get
 your


stock
 gets
 hit.
 And
 and
 I
 think
 that's


okay.
 So,
 I
 don't
 know.
 I
 I
 feel
 like


I'm
 not
 buying
 into
 this
 crazy
 bull


market
 all-time
 highs
 and
 I'm
 scared


with
 the
 I'm
 happy
 to
 be
 very
 low
 on


cash.
 And
 I
 think
 by
 the
 end
 of
 the
 year


that,
 you
 know,
 that
 should
 be
 a
 good


decision
 as
 we
 keep
 going
 into
 it.


>> You
 got
 to
 have
 conviction
 on
 the
 things


you
 believe
 in.
 Like,
 and
 I've
 learned
 a


lot
 of
 that
 from
 you,
 Amit.
 Like,
 I
 just


got
 to
 keep
 doubling
 down
 on
 the
 things


that
 I
 believe
 in.
 Mhm.
 Yeah,
 stocks


tend
 to
 go
 higher
 over
 the
 long
 term.


Not
 individually.
 It's
 definitely
 uh


more
 more
 certain
 whenever
 you
 group


them
 in
 an
 index,
 but
 it
 is
 my
 belief


that
 this
 game
 is
 one
 that,
 you
 know,


actually
 generates
 money.
 And
 and
 I
 hope


everyone
 listening
 to
 that
 believes


that,
 or
 else
 you
 might
 be
 playing
 the


wrong
 game.
 But
 um


yeah,
 I
 I
 I
 actually
 just
 bought
 uh
 SoFi


today
 at
 $31
 in
 after
 hours.


>> Oh,
 this
 guy's
 bullish.


>> Alltime
 high.
 Hit
 the
 bid.


>> I
 was
 live,
 man.
 I
 had
 to.
 I
 was


pressured.
 I
 was
 pressured.


>> That's
 awesome.
 Love
 it.
 And
 And


honestly,
 like
 if
 if
 I
 again,
 if
 SoFi


was
 not
 the
 second
 largest
 position
 in


my
 portfolio,
 I
 wouldn't
 be
 I
 I
 would


probably
 be
 DCAing
 at
 this
 point.
 I


would
 be
 daing
 at
 this
 point.
 I
 don't


even
 need
 to
 say
 probably.
 So,


>> I
 I
 did
 that
 with
 Robin
 Hood.
 Um
 I
 I I


messed
 up
 a
 little
 bit
 in
 that
 the


transition,
 but
 I'm
 like,
 "Hey,
 I'm


going
 to
 rectify.
 I'm
 just
 going
 to
 DCA


until
 I
 get
 the
 position
 sizing
 that
 I


want."
 And
 I
 did.
 And
 it
 felt
 not
 great


at
 the
 time,
 you
 know,
 when
 it
 was
 like,


"Okay,
 a
 year
 ago
 it
 was
 at
 seven
 bucks


or
 eight
 bucks,
 nine
 bucks.
 Now
 I'm


buying
 in
 the
 the
 60s
 and
 70s."
 It
 feels


pretty
 good
 right
 now,
 though.


>> Okay.
 So,
 before
 we
 get
 into
 SoFi,
 let's


uh
 cover
 a
 couple
 of these
 quick
 topics.


So,
 do
 do
 you
 guys
 know
 what
 a
 closed


end
 fund
 is?


>> No.


>> Yes.


>> Okay.
 Tanner,
 please
 educate.
 I
 have
 no


idea.
 What
 What
 is
 this?
 And
 is
 this


bullish
 for
 Robin
 and
 now
 listening
 for


>> uh
 Well,
 I
 I
 this
 is
 I
 just
 I'm
 just


seeing
 this
 news.
 So,
 what
 is
 this?
 You


can
 now
 invest
 in
 nearly
 200
 US
 listed


close-end
 funds
 on
 dude.


>> I
 know
 SoFi
 earnings
 are
 tomorrow,
 but


are
 you
 are
 you
 just
 not
 keeping
 up
 with


any
 of
 the
 Robin
 Hood
 update?
 Like,
 are


you
 bad?
 Are
 you
 the
 freaking
 title
 of


your
 live
 stream
 is
 like
 was
 the
 night


before
 sofi
 like
 it's
 freaking


Christmas.
 You're
 not
 caring
 about
 Robin


Hood
 at
 all.
 You
 just
 like


>> Vlad
 tweeted
 it.
 Vlad
 tweeted
 it.
 Have


that
 on
 notifications.
 Pop
 it
 up
 anytime


he
 says
 something.
 Come
 on.


>> This
 guy's
 fake,
 bro.


>> I
 I
 didn't
 see
 it.
 I
 saw
 that.
 Did
 you


guys
 see
 that
 they
 uh
 put
 out
 futures


for
 UK
 customers?


>> Okay.
 I
 didn't
 see
 that


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 That's


what
 I
 mean.


>> Get
 off
 X
 and
 actually
 go
 to
 their
 press


releases
 one
 time.
 Uh,
 okay.
 So,
 um,
 I


didn't
 see
 that.
 What
 it
 sounds,
 I
 don't


know
 what
 the
 the
 close-end
 funds
 are,


but
 essentially
 it
 just
 means
 that


there's
 a
 certain
 amount
 of
 outstanding


shares.
 That
 that's
 all
 that
 that
 means


that
 they're
 not
 recreating
 new
 shares.


Um,
 so
 essentially
 that
 that
 for
 every,


you
 know,
 share
 that's
 outstanding,


there
 needs
 to
 be
 a
 buyer
 of
 it.
 So,
 if


you
 end
 up
 putting
 money
 into
 that
 fund,


new
 buyers
 drive
 the
 price
 up
 rather


than
 them
 creating
 new
 um
 shares
 in


order
 to
 keep
 the
 price
 stable,
 like
 a


stable
 coin,
 for
 example.


>> Um


>> I'm
 not
 going
 to
 lie,
 it's
 not
 because


of
 your
 explanation,
 but
 I
 still
 have
 no


clue
 what
 a
 clos
 my
 explanation
 sucks,


but
 it
 just
 it
 just
 means
 that
 there's
 a


certain
 amount
 like
 closing
 fund
 just


means
 that
 there's
 a
 certain
 amount
 of


outstanding
 shares
 and
 that


>> But
 are
 these
 like
 mutual
 funds
 or
 like


why?


>> They
 can
 be
 of
 them
 coming
 on
 Robinet


like
 what's


>> at
 least
 the
 way
 that
 I
 know
 of
 it
 a


closen
 fund
 can
 be
 a
 mutual
 fund
 but


they're
 not
 mutually
 exclusive
 there


could
 be
 multiple
 different
 versions
 of


what
 a
 close-end
 fund
 is
 but
 um
 you
 know


that
 can
 be
 yeah
 Robin
 Hood
 Ventures


that
 could
 be
 private
 equity
 that
 could


be
 like
 there's
 a
 ton
 of
 closend
 funds


it
 just
 means
 that
 there's
 a
 certain


amount
 that
 they're
 not
 going
 to
 issue


new
 shares
 there's
 only
 a
 certain
 amount


of
 shares
 that's
 in
 that's
 the
 closed


Okay.
 Well,


>> as
 Curtis
 said,
 they
 won't
 dilute.
 It's


just
 a
 certain
 amount
 of
 shares.


>> So,
 this
 is
 at least
 I
 I
 have
 like
 a


very
 very
 limited
 understanding
 of
 this.


So,
 um
 releasing
 400
 of
 these,
 this


isn't
 like
 a
 oh
 man,
 this
 is
 amaz
 It's


another
 nice
 ad.
 Uh
 is
 that
 how
 you


would
 see
 it,
 Tanner,
 or


>> Well,
 it
 I
 don't
 know
 what
 the
 funds


are.
 So,
 so
 to
 me
 this
 sounds
 like
 some


version
 of
 they
 are
 adding
 mutual
 funds,


but
 in
 Canada
 we
 would
 say
 that
 you're


adding
 400
 mutual
 funds,
 but


to
 me
 this
 sounds
 like
 a
 difference
 of


of
 the
 way,
 you
 know,
 US
 companies
 are


wording
 it
 versus
 what
 I
 know,
 which
 is


can,
 you
 know,
 we
 wouldn't
 say,
 hey,


these
 are
 closed
 end
 funds
 for
 purchase.


That's
 just
 like
 the
 the
 characteristic


of
 a
 certain
 fund.
 So
 to
 me,
 I
 don't


even
 really
 know.


>> It's
 not
 a
 noun.
 It's
 almost
 like
 an


adjective
 to
 an
 extent
 of
 what
 the
 fund


>> Yeah.
 Like
 like
 the
 fund
 can
 be
 a
 closed


end
 fund,


>> right?


>> Okay.


>> Yeah.
 Here's
 that
 other
 announcement
 by


the
 way.
 Robin
 Hood
 launches
 futures.


It's
 kind
 of
 interesting
 that
 we
 haven't


seen
 ISIS
 and
 SIPs
 yet
 unless
 I've


missed
 those.
 Um
 I
 thought
 that
 they


were
 supposed
 to
 come
 out
 this
 year.


There's
 still
 some
 time
 left,
 but
 yeah.


>> Yeah.
 I
 I
 don't
 think
 they
 fully
 have


those
 yet.
 But
 look,
 futures
 trading
 is


good.
 I
 I
 I
 do
 think
 UK
 customers
 want
 a


lot
 of
 other
 things
 right
 now
 besides


futures
 trading
 but
 it
 is
 good
 to
 uh
 to


see
 that
 out
 there.
 Uh
 someone
 says
 so


here
 are
 you
 betting
 that
 the
 underlying


assets
 of
 the
 fund
 but
 on
 how
 the


portfolio
 is
 being
 managed?
 That's
 my


understanding
 of
 it
 as
 well.
 Like
 to
 me


it's
 just
 mutual
 funds
 that
 are
 managed


in
 a
 particular
 way
 like
 like
 Vanguard,


Fidelity,
 they
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 I
 a
 lot


of
 people
 don't
 leave
 those
 platforms
 to


Robin
 Hood
 because
 you
 can't
 transfer


your
 your
 funds
 uh
 because
 they're


proprietary
 to
 those
 brokerages.


>> Closing
 funds
 are
 almost
 like
 they're


almost
 non-existent.
 I
 mean
 for
 the
 most


part
 all
 the
 money
 is
 in
 open-end
 funds.


If
 you
 want
 to
 go
 out
 and
 buy
 an
 index


fund,
 for
 example,
 which
 is
 an
 open-end


fund,
 you
 buy
 at
 the,
 you
 know,
 QQQ
 or


whatever,
 and
 then
 they
 take
 your
 money


and
 go
 and
 buy
 those
 funds.
 Okay?
 They


they they
 buy
 the
 underlying
 assets.
 But


a
 closedend
 fund
 is
 like
 that
 fund
 will


go
 up
 because
 there's
 more
 buying


pressure
 than
 there
 is
 selling
 pressure.


>> So,


>> they're
 actually
 really
 not
 common.


>> Yeah,
 that's
 fair.
 uh
 it's
 another
 asset


to
 the
 platform
 but
 it's
 not
 the
 biggest


deal
 in
 the
 world.
 So
 you
 had
 that
 you


had
 Robin
 Hood
 uh
 UK
 futures
 for


uh
 for
 customers
 which
 was
 nice
 and
 then


the
 the
 other
 final
 update
 is
 uh
 look


banking
 is
 not
 officially
 out
 yet
 but


people
 are
 getting
 a
 preview
 of
 it.
 Some


of
 you
 guys
 in
 the
 chat
 might
 have


gotten
 a
 preview
 of
 banking
 and
 uh
 from


the
 pictures
 that
 we've
 seen
 they're


giving
 you
 a
 basically
 3.75%
 APY
 if
 you


set
 up
 direct
 deposit.
 So
 I
 guess
 the


broader
 question
 here,
 Roy,
 we'll
 start


with
 you,
 is
 do
 we
 think
 2026,
 the
 big


product
 outside
 of
 Cortex
 is
 going
 to
 be


banking?


>> Probably
 not.
 Um,
 that's
 still
 probably


going
 to
 be
 predictions
 market.
 Banking


is
 massive,
 too.
 Um,
 of
 course,
 their


continued
 international
 roll
 out
 of
 not


just
 uh
 their
 trading
 suite,
 but
 also


predictions
 market
 potentially,
 that's


going
 to
 be
 significant.
 And
 knowing


Robin
 Hood,
 there's
 probably
 stuff
 that


doesn't
 even
 exist
 yet
 that's
 going
 to


be
 massive,
 too.
 It's
 just
 a
 ridiculous


company.
 So,
 um,
 but
 you
 know,
 I
 I
 would


rank
 probably
 predictions
 market
 as
 a


number
 one
 there
 um
 for
 continued
 growth


at
 least
 into
 as
 they
 continue
 to


expand.
 That's
 massive.


>> Tanner,
 your
 thoughts
 on
 uh
 you
 think


banking
 is
 going
 to
 be
 a
 game
 changer


next
 year?


>> Yes,
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 game
 changer.


Um,
 I
 I
 just
 think
 the
 amount
 of
 new


products
 and
 direct
 deposit
 and


cross-ell
 and
 all
 the
 like
 the
 magical


benefits
 that
 we
 saw
 from
 SoFi
 could
 be


replicated
 at
 Robin
 Hood.
 And
 then
 on


top
 of
 that,
 I
 mean,
 they
 could
 go


international
 with
 this
 and
 partner
 with


those
 local
 banks
 there
 to
 custody
 the


the
 deposits.


I
 just
 think
 banking
 is
 is
 a
 big
 deal.


you
 know
 what
 what's
 a
 bigger
 well


actually
 that's
 not
 a
 great
 comparison


but
 there
 is
 a
 lot
 of
 very
 big
 banking


businesses
 versus
 brokerage
 businesses


having
 both
 in
 one
 is
 a
 very
 good
 you


know
 combination


>> do
 you
 think
 it's
 a
 bigger
 deal
 uh
 next


year
 as
 far
 as
 uh
 being
 accreative
 to


revenue
 um
 than
 predictions
 market
 or


are
 you
 just
 saying
 long-term
 like
 it's


a
 significant
 deal


>> oh
 sorry
 maybe
 I
 didn't
 hear
 the
 yeah
 no


prediction
 markets
 might
 take
 it
 next


year
 just
 because
 it
 already
 has


significant
 demand
 and
 it's
 going
 to


blow
 up.
 But
 uh
 over
 time,
 I
 think
 it'll


also
 be
 hard
 to
 see
 the
 the
 quality
 like


what
 banking
 means
 because
 I
 don't
 think


it's
 just
 the
 revenue.
 I
 think
 it's


>> like
 what
 does
 the
 stickiness
 of
 a
 user


that's
 coming
 back
 to
 check
 their


product
 every
 day?
 Like
 how
 much
 more
 do


they
 invest?
 How
 much
 more
 do
 they
 use


their
 credit
 card?
 How
 much
 more
 do
 they


use
 everything
 else
 if
 they
 bank
 there


and
 check
 their
 app
 every
 day?
 like
 so


it'll
 be
 hard
 to
 determine
 how
 much


banking
 is
 putting
 on
 the
 business
 but
 I


think
 it's
 very
 important.


>> Yeah,
 I
 agree.
 Um,
 okay,
 last
 topic
 on


Robin
 Hood
 is
 uh
 prediction
 markets.
 Uh,


first
 of
 all,
 I
 I
 got
 to
 I
 got
 to
 get


something
 to
 show
 you
 guys
 real
 quick.


So,
 I'll
 be
 back
 in
 a
 second.
 But,
 uh,


Roy,
 I'm
 going
 to
 throw
 this
 question
 to


you.
 Do
 you
 feel
 any
 issue
 with


prediction
 markets
 given
 the
 NBA
 scandal


and
 the
 betting
 controversy
 and
 you
 know


ESPN
 is
 advertising
 with
 FanDuel
 but


then
 they're
 having
 to
 talk
 about
 this


whole
 gambling
 controversy.
 Do
 you
 think


it's
 any
 issue
 for
 the
 broader
 health
 of


prediction
 markets
 or
 cost
 is
 raising
 at


five
 billion
 polyark
 raising
 at
 12


billion
 no
 one
 cares
 everyone's
 just


ready
 to
 continue
 this
 betting
 future


that
 we're
 in.
 Yeah,
 I
 I
 think
 that


there's
 um
 some
 regulatory
 uh
 regulator


uh
 clarification
 that's
 needed.
 The
 nice


thing
 is
 uh
 most
 aspects
 of
 the
 Trump


administration,
 I
 don't
 know
 about
 this,


I
 can't
 remember
 the
 um
 four-letter


acronym
 that
 that
 um
 they
 have
 for
 um


for
 the
 betting
 uh
 side
 of
 things,
 but


uh
 they
 actually
 instead
 of
 uh
 enforcing


and
 just
 slapping
 everybody
 with
 fines,


they're
 actually
 doing
 a
 decent
 job,


especially
 with
 crypto.
 And
 this
 is


related
 to
 crypto
 of
 saying
 okay
 these


are
 the
 regulations
 and
 guidelines
 and


of
 course
 bringing
 a
 lot
 of
 market


leaders
 to
 the
 table.
 Koshi
 uh
 was
 a


really
 smart
 partnership
 with
 Robin
 Hood


uh
 and
 of
 course
 maybe
 in
 hindsight
 they


should
 have
 bought
 him
 out
 or
 whatever


but
 uh
 given
 the
 connection
 of
 course
 to


the
 Trump
 administration
 on
 the
 board
 of


Kowi
 uh
 and
 some
 early
 success
 as
 it


relates
 to
 some
 of
 those
 state
 uhwide
 uh


specific
 lawsuits.
 It's
 hard
 for
 me
 to


see
 the
 predictions
 markets
 not
 doing


well.
 Fact,
 of
 course,
 FanDuels
 and


Draftkings
 have
 now
 shifted
 away
 from


saying,
 "Hey,
 predictions
 markets
 are
 a


joke
 to
 we're
 not
 going
 to
 do
 them
 to
 uh


we're
 going
 to
 die.


>> You
 have
 to
 buy
 a
 competitor
 to


compete."


>> Yeah.
 So,
 uh
 I
 I
 mean,
 and
 Robin
 Hood,


like
 the
 nice
 thing
 about
 Robin
 Hood
 is


uh
 not
 going
 to
 rehash
 the
 argument
 as


far
 as
 like
 separate
 apps
 and
 stuff,
 but


the
 money
 is
 already
 there
 and
 it
 makes


it
 so
 much
 easier.
 There's
 so
 much
 less


friction
 when
 you're
 like
 money's
 there


or
 margin.
 If
 you're
 using
 margin,
 be


careful
 with
 margin,
 guys.
 But,
 you


know,
 it's
 there.
 It's
 easy
 to
 use.
 Uh,


and
 um,
 so
 yeah,
 this
 has
 blown
 up


massively
 and
 it's
 just
 here
 in
 the


United
 States.
 There
 will
 be
 more


competition
 anytime
 that
 there's
 a


massive
 gold
 rush
 like
 this.
 There's
 a


lot
 more
 competitors
 coming
 in,
 but
 it


it
 is
 hard
 to
 carve
 up
 market
 share,


especially
 if
 your
 money
 is
 not
 already


on
 the
 platform.
 Uh,
 so
 it's
 it's
 a


layup
 I
 think
 for
 Robin
 Hood.


>> Tanner,
 any
 thoughts
 on
 DraftKings


having
 to
 basically
 acknowledge
 that


they
 can't
 succeed
 without
 these


prediction
 markets?
 Yeah,
 I
 think
 it's


going
 to
 be
 a
 massive
 I
 mean
 the
 stock


has
 already
 taken
 a
 massive
 blow,
 but
 I


just
 don't
 know
 the
 reason
 for
 using


their
 traditional


like
 like
 the
 uh
 I
 I
 don't
 know
 the
 name


of
 how
 like
 the
 odds
 based
 uh
 betting.


The
 spreads
 are
 extremely
 weird,


non-transparent.
 You
 can't
 exit
 before


um
 they
 finish
 without
 some
 weird
 like,


you
 know,
 prompt
 to
 say,
 "Hey,
 do
 you


want
 to
 take
 this
 and
 go?"
 I
 the


prediction
 markets
 just
 work
 so
 much


better.
 It's
 way
 cheaper.
 It's
 live
 in


real
 time.


>> There's
 instant
 liquidity.


>> Instant
 liquidity.


And
 and
 there's
 zero
 limit
 to
 what
 this


could
 be
 put
 on.
 I
 I I
 think
 prediction


markets
 are
 going
 to
 be
 massively


popular.
 Like
 I
 think
 the
 way
 that
 you


know
 people
 talk
 about
 stable
 coins


like,
 oh,
 this
 market's
 going
 to
 25x


over
 the
 next
 few
 years.
 I
 think


prediction
 markets
 are
 going
 to
 25x
 over


the
 next
 few
 years.
 like
 I
 think
 we're


seeing
 the
 early
 early
 days
 of
 what


prediction
 markets
 mean.


So,
 um
 I'm
 happy
 that
 that
 Robin
 Hood
 is


getting
 in
 early.


>> I
 I
 read
 a
 a
 really
 fascinating
 article.


I
 I'll
 have
 to
 dig
 that
 up
 and
 uh
 send


back
 to
 you
 guys,
 but
 u
 one
 aspect
 that


I
 also
 think
 tends
 to
 mean
 the


predictions
 market's
 here
 to
 stay.
 Well,


I
 guess
 two
 really
 is
 you
 can
 see
 that


it's
 being
 used
 as
 the
 source
 of
 truth
 a


lot
 more
 so
 than
 polls
 when
 it
 relates


to
 elections.
 And
 I
 I
 think
 that
 that


is,
 you
 know,
 there
 will
 be
 times
 when


it
 gets
 when
 it
 things
 are
 not
 correct,


but
 the
 wisdom
 of
 the
 crowd
 has
 proven


quite
 effective
 in
 that.
 And
 the
 other


is
 we're
 in
 the
 age
 of
 AI.
 And
 this
 this


piece
 that
 I'd
 read,
 um
 I
 I
 think
 it
 was


Sean
 Taylor.
 Anyway,
 regardless,
 he


said,
 you
 know,
 in
 the
 age
 of
 AI,
 it's


harder
 to
 determine
 what's
 actually


real,
 what's
 accurate,
 what's
 not
 just


AI
 slop
 that's
 reading
 AI
 slop
 and


giving
 you
 answers
 that
 are
 not
 true.


And
 so
 this
 as
 a
 predictions
 market
 has


even
 more
 value.
 Vlad
 was
 saying
 this


earlier
 by
 the
 way
 just
 because
 you
 can


look
 at
 the
 wisdom
 of
 the
 crowd.
 It's


not
 AIS
 or
 algorithms
 at least
 yet
 here


betting
 or
 doing
 much
 of
 that.
 And
 so


this
 is
 uh
 a
 valuable
 source
 of
 truth
 uh


for
 a
 lot
 of
 people.
 Um
 I
 actually
 look


at
 that
 oftentimes
 if
 I
 if
 I
 want
 to


know
 how
 something
 might
 turn
 out,
 I'm


tending
 to
 look
 at
 a
 predictions
 market


an
 awful
 lot.
 So
 I
 actually
 like
 having


that
 feature
 right
 there.


>> I
 do
 like
 it.
 And
 also
 just
 the
 way
 that


these
 markets
 should
 work,
 especially


ones
 like
 Poly
 Market
 that
 are
 built
 on


chain,
 that
 just
 means
 you
 can
 have
 one


pool
 of
 liquidity
 that
 is
 completely


global.


>> Yeah.
 like
 it's
 the
 same
 betters
 if
 if


we're
 talking
 about
 any
 prediction
 or


whatever
 uh
 UFC
 to
 to
 who's
 going
 to
 be


on
 the
 Joe
 Rogan
 Experience
 or
 on
 the


Emit
 show
 or
 or
 whatever
 is
 in
 the


future


from
 China
 to
 Russia
 to
 Canada
 to


Mexico.
 That's
 a
 lot
 of
 uh
 a
 lot
 of


trading.
 And
 just
 inherently
 since
 the


beginning
 of
 time,
 humans
 are
 gamblers.


Like
 we
 just
 freaking
 love
 it,
 dude.


Since
 the
 beginning
 of
 time,


gambling
 is
 a
 thing.


You're
 right.
 And
 the
 Kali
 guy
 was
 on
 a


Citadel
 interview
 and
 he
 basically
 said


like
 people
 want
 to
 make
 a
 prediction


out
 of
 everything
 and
 that's
 only
 going


to
 increase
 as
 people
 want
 other
 sources


of
 truth.
 I
 mean
 like
 I
 really
 this


market
 should
 be
 multi-billions
 of


dollars
 of
 revenue
 over
 the
 next
 10


years
 for
 hood.
 Uh
 they
 just
 got
 to
 keep


expanding
 it
 and
 they're
 adding
 they


have
 added
 800
 prediction
 markets
 over


the
 past
 I
 think
 three
 weeks.
 that
 was


at
 like
 200
 back
 in
 September.
 So,
 it's


not
 like
 they're
 stopping
 on
 this
 as


well.
 Um,
 okay.
 Before
 we
 move
 on
 to


SoFi,
 I
 do
 want
 to
 give
 a
 shout
 out
 to


our
 boy
 Nate,
 who
 is
 an
 OG


hoodie.
 He
 just
 sent
 me
 this
 today.
 This


was
 from
 the
 Summit.


>> Oh
 my
 god.


>> Nice.


>> It's
 so
 awesome,
 bro.
 It
 was
 It
 was
 a
 It


was
 a
 birthday
 gift,
 but
 also
 it's
 uh
 it


was
 a
 present
 from
 him.
 I
 actually
 got


to
 meet
 him
 in
 New
 York
 the
 other
 day


because
 he
 came
 through.
 Are
 you
 able
 to


say
 which
 one
 Nate
 is


>> or
 did
 he
 say
 not
 to?


>> I
 don't
 think
 he
 cares.
 He's
 he's
 public


on
 Twitter,
 but
 Nate
 is
 all
 the
 way
 to


the
 left,
 my
 left,
 maybe
 other
 people's


right.


>> And
 then
 you
 got
 Chris,
 Roy,
 Tanner,


myself,
 Davis,
 his
 friend
 Josh,
 and
 then


Kareem.


>> So,
 this
 is
 super
 cool.
 Super
 super


cool.
 Thank
 you
 to
 Nate
 for
 sending


this.
 I
 will
 be
 hanging
 it
 up
 in
 the


back
 at
 some
 point.
 So,
 there
 you
 go.
 By


the
 way,
 Nate,
 okay,
 this
 is
 actually
 a


good
 segue
 going
 into
 SoFi.
 So,
 I
 I
 had


dinner
 with
 Nate
 a
 week
 ago
 and
 uh
 he's


like
 hood
 forever.
 Like,
 he
 is
 bold
 up


hood.
 So,
 I
 said,
 "Well,
 what
 do
 you


think
 about
 SoFi?"


He
 was
 just
 like,
 "Dude,


they
 are
 not
 going
 to
 even
 come
 close
 to


doing
 what
 Robin
 like
 he
 is
 so
 bearish


on."
 So,
 and
 I
 I
 tried
 to
 reason.
 I


really
 But
 they're
 growing.
 He's
 like,


"But
 what
 are
 they
 doing?
 It's
 a
 bank.


Like,
 what
 are
 they
 like
 why
 are
 people


like
 what's
 going
 on
 here?"
 like
 they


have
 no
 shot.
 So,
 I
 think
 that's
 a
 good


segue
 into
 SoFi
 tomorrow
 because
 look,
 I


bought
 in.
 I'm
 excited
 for
 the
 earnings.


I
 do
 think
 there's
 a
 shot
 for
 35
 stocks


at
 31
 overnight.
 I
 think
 we'll
 start
 off


with
 you,
 Tanner.
 Why
 do
 you
 think


there's
 a
 chance
 this
 company
 could


really
 make
 a
 move
 tomorrow
 on
 earnings?


>> Why
 do
 I
 think
 SoFi
 um
 I
 mean
 it's
 up


112%.
 Why
 should
 Why
 are
 people
 Dude,


people
 are
 more
 excited
 for
 SoFi
 than


Nvidia
 earnings
 if
 you
 look
 on
 Twitter.


like
 or
 bold
 up
 on
 this
 one.


>> I
 I
 I
 think
 that
 um


yeah,


I
 just
 think
 that
 there's
 not
 a
 segment


of
 their
 business
 that's
 not
 primed
 to


do
 well.
 If
 you
 go
 through
 the
 list,


checking
 and
 savings,
 brokerage,
 credit


cards,
 uh
 personal
 loans,
 student
 loans,


home
 loans,
 the
 tech
 platform
 just


signed
 two
 huge
 deals.


um
 what
 part
 of
 their
 business
 is
 not


doing
 well
 and
 and
 it's
 not
 just
 SoFi


inherent,
 it's
 like
 the
 industries
 are


doing
 well.
 You
 know,
 personal
 loan


lenders,
 uh
 home
 loan
 lenders,


brokerages,
 credit
 card
 businesses,


they're
 all
 doing
 well.
 So
 in
 every


single
 one
 of
 them,
 um
 so
 I
 don't
 think


they're
 I'm
 not


>> expect
 Why
 Why
 is
 none
 of
 that
 priced


in,
 I
 guess,
 is
 the
 broader
 question.


Well,
 I
 think
 that
 there's
 just
 an


inherent
 um,


you
 know,
 fear
 of
 SoFi
 because
 it's
 a


cyclical
 business.
 But
 if
 they
 end
 up


putting
 up
 the
 growth
 that
 some
 some


Wall
 Street
 analysts
 are
 expecting,


they're
 going
 to
 put
 up
 a
 40%


year-over-year
 growth
 rate
 at
 the


highest
 margin
 that
 they've
 ever
 seen.


That
 is
 crazy.
 Like
 40%
 is
 not
 easy
 to


put
 up,
 right?
 And
 that's
 coming
 off
 of


the
 back
 of
 many
 quarters
 that
 have
 Oh,


and
 by
 the
 way,
 on
 a
 really
 good
 comp


last
 Q3
 was
 really
 good.
 That
 was
 the
 LA


that
 was
 the
 first
 quarter
 that
 we
 saw


the
 loan
 platform
 business.
 So,
 it's
 40%


year-over-year
 growth,
 highest
 margin
 on


a
 good
 comp.
 And
 um
 it's
 accelerating


their
 growth
 rate


like
 Palunteer,
 not
 not
 not
 at
 the
 same


degree.
 Okay,
 this
 is
 this
 is
 baby
 baby.


But


if
 you
 start
 compounding
 growth
 rates


more
 and
 more
 faster
 and
 faster,
 you
 let


um
 Wall
 Street
 and
 retail
 investors
 sort


of
 you
 let
 their
 imaginations
 run
 wild


about
 what
 they
 can
 do
 now
 that
 they


actually
 have
 some
 tailwinds.
 So,
 I


think
 people
 are
 getting
 excited
 about


Q4
 because
 now
 they're
 putting
 up
 even


higher
 uh
 downloads
 that,
 you
 know,


could
 lead
 to
 potentially
 even
 a
 better


quarter
 than
 Q3
 in
 Q4.
 So,
 people
 are,


you
 know,
 pulling
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 that


excitement
 into
 next
 year
 if
 we
 continue


to
 see
 rate
 cuts.
 It
 just
 looks
 like,


you
 know,
 going
 forward
 that
 they're


going
 to
 continuously
 have
 quite
 a
 good


time.
 I
 mean,
 Robin
 Hood
 very
 similar,


right?
 Like,
 if
 you're
 not
 expecting
 a


slowdown,
 you're
 going
 to
 give
 them
 a


premium
 for
 just
 continuous
 execution.


They've
 never
 not
 triple
 beat
 that.


That's
 got
 to
 be
 worth
 something.


>> Hasn't
 been
 in
 the
 past,
 but
 but
 yeah,


it's
 this
 earnings
 is
 going
 to
 be


special.
 Um
 we
 know
 I
 mean
 like


eventually
 maybe
 they
 won't
 triple
 B.


This
 isn't
 going to
 be
 that
 earnings.
 Uh


we
 look
 at
 analyst
 expectations,
 they


keep
 raising
 them,
 they're
 still
 too


low.
 Last
 quarter,
 like
 Tanner
 said,
 it


was
 against
 a
 weak
 comp.
 This
 time
 it's


not.
 and
 we're
 right
 around
 40%
 as
 far


as
 our
 predictions
 uh
 for
 revenue


growth.
 It's
 tough
 for
 the
 it's
 the


market
 didn't
 ignore
 it
 last
 quarter.
 It


ran
 up
 and
 of
 course
 they
 did
 that


dilution
 immediately
 right
 after
 which


kind
 of
 killed
 the
 momentum
 but
 it
 was


not
 ignoring
 SoFi
 earnings
 which
 was
 a


big
 shift.
 This
 one
 basically
 doing
 what


they
 did
 last
 quarter
 again
 against
 a


strong
 comp
 is
 highly
 meaningful.
 What


is
 it
 pricing?
 Now
 rate
 cuts
 are


probably
 priced
 in
 or
 at least
 a
 good


number
 of
 them.
 uh
 banks
 have
 shifted


from
 a
 banking
 charter
 banking
 license


being
 an
 actual
 drag
 on
 a
 business
 or
 at


least
 it
 was
 perceived
 that
 way
 for
 SoFi


that
 they
 were
 saying
 is
 less
 valuable


because
 they
 obtained
 a
 banking
 license


which
 was
 the
 dumbest
 argument
 ever
 but


bears
 made
 that
 uh
 we're
 like
 oh
 it


should
 be
 trading
 at
 price
 of
 tangible


book
 value
 unlike
 before
 when
 it
 was


when
 they
 didn't
 have
 this
 like
 okay


whatever
 not
 doing
 that
 anymore
 uh


people
 understand
 that
 I'm
 I'm
 a
 little


bit
 more
 bearish
 on
 the
 tech
 platform


than
 Tanner
 uh
 but
 uh
 what's
 really
 did


not
 price
 in
 I
 think
 as
 a
 loan
 platform


business.
 We're
 entering
 an
 environment


where
 there
 continue
 to
 have
 rate
 cut


after
 rate
 cut
 as
 well.
 Um
 demand
 is


very
 high
 for
 these
 products
 and
 other


than
 with
 some
 very
 uh
 specific
 types
 of


lending
 that
 SoFi
 doesn't
 even
 do
 uh


delinquencies
 seem
 fine.
 The
 consumer


seems
 healthy
 and
 now
 you're
 in
 an


environment
 where
 like
 even
 Mr.
 Beast


applied
 for
 a
 banking
 license.
 like
 this


is
 you're
 you're
 seeing
 a
 lot
 of


companies
 that
 said
 that
 they
 would


never
 want
 a
 banking
 license
 apply.
 So


you're
 as
 far
 as
 regulation,
 you've


shifted
 all
 all
 the
 way
 from
 seeing
 it


as
 a
 liability
 to
 an
 excellent
 uh
 asset.


Uh
 rate
 cuts
 are
 coming
 in
 and
 they
 only


really
 have
 the
 personal
 loans
 in
 the


platform
 business
 at
 any
 point
 and
 I


expect
 that
 they
 will
 in
 the
 future.


They
 may
 even
 this
 earnings
 as
 well
 spin


off
 additional
 products
 as
 there's


demand
 on
 the
 loan
 platform
 business.
 um


there
 is
 a
 lot
 of
 growth
 that
 they
 can


do
 and
 that
 the
 nice
 thing
 is
 his
 growth


that's
 it's
 at
 a
 uh
 that's
 not
 capped
 as


long
 as
 there's
 demand
 there
 like


they're
 not
 capital
 constrained
 at
 all.


So
 very
 well
 positioned
 over
 the
 next


couple
 of
 years
 um
 it's
 at
 an
 all-time


high
 it
 doesn't
 feel
 crazy
 at
 all.
 So,


so
 25
 or
 35
 you
 have
 to
 bet.
 If
 you
 have


to
 make
 a
 prediction
 market


one


>> to
 tomorrow
 or
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 year
 or


tomorrow


>> 35


>> 35


>> Tanner
 wants
 to
 say
 40.
 He's
 being


>> No,
 no,
 no.
 I
 I
 I
 I


think
 my
 prediction
 for
 tomorrow
 is


3150.


Um,
 so
 I'm
 I'm
 not


>> I
 think
 it
 I
 think
 it'll
 be
 very


>> 3151


to
 be
 honest.
 It's
 funny
 that
 we
 ended


up
 in
 the
 same
 ballpark
 to
 be
 honest.


>> You
 know
 what's
 actually
 funny?
 I
 think


that
 actually
 was
 my
 price
 target.
 It


was
 3151
 because
 Tevis's
 was
 3150.
 So
 we


we
 have
 the
 same


>> I
 like
 3152.
 I'm
 upgrading
 my


>> mine
 is
 33
 just
 because
 multiples
 of
 11.


You
 have
 to
 do
 it
 with
 SoFi
 price


targets.
 Yeah,


>> that
 would
 be
 a
 10%
 move
 on
 earnings,


which
 last
 last
 quarter,
 so
 this
 is
 the


problem.
 Last
 quarter,
 I
 think
 we
 were


up
 16
 or
 17%
 at
 one
 point,
 but
 then
 at


the
 end
 of
 the
 day
 it
 closed
 up
 six.


So,
 we
 skyrocketed
 and
 then
 throughout


the
 day
 there
 was
 a
 bunch
 of,
 you
 know,


profit
 taking.
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 that
 this


will
 be
 something
 like
 this,
 but
 yeah.


And
 I
 wish
 I
 had
 prediction
 markets


because
 the
 the
 the
 chance
 that
 they


beat
 8
 cents
 of
 EPS.
 I
 don't
 know
 what


it's
 at
 now
 on
 Poly
 Market,
 but
 earlier


it
 was
 like
 80%.
 I
 watched
 whenever
 that


market
 opened
 up
 and
 it
 was
 holding
 at


50
 and
 I'm
 like,
 man,
 what
 an
 easy
 way


for
 me
 to
 double
 my
 money.
 Currently,


Wall
 Street
 actually
 changed
 their
 price


target.
 It's
 now
 9.
 So,
 Wall
 Street


thinks
 they're
 going
 to
 beat
 this


freaking
 poly
 market
 thing.
 And
 they're


bearish
 on
 SoFi.


So,


like
 I'm
 not
 I'm
 not
 incentivizing


anyone
 to
 buy
 this.
 I
 just
 thought
 for


me,
 what
 a
 way
 to
 buy
 this.
 I
 was


looking
 at
 it
 at
 50
 uh
 at
 50%.
 But
 it's


not
 open
 in
 my
 country.
 We
 don't
 really


have
 the,
 you
 know,
 poly
 market
 yet.


>> Also,
 remember,
 didn't
 last
 time
 they


dilute
 on
 earnings?


>> Yeah.


>> That's
 what
 really
 messed
 up
 the
 like
 if


we
 don't
 get
 any
 of
 that,
 maybe
 it's


it's
 blue
 skies.
 But
 that
 that
 happened


after
 close
 of
 the
 day.
 So
 that's
 not


why
 the
 company
 got
 dragged
 down.


>> I
 think
 it
 opened
 up
 red
 the
 next
 day


because
 of
 that.


>> Um.


>> Gotcha.


>> And
 and
 people
 are
 saying,
 "Hey,
 you


know
 what?
 Are
 they
 going
 to
 dilute?"
 I


don't
 know.
 Maybe.
 The
 thing
 is
 I'm
 not


actually
 mad
 at
 like
 Noto
 needs
 $45
 a


share
 by
 next
 June.
 He's
 diluting


himself
 too.
 I
 mean,
 if
 if
 right
 now


they
 think
 they
 can
 grow
 at
 40%
 and
 by


diluting
 they
 think
 they
 can
 accelerate


that
 growth
 to
 42
 or
 44%.


Like
 who
 am
 I
 to
 judge?
 It
 it's
 it's


based
 on
 earnings
 per
 share.
 If
 you
 put


more
 shares
 out
 there,
 you
 need
 to
 make


sure
 that
 it
 is
 accretive
 to
 the
 total


outstanding
 amount
 of
 shares.
 And
 that's


what
 Noto
 believed
 last
 time.


>> And
 it
 it
 was
 barely
 accreted,
 but
 it
 it


it it
 was
 uh
 and
 here
 if
 they
 do
 it


again,
 it
 is.
 Um,
 but
 uh,
 just
 to
 add


some
 context,
 Tanner,
 because
 there's


not
 maybe
 as
 many
 SoFi
 shareholders,


that
 45
 isn't
 just
 hit
 45,
 it's
 his


volume
 weighted
 average
 over
 90
 days.


So,
 he
 needs
 higher
 than
 45.
 So,
 if
 they


dilute
 here,
 which
 they
 might,
 um,


they'll
 use
 it
 and
 it
 will
 be
 a


creative.
 Um,
 they're
 they're
 probably


going
 to
 really
 open
 the
 floodgates
 for


lending
 or
 use
 it
 for
 something
 to


really
 try
 to
 get
 uh,
 as
 many
 of
 those


PSUs
 as
 they
 can.
 35s
 is
 the
 next
 well


really
 25s
 they
 still
 need
 to
 get
 but


they're
 getting
 that
 35s
 uh
 is
 on
 the


table
 and
 then
 45s
 after
 that.
 Um


>> but
 45
 for
 June
 of
 26
 for
 like


>> 90
 days
 from
 June
 26


>> from
 I
 think
 the
 earliest
 has
 to
 be
 by


March.
 Yeah,
 any
 well
 I
 mean
 technically


you
 could
 have
 something
 crazy
 happen


like
 this
 isn't
 going
 to
 happen
 but


hypothetically
 if
 SoFi's
 trading
 at
 like


35
 bucks
 35
 bucks
 and
 it
 shoots
 to
 100


bucks
 for
 whatever
 reason
 and
 there's


actually
 volume
 uh
 for
 a
 number
 of
 days


that
 can
 skew
 it
 as
 well
 but
 uh
 I
 mean


>> yeah
 the
 average
 needs
 to
 be
 above
 45
 by


by
 June
 30th
 or
 something.


>> So
 so
 by
 March
 it
 has
 to
 minimum
 be
 45


then
 hold
 it
 for
 three
 months


essentially.
 Well,
 well,
 like
 like
 Roy


said,
 it
 doesn't
 have
 to
 be,
 but
 the


average
 like
 So,
 if
 we're
 sitting
 at
 35,


then
 it
 better
 start
 getting
 to
 65
 later


on.
 So,
 it
 really
 pumps
 up
 the
 average.


>> Yeah.


>> So,
 so
 hold
 on.
 That
 that
 means
 that


there
 needs
 to
 be
 a
 pretty
 big
 move
 in


this
 stock
 for
 him
 to
 get
 paid.
 Like,


objectively
 there
 h
 in
 what,
 four


months,
 there
 has
 to
 be
 a
 big
 move.


>> Which
 which
 is
 why


>> he
 doesn't
 get
 paid.
 Which
 is
 why
 if


they
 dilute,
 this
 is
 going
 to
 be
 the


last
 one
 that
 they
 do
 because
 it
 does


have
 a
 short-term
 impact
 that's
 negative


on
 the
 share
 price.
 And
 if
 if
 Dota's


like,
 "Hey,
 it's
 good
 for
 the
 company,


but
 I'm
 going
 to
 lose
 out
 on
 a


ridiculous
 amount
 of
 money
 and
 a
 number


of
 my
 employees
 as
 well."
 Uh,
 I
 think


he'll
 probably
 say,
 "Let's
 wait
 six


months.
 We
 have
 cash
 already
 and
 we're


ready
 to
 go."
 So,


all right.
 Tomorrow's
 going
 to
 be
 fun.


It's
 definitely
 within
 the
 realm
 of


possibility


as
 one
 of these
 comments
 says
 that
 um


SoFi
 puts
 up
 great
 earnings
 and
 the


stock
 does
 not
 follow.
 I
 mean
 we've
 seen


it
 countless
 times
 but
 um


I'm
 a
 long-term
 investor
 eventually
 that


will
 be
 correlated
 to
 financials.
 Okay,


pick
 any
 company
 over
 a
 10-year
 period.


I
 mean
 they
 they
 track
 their
 fundamental


performance.
 Um,


>> even
 PayPal.


>> PayPal,
 not
 so
 much.
 But
 it's
 a
 special


Talk
 to
 your
 brother
 about
 that.
 I
 mean,


that's
 um


>> that's
 going
 to
 be
 fun.
 I
 mean,
 dude,


what
 if
 PayPal?


>> Same
 day,
 by
 the
 way.
 Same
 time.


>> Yeah,
 I'm
 actually
 kind
 of
 expecting


because
 I'm
 I'm
 covering
 SoFi
 one
 live.


I'm
 I
 did
 PayPal
 live
 last
 time,
 but
 I'm


like,
 you
 know,
 SoFi,
 I
 think,
 is
 going


to
 be
 the
 one
 that
 I
 need
 to
 be
 at.
 Last


time
 I
 knew
 SoFi
 was
 going to
 be


amazing.
 Uh,
 I
 think
 SoFi
 PayPal
 is


going
 to
 be
 pretty
 much
 the
 same
 as
 what


they
 reported
 in
 quarter
 two.
 terms
 of


market
 reaction.
 Um
 there's
 a
 couple
 of


potential
 wild
 cards
 there,
 but
 I
 think


quarter
 four
 will
 be
 that
 quarter.
 But


uh


>> wasn't
 it
 like
 down
 7%
 or
 something?


>> Pay
 PayPal
 on
 earnings.


>> Yeah.


>> Yeah.
 Last
 time.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.


>> It's
 going
 to
 be
 the
 same.


>> No,
 no.
 I
 I'm
 saying
 like
 what
 the


market's
 wanting
 to
 see,
 which
 is


branded
 uh
 acceleration,
 topline
 uh


revenue
 acceleration
 as
 well.
 Um
 they're


not
 going
 to
 see
 that.
 I
 mean,
 they


they'll
 see
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 that,
 but


it's
 not
 going
 to
 be
 enough
 to
 really


get
 excited.
 they
 don't
 have
 the
 full


guidance
 that
 they'll
 be
 doing.
 Um
 there


there's
 a
 lot
 I
 got
 my
 earnings
 preview


out
 there.
 It's,
 you
 know,
 it's
 bullish,


but
 last
 time
 was
 a
 triple
 beat
 and
 it


fell,
 you
 know,
 seven,
 eight,
 nine,
 10%.


And
 I
 was
 like,
 uh,
 why?
 But,
 uh,
 so


maybe
 the
 free
 cash
 flow
 changes
 things.


Um,
 the
 all-time
 high
 acceleration
 of


users,
 like
 that's
 the
 other
 thing
 that


shifts.
 Uh,
 maybe
 that
 changes
 things.
 A


little
 bit
 of
 reaceleration
 at
 the
 top


line
 as
 well.
 But,
 um,
 yeah,
 I
 think


quarter
 four
 is
 going to
 be
 the
 quarter.


So,
 this
 quarter
 I'll
 be
 with
 you
 guys


with
 SoFi.
 Uh,
 next
 quarter
 PayPal


because
 I
 think
 that's
 going
 to
 be
 the


breakout.
 Not
 trying
 to
 time
 it.
 I'm


just
 holding
 my
 position.
 But
 that's
 uh


it
 wouldn't
 shock
 me
 though
 if
 this


earnings
 because
 we've
 been
 running
 uh


SoFi
 into
 earnings
 uh
 if
 we
 get
 a


pullback
 as
 some
 people
 take
 the


profits,
 you
 know,
 an
 initial
 pop
 uh


which
 is
 a
 normal
 pattern
 and
 then
 a


sell-off.
 Uh


>> it
 could
 happen.
 Buy
 the
 rumors,
 sell


the
 news.


>> And
 it
 doesn't
 bug
 me.
 I
 mean,
 we're
 at


alltime
 highs.
 It
 falls
 back
 to
 25.
 I'm


like,
 "Oh
 man,
 you
 know,
 I'm
 just
 I'm


crushed."
 No.
 And
 if
 it
 does
 something


really
 stupid
 like,
 "Hey,
 it
 falls
 to


five
 bucks."
 All
 right,
 I
 will
 just
 own


SoFi
 then.


>> Okay,
 real
 real
 quick
 question
 for
 you


guys.
 Out
 of
 these
 five
 companies,


Microsoft,
 Meta,
 Google,
 Amazon,
 Apple,


24hour
 or
 or
 sorry,
 the
 close
 of
 the


day.
 Oh,
 no.
 I
 guess
 they
 report
 after


close.
 Um
 but
 next
 close
 let
 let's
 say


the
 the
 the
 you
 know
 day
 after


who
 is
 having
 the
 best
 stock
 performance


of
 those
 companies


>> for
 for
 the
 for
 Wednesday
 or
 for


Wednesday
 and
 Thursday


>> Wednesday
 and
 Thursday
 Microsoft
 Meta


Google
 Amazon
 Apple
 their
 own
 you
 know


respective
 24-hour
 periods


>> I'll
 say
 Meta


who


>> Meta
 has
 uh
 consolidated
 for
 a
 good
 long


while.
 I've
 not
 paid
 attention
 to
 it


over
 the
 last
 two
 weeks,
 so
 maybe
 it's


shifted
 a
 lot.
 But


>> yeah,


>> um
 they've
 been
 building
 a
 lot.
 Um


they're
 also
 positioned
 very
 well
 to


benefit
 from
 the
 shifts
 that's
 happening


in
 advertising.
 Um
 they
 begin
 to


monetize
 WhatsApp
 as
 well.
 Um
 I
 wouldn't


be
 surprised
 if
 they
 have
 a
 nice
 little


pop
 in
 earnings.
 Uh
 Google
 probably


would
 be
 second
 for
 me,
 but


I
 think
 it's
 Google,
 but
 I'm
 going
 with


Amazon
 because
 they've
 not
 made
 a
 move


at
 all
 this
 year.
 I
 am
 feeling
 uneasy


though
 because
 if
 AWS
 doesn't
 do
 well,


Amazon's
 going to
 get
 hit.
 There's
 just


no
 way.
 It'll
 be
 a
 buy
 the
 dip,
 but


everyone's
 got
 to
 be
 ready
 to
 see
 low


200s
 again
 if
 AWS
 doesn't
 do
 well.
 So,
 I


think
 it's
 Amazon
 or
 Google.
 Could


>> Could
 be
 Apple,
 too,
 which
 is
 wild.
 But,


uh,
 that
 refreshes.


>> Is
 that
 your


>> I
 was
 thinking
 Apple
 potentially.
 Um,


I'm
 going
 to
 say
 Amazon
 and
 then
 I
 was


going
 to
 say
 Apple,
 but
 now
 you've


changed
 my
 mind
 to
 Meta.


>> Yes.


>> So,
 I'm
 going
 to
 say
 Amazon.
 You
 change


your
 mind
 in
 30
 seconds,
 bro.


>> Did
 you
 have
 any
 conviction
 at
 all
 on


this
 or


>> because
 because
 of
 the
 Well,
 no.
 I
 kept


my
 I
 kept
 my
 conviction.
 My
 conviction


is
 Amazon.


>> But


>> you
 said
 you
 changed
 your
 mind
 on
 Meta.


>> No,
 no,
 I
 changed
 from
 second
 place
 from


Apple
 to
 Meta.
 Um,
 no,
 I'm
 Amazon.
 I'm


still
 Amazon
 holding
 Amazon.
 But
 Meta


could
 do
 well
 because
 it
 hasn't
 moved


much.
 I
 think
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 um


a
 lot
 of
 good
 things
 from
 advertiser


names


and


>> but
 Meta
 has
 moved
 this
 year.
 I
 mean


it's
 made
 a
 freaking
 25%
 move.


>> Yeah.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 But
 but
 I
 mean
 I
 mean


quarterto
 quarter
 here.


>> Oh
 yeah.
 That's
 it.
 It
 was
 at
 800
 on
 Q2


last
 time.
 So
 it's
 definitely


>> Right.
 Right.


The
 only
 thing
 is
 is
 that
 they
 could


also
 be
 the
 worst
 performing
 one
 as
 well


because
 the
 the
 the
 the
 stock
 is
 very


>> Mark
 Zuckerberg
 likes
 to
 spend
 money
 and


and
 if
 they
 think
 that
 he's
 spending
 on


the
 wrong
 thing,
 whether
 that's


>> Horizon
 or
 something
 like
 this
 that's


not
 getting
 a
 return
 on
 invested


capital,


>> they
 could
 punish
 the
 stock.
 They've


been
 punished
 before.


I
 hope
 they
 do
 because
 I've
 been
 really


waiting
 to
 buy
 a
 meta
 dip
 and
 I
 know
 690


was
 like
 the
 opport
 but
 like
 I
 don't


know
 it
 just
 wasn't
 the
 most
 appeal.
 I


want
 them
 to
 punish
 punish
 it
 and
 I


don't
 know
 if
 they
 punished
 it
 enough
 to


take
 it
 into
 the
 low
 600s.
 I
 think
 that


would
 be
 too
 aggressive.
 But
 look


there's
 been
 a
 bit
 of
 internal
 chaos
 in


Meta.
 I
 mean
 the
 biggest
 thing
 from
 all


these
 researchers
 that
 they've
 hired


which
 rumors
 are
 you
 know
 four
 or
 five


billion
 dollars
 they
 spent
 is
 a
 Sora


competitor
 that
 no
 one
 uses.
 like
 really


working
 out
 at
 all.
 By
 the
 way,


>> Sora,


>> the
 the
 the
 hiring


>> the
 overhiring
 of
 the
 top
 names.


>> I
 think
 they
 have
 no
 choice
 because
 the


only
 relevance
 in
 advertising
 or
 in
 AI


that
 Meta
 has
 has
 has
 shown
 as


advertising.
 Llama,
 people
 say
 it's
 not


a
 failure,
 but
 no
 one
 uses
 llama.
 And


then
 number
 two
 is
 the
 glasses
 are
 just


not
 mainstream.
 And
 whatever
 AI
 version


that
 can
 enhance
 the
 glasses,
 they
 had
 a


chance
 to
 show
 it
 off.
 We
 watched
 the


stream.
 It
 was
 horrendous.
 So,
 like


where
 is
 Meta's
 AI
 moat
 coming
 from?


It's
 advertising,
 which
 is
 great.


Advertising
 is
 a
 great
 business,
 but
 I


think
 they're
 struggling
 to
 figure
 out


like
 where
 is
 our
 role
 in
 this


artificial
 super
 intelligence
 world?
 And


I
 don't
 think
 they
 have
 it
 yet.
 What
 did


you
 think
 about
 the
 Amazon
 glasses
 for


delivery
 drivers?
 How
 cool
 of
 an
 idea
 is


that?
 Oh,
 I'm
 kind
 of
 I'm
 kind
 of


propping.
 I
 would
 be
 a
 terrible


interviewer.


>> I
 actually
 didn't
 see
 that.
 Uh


>> they're
 they're
 putting
 delivery
 driver


glasses
 to
 help
 with
 direction
 uh


package
 delivery
 and
 then
 also
 scanning


boxes
 and
 taking
 pictures
 of
 the
 boxes


as
 they've
 been
 delivered.
 So
 like
 proof


of
 delivery.


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 uh
 as
 long
 as
 like
 they


don't
 have
 any
 weird
 things
 that


oftentimes,
 you
 know,
 with
 AR
 you
 have


uh
 dizziness
 or
 fatigue
 or
 they're


heavy.
 Um,
 but
 uh,
 yeah,
 if
 they
 don't


have
 that,
 that
 sounds
 great.


>> They
 they
 said
 that
 it
 cuts
 back,
 by
 the


way,
 this
 is
 insane.
 It
 doesn't
 sound


like
 a
 lot,
 but
 says
 they
 cut
 back
 about


30
 minutes
 uh,
 of
 time
 saving
 per
 shift.


>> Wow.


>> That's
 an
 insane
 change.


So,


>> I
 think
 they're
 pretty
 cool.
 And
 if
 Meta


can
 be
 a
 part
 of
 that
 for
 not
 only
 I


mean
 they
 probably
 won't
 do
 a
 lot
 of


commercial
 use
 but
 for
 retail
 use
 I'm


sure
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 use
 cases.


>> Um
 why
 have
 none
 of
 us
 said
 Microsoft?


>> I
 don't
 care
 about
 Microsoft.


>> Why
 do
 we
 always
 ignore
 Nadella?
 Bro,


>> they're
 just
 boring,
 dude.
 They're
 just


I
 don't
 know.


I
 think
 they're
 going
 to
 do
 amazing


constantly,


>> but


>> I
 just
 find
 they
 do
 everything
 mediocre


and
 nothing
 super
 great.


>> Well,
 that's
 not
 fun.


>> Pretty
 good,
 right?
 It's
 not
 like


Azure's
 been
 amazing.


>> Azure's
 been
 great.


>> But
 that's
 recent.
 That's
 recent.


>> Yeah.
 It's
 It's
 kind
 of
 like
 Amazon
 is


for
 me.
 I
 know
 you
 guys
 are
 on
 Amazon,


but
 where
 I'm
 like,
 it's
 a
 good
 company.


I
 mean,
 if
 somebody's
 saying
 otherwise,


I
 don't
 know
 who
 they
 are,
 but
 um
 I
 just


see
 better
 opportunities
 out
 there
 and
 I


versus
 like
 with
 Nvidia,
 I'm
 like,


"Okay,
 I
 need
 to
 own
 a
 piece
 of
 this."


And
 it's
 trading
 at
 a
 stupid
 valuation.


With
 Microsoft,
 I've
 never
 actually
 felt


compelled
 to
 buy.
 Um
 even
 though
 I'm


like, "Hey,
 they're
 going to
 be
 around
 a


long
 time.
 They're
 they're
 good."
 Um


but
 I
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 own
 like
 30


different
 or
 40
 different
 companies.
 I


want
 to
 own
 like
 10.
 So
 they
 I
 I
 it's


hard
 for
 me
 to
 see
 them
 making
 that
 cut


ever.


>> If
 you
 buy
 Microsoft,
 you
 own
 20
 or
 40


companies.


>> Yeah.


>> All
 right.
 So
 look,
 big
 tech
 earnings


starts
 this
 week.
 All
 three
 of
 us
 will


be
 covering
 it
 um
 on
 our
 on
 our
 channels


and
 Twitter.
 So
 if
 you're
 following
 us,


you'll
 be
 updated
 on
 everything.
 I
 mean,


this
 is
 going
 to
 be
 a
 wild
 week.


Wednesday,
 we
 got
 JPAL.
 Then
 we
 have
 big


tech.
 Then
 Thursday,
 we
 have
 Amazon
 and


Apple.
 And
 uh
 tomorrow
 we
 have
 GTC.
 So


you
 got
 Nvidia
 potentially


sharing
 some
 new
 ideas
 and
 products.
 I


mean
 this
 is
 and
 then
 as
 Tanner
 said,


40%
 of
 the
 S&P
 500
 reporting
 this
 week.


So
 this
 is
 the
 week
 that
 determines
 what


the
 next
 two
 months
 look
 like
 and


hopefully
 we
 get
 some
 good
 results
 going


into
 the
 next
 couple
 days.


>> I
 love
 earning
 season.
 I
 hope
 it
 never


goes
 to
 six
 months.


>> Yeah,


>> dude.
 It's
 going
 to
 suck.


>> Canada's
 talking
 about
 it
 too
 now.


They're
 like
 really
 pushing
 that.


Speaking
 of
 Canada,


>> no.


>> Do
 you
 know
 a
 company
 named
 Celestea?


>> I
 think
 I
 do.


>> I
 guess


>> I
 don't
 know.
 I
 I
 feel
 like
 I
 do.


>> Do
 Do
 you
 know
 what
 they
 do?


>> No,
 bro.
 This
 stock
 is
 up
 224%.


It's
 up
 10%
 after
 hours.
 They're
 a


freaking
 hardware
 manufacturing
 supply


chain
 electronics
 company
 from
 Toronto.


>> You
 say
 it
 like
 you're
 from
 Toronto.


That's
 funny.


>> Well,
 I'm
 from
 TA.
 I
 love
 TA.
 But


>> I
 pronounced
 the
 second
 T.
 That's
 how


you
 know
 someone's
 from
 Toronto.


>> Yes,
 exactly.
 Why
 Why
 is
 a
 Canadian


company
 up
 250%
 this
 year?
 And
 why
 don't


you
 know
 about
 it
 given
 you're
 from


Canada?


I
 only
 follow
 one
 Canadian
 company
 and


that's


>> an
 issue.
 That's
 an
 you.
 Dude,
 this


stock
 is
 up.
 We
 could
 have
 all
 been
 2.5x


richer
 if
 our
 Canadian
 friend
 told
 us


that
 there
 was
 a
 Canadian
 company
 out


there.


>> Can
 you
 imagine
 if
 every
 American


company
 I
 was
 like,
 "How
 do
 you
 not
 know


about
 this
 company?"
 Like,
 what
 are
 you


talking
 about?


>> No.
 The
 difference
 is
 Canada
 doesn't


really
 have
 that
 many
 companies
 that


actually
 like
 go
 up
 2.5x
 in
 a
 year.
 I


follow
 I
 follow
 more
 companies
 from
 the


Netherlands
 than
 I
 do
 Canada.


>> You
 have
 no
 You
 have
 no
 Canadian
 pride,


bro.
 You
 need
 to
 sing
 the
 national


anthem
 or
 something
 one
 day.
 Like


>> he
 might
 start
 singing
 the
 Star
 Spangle


Banner
 and


just
 sounds
 better.


>> Oh
 man,
 I'm
 gonna
 get
 locked
 up.


>> Yeah,
 I
 I


Even
 if
 I
 wasn't
 a
 content
 creator,
 I


would
 really
 not
 like
 the
 idea
 of
 going


to
 six
 months.
 I
 know
 it
 can
 save
 like


actual
 CEOs,
 especially
 smaller


companies,
 see
 this
 as
 a
 nice
 advantage


and
 everything,
 but
 man,
 it's
 going
 to


be
 a
 sad
 day
 if
 that
 happens.


>> Yeah.
 All
 right.
 Good
 stuff.
 Thank
 you


everybody
 for
 being
 here.
 Um,
 we'll
 be


back
 next
 Monday.
 We
 got
 a
 lot
 of


earnings.
 We're
 going
 to
 see
 how
 these


earnings
 can
 play
 out
 and
 hopefully
 we


get
 some
 good
 results.
 We
 got
 rate
 cuts


coming
 up
 and


yeah,
 I
 mean,
 look,
 this
 is
 a
 very,
 very


important
 time
 in
 the
 markets
 as
 long
 as


we
 can
 get
 some
 good
 results.
 I
 mean,


the
 the
 the
 health
 of
 the
 S&P
 for
 the


rest
 of
 the
 year
 basically
 depends
 on


Wednesday
 and
 Thursday.
 I
 mean,


everything
 else
 really
 doesn't
 matter.


And
 then
 you
 have
 Nvidia
 in
 a
 couple


weeks,
 but
 Wednesday,
 Thursday
 are
 big


days.
 We're
 probably
 going
 to
 get
 a
 rate


cut.
 And
 if
 we
 can
 get
 that
 going
 in
 the


right
 direction,
 then
 hopefully
 have
 a


really
 fun
 end
 of
 year.


>> All
 right,
 thank
 you
 everybody.
 Uh,
 also


thank
 you
 for
 all
 the
 birthday
 wishes


again.
 Really
 appreciate
 it.
 Thank
 you


guys.
 I
 did
 not
 expect
 you
 guys
 to
 find


the
 time
 out
 of
 your
 day
 on
 a
 busy


Monday
 and


>> hop
 on
 the
 stream.
 So,
 shout
 out
 to


Steve
 for
 organizing
 that
 and
 I


appreciate
 you.
 You
 guys
 really
 didn't


have
 to
 do
 that.
 So,
 that
 that
 meant


>> it
 was
 the
 way
 I
 envisioned
 it
 in
 my


head
 is
 that
 Steve
 would
 be
 like,
 "Yeah,


and
 there's,
 you
 know,
 just
 wanted
 to


say
 happy
 birthday."
 And
 like
 all
 of
 us


would
 pop
 in
 the
 bar
 below
 and
 then
 we


we'd
 all
 come
 on
 stream
 and
 it'
 be
 like,


"Oh
 my
 gosh,
 everyone's
 here
 for
 me."


But
 really
 it
 was
 just
 I
 joined
 and
 then


it
 was
 kind
 of
 quiet
 and
 then
 we're
 like


>> what's
 up?
 Hi.
 Like


>> oh
 great.


>> But
 uh
 yeah,
 then
 Chris
 joined
 like
 30


minutes
 later.


>> Chris
 was
 like,
 "Hey,
 happy
 birthday.


I'm
 getting
 on
 a
 flight.
 Talk
 to
 you


later."
 I
 was
 like,
 "Yeah.


But
 happy
 birthday,
 brother.
 Honestly,


um
 you
 know,
 you're
 a
 big
 inspiration
 to


me.
 I'm
 older
 than
 you,
 so
 I'm
 allowed


to
 say
 this.
 I'm
 proud
 of
 you.
 Um,


>> you
 know,
 I
 I
 feel
 like
 what
 you've
 done


has
 been
 awesome
 and
 I
 all
 of
 us
 here


are
 following
 your
 journey
 and
 and
 you


know,
 you're
 a
 trailblazer.
 So,
 uh
 just


really
 appreciate
 what
 you
 do
 and
 um


yeah,
 next
 time
 you
 try
 to
 call
 me
 and


want
 to
 have
 like
 a
 personal
 chat,
 don't


call
 me
 at
 659.


This
 guy
 goes,
 "Hey
 man,
 like
 I
 just


want
 to
 sit
 and
 talk
 for
 a
 minute.
 I
 saw


your
 heartfelt,
 you
 know,
 message."
 I'm


like,
 "You're
 going
 to
 make
 me
 late."
 I


thought
 he
 was
 doing
 it
 on
 purpose.
 I


thought
 he
 was
 messing
 with
 me.


>> I
 I
 literally
 I
 I
 thought
 you
 streamed


at
 8,
 not
 seven,
 but
 I
 was
 like,
 "Oh,


okay."
 So,


>> yeah.


>> No,
 seven.


>> I
 appreciate
 you
 guys.
 Means
 a
 lot.

 Royy's

him
