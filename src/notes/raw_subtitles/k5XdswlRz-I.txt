From
 the
 New
 York
 Times,
 it's
 the


headlines.
 I'm
 Tracy
 Mumford.
 Today's


Thursday,
 October
 23rd.
 Here's
 what


we're
 covering.


[Music]


>> Well,
 they
 had
 one
 today
 in
 the
 Pacific.


And
 uh
 the
 way
 I
 look
 at
 it
 every
 time
 I


look
 is
 it
 is
 violent
 and
 it
 is
 very


it's
 amazing
 that
 the
 weaponry


>> President
 Trump
 has
 expanded
 the
 US's


deadly
 attacks
 on
 boats
 he
 says
 are


smuggling
 drugs.
 now
 striking
 vessels
 in


the
 Pacific
 Ocean.
 Late
 yesterday,
 the


administration
 said
 that
 special
 forces


have
 carried
 out
 two
 strikes
 in
 two
 days


against
 boats
 in
 the
 Pacific.
 That
 adds


to
 the
 total
 of
 seven
 boats
 the
 US
 says


it's
 hit
 in
 the
 Caribbean
 Sea
 since


September.


>> It's
 in
 international
 waters.
 Uh
 if
 we


don't
 do
 it,
 we're
 going to
 lose


hundreds
 of
 thousands
 of
 people.


President
 Trump
 has
 claimed
 that
 the


strikes
 against
 the
 boats
 are
 a
 matter


of
 self-defense
 and
 that
 the
 military
 is


stopping
 deadly
 drugs
 that
 can
 kill


Americans
 from
 entering
 the
 US.


>> So
 now
 they'll
 come
 in
 by
 land
 at
 a


lesser
 to
 a
 lesser
 extent
 and
 they
 will


be
 hit
 on
 land.
 Also,


>> speaking
 to
 reporters
 yesterday,
 Trump


suggested
 he
 would
 escalate
 the


operations
 even
 further
 and
 soon
 order


strikes
 against
 targets
 on
 land,
 though


he
 didn't
 say
 where
 those
 might
 happen.


So
 far,
 the
 administration
 has
 offered


no
 evidence
 that
 the
 people
 on
 the
 boats


were
 smuggling
 drugs.
 And
 a
 broad
 range


of
 legal
 experts
 say
 that
 even
 if
 that


is
 the
 case,
 the
 administration
 doesn't


have
 the
 authority
 to
 kill
 the
 people
 on


the
 boats
 rather
 than
 arrest
 them.
 Every


year
 in
 the
 US,
 there
 are
 more
 than


100,000
 overdose
 deaths.
 Though
 the


administration's
 attacks
 on
 the
 alleged


drug
 boats
 from
 South
 America,
 are


unlikely
 to
 bring
 that
 number
 down
 since


most
 of
 those
 deaths
 are
 caused
 by


fentanyl,
 which
 is
 produced
 by
 drug
 labs


in
 Mexico.


[Music]


Now,
 three
 more
 updates
 on
 the
 Trump


administration.


>> Mr.
 President,
 can
 you
 tell
 us
 a
 little


bit
 about
 why
 you're
 elevating
 sanctions


against
 Russia
 right
 now?
 What's
 the


>> I
 just
 felt
 it
 was
 time.
 We've
 waited
 a


long
 time.
 I
 thought
 that


>> President
 Trump
 announced
 yesterday
 that


the
 US
 will
 impose
 new
 sanctions
 on


Russian
 oil
 companies.
 The
 first


significant
 penalty
 that
 Trump
 has
 put


on
 Russia
 since
 returning
 to
 office.


>> Every
 time
 I
 speak
 with
 Vladimir,
 I
 have


good
 conversations
 and
 then
 uh
 they


don't
 go
 anywhere.
 They
 just
 don't
 go


anywhere.
 The
 president
 has
 grown


increasingly
 frustrated
 with
 Vladimir


Putin
 recently
 over
 his
 continued


assault
 on
 Ukraine
 and
 his
 refusal
 to


negotiate
 an
 end
 to
 the
 war
 despite


Trump's
 efforts
 to
 broker
 a
 peace
 deal.


The
 new
 penalties
 target
 two
 Russian
 oil


giants,
 which
 could
 help
 cut
 off
 crucial


oil
 revenue
 that
 the
 White
 House
 says
 is


helping
 fund
 Russia's
 war
 effort.
 But


analysts
 say
 the
 sanctions
 are
 only
 as


strong
 as
 their
 enforcement.
 And
 in


recent
 years,
 Russia
 has
 managed
 to
 get


around
 existing
 sanctions
 against


thousands
 of
 Russian
 companies
 and


individuals.


Also,
 the
 Trump
 administration
 is
 now


sending
 federal
 agents
 to
 San
 Francisco


as
 it
 plans
 for
 an
 immigration
 crackdown


there.
 San
 Francisco
 is
 the
 latest


Democraticrun
 city
 where
 they've
 sent


agents
 for
 this
 kind
 of
 operation
 and


local
 leaders
 are
 already
 pushing
 back.


If
 federal
 officials
 come
 to
 incite


chaos
 on
 the
 streets
 of
 San
 Francisco,


the
 way
 to
 support
 our
 communities
 and


keep
 everyone
 in
 our
 city
 safe
 is
 to


make
 our
 voices
 heard
 peacefully.


>> The
 mayor
 of
 San
 Francisco
 accused
 the


administration
 of
 trying
 to
 use


immigration
 raids
 to
 spark
 protests,


which
 it
 could
 then
 use
 as
 pretext
 to


send
 in
 the
 National
 Guard.
 Meanwhile,


the
 city's
 district
 attorney
 along
 with


the
 Democratic
 lawmakers
 who
 represent


the
 city
 warned
 that
 if
 federal
 agents


break
 California
 law
 while
 conducting


raids,
 then
 local
 police
 could
 arrest


them.
 However,
 legal
 experts
 tell
 the


Times
 there's
 little
 precedent
 for
 state


law
 enforcement
 arresting
 federal


officers.


And
 at
 the
 White
 House,
 the
 entire
 East


Wing
 will
 be
 demolished
 as
 soon
 as
 this


weekend
 to
 make
 way
 for
 President


Trump's
 enormous
 new
 ballroom.
 Trump
 had


originally
 said
 that
 the
 wing
 wouldn't


be
 touched
 at
 all
 during
 construction,


but
 a
 senior
 administration
 official


told
 the
 Times
 that
 the
 White
 House


determined
 it's
 cheaper
 and
 more


structurally
 sound
 to
 level
 that
 part
 of


the
 complex
 than
 add
 onto
 it.
 The


90,000q
 ft
 ballroom
 is
 just
 one
 of
 many


construction
 projects
 Trump
 has
 ordered


in
 Washington
 since
 returning
 to
 office,


including
 massive
 new
 flag
 poles
 at
 the


White
 House
 and
 a
 giant
 arct
 triumph


style
 arch
 in
 front
 of
 Arlington


National
 Cemetery
 that
 he's
 planning
 to


have
 built.
 Trump
 was
 recently
 asked
 who


the
 arch
 is
 for.
 He
 responded,
 quote,


"Me.
 It's
 going
 to
 be
 beautiful.


[Music]


Looking
 over
 to
 the
 capital
 now.
 He


should
 just
 be
 really
 honest
 with
 us
 and


say,
 "I
 don't
 want
 to
 swear
 her
 in
 and


I'm
 not
 going
 to."
 Just
 be
 honest.


>> A
 recently
 elected
 representative
 has


filed
 a
 lawsuit
 demanding
 that
 House


Speaker
 Mike
 Johnson
 swear
 her
 into


Congress.


>> And
 until
 he
 does
 his
 job,
 I
 can't
 do


mine.


>> Adalita
 Galva,
 a
 Democrat,
 won
 a
 special


election
 in
 Arizona
 a
 month
 ago.
 But


Johnson
 has
 kept
 the
 House
 in
 recess


during
 the
 government
 shutdown
 and
 has


not
 sworn
 her
 in
 despite
 having
 had


multiple
 opportunities
 to
 do
 so.
 Galva's


lawsuit
 notes
 that
 earlier
 this
 year,


Johnson
 swore
 in
 two
 Republicans
 within


24
 hours
 of
 them
 winning
 special


elections,
 even
 when
 the
 House
 was
 not


in
 session.
 If
 or
 when
 Grihalva
 is
 able


to
 take
 her
 seat,
 she
 will
 narrow
 the


already
 slim
 majority
 Republicans
 hold


in
 the
 House,
 making
 it
 harder
 for


Johnson
 to
 pass
 bills.
 She's
 also


expected
 to
 provide
 the
 last
 signature


needed
 on
 a
 bipartisan
 effort
 to
 push


the
 Trump
 administration
 to
 release


files
 related
 to
 Jeffrey
 Epstein.


Johnson
 has
 denied
 that
 his
 refusal
 to


seek
 Grahalva
 is
 connected
 to
 that.
 His


office
 didn't
 respond
 to
 a
 request
 for


comment.
 The
 attorney
 general
 of
 Arizona


who
 joined
 Grahalva
 suit
 said
 in
 a


statement
 that
 Johnson
 is
 quote
 actively


stripping
 the
 people
 of
 Arizona
 of
 one


of
 their
 seats
 in
 Congress.
 Meanwhile,


in
 the
 Senate,
 Republicans
 and
 Democrats


seem
 no
 closer
 to
 any
 kind
 of
 deal
 to


reopen
 the
 government.
 They
 remain
 at
 an


impass
 over
 Democrats
 demands
 to
 extend


healthc
 care
 subsidies.
 Today
 though,


the
 lawmakers
 are
 expected
 to
 consider


legislation
 that
 would
 get
 some


government
 workers
 paid.

In
 Paris,
 the
 Louv
 reopened
 yesterday


after
 being
 shut
 down
 following
 Sunday's


shocking
 daylight
 jewel
 heist.
 The


specific
 gallery
 where
 the
 jewels
 used


to
 be,
 however,
 remains
 closed.
 And
 the


museum's
 director's
 been
 facing
 intense


criticism
 about
 the
 state
 of
 the
 Louve


security
 system.


She
 spoke
 publicly
 yesterday
 for
 the


first
 time
 since
 the
 theft
 and


acknowledged
 that
 much
 of
 the
 system
 is


badly
 outdated
 and
 that
 the
 only


exterior
 surveillance
 camera
 near
 where


the
 thieves
 broke
 in
 was
 facing
 away


from
 them.
 At
 the
 moment,
 more
 than
 100


investigators
 are
 racing
 to
 find
 the


culprits,
 who
 may
 be
 planning
 to
 break


down
 the
 artifacts
 and
 resell
 the
 stones


and
 metals
 separately.
 The
 items,


including
 tiaras,
 necklaces,
 and


earrings,
 were
 potentially
 worth
 more


than
 hund00
 million,
 but
 they
 were
 not


insured.
 According
 to
 France's
 culture


ministry,
 that's
 not
 uncommon
 for
 state


collections
 because
 of
 the
 high
 cost
 to


cover
 them.


And
 finally,
 in
 Iceland,
 the
 country's


natural
 science
 institute
 announced
 a


kind
 of
 milestone
 that
 no
 one
 really


wants
 to
 celebrate.
 Iceland
 has
 had
 its


first
 ever
 recorded
 sighting
 of


mosquitoes
 in
 the
 wild.
 The
 country
 used


to
 be
 one
 of
 the
 only
 mosquito-free


places
 in
 the
 world,
 though
 it's
 had
 a


spike
 of
 other
 insect
 life
 over
 the
 last


few
 decades.
 That's
 happened
 as
 there's


been
 more
 and
 more
 traffic
 to
 the


island.
 planes,
 cruise
 ships,
 cargo


boats,
 more
 ways
 for
 critters
 to
 hitch
 a


ride.
 Climate
 change
 has
 also


transformed
 the
 region,
 and
 insect


numbers
 can
 go
 up
 with
 higher


temperatures.
 The
 landmark
 mosquito


sighting
 was
 made
 by
 a
 backyard
 bug


enthusiast
 who
 regularly
 puts
 out
 a


piece
 of
 rope
 dipped
 in
 sugary
 red
 wine


as
 a
 lure
 for
 insects
 so
 he
 can
 examine


them.
 Last
 week,
 he
 noticed
 something


unusual
 take
 the
 bait.
 Three
 mosquitoes.


It's
 unclear
 if
 they're
 just
 accidental


tourists
 or
 the
 beginning
 of
 a
 new


native
 population.
 Before
 this,
 only
 one


mosquito
 had
 ever
 been
 caught
 in


Iceland,
 and
 that
 happened
 in
 the
 80s
 on


a
 plane
 that
 had
 just
 touched
 down
 at


the
 airport.
 For
 now,
 an
 entomologist
 at


the
 Natural
 Science
 Institute
 is


stashing
 the
 mosquitoes
 in
 his
 freezer.


Those
 are
 the
 headlines.
 Today
 on
 the


Daily,
 the
 view
 from
 Venezuela
 as
 top


Trump
 aids
 have
 pushed
 for
 the


administration
 to
 topple
 the
 country's


leader.
 You
 can
 listen
 to
 that
 in
 the


New
 York
 Times
 app
 or
 wherever
 you
 get


your
 podcasts.

 Tracy
 Mumford.
 We'll


be
 back
 tomorrow
 with
 the
 latest
 and
 the


Friday
 news
 quiz.
