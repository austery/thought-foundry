Here's what happens
when you put your DNA under a microscope.
You can extract some from your mouth,
just gargle salt water
and mix this with soap and rubbing alcohol.
You'll get a gooey mass at the top.
This is DNA.
Most of it is yours,
but some of it actually
comes from bacteria
living in your mouth.
At 100 times magnification,
you'll see these strings,
which are coiled up DNA,
proteins and debris,  all clumped together.
But looking at them is
pretty much useless.
I mean, even with a million
dollar electron microscope,
you can't actually see the
genetic code that makes you you.
So how do you read DNA?
DNA.
DNA evidence.
DNA.
Your family secrets.
You are not the father.
Diseases you haven't
been diagnosed with yet.
Predicting or even diagnosing cancers.
The tiny quirks of what makes you you.
But for the vast majority
of human history,
we have not been able to read it.
It is completely illegible.
All of this might still
be impossible today,
if not for one man who took a lot of drugs
and stumbled upon a discovery
that unlocked DNA forever.
Also, he was kind of a jerk.
In the 1960s as a biochemistry
student at Berkeley,
Kary Mullis wasn't interested
in going to his classes.
He was too busy taking LSD and lots of it.
Mullis didn't take
university very seriously.
His PhD dissertation was filled with jokes
and the committee refused to approve it
until he, quote, cut
all the wacko stuff out.
But LSD fueled his eccentric genius,
sparking all sorts of interesting ideas.
It did trickle into his science.
So for example, he wrote a
letter to the journal Nature,
which chronicled the, quote,
entire universe from the
beginning to the end,
and they published it, which is amazing.
He was like 22 years
old, they published that.
After graduating,
Mullis just bummed around for a bit.
First, he gets a job in a cardiology lab,
but he's just kind of so horrified
at how many rats are being killed.
So he starts writing fiction,
he gets a job in a bakery.
One day he's working in this bakery,
and this guy, Tom White, walks in
and it turns out Tom White
works at this company.
It's a biotech startup called Cetus.
They sort of get to talking,
and this guy offers Kary
Mullis, he offers him a job.
White recommended Mullis to his higher-ups, saying
 
"Hire this guy Mullis,
he's an excellent synthetic chemist.
I knew he was a good chemist because he'd been synthesizing
hallucinogenic drugs at Berkeley."
Cetus was one of the first
biotech companies in the world.
It was founded in 1971.
An exciting time when scientists
were starting to figure
out how to manipulate DNA.
One of the most important
discoveries was actually made
that year while researchers
at Johns Hopkins
were studying the bacteriophage.
The phage is a virus that hijacks bacteria
by injecting its DNA into the cell.
The bacteria is then
forced to create copies of the phage until it explodes.
But the researchers realized
that some bacteria evolved defenses
that make them more
resistant to the virus.
Their defensive molecules
would scan the phage DNA,
looking for a specific sequence,
and when they found a match,
they would cut the DNA,
turning it into useless strings.
Scientists called these
little scissor molecules restriction enzymes,
and different types of restriction enzymes cut
DNA at different places
and they work on human DNA too.
So the researchers extracted the enzymes
to essentially create a
toolbox of nanoscopic scissors
that would allow them to cut DNA at will.
Cetus was trying to use biotech like this
to develop commercial DNA
tests that hospitals could use
to quickly diagnose diseases.
But at the time, simple DNA
tests like this were impossible.
Say you want to detect
sickle cell disease.
I mean, you could just
look at the blood cells
under a microscope, but Cetus
wanted to prove that they could
do it with a genetic test.
And for one of those, you would start off
with a sample of DNA.
In each of your cells,
there are 23 pairs of chromosomes,
and if you zoom into the
tip of the 11th chromosome,
you'll find the beta globin gene.
This sequence of adenine,
thymine, guanine,
and cytosine nucleotides
controls the shape
of your red blood cells.
And if you inherit a
T instead of an A here
from both of your parents,
well, you're born with sickle cell anemia.
But, you can't see any of
this under a microscope.
So how do you check
these single letter mutations against DNA
that's over six billion letters long?
Mullis said that this was the equivalent to
reading a license plate on interstate five
in the dark
from the Moon
But luckily there was a way to do it.
The first step is to
separate the beta globin gene
from the rest of the DNA.
So you can use restriction
enzymes on your sample
to cut the DNA into little
pieces, all of different lengths,
and the sickle cell mutation
will be on one of these ribbons.
But how does that help?
Well, DNA is negatively charged
so if you place your cut up
sample into a porous material
like a gel and apply a voltage across it,
the DNA pieces will flow
from the negative end
to the positive end.
But because they're all different lengths,
shorter pieces of DNA will
navigate the gel pores quicker
than longer ones.
This is called gel electrophoresis,
and it lets you separate
DNA out by length.
Its results are consistent enough
that after the DNA is spread
across the gel, you can see
where different length strands end up.
Near the start, you'll see DNA strands
that are 10,000 base pairs
followed by shorter ones,
3000, 1000, and so on.
And because you used specific
restriction enzymes,
you can predict that
the sickle cell mutation
was sliced into a 2000 base pair segment.
So it's in here.
And now that we know
where the target DNA is,
we can move on to step two,
checking whether our sample
actually has that mutation or not.
If you soak the sample
in an alkaline solution
or heat it up to over 90
degrees, the hydrogen bonds
between nucleotides will
break and the DNA will unzip.
Now, the two strands will be
able to pair to any other DNA
as long as it's a match.
As only pair to Ts and Gs only pair to Cs.
You need a complimentary sequence.
Scientists could take advantage of this
by synthesizing short
pieces of DNA in a lab.
These are called probes,
and they can be designed to
have any specific sequence.
So if the sickle cell mutation is CTGTG,
you can create a probe that
has the complimentary sequence,
GACAC, that will stick to it.
And because normal DNA
is supposed to be CTGAG,
your custom probe won't be a good match.
Now, the trick is to make these
synthetic probes radioactive
and add them in.
So after a while, your
probes will either pair
to the DNA or just keep floating around.
And if you wash your sample,
any probes that didn't
pair will rinse off.
So the final step is to check
the sample for radioactivity.
You can see that with sickle cell blood,
there's a radioactive signal on the right.
The probe found the
mutation and stuck to it.
But in the case of normal
blood, there's no signal.
None of the probes paired,
so there must be no mutation.
There is also this other
huge signal in both cases.
That's because the probes
will match to other parts of the DNA too,
not just
to the sickle cell region.
This is why you need to
separate the mutation out
using the gel first.
This technique was known
as the Southern Blot,
and it worked, but there was a problem.
It took days or even weeks.
Every step of it is difficult
and every step of it, it's
like super inefficient.
The matching is inefficient.
The radio-sensitive paper
is really inefficient,
and you have these technicians
having to work with radioactive stuff.
And it happened in a
way that it was so slow
and cumbersome
that it wasn't commercially
feasible in any way.
Cetus wanted a DNA test
that could be done in a
day in a single test tube,
and they were close.
They developed a method that could test
for sickle cell disease
in just seven hours.
But this new test suffered
from a different problem.
The signal was just too faint.
You could hardly tell whether the sample
had the sickle cell mutation or not
because it would barely
return any results.
Now, Kary Mullis didn't work
on these cutting edge DNA tests.
His job was to make those
short radioactive bits of DNA
that would be used as probes.
He wasn't even doing the interesting part.
So he's just making these snippets.
That's his job, and it is a slow,
repetitive, extremely boring job.
So while he's working there, maybe in part
because he is bored, he's just obnoxious,
he's like a really annoying person.
He doesn't get along with anybody.
He picks fights with like receptionists
and security guards and his colleagues.
He also was a womanizer,
so he would be hitting
on people all the time,
which was at the same
time he was also married.
There was one time where he threatened
to bring a gun to work.
Really like not someone
you would wanna work with.
But, one day they bring in this new machine
into the workplace.
This machine basically could synthesize
these snippets all by itself.
It's basically doing, you
know, a month of his work
in like a day.
Mullis, he's like, now
I both have free time
and I have a lot of
these little DNA snippets
I can sort of play with and figure out
like, what can I do with them?
And now he doesn't really
have a lot of work to do.
And also people don't like him at work.
So he basically starts taking weekends
in Mendocino County to just relax.
As he was driving up to his cabin
on a Friday night in the spring of 1983,
Mullis let his mind wander.
He thought about that new DNA test
and was trying to think
of a way to fix it.
Then a thought struck him.
What if instead of inventing a more powerful telescope
to read a single license
plate from the Moon,
he just created more of
that same license plate.
His mind raced.
Mullis
could see DNA chains
floating all around him.
"Blue and pink images
of electric molecules injected themselves
between the mountain and my eyes."
He wasn't on LSD,
but his mind by then had
learned how to get there.
He could sit on a DNA molecule
watching the reactions unwind.
See, the whole DNA sequence
around the sickle cell mutation was known.
And because Mullis knew one
strand, by complementarity,
he knew the other as well.
So if he heated up the DNA
and separated the strands, he
could design short bits of DNA
that would pair to both strands
anywhere on the sequence.
These would be his primers.
Then, Mullis could use something
called DNA polymerase.
It's a special protein
that attaches itself
to sites like these
where primers are paired
to the original DNA.
The polymerase basically grabs nucleotides
floating around and extends the primer.
And the primer is built as
a perfect complimentary pair
to the strand of DNA it's attached to.
This creates an identical copy
of the initial double helix.
Polymerase exists in every
cell of every living thing.
It is what's responsible
for replicating DNA
during cell division.
But it will only ever build out a primer in one direction.
It's kind of like a one-way street.
You see each DNA strand starts
with a phosphate molecule.
This is called the five prime end.
That phosphate is attached
to a sugar molecule called deoxyribose,
which holds one of the four nucleotides.
And deoxyribose also connects
to the next phosphate,
and so this pattern repeats.
But the last deoxyribose molecule
doesn't have another
phosphate connected to it.
So it ends with an OH group instead.
This is the three prime
end, our street exit.
The three prime end on one
DNA strand is always connected
to the five prime end on the other.
The second DNA strand
always points the other way.
And DNA polymerase needs an OH group
to attach the next nucleotide.
So it always builds on
the three prime end.
But that wasn't a limitation,
it was an advantage,
and Mullis knew exactly how to use it.
He could create two primers
that would bind to the DNA
before the sickle cell mutation,
each on a different strand
pointing at each other.
And if he added polymerase
along with some spare nucleotides,
it would have to extend both primers
toward and over the sickle cell mutation.
This would create two
separate DNA segments,
both with the mutation.
A few miles down the road,
he had another eureka.
He could just do these three
steps again,
Unzip the DNA,
pair the primers, and use
polymerase to extend them.
He now had four DNA
sequences with the mutation
and he could make that eight
and then 16, 32, 64.
And he realized that if he
repeated this chain reaction
30 times, he would have
over a billion copies
of that specific DNA segment,
all with the sickle cell mutation.
He could cover the entire Earth
with identical copies
of the license plate.
And if he designed different primers,
he could change the length
of the DNA section that
would get replicated.
This didn't only work for
the sickle cell mutation.
As long as you knew the
sequence for any part
of any DNA, human, plant, bacterial,
you could make copies
of that exact segment
and the copies would grow exponentially,
like a nuclear chain reaction.
(upbeat music)
Mullis had invented a DNA photocopier.
He named it the polymerase chain
reaction, or PCR for short.
Immediately he stopped the car
and scribbled his idea on
the back of a gas receipt.
PCR consumed his thoughts
for the rest of the weekend.
"It was difficult for me to sleep
with DNA bombs exploding in my brain.
What if I had not taken LSD ever?
Would I have invented PCR?
I don't know. I doubt it.
I seriously doubt it."
Monday morning, he bursts
into the office at Cetus Corp,
and he pitches his idea.
He's like, basically,
look, hey, I came up with
a DNA Xerox machine.
Like, we are working so hard to read this tiny tiny thing.
What if we made a billion copies of it?
It would be so much easier.
Mullis presented his idea
at a company-wide seminar,
but people started leaving
before he was done.
A lot of them are skeptical.
They've heard him pitch
cockamamie ideas before.
The other thing is that they
were like, that's so simple.
It had to have been tried before
and it can't possibly work.
Like, there must be a reason
why this is not the way we're doing this.
But Mullis was undeterred.
He started his first
experiment in September, 1983,
trying to replicate a 400 base
pair fragment of human DNA.
After months of trying, he
couldn't get PCR to work.
Human DNA was just too complicated.
So he set his sights on a smaller fragment
of bacterial DNA, just 25 base pairs.
For months, he'd separate the
strands, attach the primers,
add the polymerase, hoping
to amplify that small section
of bacterial DNA.
By the summer of 1984,
Mullis thought he had it — indisputable
proof that PCR worked.
But others at Cetus weren't convinced.
His work was sloppy.
He didn't have any controls
or do repetitions of his experiments.
Tom White and Norman Arnheim,
another colleague at
Cetus said that
"No one but Kary believed the data he showed
demonstrated what he said it did."
"Any independent scientist
looking at the data today
would come to the same conclusion."
Mullis took these comments personally.
He constantly argued with his colleagues
about these results and
even started a fist fight
at one point.
He was
losing credibility fast and everyone wanted him out.
But White argued that PCR had potential,
so Mullis was given a one
year probationary period
to prove that PCR could work,
but he wouldn't be doing it alone.
White, Arnheim
and Henry Ehrlich
assigned other technicians
to develop PCR along with Mullis.
And from there on out,
this group of scientists
worked overtime to make PCR a reality.
And by spring 1985, after
months of painstaking trial and error,
the group finally cracked it.
They had definitive proof
that PCR was possible.
With it, their new sickle
cell diagnostic method
worked like a charm
and could be done in under 10 hours.
But PCR was still just a concept
with a huge problem.
For each cycle, you needed
to raise the temperature
to 95 degrees Celsius to unzip the DNA,
and then lower it to around 30
degrees to allow the primers
to pair and the polymerase to extend them.
And then you would repeat that cycle,
heating back up to 95 degrees.
The problem was that the polymerase
would get destroyed when it was heated up.
It was extracted from E. coli bacteria
and E. coli can only survive up to
around 50 degrees Celsius.
So you would have to stand there
and manually add in more polymerase
every time you cycled the temperature.
And that was expensive and time consuming.
You have to do this
loop like maybe 30 times
for a piece of DNA you're looking at,
and every time you gotta stop,
you gotta add more polymerase.
It was just getting in
the way of the vision
and of the efficacy.
This was like, yeah, it
was adding more time.
It was adding more
difficulty to the process.
But, it turns out a solution
had been bubbling away
in the background for over 20 years.
In 1964,
a microbiologist named Tom Brock
was visiting Yellowstone National Park.
He'd never been before,
but when he got to the
boiling hot springs,
immediately the vivid hues of the yellow
and orange water caught his
eye.
Are these colors bacteria?
Nobody thought that something
could live at higher
than 60 degrees Celsius.
But this professor Thomas
Brock, this microbiologist,
he was like, no, no, no, no, no.
I think not only can things
live at that temperature,
I think things can live
above 100 degrees Celsius.
I think things can live in boiling water.
Brock set up a lab next
to one of the springs
and asked his undergraduate student,
Hudson Freeze, to tag along.
I mean, I wasn't even old enough to drink.
So, we would go to the spring
and collect the samples there,
and then bring them back to the
laboratory for the analysis.
So every day, oh,
over about three or four days,
I would go in
and I would pick up this tube.
So, a standard looking test tube.
And I would go like that, and I'd flick it just to see
if there was anything growing in there.
Didn't see anything.
You know, this is never gonna work.
Third day, nothing, fourth
day, ooh, look at this.
There's a little something on the bottom.
So I picked up the tube and shook it.
And this time there was this
this stuff that was going (whistles)
like this.
And I, well, that's interesting.
So I got a little pipette
out, took a little drop,
put it under a microscope.
I still get goosebumps,
man, I'll tell you.
I still get goosebumps.
I looked at it, and
here are all these worms
just crawling around.
I thought, my god, I'm the
first person to the world
that ever sees this.
There was a graduate student in the lab.
And so this graduate student said,
well, I think we ought to call
it 'Hudsoniae Freeziensis'.
I mean, you do have a great name.
And Tom said, no, no, you can't name it
after a person, we're gonna
call it Thermus Aquaticus.
And the graduate student and I
both looked at each other - hot water?
Man, that's not very creative.
So it meant that if an organism
was gonna live out there,
it had to have all of its
essential enzymes adapted,
living at that temperature.
So it was clear, boiling water
is not going to knock these guys off,
but we thought it had no applications.
Brock and Hudson published their findings
and stored a culture of Taq
at the American Type Culture Collection,
a database that preserves
microbial samples.
16 years later, in the spring of 1985,
Kary Mullis stumbled upon their discovery.
He was looking for a polymerase
that could survive the
high heat of the PCR cycle
and he had found it.
At his suggestion,
the group isolated the
polymerase out of Taq
and tried it in a PCR test.
The results were breathtaking.
David Gelfand, the Cetus scientist
who purified the new polymerase said,
"It worked like a charm.
It worked better than anything
we have ever fantasized.
The holy grail had been achieved."
Not only was Taq able to
survive the high temperature
of PCR, it thrived in it.
These are the results with
the old E. coli polymerase.
You can see that it amplified
the sickle cell DNA,
but it amplified a lot of
the background DNA too.
So it was messy.
That's because primers
can actually attach to DNA
even if they aren't a perfect match,
they just need a low enough temperature,
otherwise the high kinetic
energy peels them off.
But with Taq, you never had
to lower the temperature
below 50 degrees,
so the primers would
virtually only ever bind
to their target region.
These were the results with Taq.
It completely erased all
of the background noise.
You could sort of set it and forget it
and come back, you know, 30 cycles later,
a couple hours later
and all of a sudden you have a billion
of the thing you're looking for.
PCR worked and it worked effortlessly.
They could amplify any
piece of DNA they wanted,
no matter how small the sample.
Cetus realized they had a golden goose.
But other companies like Perkin Elmer
and Kodak were starting
to catch onto their idea.
And if anyone else even briefly mentioned
the concept of PCR in their paper,
Cetus would lose all rights to the patent.
So they had to go public and
they had to do it quickly.
The PCR group urged Mullis
to publish a solo paper
first, since PCR was his idea.
But Mullis procrastinated.
Afraid they would lose credit for PCR,
the rest of the group was forced
to publish an article on
their own PCR research.
So the first paper on PCR
that came out in Science
Magazine in December of 1985
listed Mullis as the fourth author.
He was furious.
By the time he got his own paper ready,
no reputable journal wanted it.
He remarked, "Nature didn't call me.
I wasn't one of the good old boys.
Science rejected it too."
He claimed the PCR group stole his work.
"My God, they're going to get
away with their little trick."
But the group scrambled together
to get Mullis the proper recognition.
He became the face of PCR
after giving a talk at a
microbiology symposium in 1986.
But, it was too late.
Shortly after, still fueled
by his anger for the group,
Mullis left Cetus.
However, the work on PCR
continued without him.
And after he leaves,
they come up with like,
basically there are new PCR machines
that do the whole thing for you.
And basically these machines are now
in like every lab that
does any kind of work
with DNA anywhere.
PCR was a huge success.
Polymerase chain reaction test.
PCR, PCR.
It's a DNA photocopier.
Measure remaining blood cancer cells
that other tests can't detect.
Everyone was using it.
From DNA cloning and vaccines to detecting cancer and HIV,
PCR was saving lives.
It completely opened up everything,
it revolutionized everything.
P-P-P-PCR.
PCR could amplify the
tiniest sample of DNA.
It supercharged forensics.
Texas man should be freed from prison
because new DNA evidence does
not link him to the crime.
Hundreds of wrongfully convicted people
were freed and thousands
of criminals were caught.
Families separated by
war could be reunited.
We use PCR all the time, all the time.
Everybody in our institute.
Scientists even tried
to use PCR on ancient DNA from
insects fossilized in amber.
Sound familiar?
Like it's completely taken
over so much of our world.
And right at the center of this takeover,
Kary Mullis.
Dr. Kary Mullis, a surfer,
a scientist who proved
that science can be fun.
The world renowned inventor
of polymerase chain reaction.
What inspired you to invent this?
It wasn't people, it was...
Drugs, drug, drug, drugs,
I'm experienced with drugs.
In 1993, Mullis was awarded
both the Japan Prize
and the Nobel Prize in
chemistry for his invention
of the polymerase chain reaction method.
Although it wouldn't have
existed without his colleagues,
Mullis made PCR his
story and his story only.
There were a lot of people
who were like, he's such a fame hog.
Like, he completely didn't
give any of us credit.
I invented PCR.
After I had invented PCR.
And now it's like they
bought into his version
of the story
where he did this solo.
Whereas there were a lot of people at Cetus Corp who helped him.
As Erlich remarked,
"To Kary, rewriting
history was more important
than writing papers."
"He seems to have viewed PCR
as a means to a celebrity."
He left Cetus and as far as I could tell,
really stopped being a scientist.
... realized, I had in my hands
the thing that would make me famous,
'cause I knew that night
I was gonna get a Nobel Prize for that.
He used his publicity to
springboard his eccentric views.
He talked about seeing glowing raccoons
and being abducted by aliens.
He would go around saying
kind of crazy, shocking stuff.
Distrust your fellow man.
We're an arrogant little
bunch of naked apes.
He wrote this book
called "Dancing Naked in the Mind Field",
which the blurb on the book is amazing.
It's from the Washington
Post, and it's like:
"The strangest guy to ever win
the Nobel Prize in chemistry.
He just would do like weird stuff.
Did you see me eating those leaves?
Was that a drug?
He was an expert witness
in the OJ Simpson trial.
He started a company
where he would PCR DNA from famous
dead celebrities like Marilyn Monroe.
And then he would make
like little trinkets
out of them and sell them.
But not all of his
ideas were as harmless.
He didn't believe in global warming.
He didn't believe in the ozone hole.
He didn't believe that HIV caused AIDS.
HIV is not deadly. There's
not something called AIDS.
In the early 2000s, HIV
denialism in South Africa
was at a high,
while the country was battling
a crippling AIDS epidemic.
What we are facing is a catastrophe,
which is indescribable.
President Thabo Mbeki
was under the influence
of AIDS denialists.
Does HIV cause AIDS?
How does the virus cause
a syndrome? It can't.
An even invited Nobel Prize winner,
Kary Mullis, to weigh in on the issue.
Under Mbeki's leadership,
the government refused
to provide adequate
treatment for those affected.
And more than 330,000 people died.
Kary Mullis passed away in
August, 2019 at the age of 74
due to complications from pneumonia.
Nonetheless, the legacy of PCR lives on.
Just a year later,
the method reached perhaps
its most significant use yet,
as PCR COVID tests helped keep billions
of people safe throughout the pandemic.
Sometimes he's like, he's
very funny and charming
and a good storyteller,
but he's also, you feel
like he's a very sleazy guy.
He's like not a person
you'd want to be around.
He did have a sort of, a sparky mind.
He was not being forced by some company
to discover something.
He was playing.
It was like imaginative play.
He was like, I have these snippets
and what could I do with them?
And to me, he invented the solution,
and then like a huge field
of problems emerged to fit.
But maybe the real takeaway
from Mullis's story
is about automation.
I mean, he discovered PCR partly
because his day-to-day job
was taken over by a machine.
And this is a pretty important point
because all of us are maybe
staring down the barrel
of a future where machines
take over our jobs,
especially now with the surge
of AI and generative models.
And that's pretty scary.
But it could also force
us to come up with bigger,
more creative ideas, just
like it did for Kary Mullis.
Automation might open our
minds to breakthroughs
and discoveries that
could change the world.
(upbeat music)
Of course, making breakthroughs like PCR
take more than just opportunity.
