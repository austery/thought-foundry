Hey,
 Sorcin.
 I
 just
 went
 through
 the


comments.
 The
 one
 question
 keeps
 coming


up
 over
 again.


>> Why
 the
 are
 you
 writing
 this
 book?
 Jesus


Christ.
 What
 a
 party
 pooper.


>> What
 a
 party
 pooper.
 I
 don't
 know,
 man.


I
 don't
 think
 I
 think
 it's
 supposed
 to


be
 the
 the
 book's
 supposed
 to
 be
 like
 a


beach
 read.


>> A
 beach
 read?


>> Yes.


>> Come
 on.
 Did
 you
 read
 it?


>> My
 god.
 No.
 I
 saw
 the
 title.
 I
 was
 like,


skip.


>> All right,
 besties.
 I
 think
 that
 was


another
 epic
 discussion.
 People
 love
 the


interviews.
 I
 could
 hear
 him
 talk
 for


hours.
 Absolutely.


>> We
 crush
 your
 questions
 a
 minute.


>> We
 are
 giving
 people
 ground
 truth
 data


to
 underwrite
 your
 own
 opinion.
 What
 do


you
 guys
 think?
 That
 was
 fun.
 Palimat,


you
 you're
 going
 to
 love
 these


characters.
 I
 kid
 you
 not.
 I
 kid
 you


not.
 The
 people
 who
 do
 who
 are
 involved


in
 this
 at
 that
 time
 like
 the
 the
 main


character.


>> I
 totally
 agree
 with
 you.
 I
 I
 am
 a
 huge


to
 be
 honest.
 I've
 studied
 this
 period


for
 a
 while
 actually.
 I
 think
 it's
 great


that
 you
 wrote
 this
 book.
 I
 think
 it's


incredibly
 fascinating.
 We're
 here
 with


uh
 with
 Andrew
 Ross
 Sorcin
 Chimath
 and
 I


with
 another
 all-in
 interview,
 riveting.


Today
 we're
 going
 to
 talk
 about
 Andrew's


new
 book
 1929


and
 specifically
 cover
 why
 Andrew
 got


into
 it,
 what
 the
 history
 teaches
 us,


and
 are
 we
 looking
 at
 another
 1929
 or


something
 different
 this
 day
 and
 age
 as


a
 lot
 of
 people
 may
 speculate.
 But


Andrew,
 thanks
 for
 joining
 Chimath
 and
 I


to
 talk
 about
 this.


>> Thank
 you
 for
 having
 me
 and
 I
 love
 your


uh
 your
 background
 there.


a
 a
 a
 true
 image
 of
 what
 was
 actually


happening
 in
 October
 of
 1929,
 crazily


enough.


>> That's
 right.
 And
 it
 was
 colorized
 by


some
 AI
 or
 something,
 I
 think.
 But,
 uh,


yeah.
 Great.
 How
 and
 why
 did
 you
 get


into
 this
 era
 of
 1929,
 the
 great
 stock


market
 crash
 of
 1929.
 Like,
 you're
 a


busy
 guy.
 You're
 on
 TV
 every
 day.
 We
 see


you
 all
 over.
 You're
 at
 conferences.
 I


saw
 you
 at
 a
 conference
 in
 Southern


California
 this
 week.
 Then
 you're
 at


another
 conference
 and
 you're
 back
 in


New
 York.
 You're
 very
 busy.
 At
 what


point
 did
 you
 say,
 "Hey,
 I
 want
 to
 sit


down
 and
 write
 a
 book
 about
 this
 era."


>> Okay,
 so
 here's
 what
 happened
 to
 me.
 So,


I
 written
 that
 book,
 Too
 Big
 to
 Fail,


about
 the
 2008
 financial
 crisis,


>> right?


>> And
 people
 used
 to
 always
 say
 to
 me


after
 that,
 they'd
 get
 into
 these
 like


very
 in-depth
 conversations
 about
 1929


or
 they'd
 want
 to
 know
 more
 about
 1929.


And
 most
 people
 know
 that
 something


terrible
 happened
 in
 1929.
 They
 know


there
 was
 a
 crash
 in
 1929.
 They


oftenimes
 think
 it
 like
 is
 the
 great


depression
 or
 leads
 to
 the
 great


depression.
 But
 if
 you
 were
 to
 ever
 ask


most
 people
 now
 Chimath
 and
 you
 are


maybe
 in
 a
 different
 category
 and
 say


well
 who
 were
 the
 people
 who
 actually


were
 engaged
 in
 this
 what
 were
 they


saying
 to
 each
 other
 who
 was
 sleeping


with
 who?
 Who
 was
 trying
 to
 over
 who?


What
 was
 actually
 happening
 here
 and


what
 were
 the
 incentives
 and
 what
 were


the
 motivations
 that
 led
 to
 what
 clearly


were
 some
 poor
 decisions.


I
 couldn't
 find
 that.
 So,
 I
 went
 on
 a


vacation
 like
 10
 years
 ago
 with
 my
 wife,


very
 nerdy,
 and
 I
 like
 downloaded
 all


these
 books
 to
 my
 Kindle.


>> And
 there's
 some
 great
 books,
 by
 the


way,
 about
 this
 period,
 don't
 get
 me


wrong,


>> but
 they
 didn't
 have
 the
 sort
 of


character
 driven
 story.
 Like,
 I
 loved


Den
 of
 Thieves.
 I
 loved
 Barbarians
 of


the
 Gate.
 I
 loved
 stories
 about
 people.


>> Fabulous
 books.
 Fabulous
 books.


>> What
 did
 your
 wife
 think
 when
 you


ignored
 her
 the
 entire
 vacation
 you
 guys


were
 on
 were
 just
 reading
 books
 on
 your


Kindle?
 I
 mean,
 I
 think
 she
 thought
 I


was
 out
 of
 my
 mind,
 but
 um
 No.
 So,
 I
 I


read
 I
 I
 read
 these
 books
 and
 I
 was


like,
 "Okay,
 where's
 the
 story?
 Where's


the
 where
 are
 the
 people?"


>> Before
 you
 get
 to
 the
 people,
 can
 you


can
 you
 give
 people
 a
 concise


>> t
 like
 I
 was
 going
 to
 ask
 you
 for
 a


TikTok
 of
 the


overarching
 economic
 issues
 before
 we


get
 to
 the
 sort
 of
 the
 characters


because
 I
 think
 Yeah.
 Because
 I
 think


what
 to
 your
 point
 which
 is
 an
 important


one,
 people
 think
 it
 was
 like
 a
 okay


stocks
 went
 down,


>> right?


>> But
 the
 other
 things
 like
 the
 overp


production
 of
 the
 economy,
 tightening


interest
 rates,
 the
 war
 debt,
 like
 all


of
 this
 stuff
 was
 just
 comingled
 and


nobody
 fully
 understands
 that.
 Can
 you


>> maybe
 give
 folks
 a
 precise


representation
 of
 the
 setup?
 The


>> setup.
 Okay.
 So,
 so
 let's
 just
 go
 back


even
 let's
 go
 back
 to
 1919
 because


actually
 I
 think
 that's
 a
 critical
 year.


So
 prior
 to
 1919
 in
 America,
 people
 did


not
 really
 borrow
 money.
 It
 was
 like
 a


moral
 sin
 to
 to
 to
 get
 credit.
 Like


people
 didn't
 do
 it.


>> In
 1919,


General
 Motors
 says,
 "You
 know what?


We're
 going
 to
 start
 lending
 people


money


>> so
 that
 you
 can
 buy
 a
 car."
 And
 that
 was


actually
 like
 a
 major
 inflection
 point


in
 America


>> because
 then
 Sears
 Robuck
 clocks
 what's


going
 on
 and
 says,
 "Okay,
 we're
 going
 to


do
 this
 too
 for
 appliances."
 And
 then
 a


guy
 named
 Charlie
 Mitchell
 who
 ran
 a


bank
 called
 National
 City
 which
 becomes


Cityroup
 says
 you
 know
 what
 we
 can
 do


this
 for
 stocks.
 So,
 you
 know,
 and
 and


all
 of
 a
 sudden
 brokerage
 houses
 are


opening
 up,
 you
 know,
 on
 the
 corners
 of


streets
 the
 way
 we
 see
 Starbucks
 today.


It's
 like
 literally
 like
 that.
 And
 you


could
 go
 into
 one
 of these
 places
 and


you
 could
 put
 a
 buck
 down
 and
 they
 would


literally
 loan
 you
 $10


off
 of
 your
 dollar.
 I
 mean,
 that's
 how


insane
 things
 were.
 And
 at
 the


>> ter
 there
 was
 no
 risk
 underwriting
 of


any
 kind.


>> Zero
 risk
 underwriting.


>> But
 nobody
 understood
 what
 they
 were.


>> By
 the
 way,
 there's
 no
 SEC.
 There's
 no


regulations.
 Somebody
 who
 who
 who
 read


this
 book
 early
 said,
 "Oh,
 in
 your


research,
 did
 you
 get
 a
 chance
 to
 read


any
 of
 the
 prospectuses
 for
 the


companies?"
 I
 was
 like,
 "Perspectuses?


Like
 if
 there
 was
 like
 a
 leaflet
 that


they
 handed
 out
 on
 the
 street,
 you'd
 be


lucky."
 So
 there's
 no
 there's
 nothing.


>> And
 it's
 just
 like
 a
 complete
 go-
 go


era.
 Forget
 about
 1929.
 In
 1928,
 the


stock
 market
 went
 up
 48%.


So,
 people
 are
 just,
 there's
 just
 sort


of
 like
 this,
 it's
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 the


Chuck
 Prince
 when
 the
 music's
 playing,


you're
 dancing,
 and
 everybody's
 dancing,


and
 nobody's
 even
 thinking
 about
 the


music
 stopping
 kind
 of
 like
 ever.
 Now,


meanwhile,
 there's
 also
 these


technological
 changes.
 I
 mean,
 huge


generational
 technological
 changes.
 In


the
 same
 way,
 I
 think
 we're
 probably


talking
 about
 like
 AI
 today,
 radio.
 So


RCA
 was
 like
 the
 Nvidia
 of
 its
 time.


Everybody
 wanted
 into
 RCA.
 The
 stock


ticker
 was
 radio
 because
 it
 was
 like
 the


it
 was
 like
 going
 to
 change
 the
 world.


And
 and
 the
 other
 big
 piece
 of
 this
 was


also
 similar
 to
 today
 this
 idea
 of


democratizing
 finance.
 It
 was
 like
 okay


the
 elites
 have
 had
 their
 way.
 They've


made
 all
 the
 money.
 We're
 now
 going
 to


let
 everybody
 in
 on
 the
 action.
 Now,
 the


difference
 between
 then
 and
 now
 though


was
 there
 was
 also
 like
 crazy
 amounts
 of


manipulation,
 insider
 trading.
 As
 I


said,
 there
 were
 no
 rules.
 Like


literally
 no
 rules.
 Nobody's
 going
 to


jail
 for
 this
 stuff
 because
 it
 didn't


there
 wasn't
 a
 rule
 against
 it.


>> By
 the
 way,
 it
 wasn't
 just
 individuals


that
 was
 investing
 and
 overextended
 with


margin.
 But
 the
 banks
 would
 take


depositors
 money
 and
 they
 were
 going


long
 the
 stock
 market.


>> The
 the
 the
 banks
 the
 banks
 were
 doing


it.
 By
 the
 way,
 the
 bank
 not
 only
 the


banks,
 regular
 old
 corporations.
 I
 mean,


could
 you
 imagine
 could
 you
 imagine
 if


it
 turned
 out
 that
 like
 JP
 Morgan
 and


Goldman
 was
 going
 long
 in
 video
 with


depositor
 funds?
 That's
 that's
 the


effective
 equivalent
 of
 what
 was


happening
 back
 then,
 too.


>> You
 had
 you
 had
 corporations
 taking


their
 balance
 sheet,
 right,


>> and
 effectively
 then
 loaning
 it
 out
 so


that
 people
 could
 go
 buy
 stocks.
 That


was
 the
 other
 thing
 was
 happening.


there's
 a
 sort
 of
 like
 just
 the
 the
 push


towards
 investing
 and
 and
 overprouction


and
 and
 all
 sorts
 of
 other
 things


created
 this
 sort
 of
 frothy
 market.
 And


you
 had
 a
 Fed.
 You
 mentioned
 the
 Fed,


which
 is
 an
 interesting
 part
 of
 this.


There
 was
 a
 Fed.
 It
 was
 new.
 Started
 in


1913.
 They
 knew
 this
 was
 a
 mess.
 Like


they
 kept
 saying
 to
 themselves,
 you
 read


all
 the
 diaries
 and
 notes
 that
 I
 was
 in


for
 the
 last
 eight
 years.
 They
 knew


there
 was
 a
 problem.
 But
 they
 were


scared
 out
 of
 their
 mind
 about
 doing


what
 they
 probably
 should
 have
 done,


which
 was
 raise
 interest
 rates,
 but
 they


couldn't
 pull
 off
 like
 a
 vulker
 kind
 of


thing.


>> Can
 you
 sorry,
 but
 can
 you
 double
 click


into
 what
 you
 said
 about
 the
 fact
 that


there
 was
 a
 social
 contagion
 around


wealth
 creation
 that
 people
 felt
 like


the
 elites
 had
 had
 their
 way
 and
 now
 it


was
 everybody
 else's
 turn.
 Just
 describe


that
 like
 what
 had
 caused
 that
 and
 what


amplified
 that
 social
 cont
 and
 who
 and


who
 was
 everyone
 else?
 Were
 these


factory
 workers
 because
 we're
 kind
 of
 on


the
 heels
 of
 a
 big
 industrial
 buildout.


So
 like
 was
 it
 the
 FA
 folks
 were
 had


savings
 for
 the
 first
 time
 like
 where's


this
 coming
 from?


>> Well,
 so
 what's
 really
 happening
 is
 you


have
 a
 lot
 of
 folks
 who
 are
 coming
 from


the
 from
 farms
 frankly
 and
 moving
 to
 the


big
 cities
 for
 the
 first
 time.
 That's
 a


huge
 part
 part
 of
 what's
 happening.
 So


most
 of
 the
 trading
 I
 should
 say
 is


happening
 in
 the
 big
 cities.
 It's
 not


happening
 you
 know
 out
 out
 in
 small


towns.
 It's
 happening
 in
 big
 cities
 for


the
 most
 part.
 But
 but
 that
 whole
 sort


of
 scenario


once
 they're
 in
 the
 big
 city
 and
 they're


seeing
 that
 there's
 sort
 of
 this
 wealthy


group
 of
 people,
 talk
 about
 inequality,


this
 wealthy
 group
 of
 people
 and
 they


want
 in
 on
 the
 action.
 And
 also
 by
 the


way
 the
 people
 at
 the
 top,
 meaning
 the


bankers
 and
 investors
 and
 entrepreneurs


are
 like,
 we
 think
 there's
 this
 big


opportunity
 to
 open
 this
 up
 for
 the


little
 guy
 or
 the
 ordinary
 investor.
 We


think
 this
 is
 like
 a
 huge
 opportunity.


There
 was
 a
 guy
 named
 John
 Rascco
 who's


sort
 of
 like
 the
 Elon
 Musk
 of
 his
 era.


Um
 he
 actually
 ran
 General
 Motors,


created
 the
 credit
 program
 there,
 then


becomes
 hugely
 wealthy,
 then
 gets
 into


politics
 by
 the
 way,
 ends
 up
 building


the
 Empire
 State
 Building.
 But
 he
 was


trying
 to
 create
 almost
 like
 the
 first


mutual
 fund


>> because
 he
 thought
 that
 people
 should
 be


able
 to
 get
 in
 on
 the
 action
 the
 way
 he


did.
 That
 was
 like
 his
 whole
 conceit.


And
 he
 talked
 about
 it
 pretty
 openly.


There
 was
 a
 famous
 article
 called


everyone
 ought
 to
 be
 rich.
 Uh
 that
 was


his
 line.
 everyone
 ought
 to
 be
 rich.
 And


it
 also
 was
 a
 time
 where
 sort
 of
 the


American
 dream
 shifted
 a
 little
 bit,
 I


think,
 from
 sort
 of
 a
 Horatio
 Alra
 story


a
 little
 bit
 to
 like
 a
 lottery,
 can
 we


get
 rich?
 Like
 can
 like
 the
 whole
 idea


of
 capitalism
 is
 going
 to
 give
 us
 this


great
 opportunity?
 And
 I,
 you
 know,


obviously
 we're
 today.
 Do
 you
 think
 that


radio
 played
 a
 role
 in
 that
 because
 it


amplified
 these
 stories
 and
 made
 them
 go


faster
 and
 people
 would
 just
 like
 start


to
 tell
 these
 tales
 and
 folks
 started
 to


forget
 the
 Horatio
 Alger
 part?
 Like
 I'm


just
 still
 trying
 to
 understand
 like
 I


>> you
 have
 you
 have
 folks
 on
 the
 farms,


right?
 They're
 getting
 educated.
 The


industrial
 revolution
 is
 happening.
 So


they're
 moving
 to
 the
 city
 and
 the
 radio


then
 is
 maybe
 what
 Instagram
 is
 like


now.
 You're
 seeing
 people
 with
 wealth.


You're
 seeing
 this
 wealth
 that
 you
 don't


have.
 You
 aspire
 to
 that.


>> Yes.
 and
 then
 something
 comes
 in
 and


fills
 the
 void.
 Is
 that
 is
 that
 kind
 of


the
 mechanic?


>> I
 think
 something
 fills
 the
 void
 and
 all


of
 a
 sudden
 you
 now
 have
 the
 opportunity


because
 this
 the
 the
 bank
 or
 the


brokerage
 houses
 are
 going
 to
 lend
 you


all
 this
 money
 and
 it's
 not
 just
 radio


being
 the
 communication
 device.
 It's


really
 the
 media.
 So
 the
 other
 thing


that
 was
 happening
 during
 this
 period
 so


Time
 magazine
 starts
 in
 1923,
 Forbes


1917.


All
 of
 a
 sudden,
 Charlie
 Mitchell,
 the


CEOs,
 are
 now
 on
 the
 cover
 of
 magazines


the
 way
 Babe
 Ruth
 and
 Charles
 Lindberg


had
 been
 on
 the
 cover.
 So,
 sort
 of
 the


the
 shift
 in
 how
 people
 even
 thought


about
 business.
 Uh,
 none
 of
 these
 guys


were,


you
 know,
 famous
 before
 the
 1920s,
 but


they
 became
 famous
 and
 everybody
 wanted,


everybody
 wanted
 to
 be
 them.


>> This
 was
 what
 America
 was
 about
 was
 this


industrialization,
 right?
 And
 this
 was


kind
 of
 like,
 hey,
 we're
 pioneering
 an


entirely
 new
 world
 and
 these
 are
 the


leaders
 doing
 it
 and
 these
 are
 the
 rock


stars
 that
 are
 transform
 transforming


this
 country.
 I
 mean,
 was
 that
 kind
 of
 a


big
 part
 of
 what
 was
 going
 on
 at
 the


time?


>> Totally.
 And
 everybody
 wanted
 to
 be


everybody
 wanted
 to
 be
 a
 rockstar.
 By


the
 way,
 it's
 the
 same
 way
 everybody


wants
 to
 be
 you
 David
 or
 everybody
 wants


to
 be
 Chimatha
 or
 they
 all
 want
 to
 be


Elon.
 Like
 I
 think
 there
 was
 a
 huge


thing
 like
 okay
 and
 here's
 this


opportunity
 and
 they
 were
 being
 sold
 the


opportunity
 and
 given
 the
 opportunity


not
 just
 to
 invest
 but
 again
 I
 think


that
 the
 margin
 piece
 of
 it
 was
 such
 a


crucial
 crucial
 element.
 Do
 you
 think


it's
 a
 coincidence,
 Andrew,
 that
 now


you're
 you're
 publishing
 this
 book
 in


2025,
 but
 like
 how
 does
 it
 feel
 like


eerily
 similar
 to
 you?
 Like
 way
 too


similar
 where
 you
 can
 almost
 map
 one
 to


one
 those
 boundary
 conditions
 then
 in


some
 version
 of
 that
 today
 like
 is
 that


is
 that
 what


>> like
 a
 little
 bit
 but
 not
 I
 will
 say


that
 wasn't
 my
 intent
 like
 when
 I
 got


involved
 in
 this


>> I
 just
 wanted
 to
 retell
 the
 story
 and


figure
 out
 who
 these
 guys
 were.
 I
 I


ended
 up
 after
 that
 crazy
 vacation
 with


my
 wife.
 I
 ended
 up
 going
 to
 the
 Baker


Library.
 I
 happened
 to
 be
 giving
 a


speech
 at
 Harvard
 and
 I
 walk
 in
 there


and
 I
 had
 some
 time
 and
 I
 asked
 the


librarian.
 I
 said,
 "Can
 I
 see
 these


boxes?"
 This
 guy
 Thomas
 Lamont
 who
 ran


JP
 Morgan
 at
 the
 time
 and
 I
 said,
 "Can
 I


look
 inside
 these
 boxes?"
 And
 inside
 the


boxes,
 his
 secretary
 is
 keeping


transcripts
 of
 his
 phone
 calls
 with


Hoover
 and
 Roosevelt.


Like,
 by
 the
 way,
 same
 way
 like


everybody's
 probably
 talking
 to
 Trump
 or


Trump
 today.
 And
 I'm
 like,
 "Oh
 my
 god,
 I


haven't
 seen
 it."
 And
 you're
 seeing
 the


conversation.
 And
 I
 thought,
 "Okay,
 if


you
 could
 use
 those
 transcripts
 in
 an


actual
 story
 and
 then
 you
 could
 figure


out
 I
 didn't
 know
 if
 other
 transcripts


existed
 for
 all
 the
 other
 characters."


Yeah.


>> Wow.
 You
 could
 recreate
 this
 whole
 crazy


situation,


>> right?


>> But
 I
 didn't
 go
 into
 it
 thinking,
 okay,


this
 is
 all
 onetoone.
 And
 I
 don't
 think


it
 is
 onetoone.
 I
 think
 there's
 a
 lot
 of


leverage
 in
 the
 system
 today,
 but
 it's
 a


different
 kind
 of
 leverage.
 I
 like
 to


believe
 that
 there's
 now
 an
 SEC.
 There's


other
 regulations.


>> If
 you
 believe
 it,
 there
 is
 one.
 Paul's


doing
 a
 good
 job.
 He's
 there.


>> So,
 I'm
 not
 here
 to
 tell
 you
 that
 like


we're
 going
 off
 a
 cliff
 tomorrow.
 I


think
 there's
 probably
 some
 things
 that


are
 happening
 our
 economy
 today
 that
 do


mirror
 that
 period.
 And
 I
 hope
 there's


some
 lessons
 in
 here.
 But
 do
 you
 think


do
 you
 think
 the
 regulations
 that
 have


been
 in
 put
 in
 place
 over
 the
 past


hundred
 years
 and
 there
 have
 been


several
 cycles,
 one
 of
 which
 happened


after
 '08,
 of
 trying
 to
 create
 new


protective
 provisions
 around
 how
 we


operate
 in
 our
 financial
 markets,
 have


they
 actually
 changed
 things
 enough
 or


does
 the
 human
 element
 always
 find
 its


way?
 It
 always
 finds
 its
 way
 to


frothiness,
 to
 frenzies,


>> to
 these
 kind
 of
 moments
 of
 exuberance,


easy
 money.
 And
 this
 this
 like
 will


there'll
 always
 be
 a
 path,
 you
 know,


whether
 some
 people
 might
 argue
 crypto


tokens,
 there
 was
 an
 NFT
 moment
 a
 few


years
 ago.
 Wherever
 the
 regulation
 kind


of
 path
 of
 least
 resistance
 is,
 that's


where
 everyone
 goes.


>> Totally.


>> That's
 always
 going
 to
 be
 the
 case.


>> That's
 the
 human
 condition.
 We
 all
 want


more.
 You
 know,
 there's
 that
 great
 line


in
 um
 it's
 it's
 it's
 a
 Wall
 Street
 2
 uh


where
 I
 think
 Michael
 Douglas
 says
 to


Shai
 Labuff,
 I
 thought
 the
 second
 Wall


Street
 was
 not
 as
 good
 as
 the
 first
 one,


by
 the
 way.
 Says
 says
 something
 like,


"What's
 your
 number?"
 and
 he
 looks
 at


him
 and
 he
 goes,
 "More."
 Right?


>> And
 and
 that's


>> that's
 humans.
 That's
 humans.


>> And
 that's
 humans.
 And
 more
 means
 we're


all
 trying
 to
 figure
 out
 how
 we're
 going


to
 get
 to
 more.
 And


>> I
 think
 that
 that
 was
 what
 was
 going
 on


then.
 To
 some
 degree,
 it's
 what's
 going


on
 now.
 I
 think


>> it's
 always
 going
 on.
 It
 never
 changes.


It's
 not
 like
 there's
 some
 unique
 moment


today.
 Maybe
 there's
 technology
 that's


kind
 of
 unlocked
 this
 kind
 of
 new
 cycle.


Look,
 the
 other
 piece
 of
 this
 and
 it
 was


actually
 a
 lesson
 for
 me
 that
 I
 still


grapple
 with
 today.
 I
 think
 people
 think


the
 word
 speculation
 is
 like
 a
 dirty


word.
 And
 the
 truth
 is,
 having
 now


written
 this
 book
 and
 too
 big
 to
 fail


and
 just
 spending,
 you
 know,
 all
 this


time
 reporting
 on
 all
 this,
 you
 need


speculation.
 Speculation
 is
 the
 twin
 of


innovation.


>> Putting
 your
 capital
 at
 risk.
 There
 is


no
 it's
 price
 discovery.
 It's
 risk


discovery.
 It
 is
 the
 hard


>> underbelly
 of
 innovation.
 I
 completely


agree
 with


>> there
 is
 no
 innovation
 without
 some


speculation.
 Elon
 Musk
 would
 not
 have


created
 Tesla
 and
 said
 somebody


speculated
 on
 him
 early
 when
 it
 all


seemed
 totally
 insane.


>> No.
 And
 also
 he's
 probably
 speculated


himself
 in
 50
 different
 ideas
 that
 never


saw
 the
 light
 of
 day.
 That's
 what
 it


means.
 It's
 like
 you're
 investing
 risk


capital.
 That
 capital
 is
 not
 always


money.
 It's
 a
 lot
 of
 time
 it's
 time
 and


reputation
 as
 well.
 It's
 convincing


other
 people
 to
 come
 work
 on
 something


and
 you're
 doing
 it
 speculatively.


That's
 what
 Silicon
 Valley
 does.
 Betting


on
 the
 come.


>> And
 so
 then
 the
 question
 becomes,
 how
 do


you
 create
 an
 environment
 where
 you
 can


have
 speculation?
 Not
 just
 have
 it,
 but


encourage
 it,
 but
 not
 let
 it
 get
 out
 of


control,
 right?
 Like
 that
 is
 the
 sort
 of


fundamental
 question.


>> What
 ends
 up
 happening,
 Andrew,
 is
 like


no
 one
 gives
 a
 when
 a
 big
 fund
 manager


or
 a
 big
 bank
 or
 some
 kind
 of
 dark
 pool


of
 capital
 loses
 loses
 money.
 But
 when


it
 hits
 the
 consumer,
 when
 it
 hits
 the


individual,
 then
 there's
 this
 rush
 to


protection.
 It's
 like
 we
 need
 to
 protect


the
 system.
 We
 need
 to
 kind
 of
 protect


the
 consumer
 because
 they're
 always
 the


ones
 that
 get
 taken
 advantage
 of.
 Is


that
 kind
 of
 fair?
 And
 if
 as
 you
 look
 at


what
 happened
 coming
 out
 of


>> 100%
 out
 of08,


>> look,
 you
 can
 look
 at
 both
 of
 those


things.
 You
 could
 look
 at,
 by
 the
 way,
 I


think
 an
 interesting
 one
 because
 we're


now
 dealing
 with
 it
 now
 is
 the


accredited
 investor
 rule.
 So,
 you
 know,


by
 the
 way,
 that
 really
 goes
 back
 to
 the


19
 late
 1930s
 or
 1940.
 You
 know,
 the


idea
 was
 we
 only
 wanted
 the
 wealthy
 to


be
 able
 to
 have
 opportunities
 to
 invest


in
 private
 companies
 because
 they
 were


the
 only
 ones
 that
 we
 thought
 should
 be


prepared
 to
 lose
 the
 money
 and
 we
 didn't


want
 the
 little
 guy
 to
 lose
 the
 money.


>> Here
 we
 are
 now
 in
 uh
 you
 know
 2025
 and


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 folks
 saying
 you
 know
 I


want
 I
 want
 the
 access.
 I
 want
 the


opportunity.
 And
 you
 know
 sometimes
 like


I
 remember
 Chimath
 you
 and
 I
 probably


talked
 about
 this
 years
 ago.
 I
 remember


I
 either
 talk
 about
 like
 GameStop
 or


some
 of
 these
 other
 companies
 and
 tell


people
 you
 know
 oh
 you
 got
 to
 be
 careful


guys
 this
 could
 go
 wrong.
 I
 said
 that
 a


little
 bit
 some
 about
 spacky
 stuff
 and


some
 other
 things
 and
 people
 like
 Sorcin


stop
 it
 you're
 not
 protecting
 me
 you're


protecting
 the
 man.


>> You're
 protecting
 the
 man
 and
 it
 was


sort
 of


>> regulatory
 capture.


>> It's
 a
 very
 interesting
 concept.
 So
 I


anyway
 I
 haven't
 come
 up
 with
 a
 you
 know


a
 neat
 answer
 about
 that
 but
 I
 do
 think


about
 it
 a
 lot.


>> Well
 to
 your
 point
 I
 think
 the
 the
 40s


act
 1940
 act
 I
 think
 it
 was
 it's
 been
 a


very
 complicated
 piece
 of
 legislation


because
 if
 you
 fast
 forward
 to
 today


we're
 still
 trying
 to
 unwind
 and
 fit
 a


square
 peg
 into
 a
 round
 hole
 if
 you


will.
 The
 entire
 crypto
 economy
 contorts


itself
 around
 the
 40
 act


>> right?


>> All
 these
 BDCs
 contort
 itself.
 private


credit
 contorts
 itself
 and
 why?
 Well,


right
 now
 we
 don't
 have
 the
 regulatory


will
 to
 just
 go
 and
 have
 a
 wholesale
 rip


and
 replace
 of
 what
 is
 really
 old


legislation.
 I
 think
 Scott,


>> do
 you
 want
 to
 talk
 about
 the
 Kimat?
 Do


you
 want
 to
 just
 describe
 the
 40s
 act?


Like
 what's
 in
 it?


>> Well,
 it
 it
 was
 basically
 written
 as
 a


way
 to
 sort
 of
 try
 to
 delineate
 what
 is


a
 security,
 what
 is
 allowed
 to
 be


traded,
 what
 kind
 of
 businesses
 can
 be


public.
 And
 at
 the
 time
 with
 the


understanding
 that
 they
 had
 of
 the


economy,
 it
 all
 made
 sense.
 There
 was
 a


pretty
 bright
 line
 of
 here's
 a


commodity,
 here's
 a
 security,
 and
 here's


what
 is
 allowed.
 The
 problem
 is,
 as


we've
 seen,
 is
 that
 businesses
 today
 in


2025
 are
 way
 too
 dynamic,
 and
 they
 don't


map
 to
 the
 brittle
 definitions
 of
 80


years
 ago.
 The
 problem
 is
 that
 when
 you


try
 to
 go
 and
 rewrite
 those
 rules,
 there


isn't
 the
 legislative
 will
 because
 what


Andrew
 says
 comes
 up
 over
 and
 over


again,
 which
 is
 the
 fear
 of
 what
 could


go
 wrong
 stops
 people
 from
 doing
 what
 I


think
 could
 go
 right
 and
 that
 has
 pretty


profound
 consequences.
 I
 think
 I
 think


in
 part
 when
 you
 look
 at
 what
 happened


in
 GFC,
 you
 can
 pull
 the
 string
 back
 to


to
 the
 1940s
 and
 the
 40
 act
 and
 people's


reaction
 to
 to
 regulations.
 the
 savings


and
 loan
 crisis.
 That's
 another
 one
 that


was
 absolutely
 unnecessary
 but
 happened


because
 we
 tried
 to
 contort
 ourselves
 to


expand
 the
 economy
 in
 ways
 that
 were


brittle.
 Andrew,
 I
 want
 to
 ask
 you
 a


question,
 which
 is
 if
 we
 go
 back
 to
 the


29,
 so
 we
 we
 have
 a
 good
 sense
 of
 the


the
 setup.


>> Yeah.


>> Can
 you
 explain
 the
 big
 characters
 and


>> who
 they
 were
 and
 the
 roles
 that
 they


were
 playing?


>> Okay.
 So
 there's
 there's
 there's
 two


there's
 a
 whole
 bunch
 of
 characters,
 but


I'd
 say
 there's
 two
 main
 characters
 in


this
 book
 that
 really
 drive
 the


storyline.


One
 is
 Charlie
 Mitchell,
 this
 fellow
 who


runs
 National
 City.
 He
 is
 the
 Jaime


Diamond
 of
 his
 time
 in
 terms
 of
 fame.
 He


might
 actually
 be
 more
 like
 Michael


Milin
 because
 he
 he
 really
 does
 develop


sort
 of
 credit
 for
 the
 public.
 Michael


of
 course
 did
 it
 uh
 for
 businesses
 later


but
 um


>> he
 they
 used
 to
 call
 him
 Sunshine


Charlie
 and
 he
 was
 on
 the
 board
 of
 the


New
 York
 Fed.


>> He
 was
 constantly
 calling
 for
 lower


interest
 rates
 interestingly
 during
 all


of
 this
 and
 he
 was
 the
 guy
 who
 was
 not


just
 loaning
 to
 uh
 speculators
 and


stockholders.
 He
 was
 also
 uh
 loaning


money
 to
 different
 brokerage
 houses


across
 the
 country.
 On
 the
 other
 side
 of


the
 story
 in
 Washington
 is
 a
 guy
 who
 you


probably
 heard
 of
 or
 know
 named
 Carter


Glass.


>> Yeah.


>> Carter
 Glass
 was
 the
 Elizabeth
 Warren
 of


his
 time
 or
 maybe
 even
 like
 AOC.


>> AOC.
 Yeah.


>> And
 he
 would,
 by
 the
 way,
 uh
 he
 was
 like


a
 a
 racist
 Elizabeth
 Warren,


interestingly,
 uh
 given
 the
 weird
 things


going
 on
 down
 there
 at
 the
 time.
 Anyway,


he
 would
 rail
 for
 years
 about
 this
 thing


that
 he
 described
 as
 mitchellism.
 He


believed
 that
 Charlie
 Mitchell
 and
 what


Charlie
 Mitchell
 was
 doing
 was
 going
 to


upend
 the
 economy
 effectively.
 And
 as


the
 story
 plays
 out,
 they
 are
 sort
 of


pitted
 against
 each
 other.
 One
 of
 the


things
 that
 Charlie
 does
 is
 he
 defies
 or


at least
 appears
 at
 one
 point
 to
 defy


the
 Federal
 Reserve,
 which
 is
 trying
 to


clamp
 down
 on
 speculation.
 They
 don't


try
 to
 raise
 interest
 rates.
 What
 they


weirdly
 do
 is
 they
 send
 a
 letter
 to
 all


the
 banks
 saying,
 "Please
 stop
 lending


to
 speculators."
 And
 the
 banks
 don't


know
 what
 that
 even
 means.
 So
 they
 stop


lending
 basically
 to
 everybody.
 And


Charlie
 says,
 "We're
 not
 going
 to
 have


that.
 So
 we're
 going
 to
 start
 lending


ourselves."
 And
 that
 sort
 of
 creates


this
 whole
 other
 dynamic
 which
 leads
 him


to
 end
 up
 being
 in
 front
 of
 Congress.


And
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 give
 away
 the
 story,


but
 he
 does
 get
 arrested
 on
 the
 steps
 of


his
 own
 home
 for
 doing
 some
 crazy
 things


later
 in
 the
 story.
 But
 those
 two
 sort


of
 play
 a
 big
 role.
 Then
 you
 get
 to
 see


how
 Glass
 Stebo
 came
 about,
 which
 by
 the


way
 is
 shocking
 because
 it
 is
 not
 what


you
 would
 think
 at
 all.
 It
 almost
 has


nothing
 to
 do
 I
 don't
 want to
 say
 it
 has


nothing
 to
 do
 with
 breaking
 the
 banks


apart
 for
 like
 political
 reasons,
 but
 it


actually
 has
 to
 do
 with
 uh
 business


reasons,
 meaning
 there
 was
 like
 some


major
 bank
 money
 and
 lobbying
 going
 on


behind
 the
 scenes
 to
 f
 over
 JP
 Morgan
 by


the
 guys
 who
 were
 running
 Chase
 and
 the


Rockefellers.
 So,
 it's
 it's
 wild.
 The


story
 is
 wild.
 Okay.
 So,
 just
 the


summary,
 but
 the
 glass
 deagle
 I
 think
 as


I
 understand
 it,
 but
 tell
 me
 basically


separates
 commercial
 banks
 and


investment
 banks.


>> Separate
 separates
 commercial
 banks
 and


investment
 banks


>> and
 then
 sets
 up
 the
 FDI
 basically


>> and
 sets
 up
 the
 FDI,


>> right?


>> Again,
 when
 you
 see
 how
 that
 all
 came


together,
 the
 FDI
 piece
 of
 it,
 it
 the


the
 backstory
 of
 like
 these
 laws.
 It's


not
 It's
 not
 coming
 from
 consumer


protection
 as
 much
 as
 you're
 saying


lobbying
 to
 try
 to
 basically
 like


marginalize
 the
 800
 pound
 gorilla.


>> Exactly.
 Exactly.
 And
 and
 you'll
 see
 it.


You
 will
 be
 in
 the
 room
 with
 these


people
 literally
 going
 in
 there
 sitting


in
 the
 White
 House
 begging
 Roosevelt
 to


do
 this.
 And
 and
 by
 the
 way,
 Carter


Glass
 is
 actually
 unhappy
 about
 it.
 I


found
 letters
 where
 Carter
 Glass
 is
 like


this
 bill
 is
 getting
 taken
 away
 from
 me


and
 is
 basically
 being
 taken
 over
 by
 the


bankers
 which
 is
 almost
 hilarious


because
 Elizabeth
 Warren
 loves
 to
 cite


this
 bill
 as
 sort
 of
 some
 panacea.


>> Andrew
 as
 you
 look
 at
 markets
 today
 just


to
 come
 back
 to
 the
 modern
 era
 I
 don't


want
 to
 ask
 you
 the
 the
 simple
 like
 draw


the
 parallels
 but
 are
 are
 we
 in
 and
 and


I've
 heard
 you
 ask
 this
 question
 a
 lot


lately
 like


>> are
 we
 in
 a
 monetary
 bubble?
 Are
 we
 in


an
 inflationary
 bubble?
 Are
 we
 in
 a


speculative
 bubble?
 Are
 we
 in
 no
 bubble?


>> So,
 I'm
 assuming
 we're
 in
 some
 bubble


and
 we
 just
 don't
 know
 when
 it's
 going


to
 pop
 of
 some
 sort.
 And
 by
 the
 way,
 we


don't
 know
 how
 big
 it's
 going
 to
 pop


either.
 You
 don't
 It
 doesn't
 have
 to
 be


1929.
 It
 could
 be
 1999,
 could
 be
 2008,


could
 be
 smaller
 than
 that.
 I
 I
 don't


know.
 Do
 I
 think
 that
 there's
 leverage?


I
 mean,
 you
 guys
 talk
 about
 this
 AI


investment
 phenomenon
 that's
 taking


place
 right
 now.
 And
 for
 the
 most
 part,


the
 big
 corporations
 are
 spending
 real


cash.
 So,
 it's
 not
 that's
 not
 leverage.


But
 you
 look
 at
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 real
 estate


plays,
 the
 energy
 plays
 that
 sort
 of
 on


the
 periphery
 of
 this,
 there's
 a
 lot
 of


leverage
 there.
 I
 think
 the
 the
 private


credit
 world,
 we
 don't
 really
 know
 where


all
 the
 leverage
 lies
 right
 now.
 Now,
 I


don't
 think
 that
 any
 of
 that
 is
 as


leveraged
 as
 what
 we
 were
 talking
 about


this
 like
 10
 to
 one
 situation
 in
 1929
 or


maybe
 or
 even
 like
 the
 subprime


situation
 in
 2008.
 But
 I
 don't
 know,
 at


some
 point
 you
 start
 to
 look
 at
 some
 of


these,
 you
 know,
 like
 the
 Nvidia
 OpenAI


deal
 or
 the
 AMD
 deal
 and
 there
 is
 a


little
 bit
 of
 a
 circular
 kind
 of


thing
 going
 on
 there
 uh
 for
 now.
 And
 I


just
 don't
 know
 where
 but
 that
 could
 be


we
 could
 still
 be
 years
 we
 could
 still


be
 years
 away
 from
 this
 and
 by
 the
 way


it
 could
 work
 out
 on
 the
 other
 end.


>> But
 what
 about
 like
 government
 monetary


fiscal
 issues?
 the
 central
 bank
 monetary


policy


>> interest
 rates
 and
 then
 the
 fiscal


issue,
 the
 government
 spending
 right


now.


>> Ultimately,
 if
 you
 have
 a
 devaluation
 of


the
 dollar,
 we're
 seeing
 gold
 at
 4,000


bucks
 an
 ounce.
 We're
 seeing
 the
 dollar


basket
 trade
 down.
 I
 think
 one
 of the


worst
 years
 we've
 ever
 seen
 this
 year.


Uh
 does
 that
 ultimately
 translate
 into
 a


higher
 index
 on
 the
 stock
 market
 because


the
 dollar
 is
 worth
 less?
 I
 mean
 should


you
 know
 could
 this
 actually
 be
 more
 of


a
 monetary
 or
 fiscal
 kind
 of
 problem


than
 it
 is
 a
 speculative
 kind
 of


problem?


>> Well
 so
 you
 would
 think
 it
 would
 be
 but


then
 explain.
 So
 yes
 I
 think
 like
 the


traditional
 the
 classic
 economist
 would


say
 this
 you
 know
 these
 things
 should


not
 be
 happening
 at
 the
 same
 time


meaning
 look
 at
 the
 price
 of
 equities


look
 at
 the
 price
 of
 gold
 look
 at
 the


price
 of
 you
 know
 US
 treasuries
 right


now.
 It
 doesn't
 at
 least
 classically
 it


shouldn't
 shouldn't
 line
 up
 the
 way
 it's


lining
 up
 right
 now.
 So
 I
 I
 just
 don't


know.
 I
 would
 have
 thought
 that
 the


investor
 class
 would
 have
 wanted
 to


charge
 us
 a
 higher
 premium
 for
 our
 bonds


these
 days
 for
 a
 whole
 bunch
 of
 reasons,


but
 they
 don't.
 Uh
 maybe
 that's
 just


like
 life
 is
 relative
 and
 other


countries
 are,
 you
 know,
 not
 doing
 as


well
 and
 so
 we're
 still
 the
 the


prettiest
 girl
 at
 the
 dance.


>> I
 think
 that's
 exactly
 right.


>> But
 we've
 never
 seen
 so
 much
 capital
 so


so
 much
 printing
 happening
 as
 we
 see


today.
 I
 mean
 the
 7%
 debt
 to
 GDP
 in


peace
 time
 with
 an
 expanding
 economy.


Never
 seen
 that
 before.


>> Totally.
 But
 then
 if
 that's
 the
 case,


you'd
 think
 that
 we'd
 all
 have
 our
 money


in
 Bitcoin
 and
 or
 gold,
 but
 but
 we


don't.
 Why
 is
 that?
 I
 don't
 know.


>> How
 do
 you
 invest?
 Anyone
 ever
 ask
 you


that?


>> Most
 people
 don't
 ask
 me
 that.
 And
 the


truth
 is
 I'm
 not
 allowed
 to
 invest
 in


individual
 stocks.
 It's
 actually
 given


what
 I
 do
 for
 a
 living.
 That's
 part
 of


the
 part
 of
 the
 deal
 part
 of
 the
 the


nunnery
 that
 I
 have
 to
 live
 in.


>> You're
 long
 the
 index.


>> I'm
 long
 the
 index.
 I
 am
 long


>> Bitcoin.
 Bitcoin
 gold.


>> I'm
 I'm
 long
 the
 indexes.
 And
 uh
 no,
 I
 I


I
 by
 the
 way,
 I
 wish
 I
 could.
 I
 thought


for
 many
 many
 years,
 it's
 probably


shifted
 now,
 but
 for
 years
 upon
 years,
 I


was
 always
 I
 think
 Chimath
 and
 I
 have


talked
 about
 this.
 I
 was
 always
 worried


about
 buying
 Bitcoin
 because
 I
 didn't


know
 I
 I
 didn't
 want
 to
 be
 on
 TV
 or
 in


the
 papers.


>> Oh,
 I
 I
 would
 do
 it.
 I
 came
 on
 CNBC
 and


I
 would
 tell
 Sorcin
 to
 buy
 it


>> 100
 a
 coin,
 200
 coin.
 Sorcin
 would
 show


me
 a
 clip
 of
 Charlie
 Munger
 telling
 me


that
 it
 was
 poison
 and
 he
 would
 say,


"Mon,
 what
 do
 you
 think?"


>> And
 I
 said,
 "I
 have
 tremendous
 respect


for
 Charlie
 and
 Warren,
 but
 they're


wrong."


>> I
 remember
 those
 moments
 fondly
 and


sadly
 because
 I
 should
 have
 I
 should


have
 listened.
 I
 should
 have
 listened.


>> But
 so,
 okay,
 so
 you
 have
 a
 very


balanced
 kind
 of
 portfolio.
 Pretty


vanilla
 down
 the
 middle.
 super
 I'm
 not


going
 to
 get
 index
 funds
 I'm
 not
 going


to
 get
 rich
 unfortunately
 uh
 on
 being
 a


journalist
 that
 restricts
 you
 from


access
 to the
 markets
 I
 mean
 you
 you


seem
 to
 have
 a
 good
 pulse
 on
 what's


going
 on
 but
 really
 what
 matters
 in


markets
 is
 having
 a
 pulse
 on
 what
 the


actors
 in
 the
 markets
 are
 doing


>> right


>> and
 you're
 not
 able
 to
 to
 act
 on
 it


>> I
 have
 misgivings
 about
 it
 how
 about


that


>> you're
 you're
 the
 character
 in
 your
 show


>> acts
 where
 you
 have
 all
 the
 inside
 info


but
 you
 can't
 do
 anything
 about
 it


>> can't
 do
 anything
 about
 Yeah,


>> exactly.
 But
 that's
 the
 point.
 I
 get
 it.


I
 I
 knew
 that's
 what
 I
 was
 signing
 up


for,
 so
 I'm
 I'm
 I'm
 cool
 with
 it.


>> I
 mean,
 do
 you
 like
 do
 you
 like
 being
 a


journalist?
 I
 mean,
 do
 you
 like
 sitting


as
 a
 speculator
 or
 an
 observer
 versus


being
 an
 actor?
 I
 mean,
 have
 you
 ever


thought
 like,
 man,
 I
 really
 understand


markets.
 I
 really
 understand
 the


parallels
 to
 history.
 I've
 got
 a
 good


sense
 of
 this.
 I
 I
 feel
 like
 I
 should


play
 a
 role.
 I
 want
 to
 play
 a
 role.
 I


can
 make
 money.


>> I
 think
 about
 that.
 I've
 thought
 about


that
 for
 years
 to


>> totally
 uh
 about,
 you
 know,
 could
 I


could
 I
 be
 an
 actor?
 could
 I
 play
 a


role?
 And
 I
 often
 go
 back
 to
 the
 idea


and
 may
 and
 look,
 maybe
 this
 is
 not
 the


right
 way
 to
 think
 about
 it,
 but
 I
 feel


like
 I've
 managed
 to
 have
 hopefully
 some


semblance
 of
 credibility
 with
 some


people
 by
 doing
 it
 this
 way.
 And
 I'm
 and


I've
 been
 able
 to
 be
 hopefully
 a
 a
 good


part
 of
 the
 conversation
 and
 be
 engaged


in
 a
 lot
 of
 things.
 Maybe
 I
 could
 do


that
 as
 as
 as
 a
 sort
 of
 a
 direct
 actor,


too.
 I
 don't
 know.
 I
 also
 think,
 by
 the


way,
 journalism
 seems
 to
 be
 changing.


MSM,
 legacy
 media.
 I
 mean,
 by
 the
 way,


there's
 a
 lot
 of people


>> or
 you
 could
 start
 a
 podcast
 and
 you


could
 just
 do
 whatever
 you
 want
 to
 do.


>> So,
 I
 don't
 know.
 I
 don't
 know
 what
 the


right
 answer
 is.


>> Tell
 us
 who
 are
 the
 characters
 in
 the


play
 today.
 Who
 are
 who
 are
 the
 actors?


Who
 are
 the
 main
 actors
 that
 you
 see
 in


>> That's
 a
 good
 question.
 Yeah.


>> Uh,
 the
 main
 actors,
 well,
 I
 think
 you'd


probably
 think
 about
 them
 in
 a
 couple


different
 ways.
 You
 sort
 of
 think
 about


on
 the
 financial
 side
 and
 probably
 the


tech
 side
 and
 where
 they
 sort
 of
 come


together.
 So,
 I
 think
 obviously
 and
 then


the
 government
 piece.
 So
 obviously
 the


president,
 Scott,
 Howard
 on
 on
 the
 sort


of
 business
 end
 of
 things
 inside
 the


inside
 the
 government.
 And
 then
 I
 think


in
 the
 banking
 or
 classic
 banking
 world,


you'd
 say
 that
 probably
 Jamie
 Diamond


and
 Larry
 Frink
 are
 probably
 the
 most


sort
 of
 powerful
 players
 in
 the
 sort
 of


traditional
 legacy
 piece,
 but
 then
 you'd


probably
 give
 a
 nod
 to
 Brian
 Armstrong


at
 Coinbase
 as
 sort
 of
 being
 one
 of
 the


sort
 of
 OGs
 in
 sort
 of
 wherever
 you


think
 crypto
 goes.
 By
 the
 way,
 I'd


probably
 hats
 off
 to
 uh
 to
 Vlad
 Tennov


who
 I
 think's
 been
 sort
 of
 very


outspoken
 sort
 of
 talk
 about


democratizing
 finance,
 right?
 Like
 he's


sort
 of
 represents
 that.
 But
 then
 you


tell
 me
 I
 mean
 I
 think
 Sam
 Alman
 and


Elon
 and
 wherever
 you
 think
 AI
 is
 headed


next
 and
 the
 Google
 guys.


>> But
 it's
 interesting
 because
 you're


playing
 you're
 saying
 that
 technology


particularly
 AI
 is
 playing
 a
 key
 role
 in


>> Yes.


>> fundamentally.


>> It
 seems
 like
 it
 is.
 Do
 you
 think
 you


think
 that's
 true?
 Well,
 I'm
 asking


because
 you
 also
 I
 mean
 the
 capital


that's
 moving
 through
 banks.
 The
 there's


there's
 a
 whole
 another
 set
 of


industries
 that
 generate
 trillions
 of


dollars
 of
 revenue
 that
 seem
 to
 be


largely
 ignored
 in
 the
 conversation


about
 where
 the
 economy
 where
 the
 global


economy
 is,
 where
 it's
 headed,
 where


markets
 are
 headed.
 It's
 all
 about
 AI,


right?
 I
 mean,
 and
 I
 I
 think
 that's
 like


>> but
 that's
 because
 and
 I
 guess
 the


question
 is
 like
 is
 that
 a
 media
 thing


or
 is
 that
 like
 a
 real
 economy
 thing?
 I


think
 it's
 a
 real
 economy
 thing
 because


I
 think
 if
 you
 if
 you
 x
 out
 the
 mag
 7


Yeah.


>> all
 of a
 sudden
 the
 economy
 does
 not


look
 nearly
 the
 same.
 I
 mean
 I
 don't


want
 to
 say
 we're
 levitating
 but
 you


know
 we're
 either


>> I
 saw
 a
 data
 point
 yesterday
 that
 said


the
 GDP
 quarterly
 GDP
 was
 like
 flat


excluding
 data
 center
 spending.
 Does


that
 sound
 right
 to
 you?
 Did
 you
 see


that?


>> It's
 definitely
 100
 to
 200
 basis
 points


of
 GDP.


>> Yeah.


>> So
 sure.
 So,
 so
 let's
 say
 if
 you
 if
 you


X
 out
 it
 if
 you
 X
 out
 the
 AI
 boom
 where


you
 know
 where
 do
 you
 really
 stand?
 I


think
 that's
 a
 real
 real
 life
 question.


I
 think
 the
 reason
 why
 no
 one's
 focused


on
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 economy
 first
 of
 all


the
 AI
 story
 I
 think
 is
 the
 more


exciting
 part
 but
 it
 is
 what
 I
 think
 is


I
 don't
 want
 to
 say
 propping
 up
 the


economy
 but
 it's
 keeping
 the
 economy


>> well
 I
 would
 I
 would
 flip
 it
 on
 its
 ear.


I
 don't
 I
 think
 that
 those
 comparisons


are
 kind
 of
 dumb
 because
 at
 every
 point


in
 the
 economy
 there
 are
 these
 dynamic


reallocation
 of
 resources
 and
 assets.


Things
 are
 important
 at
 different
 times.


I
 think
 the
 thing
 with
 the
 AI
 thing
 is


like
 what
 is
 every
 company
 doing
 to


figure
 out
 what
 they
 look
 like
 in
 a


world
 of
 AI
 and
 if
 they're
 not
 going
 to


spend
 that
 amount
 of
 time,
 their


productivity
 is
 probably
 going
 to
 on
 the


margin
 shrink
 to
 a
 net
 new
 company
 that


just
 does
 what
 they
 do
 just
 efficiently


and
 better.
 That's
 just
 the
 cycle
 of


creative
 destruction
 we've
 seen
 at
 every


point
 of
 every
 meaningful
 technology.


>> So
 you
 think
 we
 need
 to
 be
 talking
 about


this
 much
 more
 outside
 of
 the
 sort
 of


like
 tech
 and
 data
 centers
 and
 I
 made


this


>> Yeah,
 I
 made
 this
 comment.
 All
 the


private
 equity
 wives
 got
 their
 husbands


to
 come
 in
 and
 rail
 at
 me
 in
 the


comments
 and
 I
 said,
 you
 know,
 the
 the


least
 success
 I've
 had
 at
 this
 software


company
 I
 started
 has
 been
 selling
 into


private
 equity.
 It's
 like
 I
 have
 Fortune


500
 and
 Fortune
 1000
 customers
 lining


out
 the
 door.
 I
 couldn't
 sell
 to
 one


single
 private
 equity
 company
 what
 is


effectively
 a
 platform
 that
 uses
 AI
 to


rewrite
 all
 your
 software.
 And
 I'm
 like,


but
 this
 is
 the
 first
 company
 that


should
 be
 in
 line.
 And
 what
 it
 goes
 to


is
 that
 their
 heads
 are
 firmly
 in
 the


sand.
 And
 I
 think
 that's
 not
 a
 a


decision
 on
 technology.
 It's
 a


psychological
 decision.
 So
 I
 think
 the


weird
 thing
 with
 AI
 is
 that
 it
 pushes


people
 to
 a
 place
 of
 psychological


insecurity.
 And
 I
 think
 that
 they
 think


I
 don't
 want
 this
 to
 be
 my
 problem.
 I


need
 to
 just
 wait
 this
 out
 and
 somebody


else
 will
 deal
 with
 it
 in
 the
 future.


That's
 very
 different
 than
 other


technology
 arcs
 like
 you
 know
 in
 the
 dot


bubble.
 That's
 not
 what
 we
 live
 through.


In
 the
 social
 bubble
 or
 the
 mobile


bubble


>> it
 was
 always
 like
 okay
 this
 seems


interesting.
 Let's
 figure
 out
 how
 to


embrace
 it
 take
 advantage
 of
 it.
 This
 is


the
 one
 where
 many
 people
 are
 like
 nope


I'm
 just
 nope.


>> All right
 but
 here's
 the
 question.
 So,


you
 know,
 1932
 comes
 around
 and
 we
 had


unemployment
 in
 this
 country
 at
 25%.


>> 25%.
 Yeah.


>> It
 was
 pretty
 crazy.


>> Yeah.


>> If
 the
 AI
 boom
 is
 as
 successful
 as
 I


think
 we're
 all
 excited
 it
 could
 be
 and


it
 affects
 every
 industry
 in
 every
 way


and
 all
 the
 things
 we're
 we're


discussing
 here,
 there
 need
 to
 be


massive
 productivity
 gains.
 Like


massive,
 like
 crazy.
 And
 invariably,


productivity
 gains
 are
 sort
 of
 a


euphemism
 for
 cutting
 costs
 in
 some


other
 way.
 And
 that
 ultimately
 probably


is
 going
 to
 have
 an
 impact
 on
 employment


in
 this
 country
 and
 do
 more
 things


>> or
 do
 more
 things.
 And
 the
 question
 is


which
 one
 is
 it?
 Or
 by
 the
 way,
 is
 it
 a


combination
 of
 both?
 I
 would
 I
 would


probably


>> it's
 a
 combo.
 You
 highra
 people
 so
 that


they
 spend
 less
 time
 doing
 drudgery
 and


you
 allow
 them
 to
 work
 on
 more
 important


things.
 Like
 I'll
 give
 you
 an
 example.


My
 wife
 runs
 a
 life
 sciences
 business


and
 what's
 funny
 is
 when
 she
 looks
 at


AI,
 she's
 like,
 "All
 of
 this
 stuff
 is


trying
 to
 sell
 me
 speed."
 And
 she's


like,
 "I
 don't
 want
 speed.
 I
 want


quality."
 She's
 like,
 "I'm
 not
 trying
 to


make
 500
 molecules
 tomorrow.
 I'm
 trying


to
 make
 the
 right
 molecule
 for
 the
 right


disease,


>> and
 I'm
 happy
 to
 take
 five
 or
 six
 years


to
 do
 it."
 And
 right
 now
 I
 think
 we're


still
 in
 the
 novelty
 slopware
 phase
 of


AI
 where
 most
 of
 it
 is
 about
 speed
 and


you
 know
 you're
 spending
 a
 lot
 of
 money


to
 try
 to
 get
 crappy
 outcomes
 out


faster.
 Eventually
 we'll
 replace
 that


with
 quality
 outcomes
 and
 they'll
 take
 a


lot
 more
 time
 and
 I
 think
 that
 that's


when
 you'll
 have
 the
 real
 productivity


improvements.
 Back
 to
 life
 sciences
 like


these
 guys
 want
 to
 get
 drugs
 for
 every


person,
 right?
 That's
 not
 a
 tomorrow


thing.
 That's
 not
 like
 type
 it
 in
 in


English
 and
 all
 of
 a
 sudden
 pops
 out
 the


other
 end.
 And
 so
 I
 think
 we're
 going
 to


have
 to
 take
 a
 lot
 more
 time.
 That's


when
 this
 stuff
 becomes
 really
 real
 and


that's
 going
 to
 be
 very
 exciting.


>> Andrew,
 did
 we
 see
 coming
 out
 of
 the


crash
 of
 1929


a
 big
 move
 towards
 socialism
 in
 this


country
 saying,
 "Hey,
 capitalism
 has


failed
 us."
 And
 you
 know,
 how
 do
 you


kind
 of
 speak
 to
 the
 rise
 of
 socialism


today
 and
 the
 argument
 that
 capitalism's


failed
 most
 Americans?


>> Well,
 so
 yes,
 sorry.
 And
 to
 add
 on
 to


that,
 do
 you
 think
 the
 New
 Deal
 would


have
 looked
 the
 same
 or
 would
 there
 have


even
 been
 a
 New
 Deal
 if
 there
 hadn't


been
 a
 crash
 in
 2019?


>> Okay,
 so
 two
 quick
 answers.
 U
 yes,
 that


conversation
 happened,
 but
 not
 nearly
 as


quickly
 as
 it
 happened,
 for example,


after
 GFC
 of
 2008.
 So
 I
 remember
 being


down
 at
 like
 Zucati
 Park,
 Wall
 Street,


Occupy
 Wall
 Street,
 all
 of
 this


conversation
 we're
 having
 now
 about


socialism
 versus
 capitalism.
 Like
 that


happened
 immediately.
 In
 1929,
 that


conversation
 did
 not
 happen
 immediately.


Part
 of
 the
 reason
 it
 didn't
 happen
 um


is
 because
 there
 was
 sort
 of
 like
 a
 slow


roll
 on
 the
 economy
 and
 even
 the
 market.


So
 there
 was
 sort
 of a
 disconnect


between
 the
 economy
 and
 the
 market.


People
 forget
 at
 the
 end
 of
 29
 the
 stock


market
 actually
 was
 down
 only
 17%
 by
 the


end
 and
 so
 people
 thought
 it
 was


actually
 going
 to
 come
 back.
 There
 were


times
 when
 it
 actually
 seemed
 to
 be


coming
 back
 and
 and
 Hoover
 had
 this
 idea


that
 he
 could
 it
 was
 almost
 like
 a


psychological
 problem
 and
 that
 the


market
 and
 the
 economy
 were
 detached


from
 each
 other.
 He
 then
 starts
 making


all
 of
 these
 sort
 of
 frankly
 mistakes.


Obviously
 the
 Fed
 doesn't
 uh
 flood
 the


system.
 Hoover
 decides
 he
 wants
 to
 raise


taxes.
 He
 does
 smooth Smoot
 Holly
 with


tariffs.
 That's
 something
 he
 had
 pledged


to
 do
 to
 try
 to
 get
 farmers
 to
 actually


vote
 for
 him.
 And
 he
 thought
 that
 was


like
 a
 pledge
 that
 he
 had
 to
 keep.
 And


so
 there's
 a
 whole
 sort
 of
 set
 of


policies
 that
 came
 into
 play.
 And
 the


Hoovervilles
 don't
 show
 up
 in
 these
 sort


of
 like
 tented
 camps,
 sort
 of
 think


Zucati
 Park.
 That
 doesn't
 happen
 really


till
 1932.


>> And
 when
 you
 go
 back
 and
 look
 at
 why


Roosevelt
 won,
 it
 wasn't
 actually
 on
 the


economy.
 If
 you
 go
 and
 look
 at
 the


polls,
 it
 was
 over
 prohibition


>> crazily
 enough.
 And
 so
 it
 didn't
 have


that
 sort
 of
 social
 effect.
 Having
 said


that,
 you
 know,
 famously
 Roosevelt,
 you


know,
 on
 his
 inauguration
 day
 goes
 after


the
 bankers
 in
 the
 inaugural
 address.


And
 then,
 of
 course,
 the
 New
 Deal
 shuts


down
 the
 banks,
 has
 what
 was
 equivalent


of
 national
 holiday.
 9,000
 banks
 go
 out


of
 business,
 right?
 and
 and
 then
 that's


sort
 of
 when
 the
 conversation
 about


capitalism
 and
 socialism
 starts
 to
 rear


its
 head.


>> I
 think
 it's
 because
 at
 that
 point
 in


American
 history,
 we
 had
 not
 yet
 made


the
 promise
 to
 the
 average
 American
 that


they
 have
 the
 right
 or
 the
 opportunity


to
 buy
 a
 home,
 to
 get
 a
 a
 college


education,
 to
 have
 progressive
 income


every
 year.
 As
 you
 point
 out,
 most
 folks


were
 transitioning
 from
 an
 agrarian
 to


an
 industrial
 economy.
 And
 so
 the
 big


transition
 in
 life
 had
 been,
 "Wow,
 I
 can


get
 an
 apartment.
 I
 don't
 have
 to
 work


12
 hours
 a
 day
 grueling
 physical
 labor


in
 the
 fields.
 I
 can
 actually
 live
 and


walk
 to
 a
 grocery
 store
 and
 get
 amazing


food
 and
 meet
 people
 and
 socialize
 and


live
 in
 this
 amazing
 city.
 And
 it
 was


before
 we
 had
 made
 all
 of
 these
 promises


that
 I
 think
 led
 to
 these
 expectations


that
 folks
 then
 end
 up
 feeling


disappointed
 by
 and
 they
 blame
 it
 all
 on


the
 failure
 of
 capitalism.
 My
 personal


opinion
 as
 you
 know
 is
 that
 it's


fundamentally
 a
 function
 of
 overspending


by
 the
 government
 and
 overpromising


rather
 than
 allowing
 natural
 market


forces
 to
 bring
 everyone
 up
 which
 um


fundamentally
 I
 think
 created
 and


creates
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 the
 distrust
 and


the
 the
 issues
 we
 face.
 Can
 I
 just
 add


on
 top
 of
 that
 because
 you
 know
 you're


describing
 what
 I
 always
 think
 of
 as


sort
 of
 the
 Leave
 it
 to
 Beaver
 American


dream
 that
 people
 sort
 of
 have
 in
 their


mind
 which
 is
 really
 more
 of
 like
 a


1950s
 style
 dream
 and
 actually
 was
 a


function
 I
 think
 of
 a
 postworld
 war


situation
 where


>> where
 the
 where
 the
 country
 was
 we
 were


monopoly
 power
 everybody
 else
 was
 out
 of


business.
 This
 is
 also
 the
 time
 like
 the


reason
 why
 unions
 even
 worked
 I
 would


argue
 for
 in
 large
 part
 was
 because


there
 was
 this
 period
 of
 time
 where
 we


were
 the
 only
 players
 in
 town
 and
 so
 we


could
 we
 could
 charge
 monopoly
 rents
 for


a
 lot
 of
 things
 and
 people
 could
 buy
 a


house
 with
 a
 white
 fence
 and
 have
 two


kids
 and
 and
 have
 an
 ed
 all
 of
 those


things
 that
 we
 uh
 now
 say
 are
 the
 dream.


I'm
 look
 there's
 some
 people
 who
 think


that
 was
 an
 aberration
 in
 history.
 I
 I


hope
 it
 wasn't,
 but
 I'm
 saying
 there


were
 a
 lot
 of
 forces
 at
 play
 that


created
 that
 dream,
 but
 I
 don't
 think


that
 was
 the
 dream
 in
 1929.


>> Yeah.
 Do
 you
 buy
 into
 Ray
 Ray
 Dalio's


points
 of
 view
 that
 we're
 at
 the
 end
 of


an
 empire,
 end
 of
 a
 cycle?


>> I
 hope
 we're
 not.
 I
 hope
 we're
 not.
 I


you
 you
 look
 I
 think
 I
 think
 you
 look
 at


a
 lot
 of
 the
 things
 going
 on
 right
 now


just
 with
 how
 much
 debt
 we
 have.
 I
 I


sort
 of
 look
 at
 the
 Neil
 Ferguson
 view


of
 the
 world
 which
 maybe
 lines
 up
 pretty


directly
 with
 uh
 with
 Gallia
 which
 is


that
 when
 you
 get
 uh
 you
 know
 GDP
 you


start
 to
 look
 at
 like
 defense
 spending


as
 a
 percentage
 of
 GDP
 there
 is
 this


point
 at
 which
 at least
 historically
 you


have
 like
 a
 real
 problem
 um
 and
 that


sort
 of
 has
 set
 it
 created
 the
 end
 of


the
 empire.
 I
 think
 that
 happens
 in
 his


view
 of
 the
 world
 in
 like
 19
 in
 2040
 so


maybe
 there's
 still
 time
 to
 turn
 it


around.
 I
 don't know
 what
 you
 What
 about


you?


>> It's
 a
 very
 exact
 forecast
 2040.


>> You
 ever
 read
 that
 um
 what's
 that
 series


the
 Asimov
 series
 on
 uh
 where
 they've


got
 this
 like
 social
 forecasting


capability?
 Sorry,
 totally
 forgot.


Sorin,
 do
 you
 think
 that
 if
 you
 look
 at


GDP
 going
 through
 the
 crash,
 it


basically
 like
 cratered
 and
 then


>> I
 mean
 what
 whatever
 we
 think
 of
 the
 New


Deal,
 I
 think
 the
 the
 reality
 is
 that
 it


it
 just
 created
 an
 enormous
 amount
 of


investment
 that
 then
 just
 turned
 GDP


around.
 Is
 there
 a
 version
 of
 the
 New


Deal
 that
 America
 needs
 to
 do
 today?
 Is


there
 a
 new
 compact
 we
 need
 to
 have
 with


our
 citizenry
 today?


>> Well,
 but
 so
 there's
 two
 things
 that


happened
 though.
 there's
 the
 New
 Deal


and
 then
 World
 War
 II.
 I
 mean,
 so
 yeah,


I
 think
 you
 have
 to
 sort
 of
 lump
 them
 in


a
 way
 together
 in
 terms
 of
 the
 spending


profile
 and
 why
 we
 were
 spending
 and
 and


>> well,
 even
 I
 think
 even
 in
 the
 mid-30s


though,
 like
 really
 before
 we
 were


engulfed
 in
 it,
 we
 were
 we
 were
 cranking


like
 8
 n
 10%
 GDP.
 My
 my
 my
 point
 is
 just


more


>> just
 that
 idea
 of
 a
 new
 social
 compact,


a
 new
 set
 of
 like


agreements.
 I
 I I
 don't
 know
 like
 is
 is


we
 at
 a
 point


>> maybe
 maybe
 we
 do
 but
 what
 does
 that


look
 like
 and
 and
 where
 are
 we
 going
 to


get
 the
 money
 to
 to
 spend
 it
 that's
 the


real
 question
 and
 how
 can
 we


>> I
 think
 Freeberg
 would
 say
 well
 I'm
 not


going
 to
 put
 words
 in
 Freeberg's
 mouth


is
 that
 the
 agreement
 is
 actually
 not


about
 spending
 more
 but
 actually
 less


and
 getting
 folks
 to
 understand
 that


these
 trade-offs
 need
 to
 happen


>> so
 I
 I
 agree
 with
 you
 and
 I
 agree
 with


David
 on
 that
 like
 I
 think
 we
 have
 to


cut
 spending
 in
 a
 big
 way
 but
 this
 goes


back
 to
 the
 more
 issue
 which
 Everybody


everybody
 wants
 more.


>> The
 irony
 sorcen
 and
 I've
 shared
 this


point
 of
 view
 many
 many
 times
 but
 I


think
 when
 we
 made
 the
 promise
 when
 the


federal
 government
 and
 uh
 people
 who
 got


elected
 to
 represent
 the
 population
 and


the
 federal
 government
 got
 elected
 they


said
 we're
 going
 to
 give
 you
 an


education
 and
 then
 we're
 going
 to
 use


federal
 spending
 to
 do
 that.
 We're
 going


to
 give
 you
 access
 to
 a
 home.
 We're


going
 to
 create
 this
 federal
 home
 loan


program.
 And
 in
 all
 these
 cases
 when


there
 was
 a
 promise
 made
 on
 giving
 you


the
 more
 it
 was
 all
 about
 increasing


government
 spending.
 we're
 going to
 give


you
 access
 to
 healthcare.


>> And
 then
 Medicare
 became
 kind
 of
 this


ballooning
 spending
 line
 because
 in


every
 case
 because
 it's
 not
 actually
 a


free
 market,
 the
 government
 doing
 the


spending
 gets
 taken
 advantage
 of
 and
 all


the
 costs
 underlying
 that
 spending
 line


get
 inflated
 because
 there's
 no
 natural


market
 force
 of
 buy
 and
 sell.
 There's


only
 a
 market
 force
 of
 buy.
 And
 that's


why
 education
 costs
 have
 ballooned.


That's
 why
 housing
 has
 ballooned.
 That's


why
 medical
 expenses,
 pharmaceutical


drugs
 have
 all
 ballooned.
 Because
 as


soon
 as
 the
 government
 provides
 that
 as


a
 service,
 it
 completely
 distorts
 the


market
 and
 you
 can
 never
 get
 out
 of
 that


freefall.
 So
 the
 fundamental
 challenge


is
 you
 have
 to
 have
 the
 more
 difficult


conversation
 to
 your
 point
 of
 it's
 not


more,
 it's
 less
 and
 we're
 all
 going
 to


have
 to
 kind
 of
 deal
 with
 that
 or
 you're


going to
 do
 the
 same
 thing
 that


everyone's
 done
 historically
 which
 is


wealth
 taxes
 and
 you
 know
 growth
 slow


all
 the
 stuff
 that
 kind
 of
 we've
 seen


many
 times
 before.
 So,
 but
 this
 is
 now


you're
 talking
 about
 like
 a
 political


it's
 almost
 a
 paradox
 or
 a
 challenge


which
 is
 how
 do
 you
 get
 the
 public
 to


buy
 into
 the
 idea
 of
 less,
 right?
 That


is
 the
 fundamental
 question.
 We
 all
 know


that
 we
 have
 to
 spend
 less.


>> I
 I'm
 I
 agree
 with
 that.
 I'm
 and
 I
 and


by
 the
 way,
 I
 feel
 blessed
 that
 I
 could


probably
 afford
 afford
 it
 but
 to
 take


less.
 But
 the
 question
 is,
 you
 know,
 if


you
 don't
 have
 it,
 taking
 less


>> Yeah.
 They'll
 they'll
 say,
 "Yeah,
 rich


 like
 you
 guys
 can
 say
 that.


Good
 for
 you."
 like
 that's
 not


fair
 to
 me.
 And
 I
 think
 that's
 the
 big


issue
 is
 the
 people
 who
 would
 proclaim


that
 would
 be
 immediately
 attacked
 like


you
 live
 with
 less
 tax
 the
 rich
 and
 that


becomes
 where


Dalio
 and
 others
 have
 argued


historically.
 You
 see
 these
 notions
 of


civil
 unrest
 of
 civic
 splits
 that
 that


that
 happen.
 By
 the
 way,
 the
 book
 is


foundation
 the
 foundation
 series.
 I


don't know
 why
 it
 didn't
 come
 to
 my


mind.
 The
 idea
 is
 called
 psycho
 history


where
 the
 guy
 can
 actually
 predict
 all


of
 these
 social
 trends
 because
 they're


all
 predictable
 and
 they
 all
 happen
 in


in
 cycles.


>> Okay.
 Can
 I
 just
 throw
 one
 other
 thing


in
 this
 because
 I'm
 so
 curious
 about
 it


and
 I
 spent
 a
 lot
 of
 time
 thinking
 about


Smoot
 Holly
 in
 terms
 of
 tariffs.
 So


there's
 an
 AR
 there's
 a
 there's
 a
 I


think
 a
 fair
 argument
 that
 tariffs
 were


now
 t
 tying
 to
 national
 security


resilience
 today
 and
 like
 we
 may
 decide


philosophically
 you
 want
 to
 have
 an


automobile
 industry
 in
 the
 United
 States


because
 if
 you
 let
 BYD
 sell
 cars
 in
 this


country
 we
 would
 not
 sell
 cars
 in
 this


country
 and
 we
 wouldn't
 make
 cars
 in


this
 country
 ever
 again.
 And
 you
 may


think
 that
 that's
 a
 bad
 idea
 and
 you


want
 that
 to
 be
 here.
 Having
 said
 that,


if
 we
 do
 this,
 which
 we
 are,
 we
 will


probably
 spend
 more
 to
 buy
 less


technologically
 capable
 cars
 10
 years


from
 now
 than
 the
 next
 time
 we
 all,
 you


know,
 if
 you
 go
 on
 vacation
 to
 Europe
 or


Asia
 and
 get
 in
 the
 back
 of
 one
 of
 these


other
 cars.
 And
 how
 should
 we
 think


about
 that?
 That
 to
 me
 is
 like
 a
 real


fundamental
 question
 about
 capitalism


and
 also
 about
 resilience
 and
 national


security.


>> What
 I
 would
 offer
 to
 you
 is
 the
 way


that
 we
 should
 think
 about
 this
 is
 how


do
 Americans
 and
 American
 society


preserve
 maximum
 optionality
 in
 the
 face


of
 very
 difficult
 decisions
 in
 the


future.
 So
 if
 geopolitically


we
 are
 induced
 into
 a
 war,
 all
 wars
 have


tremendously
 bad
 consequences.


How
 would
 we
 have
 the
 wherewithal
 to
 not


have
 to
 be
 a
 part
 of
 it?
 If
 you
 look
 at


the
 last
 number
 of
 wars,
 these
 are
 all


ultimately
 over
 resources.
 Right.


>> Right.


>> And
 if
 you
 think
 about
 resource


independence,


there
 are
 many,
 many
 things
 today
 where


America
 is
 just
 fundamentally
 instable


because
 we
 don't
 have
 resource


independence.
 But
 if
 we
 were
 to
 get
 that


and
 then
 we
 had
 the
 building
 blocks,


we
 wouldn't
 actually
 have
 to
 fight
 a


war.
 Now,
 there
 may
 be
 other
 reasons
 and


people
 may
 pull
 us
 into
 wars
 and
 I
 I
 get


all
 of
 that,
 but
 I
 think
 that
 that's
 a


really
 big
 question.
 Would
 I
 be
 okay


with
 a
 less
 better
 car,
 but
 having
 a


national
 transportation
 infrastructure


that
 we
 control
 and
 cannot
 be
 turned
 off


by
 somebody
 else?
 On
 the
 margins,
 I


would
 say
 yeah,
 I'd
 be
 okay
 with
 that.


>> And
 and
 the
 interesting
 part
 though
 is


there's
 going to
 be
 a
 premium
 on
 that,


right?
 Like
 we're
 going
 to
 pay
 more
 for


that.
 And
 that
 may
 be
 that
 may
 just
 be


the
 cost
 of
 doing
 business.


>> Sure.
 And
 that
 may
 that's
 that
 may
 be


the
 cost
 of
 strategic
 flexibility
 and


optionality.
 And
 I
 think
 if
 you
 just


think
 about
 what
 the
 downstream


consequences
 of
 not
 having
 that
 are


>> and
 maybe
 and
 by
 the
 way
 maybe
 those


costs
 are
 even
 higher
 and
 and
 we
 and


those
 costs
 don't
 get
 added
 and
 they


don't
 get
 added
 into
 the
 model.
 Right.


>> You're
 absolutely
 right.
 They're
 they're


always
 higher
 because
 they're
 measured


in
 human
 lives.


It's
 always
 higher.
 It's
 always
 more


costly.


>> Andrew,
 who
 do
 you
 sell
 the
 uh
 movie


rights
 to
 of
 your
 book
 and
 when's
 the


movie
 coming
 out?


>> Uh
 haven't
 sold
 them
 yet.
 We're
 talking


to
 a
 couple
 people.
 Hopefully,
 we'll


have
 some
 news
 on
 that
 sometime
 soon


>> because
 it
 sounds
 like
 it's
 a
 very


peopledriven
 story.
 So,
 it
 should
 make


for
 kind
 of
 great
 drama,
 right?


>> Oh,
 totally.
 I
 mean,
 I
 tried
 to
 write
 it


I
 didn't
 try
 to
 write
 it
 uh
 for
 film
 per


se,
 but
 I
 tried
 to
 write
 it
 in
 as


cinematic
 a
 way
 as
 humanly
 possible


given
 that
 I
 was
 also
 constrained
 by,


you
 know,
 I
 had
 to
 have
 archives
 and


notes
 and
 diaries.
 You
 know,
 it
 looks


like
 a
 long
 book.
 By
 the
 way,
 folks,


it's
 a
 little
 bit
 shorter
 because


there's
 a
 hundred
 some
 odd
 pages
 of


endotes
 at
 the
 end
 uh
 for
 those
 who
 want


to
 uh
 and
 by
 the
 way,
 some
 of
 the


endotes
 are
 kind
 of
 fun.


>> Andrew,
 when
 you
 write
 these
 things,
 do


you


>> and
 then
 when
 you
 license
 it,
 for


example,
 like
 when
 they
 started
 to
 make


billions?


>> Yeah.


>> Do
 you
 take
 a
 strong
 point
 of
 view
 and


how
 the
 scripts
 in
 that
 case
 or
 the


screenplay
 in
 this
 case
 will
 be
 written


or
 do
 you
 kind
 of
 say,
 "Okay,
 here's
 my


source
 material.
 You
 guys
 do
 the
 best


you
 can
 and
 you
 kind
 of
 do
 you
 care
 who


the
 actors
 are.
 Do
 you
 care
 about
 any
 of


that
 stuff
 or
 do
 you
 think
 it's
 like,


okay,
 they're
 licensing
 it
 off
 off
 on


your
 merry
 way.
 Do
 the
 best
 you
 can?


>> You
 know,
 I
 think
 actually
 in
 this
 day


and
 age
 just


>> because
 it's
 probably
 in
 your
 mind,


right?
 You
 have
 a
 vision
 of
 what
 this


whole
 thing
 looks
 like
 visually.
 You


probably
 have
 faces,
 right?
 You
 probably


you
 probably
 have
 all
 of
 this.
 So,
 how


do
 you
 do
 you
 let
 go
 of
 that
 or


>> Well,
 I
 think
 you
 first
 of
 all,
 I
 think


you
 have
 to
 let
 go
 a
 little
 bit
 at
 some


level
 because
 that's
 just
 the
 nature
 of


the
 business
 for
 better
 or
 worse.
 I


think
 right
 now
 in
 this
 streaming


environment,
 you
 know,
 there's
 sort
 of


two
 ways
 you
 can
 go
 sell
 projects
 like


this.
 One
 is
 you
 go
 sell
 it
 to
 a


streamer
 and
 they
 go
 off
 and
 they
 try
 to


develop
 it.
 They
 go
 find
 the
 team
 that


does
 it.
 The
 other
 approach
 is,
 you


know,
 find
 the
 actor,
 maybe
 a
 director,


maybe
 the
 writer
 all
 at
 one
 time
 and


then
 walk
 in
 with
 it.
 So
 in
 that


context,
 you
 probably
 have
 more
 of
 a
 say


in
 the
 future
 of
 it.
 you
 know,
 right
 now


just
 the
 way
 the
 business
 is,
 you
 know,


the
 Hollywood's
 buying
 a
 lot
 less
 stuff


and
 I
 think
 is
 more
 interested
 in
 sort


of
 the
 former
 version
 where
 you
 show
 up


with
 the
 whole
 thing
 sort
 of


prepackaged,
 pre-planned,
 but
 you
 know,


it
 almost
 changes,
 you
 know,
 by
 the


month
 in
 terms
 of
 what
 they
 want.


>> Are
 you
 uh
 doing
 the
 audio
 book


yourself?
 Were
 you
 reading
 the


>> I
 read
 it.
 You
 guys
 are
 in
 the
 audio


business
 yourselves.
 So
 I
 will
 tell
 you


I
 went
 in
 it's
 13
 hours
 the
 the
 book
 in


total.
 You
 do
 it
 on
 you
 know
 double
 time


and
 you
 you'll
 be
 done
 in
 uh
 you
 know


six
 and
 a
 half
 hours.
 But
 uh
 it
 probably


took
 me
 like
 30
 hours.
 It
 takes
 a
 while


and
 they
 do
 it.


>> I
 did
 do
 it.
 Yeah.
 I
 did
 it.
 It
 was
 fun.


It
 was
 like


>> your
 first
 time.
 Was
 it
 your
 first
 time


reading
 the
 audio
 book?


>> I've
 never
 read
 it
 before.
 When
 when
 Too


Big
 to
 Fil
 came
 out,
 we
 had
 a
 British


actor
 do
 it
 and
 I
 enjoyed
 read
 I
 enjoyed


listening
 to
 him.
 He
 added
 some
 gravitas


to
 the
 to
 the
 project
 because
 that
 you


know
 the
 Brits
 always
 sound
 smarter
 than


us.


>> British.


>> Pretty
 much
 pretty
 much
 pretty
 much.


>> Okay.
