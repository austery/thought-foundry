Hey
 everybody,
 welcome
 back
 to
 the


channel.
 We
 are
 back
 on
 another
 episode


of
 the
 daily
 recap.
 Thank
 you
 everybody


for
 being
 here.
 It
 is
 officially
 Monday,


brand
 new
 start
 to
 the
 week.
 First
 of


all,
 I
 just
 want
 to
 say
 thank
 you
 to


everyone
 who
 reached
 out
 and
 said
 happy


birthday
 today.
 Uh
 really
 means
 a
 ton.


We
 got
 to
 celebrate
 it
 on
 the
 market


open,
 market
 close,
 did
 a
 giveaway
 on


the
 close
 and
 that
 was
 really
 fun
 and


yeah,
 I
 spent
 a
 lot
 of
 time
 talking


about
 it
 on
 the
 open
 and
 the
 close,
 but


uh
 just
 deeply
 deeply
 deeply
 deeply


appreciate
 the
 position
 that
 I'm
 in
 in


life.
 And
 you
 know,
 as
 I
 get
 older,
 20


years
 old,
 uh
 start
 to
 reflect
 a
 lot


more
 on
 what
 has
 been
 happening
 in
 life


and
 uh
 you
 know,
 the
 community
 we
 built


over
 the
 past
 couple
 years,
 it
 it
 it


truly
 means
 everything
 to
 me.
 So,
 I
 just


really
 appreciate
 everyone
 that
 reached


out.
 Thank
 you
 all
 for
 the
 birthday


wishes.
 Your
 boy
 is
 28.
 Two
 years
 from


the
 dirty
 30s.
 I
 know
 a
 lot
 of
 people


watching
 are
 probably
 much
 older
 than


28,
 but
 uh
 you
 know,
 you
 guys
 have


basically
 seen
 me
 grow
 up
 over
 the
 next


five
 years,
 and
 hopefully
 we'll
 continue


to
 see
 me
 grow
 up
 coming
 into
 the


future.
 We
 got
 a
 lot
 to
 talk
 about


today.
 Palanteer,
 big
 new
 contract,


massive
 contract.
 Also,
 new
 all-time


highs
 on
 Palunteer.
 It
 was
 a
 very
 nice


birthday
 present.
 So,
 thank
 you,


Palanteer.
 Uh,
 so
 we'll
 talk
 about


what's
 going
 on
 with
 Palanteer.
 Tassy


got
 some
 upgrades
 on
 the
 street.


Street's
 getting
 a
 lot
 more
 excited


about
 where
 autonomous
 vehicles
 are


going,
 and
 that's
 why
 you
 saw
 Tesla
 get


a
 bit
 of a
 5%
 move
 today.
 Uh,
 some


semiconductor
 companies
 are
 starting
 to


pop
 up
 and
 potentially
 challenge
 some
 of


the
 other
 incumbents
 in
 the
 space.
 So,


we'll
 talk
 a
 bit
 more
 about
 that.
 And


then
 the
 broader
 macro.
 I
 mean,
 we
 have


all-time
 highs
 on
 the
 S&P
 500,
 up
 1%
 on


the
 day.
 Pretty
 much
 every
 stock
 has


been
 relatively
 green
 today.
 There
 were


some
 pockets
 of
 the
 market
 today
 that


were
 red,
 but
 overall,
 it
 was
 a
 pretty


strong
 green
 day
 for
 the
 markets.
 And


we're
 going
 to
 talk
 a
 little
 bit
 more


about
 macro
 and
 what
 that
 means
 going


into
 the
 end
 of the
 year
 and
 kind
 of
 my


overall
 thoughts
 on
 the
 nature
 of
 this


bull
 market.
 So,
 thank
 you
 everybody
 for


being
 here.
 Thank
 you
 again
 for
 the


happy
 birthday
 wishes.
 Let's
 get
 into


it.
 All
 right,
 let's
 start
 off
 with


Palunteer
 and
 then
 we'll
 get
 into
 the


macro
 and
 what's
 kind
 of
 going
 on.
 First


of
 all,
 Palanteer,
 massive
 day.


Congratulations
 shareholders.
 One
 of the


reasons
 why
 I
 am
 even
 in
 the
 uh
 the


position
 I'm
 in
 today
 is
 because
 of


Palanteer
 uh
 and
 choosing
 to
 analyze


this
 company
 when
 it
 was
 a
 much
 smaller


company
 and
 obviously
 it
 has
 completely


changed
 my
 life,
 changed
 so
 many
 of
 our


lives
 and
 you
 got
 Palanteer
 that
 had
 a


pretty
 strong
 day.
 Now
 it
 hit
 1928
 at


one
 point
 which
 is
 pretty
 incredible.


Didn't
 close
 at
 192,
 closed
 at
 189.


Uh
 now
 why
 did
 that
 happen
 today?
 Well


there's
 a
 couple
 reasons.
 Number
 one,
 we


talked
 about
 this
 last
 week.
 Karp
 did
 a


new
 interview
 on
 Fox
 Business
 and
 they


had
 a
 $200
 million
 partnership
 with


Lumen
 which
 was
 very
 very
 important.


Obviously
 Lumen
 is
 a
 massive
 company
 in


the
 government
 space
 and
 the
 contracts


that
 they've
 been
 able
 to
 work
 on
 with


Palare
 has
 started
 to
 really
 influence


the
 way
 that
 Pounder
 thinks
 of
 their
 go


to
 market
 particularly
 with
 working
 with


some
 of
 these
 other
 thirdparty
 companies


when
 it
 comes
 to
 servicing
 and
 being
 a


vendor
 and
 distributor
 for
 a
 lot
 of


different
 contracts.
 And
 you
 know
 from


Pounders
 perspective
 the
 data
 analytics


play
 for
 those
 vendor
 and
 distributors.


Today
 they
 signed
 a
 new
 agreement
 with


Poland's
 Ministry
 of
 Defense.
 Here's


what
 Pounder
 said.
 Pouchers
 committed
 to


Poland
 and
 proud
 to
 deepen
 our


partnership
 with
 the
 Ministry
 of


Defense.
 Today's
 agreement
 paves
 the
 way


for
 Poucher's
 AI
 enabled
 defense


technology
 to
 begin
 rapidly
 supporting


the
 country's
 armed
 forces
 as
 they


innovate
 at
 the
 forefront
 of
 an


increasingly
 complex
 threat
 environment


and
 strengthen
 Poland's
 position
 as
 a


sovereign
 leader
 in
 defense.
 So,
 this


was
 a
 letter
 of
 intent
 to
 work
 with


Poland's
 defense
 ministry.
 We've
 seen


that
 pound
 started
 to
 really
 expand


their
 work
 with
 the
 international


governments
 across
 the
 world.
 The
 UK


just
 gave
 them
 a
 billion
 dollar


contract,
 the
 Ministry
 of
 Defense
 back


in
 end
 of
 September,
 early
 October.
 So,


that
 was
 very
 good
 to
 see.
 And
 obviously


Palers's
 work
 with
 the
 government
 in
 the


United
 States
 has
 continued
 to
 expand


aggressively
 as
 more
 and
 more
 of
 what


they're
 doing
 with
 the
 government


becomes
 something
 that
 the
 government


says,
 "Hey,
 you
 know,
 we
 need
 to
 be
 able


to
 buy
 the
 software
 to
 uh
 work
 with."


Russia,
 Ukraine,
 obviously
 everything


that's
 been
 going
 on
 has
 led
 to
 a
 lot
 of


these
 other
 countries
 recognizing
 maybe


it's
 time
 for
 us
 to
 potentially
 wonder


if
 we
 were
 to
 get
 invaded
 or
 if
 our


sovereignty
 was
 threatened,
 what
 would


we
 do?
 And
 the
 Poland
 deputy
 prime


minister
 today
 said
 because
 those
 who


threaten
 Poland
 know
 that
 we
 have
 the


best
 data
 processing
 system,
 they
 will


think
 twice
 before
 taking
 the
 next
 step.


I
 think
 this
 is
 really
 important
 because


at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day,
 one
 of
 my
 bull


cases
 for
 Pounder
 was
 that
 they're
 going


to
 become
 the
 operating
 system
 of
 the


West.
 Not
 only
 do
 they
 defend
 Western


values,
 not
 only
 are
 they
 unapologetic


on
 the
 defense
 of
 Western
 values,
 which


is
 why
 Palanteer
 is
 never
 sold
 to


Russian
 China.
 20
 years
 later
 kind
 of


made
 sense
 to
 not
 work
 with
 Russia
 and


China
 because
 now
 if
 you
 work
 with


Russia
 and
 China
 you're
 seen
 as
 a


liability
 but
 Palanteer
 has
 been
 a
 a


staunch
 supporter
 of
 of
 uh
 of
 the
 West


and
 they've
 supported
 the
 ideas
 and


values
 and
 concepts
 of
 the
 West.
 So


Poland
 is
 just
 another
 extension
 of


Palanter's
 philosophy
 in
 terms
 of


wanting
 to
 work
 with
 countries
 that


potentially
 could
 have
 their
 sovereignty


threatened
 and
 I
 think
 it
 makes
 a
 lot
 of


sense.
 We've
 known
 that
 Palanter
 has


been
 obviously
 working
 with
 everything


they've
 done
 in
 Ukraine,
 Lithuania,
 Kart


mentioned,
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 Asian


governments
 over
 the
 past
 couple
 years.


The
 Japanese
 government
 in
 particular


potentially
 has
 started
 to
 get
 more


curious
 about
 Palanteer
 software.
 I


think
 the
 government
 business
 is
 going


to
 keep
 growing
 and
 as
 a
 result
 of
 the


government
 business
 keep
 that
 that


continues
 to
 grow.
 The
 international


expansion
 into
 the
 commercial
 sector,


which
 by
 the
 way
 in
 the
 United
 Kingdom,


a
 lot
 of
 their
 international
 commercial


customers
 came
 from
 beginning
 to
 work


with
 the
 Ministry
 of
 Defense.
 I
 mean,
 it


really
 is
 easier
 to,
 you
 know,
 sell
 a


customer
 on
 a
 deal
 if
 you're
 working


with
 the
 country's
 government.
 And
 so,
 I


think
 that
 makes
 a
 lot
 more
 sense.
 Now,


in
 terms
 of
 the
 stock,
 look,
 I've
 been


buying
 at
 171,
 173,
 even
 at
 180
 I


bought.
 I
 I I
 never
 thought
 I
 I
 would


say
 I'm
 buying
 at
 these
 levels,
 but
 I'm


kind
 of
 just
 doing
 the
 math
 in
 my
 head


on
 the
 growth
 rate
 that
 they're
 going
 to


put
 up.
 And
 I'll
 do
 a
 more
 in-depth


counter
 preview
 episode
 later.
 Um,
 I


think
 they're
 going
 to
 grow
 more
 than


50%.
 I
 think
 they're
 going
 to
 increase


guidance.
 I
 think
 operating
 margins
 are


going
 to
 continue
 to
 grow.
 Karp
 has


sounded
 pretty
 excited
 to
 say
 the
 least


about
 how
 they're
 growing
 and
 where


their
 trajectory
 of
 growth
 is.
 I
 am
 not


immune
 to
 the
 fact
 that
 the
 valuation
 is


aggressive.
 I
 understand
 that
 and
 I


understand
 I'm
 buying
 into
 an
 expensive


company
 and
 that
 the
 stock
 could
 fall


and
 it
 is
 what
 it
 is.
 But
 I
 also
 have
 a


pretty
 nice
 margin
 of
 safety
 given
 I've


been
 in
 the
 stock
 for
 a
 long
 time
 and


quite
 frankly
 sometimes
 your
 best
 ideas


are
 the
 ideas
 that
 you
 got
 into
 early.


And
 so
 I
 understand
 the
 market
 cap
 is


elevated,
 but
 I
 also
 think
 that
 a
 run
 to


200
 is
 not
 crazy
 after
 a
 bombastic


earnings
 that
 they
 can
 deliver,


especially
 because
 it
 will
 continue
 to


validate
 to
 the
 street.
 There
 is
 no


other
 software
 company
 that
 is
 growing


more
 than
 50%.
 There's
 no
 other
 software


company
 utilizing
 AI
 that's
 growing
 50%


with
 the
 margins
 that
 Paltor
 has.
 By
 the


way,
 sticky
 revenue,
 not
 really


contextual
 to
 the
 market,
 but
 once
 they


lock
 you
 in,
 they
 lock
 you
 in
 and
 that


continues
 to
 compound.
 So
 with
 a
 rule
 of


80,
 I
 think
 this
 is
 going
 to
 be
 a
 good


quarter.
 I
 don't
 know
 what
 happens
 to


the
 stock.
 I
 did
 buy
 the
 dip
 last
 week


and
 yeah,
 congratulations
 to
 everyone.


Alltime
 highs
 on
 pounder
 and
 we
 will
 get


to
 continue
 seeing
 how
 the
 story
 unfolds


as
 we
 get
 into
 earnings
 going
 into
 next


week.
 Okay,
 let's
 talk
 macro
 because
 we


got
 a
 lot
 of
 stuff
 going
 on
 in
 the
 world


of
 macro.
 First
 of
 all,
 what
 caused
 the


bright
 green
 that
 we
 saw
 uh
 over
 the


past
 24
 hours?
 And
 the
 answer
 to
 that


question
 lies
 in
 what
 Scott
 Bent
 said


over
 the
 weekend.
 What
 does
 Scott
 Bent


say,
 the
 US
 Treasury
 Secretary?
 Well,
 he


was
 in
 Malaysia
 with
 a
 meeting
 uh
 with


President
 uh
 not
 the
 president
 but
 the


prime
 minister
 of
 trade
 in
 and
 their


representative
 Lee


in
 China
 or
 from
 China.
 And
 the


conversations
 were
 really
 good.
 I
 mean


we
 didn't
 get
 that
 many
 specifics
 on
 the


conversations
 outside
 of
 the
 fact
 that


the
 rare
 earth
 minerals
 and
 metals
 which


by
 the
 way
 the
 reason
 why
 those
 stocks


declined
 today
 is
 because
 it
 looks
 like


the
 China
 tensions
 are
 not
 that


aggressive.
 So
 the
 domestic
 producers
 of


the
 rare
 earth
 companies
 are
 not
 that


rare
 ironically.
 And
 so
 uh
 if
 we're


going to
 keep
 exporting
 from
 China
 then


you
 know
 we
 might
 not
 have
 that
 much


demand
 at
 least
 in
 the
 short
 term
 for


the
 elevated
 valuations
 for
 some
 of


those
 other
 companies
 like
 an
 MP
 or
 a
 US


AR
 etc.
 So
 uh
 the
 exports
 is
 not
 that


big
 of
 a
 deal
 anymore
 in
 terms
 of
 export


controls
 trade
 negotiations.
 Bas
 said
 we


have
 a
 meaningful
 framework
 to
 be
 able


to
 engage
 with
 the
 Chinese
 and
 it
 is


setting
 up
 the
 November
 1st
 meeting


between
 Trump
 and
 Xi
 in
 South
 Korea
 and


if
 that
 meeting
 goes
 well
 then
 the


markets
 are
 potentially
 going
 to
 be


pricing
 at
 a
 trade
 deal.
 So,
 I
 think


this
 is
 why
 we've
 had
 some
 fun
 over
 the


past
 24
 hours.
 I
 mean,
 the
 S&P
 500


again,
 the
 reason
 we
 took
 that
 3%
 draw


down
 on
 October
 10th
 is
 because
 of
 the


Trump
 China
 tweet.
 And
 quite
 frankly,
 as


I've
 been
 thinking
 about
 it
 over
 the


past
 24
 hours,
 I
 think
 it's
 not
 really


because
 of
 that
 tweet.
 I
 think
 the


market
 needed
 a
 catalyst.
 And
 that


catalyst
 ended
 up
 being
 that
 tweet.
 And


as
 a
 result
 of
 that
 tweet,
 you
 had
 the


windfall
 of
 stocks
 finally
 taking
 a


breather,
 which
 in
 August
 they
 didn't


take
 a
 breather.
 In
 September,
 they


didn't
 take
 a
 breather.
 In
 the
 summer,


they
 didn't
 take
 a
 breather.
 The
 last


time
 they
 took
 a
 breather
 literally
 was


April
 when
 we
 had
 a
 2%
 down
 day.
 It
 was


five
 months
 until
 we
 had
 that
 draw
 down


until
 October
 10th.
 Now,
 what
 does
 this


mean
 for
 the
 broader
 market?
 You've
 got


rate
 cuts
 coming
 up
 on
 Wednesday.
 I'll


be
 live
 pretty
 much
 all
 day
 on


Wednesday,
 so
 that's
 going to
 be
 a


massive
 day.
 Um,
 we
 don't
 know if
 we're


getting
 rate
 cuts,
 but
 there's
 like
 a


97%
 chance
 we're
 getting
 rate
 cuts.
 You


have
 earnings
 growth
 Wednesday.
 We
 also


have
 Microsoft,
 Google,
 and
 Meta.
 I


don't
 know
 how
 we're
 going
 to
 manage


that
 on
 the
 market
 close,
 but
 we've
 got


all
 those
 earnings.
 So,
 we'll
 be
 taking


a
 look
 at
 that.
 Uh,
 so
 you
 got
 earnings


growth
 that's
 coming
 up
 from
 the
 big


tech
 companies.
 So
 far,
 earnings
 have


been
 pretty
 good
 across
 the
 board.
 We


talked
 about
 that
 last
 week.
 You've
 got


rate
 cuts
 coming
 and
 then
 you
 got


trillions
 of
 dollars
 on
 the
 sideline.


That
 is
 likely
 going
 to
 want
 to
 get
 some


exposure
 to
 what's
 going
 on
 in
 the
 stock


market
 if
 the
 earnings
 continue
 to
 do


well.
 Not
 to
 mention,
 you
 also
 had
 a


draw
 down
 of
 3%
 on
 the
 S&P
 500.
 So,


individual
 names
 took,
 you
 know,
 a
 10
 to


15%
 hit.
 But
 that
 was
 just
 the
 good


companies
 like
 a
 Robin
 and
 a
 Nebius,


which
 have
 started
 to
 recover
 very
 well.


the
 companies
 that
 aren't
 as


fundamentally
 sound.
 And
 I'm
 not
 saying


they're
 bad
 companies.
 I'm
 not
 saying


they're
 they're
 piles
 of
 I
 I
 am


just
 saying
 objectively
 like
 when
 you


don't
 have
 any
 earnings
 and
 revenue
 and


you're
 getting
 a,
 you
 know,
 20
 30


billion
 dollar
 market
 cap.
 The
 question


is
 why?
 Like
 really,
 what
 is
 out
 there


that's
 creating
 all
 this
 momentum,
 all


this
 capital
 flowing
 into
 the
 the


company
 itself,
 is
 it
 hype?
 Is
 it
 a


narrative?
 Or
 is
 it
 the
 idea
 that
 there


will
 be
 projected
 massive
 earnings


growth
 in
 the
 future?
 And
 the
 street


wants
 to
 pull
 that
 forward,
 which
 by
 the


way,
 the
 street
 does
 that
 on
 Tesla.
 It's


just
 Tesla
 also
 does
 hundred
 billion


dollars
 in
 revenue
 and
 has
 40
 billion
 in


cash.
 The
 street
 does
 that
 with
 Apple.


It's
 just
 that
 Apple
 buys
 back
 $100


billion
 dollars
 of
 stock
 and
 it's
 Apple.


It's
 one
 of the
 most
 important
 companies


on
 the
 planet.
 So
 seeing
 these
 smaller


companies
 get
 these
 multiples
 and
 then


get
 a
 draw
 down
 that
 has
 been
 pretty


aggressive.
 I
 said
 it
 last
 week
 and
 I
 I


I
 don't
 mean
 to
 sound
 like
 someone
 who


wants
 these
 companies
 to
 fail.
 I
 have
 no


shorts.
 I
 have
 no
 puts.
 Nothing
 like


that.
 It
 doesn't
 really
 make
 my
 life


better
 if
 these
 companies
 go
 down.
 I


just
 think
 as
 a
 as
 as
 a
 broad
 market


participant,
 it
 is
 healthy
 and
 I
 think


many
 people
 agree
 with
 this
 to
 see
 some


of
 these
 names
 lose
 some
 of
 the
 froth


because
 when
 that
 froth
 is
 in
 the


system,
 the
 problem
 is
 it
 messes
 up
 the


entire
 market.
 Now,
 it
 likely
 won't
 have


an
 impact
 on
 Nvidia
 and
 Amazon
 and
 all


these
 other
 companies,
 but
 the
 problem


is
 when
 there's
 that
 much
 euphoria
 and


excitement,
 we've
 seen
 this
 happen
 over


and
 over
 again
 over
 the
 past
 hundred


years
 in
 the
 stock
 market,
 you
 tend
 to


get
 massive
 drawdowns.
 As
 too
 much
 money


finds
 too
 much
 speculation,
 that


speculation
 leads
 to
 disaster.
 So,
 what


I
 think
 has
 happened
 over
 the
 past


couple
 weeks,
 which
 is
 actually
 very


healthy,
 is
 that
 a
 lot
 of
 that


speculation
 came
 down
 the
 drain.
 Some
 of


those
 stocks
 might
 never
 get
 back
 to


all-time
 highs.
 Some
 of
 them
 might.
 And


some
 of
 them
 are
 recovering.
 Like
 Oaklo,


for
 example,
 went
 all
 the
 way
 down
 to


118.
 I
 think
 it
 closed
 today
 at
 137.
 Its


all-time
 high
 was
 195.
 And
 at
 137,
 it's


still
 up
 500%
 year
 to
 date.
 So,
 it's
 not


like
 I
 think
 anyone's
 complaining
 about


the
 fact
 that
 they're
 an
 Oaklo
 unless


you
 bought
 at
 195,
 which
 is,
 you
 know,


if
 you
 bought
 at
 the
 top
 or
 at
 the


short-term
 top.
 It's
 just
 one
 of
 those


things
 where,
 you
 know,
 you
 bought


really
 high.
 Same
 thing
 with
 MP


Materials,
 right?
 If
 you
 bought
 a
 rare


earth
 company
 at
 95
 bucks
 and
 now
 it's


at
 60,
 it's
 like,
 you
 know,
 you
 kind
 of


bought
 into
 the
 momentum
 and
 it
 is
 okay


for
 that
 momentum
 to
 have
 a
 draw
 down.


Fact
 that
 the
 S&P
 500
 is
 back
 to


all-time
 highs.
 Google's
 at
 all-time


highs.
 Amazon's
 trying
 to
 push
 all-time


highs.
 And
 they've
 got
 a
 lot
 of these


names
 that
 have
 recovered
 but
 not
 really


recovered
 to
 me
 is
 very
 healthy
 for
 the


broader
 for
 the
 broader
 like
 idea
 that


the
 bull
 market
 can
 be
 healthy
 and


continue
 because
 you're
 seeing
 that


froth
 get
 taken
 out.
 And
 that
 is
 okay.


And
 again,
 it's
 not
 to
 say
 these
 are
 bad


companies.
 It's
 not
 to
 say
 these


companies
 can't
 succeed
 in
 the
 future.


It's
 just
 to
 say
 these
 companies
 haven't


put
 up
 the
 earnings
 growth.
 And


unfortunately,
 if
 they
 don't
 continue
 to


put
 up
 any
 earnings
 growth,
 which
 we


have
 earnings
 coming
 up,
 and
 you
 know,


if
 you
 just
 don't
 see
 really
 good
 solid


earnings
 from
 any
 of
 these
 companies,
 I


think
 the
 market
 is
 now
 in
 this,
 hey,


we're
 not
 going
 to
 tolerate
 this


type
 of
 mode.
 Like,
 maybe
 these


companies
 can
 put
 up
 nothing
 and
 just


say,
 hey,
 give
 us
 another
 couple


quarters,
 it's
 coming,
 and
 the
 market's


okay
 with
 that.
 But
 I
 think
 the
 market's


also
 like,
 dude,
 Google's
 doing
 115


billion
 of
 profits
 and
 Google
 still


doesn't
 trade
 at
 a
 30
 times
 PE.
 Google


did
 hit
 an
 all-time
 high
 today.
 Why
 are


we
 buying
 this
 that
 is
 promising
 us


revenue
 in
 the
 future?
 And
 quite


frankly,
 the
 market's
 not
 buying
 this.


It's
 a
 lot
 of
 retail
 that's
 buying
 this,


but
 a
 lot
 of
 retail
 might
 start
 to


recognize,
 why
 am
 I
 not
 buying
 Nvidia,


Palenteer,
 and
 Tesla,
 and
 these,
 you


know,
 even
 though
 those
 companies,
 you


could
 say,
 have
 aggressive
 multiples,


they
 are
 real,
 legit
 companies
 that
 are


putting
 up
 earnings.
 I
 can
 disagree
 with


the
 multiple,
 but
 I
 can't
 disagree
 with


the
 fact
 that
 they
 don't
 deserve
 a


multiple.
 And
 so
 I
 think
 the
 state
 of


the
 markets
 that
 we're
 in
 right
 now
 is


that
 if
 we
 have
 Fed
 cuts
 coming,
 we
 have


earnings
 growth,
 we
 have
 China
 tensions


that
 are
 potentially
 getting
 resolved,


we
 have
 more
 geopolitical
 stability


across
 the
 world,
 and
 we
 have
 a
 lot
 of


the
 momentum
 that
 has
 been
 taken
 out.


Again,
 the
 reason
 I'm
 harping
 on
 this


point,
 it's
 very
 important
 to
 understand


in
 2021,
 we
 had
 a
 meme
 stock
 ETF
 come


out
 that
 was
 the
 top.
 It
 was
 the
 tippy


top.
 And
 then
 by
 the
 end
 of
 uh
 or
 by
 mid


2023
 after
 the
 2022
 uh
 bare
 market
 19%


draw
 down
 on
 the
 S&P
 that
 meme
 stock
 ETF


went
 away.
 What
 happened
 a
 couple
 weeks


ago
 that
 freaked
 a
 lot
 of
 you
 guys
 out.


The
 meme
 stock
 ETF
 came
 back.
 And
 it


freaked
 me
 out
 too
 because
 you
 know
 as


someone
 who
 cares
 about
 the
 health
 of


the
 bull
 market
 I'm
 just
 like
 bro
 like


if
 if
 there's
 a
 literal
 ETF
 where
 you


could
 trade
 meme
 stocks
 and
 it's
 getting


a
 ton
 of
 trading
 volume
 that
 means


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 ready
 to
 chase


more
 and
 more
 names.
 I
 mean,
 literally,


ticker
 symbol
 ASST
 went
 up
 50%
 today


because
 someone
 with
 200,000
 followers


tweeted
 about
 it.
 Again,
 when
 you
 have


those
 things
 happening
 in
 the
 market,


and
 I
 think
 most
 people
 that
 have
 been


around
 at
 least
 for
 the
 past
 five
 years,


even
 if
 you've
 only
 been
 through
 one


cycle,
 you
 you
 you
 you
 know
 that's
 not


the
 best
 sign
 in
 the
 world.
 So,
 to
 see


that
 froth
 come
 away
 and
 come
 down
 and


the
 market
 continue
 to
 make
 a
 new


all-time
 high,
 I
 think
 is
 incredible.


And
 if
 those
 names
 put
 up
 good
 earnings,


they
 will
 probably
 get
 their
 multiples


again
 or
 grow
 into
 their
 multiples


because
 they
 deserve
 it.
 they
 don't
 then


they
 won't
 which
 is
 fine
 if
 Nvidia


doesn't
 put
 up
 the
 growth
 Nvidia
 doesn't


get
 a
 multiple
 either
 and
 and
 that's
 how


it
 should
 be
 in
 the
 stock
 market
 if
 you


can't
 grow
 if
 Grab
 which
 I
 love
 and
 I


think
 can
 break
 out
 to
 $10
 by
 next
 year


if
 they
 can't
 put
 up
 the
 earnings
 growth


they
 should
 not
 get
 a
 multiple


so
 I
 think
 we're
 in
 a
 market
 that
 is


relatively
 healthy
 and
 you
 know
 a
 lot
 of


the
 bears
 that
 are
 listening
 to
 this
 are


probably
 going
 to
 get
 mad
 at
 me
 for


saying
 this
 but
 I
 do
 think
 that
 the
 draw


down
 of
 momentum
 and
 people
 forcing


themselves
 to
 ask
 themselves
 why
 do
 I


own
 these
 names
 which
 everyone
 has
 to
 do


regardless
 of
 whatever
 name
 you
 own
 like


it
 forces
 you
 in
 a
 draw
 down
 to
 say
 is


this
 a
 fundamental
 company
 I
 deserve
 to


own
 that
 is
 what's
 been
 happening
 over


the
 past
 couple
 weeks
 and
 as
 a
 result
 of


going
 through
 those
 pains
 where
 you're


able
 to
 now
 see
 some
 gains
 and
 so
 I


think
 it
 has
 been
 a
 relatively
 strong


cycle
 over
 the
 past
 two
 weeks
 November


tends
 to
 be
 the
 best
 month
 of
 the
 year


on
 average
 up
 about
 four
 and a
 half%


going
 into
 the
 end
 of the
 year
 so
 I


think
 we
 are
 entering
 into
 a
 good
 time


and
 if
 we
 can
 get
 these
 earnings
 and


rate
 cuts
 that
 should
 only
 continue
 to


propel
 the
 bull
 market
 okay
 Tessy
 let's


talk
 about
 Tessy
 We
 got
 some
 pretty
 good


updates
 in
 the
 world
 of
 Tesla.


Caner
 Fitzgerald
 raised
 the
 price
 target


to
 510.
 Here's
 what
 they
 said.
 Tesla


disclosed
 that
 volume
 production
 of
 its


Cyber
 Cap,
 Semi
 and
 Mega
 Pack
 3
 are
 all


on
 track
 for
 fiscal
 year
 2026,
 which
 we


see
 is
 significant.
 Lastly,
 Tesla
 also


disclosed
 that
 it
 expects
 a
 significant


increase
 in
 capex
 for
 next
 year.


Overall,
 we
 remain
 bullish
 on
 Tesla
 over


the
 medium
 to
 long-term,
 and
 we
 continue


to
 see
 meaningful
 future
 upside
 from


energy
 storage
 and
 deployment,
 FSD,


RoboCap,
 Cyber,
 Robo
 Taxi,
 CyberCab,


Semis,
 and
 Optimus
 Bots.
 We
 maintained


our
 overweight
 rating
 and
 recently


increased
 our
 price
 target
 from
 355


to
 510.
 That's
 a
 pretty
 big
 upgrade
 from


Cancer
 Fitzgerald.
 They're
 basically


betting
 on
 the
 robo
 taxis
 and
 FSD
 story


starting
 to
 materialize
 in
 2026,
 which
 I


think
 they're
 going to
 be
 right
 about.
 I


don't
 know
 how
 much
 that
 impacts


earnings,
 but
 we
 will
 see
 some
 like
 more


probably
 progress
 on
 like
 actual
 deals


and
 things
 of
 that
 nature
 even
 if
 the


earnings
 catalyst
 is
 in
 uh
 2027.
 So,


that's
 really
 important.
 Then
 you've
 got


um
 Morgan
 Stanley's
 Adam
 Jonas
 who's


been
 a
 Tesla
 analyst
 for
 a
 long
 time


saying,
 "I'm
 calling
 it.
 Autonomous
 cars


are
 solved.
 Do
 I
 mean
 six
 or
 seven
 nines


to
 the
 right
 of
 the
 decimal?
 No.


Perfection?
 Never.
 But
 enough
 to
 pull


the
 safety
 driver
 at
 scale
 in
 major


metros."
 Here's
 what
 he
 said.
 From
 our


discussions
 with
 Tesla,
 it
 appears
 the


only
 thing
 preventing
 Tesla
 from
 pulling


a
 driver
 in
 its
 own
 abundance
 of


caution.
 Our
 understanding
 is
 that
 there


is
 no
 explicit
 regulatory
 approval


required
 to
 pull
 drivers
 in
 Texas.
 A


passive
 optical
 only
 AV
 system
 would


seriously
 challenge
 the
 conventional


thinking
 of
 many
 in
 the
 robo
 taxi


community.
 Tesla
 truly
 believes
 that
 the


radar
 and
 ligard
 do
 not
 make
 its
 cars


any
 safer.
 It
 is
 our
 long-standing


opinion
 that
 if
 you
 solve
 autonomy
 for


cars,
 you
 solve
 autonomy
 for
 many
 of
 the


other
 form
 factors
 of
 AI
 enabled


robotics.
 So,
 you've
 got
 a
 lot
 of
 these


Wall
 Street
 guys
 coming
 out
 and
 saying,


"Look,
 we
 know
 the
 earnings
 aren't
 that


impressive.
 We
 know
 they're
 growing


negative
 30%
 year-over-year,
 but


Tesla
 is
 the
 manifestation
 of
 physical


AI
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 robots
 and
 FSD.
 I


haven't
 tried
 FSD14
 yet.
 I
 do
 have
 to


download
 it.
 I
 know
 Elon
 said
 anyone
 has


the
 chance
 now
 to
 use
 it
 and
 download


it.
 So,
 I'm
 excited
 to
 use
 it.
 But,
 I


mean,
 FSD
 is
 pretty
 damn
 good.
 13.2.9


that
 I'm
 on
 doesn't
 seem
 like
 it's


getting
 any
 worse.
 And
 so,
 uh
 I
 think


the
 argument
 actually
 makes
 a
 lot
 of


sense
 from
 this
 perspective.
 If
 you
 do


solve
 autonomy,
 you
 probably
 solve
 the


broader
 implications
 around
 AI
 that
 uh


eventually
 are
 going
 to
 need
 to
 be


solved
 in
 regards
 to
 things
 like,
 you


know,
 other
 elements
 of
 physical
 AI
 like


humanoid
 robotics.
 The
 question
 then


becomes
 for
 Tesla.
 Where
 does
 the


earnings
 power
 come
 from?
 And
 I
 don't


think
 it's
 energy
 next
 year
 unless
 Tesla


really
 blows
 it
 out
 the
 water.
 But


again,
 that's
 just
 not
 a
 significant


part
 of
 the
 earnings
 growth.
 I
 don't


think
 it's
 FSD
 unless
 they
 sell
 a
 ton
 of


cars.
 And
 I
 know
 rates
 are
 coming
 down,


but
 you
 know,
 the
 question
 is
 if
 that
 EV


incentive
 is
 gone,
 is
 that
 going
 to
 be


enough
 to
 get
 people
 to
 buy
 the
 cars


which
 will
 allow
 them
 to
 even
 have
 a


chance
 to
 opt
 into
 FSD?
 So
 then
 the
 real


and
 then
 I
 don't
 think
 it's
 optimist
 in


26.
 So
 then
 the
 question
 becomes
 robo


taxi
 and
 as
 Adam
 Jonas
 says
 if
 they
 can


get
 rid
 of
 the
 driver
 in
 Austin
 then


that
 really
 becomes
 helpful
 because
 now


it's
 like
 a
 legit
 robo
 taxi
 network.
 If


they
 can
 expand
 to
 California,
 Nevada,


New
 York,
 etc.
 that
 would
 be
 a
 big
 deal


like
 Whimo's
 expanding.
 It's
 just
 the


Tesla
 expansion
 along
 with
 the
 ability


to
 have
 a
 differentiated
 form
 of
 FSD


compared
 to
 some
 of
 the
 competitors


would
 be
 very
 important.
 So
 I
 think


that's
 actually
 the
 catalyst
 for
 2026.


If
 you're
 excited
 about
 Tesla,
 you


really
 need
 robo
 taxi
 to
 begin
 to
 scale


and
 maybe
 26
 is
 not
 the
 year.
 But
 it


looks
 like
 and
 you
 know
 even
 based
 on


the
 price
 action
 with
 robo
 taxi
 or
 with


Tesla
 gapping
 up
 today,
 look
 at
 that
 455


in
 the
 after
 hours.
 I
 mean
 I
 think
 the


reason
 it's
 doing
 that
 even
 it
 touched


418
 back
 on
 the
 earnings
 day
 is
 simply


based
 on
 the
 idea
 that
 the
 street
 knows


this
 is
 the
 best
 way
 to
 get
 exposure
 to


AI
 at least
 in
 the
 physical
 realm.
 You


know
 you
 got
 Nvidia,
 you
 got
 the
 capex


build
 out,
 you
 got
 Google,
 Amazon,
 etc.


Tesla
 is
 going
 for
 the
 moonshot
 and
 if


they
 can
 execute
 on
 the
 moonshot
 and


Elon's
 very
 incentivized
 because
 he'll


get
 a
 trillion
 dollars
 if
 he
 does
 that


would
 not
 be
 the
 worst
 thing
 in
 the


world
 for
 Tesla.
 All right,
 last
 three


updates
 right
 here
 and
 then
 we
 will
 be


done
 for
 the
 day.
 First
 of
 all,
 Robin


got
 an
 upgrade
 from
 uh
 105
 to
 161
 by


Compass
 Point.
 Very
 similar
 to
 a
 lot
 of


the
 other
 upgrades
 it's
 been
 getting


over
 the
 past
 couple
 weeks
 into
 that
 140


to
 160
 range.
 And
 essentially
 the


analyst
 said
 our
 3Qbida
 forecast
 is
 6%


above
 the
 street
 and
 we
 are
 raising
 our


2026
 EPS.
 They
 acknowledge
 that
 Robin


Hood
 trades
 at
 a
 premium.
 Their
 argument


is
 if
 Robin
 Hood
 can
 continue
 beating


expectations,
 then
 that
 premium
 is


justified
 and
 as
 a
 result,
 they
 continue


to
 raise
 their
 price
 target.
 Robin
 Hood


almost
 back
 to
 150.
 It
 closed
 at
 146


today.
 Got
 to
 149.
 So
 again,
 this
 goes


back
 to
 my
 point
 about
 quality
 companies


like
 the
 Hood
 from
 150
 to
 120.
 They
 had


a
 momentum
 shakeddown
 which
 was
 good.
 I


don't
 think
 Robin
 Hood
 really
 deserved


to
 get
 to
 150
 in
 a
 week,
 which
 is,
 you


know,
 it
 would
 be
 a
 week
 and
 a
 half,


which
 again,
 I
 say
 this
 as
 someone
 who


has
 more
 than
 10,000
 shares
 of
 Robin


Hood.
 I
 I
 I
 love
 the
 company,
 but
 I
 also


know
 from
 a
 health
 perspective,
 this


thing
 needs
 to
 happen
 naturally
 with


catalyst,
 with
 earnings
 growth,
 not
 just


for
 the
 hell
 of
 it,
 because
 then
 it


becomes
 a
 meme.
 And
 I'm
 not
 interested


in
 investing
 in
 memes.
 I
 did
 that
 5


years
 ago,
 got
 burned.
 I'm
 sure
 a
 lot
 of


people
 feel
 the
 same.
 I
 want
 it
 to


actually
 be
 more
 natural.
 And
 so
 Robin


Hood
 falling
 to
 120,
 getting
 a
 lot
 of


the
 weak
 hands
 out
 of
 the
 system
 that


you
 know
 got
 into
 it
 for
 the
 wrong


reasons
 and
 getting
 actual
 dip
 buyers
 to


come
 in
 and
 having
 more
 of
 a
 catalyst


aka
 S&P
 500
 continuing
 to
 do
 well,


crypto
 continuing
 to
 do
 well
 and
 then


getting
 closer
 to
 earnings.
 So
 more


people
 are,
 you
 know,
 looking
 at
 what


numbers
 they
 could
 actually
 put
 up.
 That


is
 why
 it
 deserves
 to
 get
 back
 to


alltime
 highs.
 And
 then
 if
 they
 can


crush
 earnings,
 they
 deserve
 to
 continue


expanding
 their
 multiple.
 But
 they
 got


to
 crush
 earnings.
 They've
 got
 to
 show


it
 off.
 And
 I
 I
 think
 that's
 going to
 be


the
 most
 important
 thing
 as
 well.
 Same


thing
 for
 Nebius,
 which
 fell
 from
 140
 to


96,
 now
 recovering
 back
 to
 125.
 A
 lot
 of


these
 companies
 that
 got
 hit
 are


starting
 to
 come
 back,
 but
 they're


coming
 back
 with
 a
 vengeance.
 They're


not
 just
 coming
 back
 for
 the
 hell
 of


coming
 back.
 And
 the
 companies
 that


really
 got
 hit
 badly
 uh
 are
 coming
 back


a
 little
 bit,
 but
 if
 there's
 no


fundamentals,
 they
 might
 not
 continue
 to


come
 back.
 So,
 that
 was
 a
 really
 good


upgrade
 on
 Robin.
 I
 think
 we'll
 see
 more


of
 them.
 Google
 got
 upgraded
 to
 300.
 Uh


Anthropic
 is
 going
 to
 be
 buying
 a


million
 more
 TPUs,
 which
 are
 Google's


custom
 chips.


I
 mean,
 Google
 now
 $3.1
 trillion


company.
 For
 those
 that
 bought
 at
 150


during
 the
 year
 and
 you
 ignored
 the


noise,
 give
 yourself
 a
 pat
 on
 the
 back.


I
 mean,
 you
 absolutely
 deserve
 the


gains.
 And
 Google
 doesn't
 look
 like


they're
 slowing
 down.
 If
 this
 thing
 has


a
 three
 handle
 on
 it
 by
 the
 end
 of
 the


year,
 it
 would
 uh
 be
 essentially
 a


double
 from
 150
 to
 300
 in
 four
 months.


So,
 Google
 continues
 to
 be
 one
 of
 the


best
 Mac
 7
 names.
 It
 is
 the
 second
 best


Mac
 performing
 name,
 up
 37%
 year-to
 date


and
 80%
 from
 the
 April
 lows.
 and
 it


continues
 to
 get
 upgraded
 by
 the
 street.


Uh,
 last
 two
 updates,
 one
 last
 thing
 on


Google.
 Google's
 officially
 purchasing


nuclear
 power.
 Bloomberg
 is
 reporting


today
 that
 Next
 Era
 Energy,
 NE,
 ticker


symbol,
 plans
 to
 restart
 a
 nuclear
 power


plant
 in
 Iowa,
 and
 Google
 is
 uh


competing
 to
 be
 the
 bidder
 for
 that


nuclear
 power.
 So,
 again,
 the
 data


center
 energy
 names.
 We're
 going
 to
 do
 a


lot
 more
 of
 deep
 dives
 into
 energy


stocks
 going
 into
 the
 end
 of
 the
 year,


but
 I
 do
 think
 that
 2026
 will
 be
 an


energy
 fuel
 theme.
 And
 Google
 looks
 like


they're
 going
 to
 start
 to
 buy
 more


nuclear
 power.
 They
 started
 investing


$15
 billion
 in
 India.
 Last
 week
 they


said
 for
 data
 centers
 definitely
 looks


like
 energy
 is
 going
 to
 be
 there.
 Now


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 energy
 names
 that
 are
 a


bit
 expensive
 in
 my
 opinion.
 So
 I'm


trying
 to
 look
 for
 the
 real
 value
 in
 the


energy
 names.
 ENS
 is
 a
 the
 stock
 that
 I


think
 a
 lot
 of people
 should
 look
 at
 as


well.
 Uh
 I
 did
 a
 Twitter
 spaces
 on
 that


a
 while
 ago.
 I'll
 put
 that
 in
 the


description
 for
 those
 that
 want
 to
 hear


the
 audio
 version
 of
 it.
 But
 that
 one's


more
 in
 battery
 production.
 Still


important
 for
 energy.
 Final
 update
 right


here.
 There
 is
 room
 for
 Qualcomm
 to


generate
 significant
 AI
 inference


related
 revenue
 longterm.
 Rosenlat
 gives


them
 a
 buy
 target
 at
 225.
 Now
 Qualcomm


is
 one
 of
 those
 names
 that
 I'm
 sure
 a


lot
 of
 people
 have
 heard
 about,
 but


today
 if
 you
 were
 live
 in
 the
 market


open,
 you
 saw
 this
 bad
 boy
 gap
 up
 20%.


End
 of
 the
 day
 up
 only
 11%.
 Went
 from


205
 to
 187.
 Essentially,
 they
 introduced


a
 couple
 new
 chips
 and
 people
 thought


they
 were
 competitors
 to
 Nvidia
 and
 AMD.


Uh
 Rosenlat
 said,
 "We
 view
 today's


announcement
 as
 a
 positive
 for
 the


Qualcomm
 shares
 for
 the
 longer
 term.
 For


years,
 management
 strategy
 has
 been
 to


diversify
 its
 end
 markets
 while
 growing


its
 smartphone
 market
 share.
 Landing
 a


200
 megawatt
 deployment
 with
 Human
 is
 a


very
 good
 step.
 This
 is
 in
 Saudi
 Arabia.


In
 a
 new
 growth
 vector
 in
 AI
 inference


data
 centers,
 as
 a
 reminder,
 in
 May
 this


year,
 AMD
 and
 Human
 announced
 a
 500


megawatt
 deployment
 worth
 10
 billion.


While
 revenue
 details
 have
 not
 been


provided,
 we
 expect
 Qualcomm's


deployment
 with
 human
 to
 generate


potentially
 two
 billion
 in
 revenue.


Deployment
 is
 expected
 to
 start
 in
 26.


Inference
 stage
 AI
 market
 is
 expected
 to


be
 250
 billion
 by
 2030
 and
 growing
 20%


annually.
 I'm
 going
 to
 try
 to
 dig
 a


little
 deeper
 into
 what
 the
 heck's
 going


on
 with
 Qualcomm,
 but
 it
 does
 seem
 like,


you
 know,
 these
 new
 chips
 bring
 up
 some


questions
 of,
 hey,
 can
 they
 potentially


take
 some
 market
 share
 from
 the
 AMDs,


Nvidas
 of
 the
 world?
 I
 think
 there's
 a


massive
 market
 for
 old
 companies
 to


survive,
 but
 you
 potentially
 have
 a
 new


player
 that
 Rosenlat
 is
 bullish
 on.
 Some


of
 the
 other
 semiconductor
 analysts
 are


like,
 well,
 this
 is
 not
 really
 replacing


the
 MI450
 or
 Blackwell.
 Uh,
 but
 it's


nice
 to
 see
 more
 and
 more
 semiconductor


companies
 getting
 into
 the
 mix
 and


continuing
 to
 prove
 that
 the
 AI
 capex


buildout
 is
 not
 slowing
 down.
 All right,


that's
 it
 for
 me.
 Thank
 you
 everybody


for
 listening
 and
 watching.
 Again,
 thank


you
 for
 the
 happy
 birthday
 wishes.
 Means


the
 absolute
 world.
 I
 cannot
 say
 from


the
 bottom
 of
 my
 heart
 how
 much
 I
 uh
 am


blessed
 to
 be
 in
 this
 position
 and
 I


don't
 take
 it
 for
 granted.
 You
 know,
 I


worked
 really
 hard
 over
 the
 past
 four


years
 to
 get
 here,
 but
 I
 also
 understand


how
 much
 of
 a
 community
 uh
 has
 been


formed
 and
 how
 much
 I
 care
 about
 serving


that
 community
 every
 single
 day.
 So,
 um


just
 been
 an
 incredible
 ride,
 the
 ride


of
 a
 lifetime.
 Thank
 you
 to
 everyone
 who


reached
 out.
 It
 truly
 truly
 means
 so


much
 to
 me.
 And
 uh
 yeah,
 we're
 going to


just
 keep
 it
 going.
 Thank
 everybody.


Appreciate
 you
 all.
 Love
 you
 all.
