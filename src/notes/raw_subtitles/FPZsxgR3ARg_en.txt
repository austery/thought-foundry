If
 you
 walk
 into
 a
 room
 with
 a
 baby,
 you


automatically
 start
 to
 change
 how
 you


speak.
 Why
 do
 we
 do
 that?
 It
 turns
 out


that
 people,
 including
 babies,
 learn


best
 when
 we
 are
 challenged,
 but
 not


overwhelmed.
 This
 experience,
 where
 we


struggle
 productively,
 is
 called
 optimal


challenge.
 Here's
 how
 it
 works.
 Your


brain
 makes
 predictions
 about
 the
 world


based
 on
 all
 the
 data
 you've
 collected


from
 experience,
 and
 it
 updates
 its


model
 when
 its
 predictions
 are
 wrong.
 A


baby
 might
 see
 a
 furry
 animal
 and
 expect


a
 dog.
 But
 when
 she
 points
 and
 says


doggy,
 dad
 corrects
 her
 and
 says
 that's


a
 cat.
 Can
 you
 say
 cat?
 This
 acts
 as


feedback
 for
 the
 baby
 to
 update
 its


model.
 So
 how
 can
 we
 use
 the
 concept
 of


optimal
 challenge
 when
 we're
 learning?


It's
 probably
 obvious
 that
 if
 you
 don't


challenge
 yourself,
 there's
 no


prediction
 errors
 to
 learn
 from.
 But


more
 struggle
 isn't
 always
 better


either.
 Skipping
 a
 grade
 in
 school
 or


getting
 a
 job
 that
 you're
 not
 qualified


for
 won't
 necessarily
 force
 you
 to
 learn


faster.
 It
 might
 just
 leave
 you
 more


confused
 and
 exhausted.
 In
 education,


the
 most
 analogous
 concept
 to
 optimal


challenge
 is
 Zygotssky's
 zone
 of


proximal
 development.
 It's
 a
 gap
 between


what
 the
 learner
 can
 achieve


independently
 and
 what
 they
 can
 achieve


with
 assistance.
 The
 big
 takeaway
 here


is
 a
 knowledgeable
 other
 that
 can


simplify
 things.
 That
 allows
 you
 to
 work


up
 to
 concepts
 that
 would
 otherwise
 be


inaccessible.
