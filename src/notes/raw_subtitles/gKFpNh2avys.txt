Hi
 Malala,
 I'm
 Anna.


>> Today
 I'm
 speaking
 to
 Malala
 Yusfsai.


Malala
 became
 a
 feminist
 and
 political


icon
 at
 15
 years
 old
 after
 a
 member
 of


the
 Taliban
 tried
 to
 assassinate
 her


while
 she
 was
 riding
 the
 school
 bus.
 She


was
 targeted
 for
 saying
 that
 girls


should
 have
 the
 right
 to
 go
 to
 school.


>> When
 I
 see
 my
 school
 in
 this
 way,
 so
 I'm


very
 shameful
 of
 my
 army.


>> At
 16,
 she
 wrote
 a
 memoir
 about
 the


experience.
 And
 at
 17,
 she
 won
 the
 Nobel


Peace
 Prize,
 becoming
 the
 youngest


person
 to
 ever
 win
 that
 award.
 For


years,
 the
 world
 has
 known
 her
 as
 this


extraordinary
 young
 activist.
 But
 now,


she
 has
 a
 new
 memoir
 out.
 It's
 called


Finding
 My
 Way.
 And
 in
 it,
 she
 talks


about
 learning
 to
 do
 ordinary
 things,


make
 friends,
 find
 her
 personal
 style,


go
 to
 parties,
 study
 for
 exams,
 even


fall
 in
 love.
 From
 the
 New
 York
 Times,


I'm
 Anna
 Martin.
 This
 is
 Modern
 Love.


Malala,
 welcome
 to
 Modern
 Love.


>> Thank
 you.


>> We
 are
 so
 happy
 that
 you're
 in
 the


studio
 with
 us.
 Congratulations
 on
 your


new
 memoir,
 Finding
 My
 Way.


>> Thank
 you
 so
 much.
 I'm
 so
 excited.


>> You
 are
 now
 a
 double
 memoirist.


>> Yes.


>> Will
 you
 make
 it
 a
 third
 a
 triple
 memoir


in
 a
 couple
 years
 or
 is
 this
 enough
 for


>> Oh,
 I
 just
 want
 to
 focus
 on
 this
 one
 for


now.


>> That
 makes
 sense.
 How
 many
 memoirs
 can


one
 person
 write?
 Do
 you
 think
 there's
 a


limit?


>> I
 think
 people
 know
 when
 it's
 time
 to


write
 one.


>> I
 actually
 waited
 for
 this
 one.
 Um,
 I


was
 asked
 by
 so
 many
 people,
 why
 don't


you
 write
 another
 book?
 And
 I
 was
 like,


about
 what?
 Like,
 who
 wants
 to
 write
 if


there's
 nothing
 meaningful?
 But
 the


timing
 of
 Finding
 My
 Way,
 uh,
 my
 new


memoir
 just
 felt
 right.
 And
 I
 knew
 there


was
 something
 to
 share
 that
 is


meaningful
 to
 people.


>> Tell
 me
 more
 about
 how
 you
 knew
 the


moment
 was
 right
 to
 begin
 writing.
 I


love
 that
 that
 you
 waited
 even
 though


people
 were
 clamoring.
 It
 sounds
 like,


how
 did
 you
 know
 the
 time
 was
 right?


>> I
 was
 reflecting
 on
 how
 I
 had
 become
 a


young
 woman.
 M


>> I
 was
 known
 in
 the
 public
 eye
 as
 a
 girl


who
 was
 shot
 by
 the
 Taliban
 at
 age
 15.


And
 I
 was
 still
 meeting
 people
 who
 would


see
 me
 as
 that
 girl


>> and
 I
 wanted
 to
 reintroduce
 myself


beyond
 those
 titles,
 beyond
 those


headlines.
 And
 I
 wanted
 to
 show
 that
 now


I
 have
 experienced
 much
 more.
 I
 had
 this


incredible
 time
 at
 college.
 I
 made


incredible
 friends.
 I
 had
 my
 first
 love.


I
 am
 married.
 I
 have
 been
 going
 through


other
 challenges
 and
 difficulties
 from


like
 mental
 health
 to
 even
 coming
 to
 a


decision
 about
 marriage
 itself.
 But
 this


is
 all
 a
 part
 of
 me
 and
 activism
 is
 of


course
 the
 mission
 of
 my
 life.
 But
 you


know
 I


>> I'm
 I'm
 more
 than
 that
 as
 well
 and
 I


wanted
 to
 share
 the
 personal
 story.
 So


these
 are
 you
 know
 these
 are
 the
 true


reflections
 of
 of
 me.
 This
 is,
 I
 think,


very
 important
 and
 part
 of
 the
 reason
 I


I
 loved
 this
 book
 so
 much
 is,
 you
 know,


you're
 you
 are
 so
 immediately


recognizable,
 right?
 Your
 name,
 your


face,
 your
 work.
 And
 I
 loved
 how
 this


book,
 it
 talks
 about
 big
 things


certainly,
 but
 at
 the
 same
 time,
 there


were
 all
 of
 these
 small,
 ordinary,


everyday
 details
 about
 your
 life
 that
 I


thought
 just
 added
 such
 dimension.
 I


felt
 very
 grateful
 that
 you
 were
 sharing


those
 things
 with
 us.


I
 think
 we
 see
 this
 perfect
 image
 of


everybody
 on
 social
 media
 or
 the
 way


people
 usually
 tell
 their
 story
 is
 um


like
 you
 know
 they
 somehow
 knew
 how
 to


figure
 it
 all
 out.
 But
 I
 had
 to
 be
 very


honest
 that


>> I
 was
 actually
 very
 shy
 at
 school.
 I
 was


so
 scared
 that
 I
 will
 never
 be
 able
 to


make
 any
 friends.
 So
 in
 college
 of


course
 I
 was
 you
 know
 there
 because
 I
 I


wanted
 to
 study
 at
 Oxford
 but
 more
 than


anything
 I
 just
 wanted
 to
 make
 friends.


M
 I
 did
 not
 want
 to
 feel
 alone
 anymore.


Before
 you
 went
 to
 college,
 when
 you


were
 a
 teenager,
 it
 seemed
 to
 me
 reading


this
 book
 that
 you
 had
 quite
 a
 serious


life,
 right?
 You're
 flying
 to
 speak
 with


world
 leaders
 and
 and
 be
 on
 panels.


You're
 doing
 public
 activism
 work.


>> What
 was
 it
 like
 for
 you
 to
 be
 doing
 all


of
 this
 stuff


>> so
 young
 and
 so
 close
 to
 the
 attack?


What
 was
 that
 like?


When
 I
 look
 back,
 I
 feel
 very
 different


because


now
 I
 see
 how
 I
 had
 somehow
 accepted
 the


global


recognition
 I
 was
 given.


>> And
 I
 felt
 like
 people
 were
 defining
 me


when
 I
 was
 still
 in
 a
 coma.


>> They
 were
 calling
 me
 brave,
 courageous,


an
 activist,


>> speaks
 truth
 to
 power,
 all
 of
 that.
 And


I
 was
 like,
 "Wow,
 I'm
 I'm
 15.
 I
 have
 to


start
 my
 school
 again
 and
 figure
 out
 my


life
 in
 a
 new
 country
 in
 in
 the
 UK.


>> Um,
 so
 much
 to
 process
 yet
 this
 is
 now


the
 the
 mission
 of
 my
 life.


>> Somehow
 I
 was
 forcing
 myself
 to
 accept


that.


>> In
 school,
 I
 had
 like
 literally
 no


friends.
 I
 only
 made
 best
 friend,
 one


best
 friend
 by
 the
 end
 of
 my
 school


time.
 Um,
 I
 would
 still
 talk
 to
 my
 old


friends
 from
 Pakistan,
 have
 those
 long


uh
 calls
 with
 them


>> and
 the
 rest
 of
 my
 time
 I
 was
 either


with
 the
 family
 at
 home
 or
 I
 would
 be


traveling
 doing
 speeches
 and


conferences.
 So,
 my
 exposure
 was
 very


limited.
 I
 actually
 had
 not
 seen
 boys
 my


age


>> cuz
 you
 went
 to
 an
 all
 girls
 school.


>> I
 went
 to
 an
 all
 girls
 school
 and
 it
 was


like
 just
 older
 people.


>> They
 weren't
 so
 amazing
 at
 age
 15.
 I'll


just
 share
 that
 as
 someone
 who
 was


around.
 No,
 then
 I
 I
 found
 out
 when
 I


went
 to
 like
 wasn't
 missing
 anything.


Yeah.


>> No,
 I
 was
 like,
 "Oh,
 I'm
 I'm
 glad
 I
 saw


it."
 And
 then
 now
 I
 now
 I
 know.
 But


>> they
 smell
 kind
 of
 weird,
 don't
 you


think?


>> A
 lot
 of
 things.
 I
 think
 that
 could
 be
 a


different
 podcast
 for
 us.


>> But
 it
 was
 just
 this
 feeling
 that
 um
 you


know,
 I
 was
 not
 living
 the
 the
 life
 a


child
 should
 be
 living
 at
 age
 15.
 So
 at


college
 like
 much
 later
 when
 I
 was
 not


being
 watched
 by
 my
 parents
 when
 I
 felt


I
 could
 be
 myself
 and
 there
 are
 not


these
 work
 people
 after
 me
 asking
 me
 to


do
 this
 and
 that
 and
 I
 thought
 I
 had


just
 more
 control
 over
 like
 my
 life.


That's
 when
 I
 was
 like,
 "Okay,
 I'm
 gonna


like,
 you
 know,
 just
 hang
 out,
 do
 these


crazy
 things.
 Somebody
 wants
 me
 to
 climb


the
 rooftop,
 I
 will.
 Late
 night,
 we're


going
 to
 get
 to
 that.
 I
 will."


>> Uh,
 yeah.
 I
 think
 it's
 I
 thought
 that


college
 would
 be
 just
 this
 limited
 time


of
 my
 life
 where
 I
 get
 to
 do
 anything
 I


want
 and
 then
 after
 that
 maybe
 I'll
 just


go
 back
 to
 the
 old,
 you
 know,
 serious


life.
 But
 I
 was
 like,
 this
 is
 that
 time,


the
 three
 years
 where
 I'm
 studying
 at


Oxford.
 Maybe
 I
 can
 be
 more
 adventurous.


>> Right.
 Before
 you
 go
 to
 Oxford,
 this


moment
 in
 the
 book
 tickled
 me
 so
 much.


You're
 trying
 to
 figure
 out
 what
 to


pack,
 what
 to
 wear.


>> Yes.


>> Because
 your
 mom
 had
 chosen
 your


outfits,
 right?


>> Yes.


>> Do
 you
 remember?
 I
 mean,
 of
 course,
 it's


your
 life,
 but
 why
 don't
 you
 share
 what


you
 did
 in
 order
 to
 figure
 out,
 you


know,
 what
 what
 to
 pack?
 I
 loved
 this


detail.


>> I
 know.
 I
 love
 my
 mom,
 but
 she's
 a
 very


strict
 mom
 and
 she
 was
 always
 deciding


what
 I
 should
 be
 wearing.
 Same
 for


university.
 She
 said,
 "Let
 me
 pack


everything
 for
 you."
 So,
 it
 was,
 you


know,
 traditional
 dresses,
 shelvaramies.


And
 my
 mom
 always
 got
 me
 a
 size
 bigger


than
 mine
 somehow.
 And
 it
 it's
 just
 no


sense
 of
 fashion.
 None
 of
 that
 for
 me.


>> Much
 love,
 mom,
 though.
 We'll
 say


>> I
 know.
 I
 know.
 But
 for
 me
 at


university,
 it
 was
 about
 me
 feeling
 like


every
 other
 student.
 And
 I
 did
 not
 want


to
 stand
 out
 because
 of
 course
 when
 I


wear
 my
 shvaramies
 the
 traditional


Pakistani
 dress
 I
 do
 stand
 out
 and


people
 have
 seen
 me
 in
 the
 public
 eye
 in


those
 outfits.
 So,
 I
 wanted
 to
 just
 wear


a
 jumper,
 just
 jeans,


>> sweater.
 Again,
 I'm
 decoding
 sweater,


>> trousers,
 um,
 a
 hoodie,
 pants.
 Oh
 my


goodness.


>> Now,
 it's
 become
 kind
 of
 a
 bid,
 but
 the


UK,
 you
 No,
 it's
 totally
 fine.
 I'm
 I'm


translating
 for
 them
 so
 they'll


understand.


>> Very
 very
 casual
 clothes
 that
 you
 just


assimilate
 and
 and
 you're
 you're
 like


any
 other
 student.
 That's
 what
 I
 wanted.


I
 was
 like,
 I
 just
 want
 to
 be
 a
 normal


student.


>> So,
 yeah,
 my
 mom
 would
 put
 a
 Pakistani


dress.
 I
 would
 remove
 it
 and
 put
 in
 a


jumper
 and
 somehow
 I
 I
 found
 a
 way
 out


through
 that
 and
 I
 took
 these,
 you
 know,


more
 casual
 clothes
 and
 my
 search
 on


Google
 at
 the
 time
 was
 Selena
 Gomez
 2017


casual
 outfits.


>> Was
 it
 like
 a
 lot
 of
 infinity
 scarves?


Do
 you
 remember
 those
 things?


>> Yes.
 And
 just
 like
 those
 long
 um
 sort
 of


gemstone
 kind
 of
 necklaces.


>> We
 were
 so
 It
 look
 like
 chandeliers.


>> Yeah.


>> Why
 were
 we
 dressing
 like
 that?


>> I
 know.
 too
 many
 scarves
 around
 their


neck.


>> So
 many
 infinity
 scarf
 when
 it
 wasn't


even
 cold,
 I
 will
 say.


>> No,
 no,
 but
 I
 want
 to
 forget
 all
 of


those
 outfits
 that
 I
 wore
 once.
 I
 was


like,
 "Okay,


>> we
 should
 move
 on.
 We
 should
 move
 on."


>> So,
 you
 get
 to
 Oxford
 with
 a
 suitcase


full
 of
 Selena
 Gomez
 casual.


>> Yes.


>> Who
 were
 the
 people
 you
 were
 drawn
 to
 as


friends?


>> Wow.
 I
 I
 was
 exploring
 um


the
 whole
 university.
 I
 was
 saying
 hello


to
 almost
 everybody
 because


there
 was
 no
 criteria
 for
 me.
 I
 wanted


to
 meet
 as
 many
 people.
 There
 were


incredible
 people
 in
 my
 subject
 group.


Every
 friend
 was
 unique
 in
 their
 own
 way


>> and
 we
 had
 a
 lot
 in
 common
 but
 also
 very


different
 experiences
 in
 terms
 of
 our


background
 where
 we
 had
 come
 from.
 There


was
 always
 something
 to
 talk
 about
 and


always
 something
 to
 learn.
 when
 you
 were


with
 friends,


>> they
 made
 Oxford
 life
 more
 fun
 for
 me


because
 this
 was
 a
 time
 when
 I
 was
 not


being
 asked
 about
 what
 was
 it
 like


meeting
 that
 president
 and
 so
 what
 do


you
 do
 through
 Malala
 Fund?
 It
 was
 about


how
 was
 your
 essay
 last
 week?
 Wasn't


that
 question
 so
 hard?
 Did
 you
 figure
 it


out?
 This
 tutor
 is
 like
 so
 annoying
 or


can
 we
 skip
 this
 lecture
 please?
 Yeah.


Yeah.


>> These
 were
 the
 conversations
 and
 that's


exactly
 what
 I
 wanted.
 I
 wanted
 to
 be
 a


student.
 I
 wanted
 to
 be
 uh
 treated
 as
 a


friend.
 And
 all
 of
 these
 people,
 the


incredible
 friends
 I
 made
 at
 Oxford


made
 me
 feel
 like
 I
 was
 their
 friend


>> and
 I
 felt
 so
 secure
 with
 them,
 not


being
 judged.
 And


>> yeah,
 this
 was
 the
 most
 precious
 thing


from
 college.
 You
 are
 making
 friends.


You're
 doing
 all
 these,
 you
 know,


totally
 normal
 college
 activities.


>> Yes.


>> And
 yet
 you
 do
 have
 a
 security
 detail


that
 follows
 you
 on
 campus.
 And
 I
 wasn't


exactly
 clear
 in
 that.
 Are
 they
 quite


literally
 everywhere
 with
 you?
 Just
 a


few
 steps
 behind
 or
 how
 was
 that?


>> Yeah,
 they're
 following
 you.
 They
 are
 uh


non-uniform
 and
 they
 want
 to
 keep
 it
 as


normal
 for
 you
 as
 they
 can.


>> Sure.
 But
 there
 is
 a
 point
 where
 your


friends
 are
 like,
 "We
 see
 these


strangers
 behind
 you
 every
 day.
 Are
 you


okay?
 Are
 they
 following
 you?"
 And
 I'm


like, "No,
 no,
 they're
 just
 taking
 care


of
 me.
 Don't
 worry."


>> They
 would
 come
 to
 like
 parties
 and


stuff.


>> Yeah.


>> Okay,
 that's
 fine.


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean,


>> some
 older
 guys
 at
 the
 party.
 It's
 fine.


>> Quite
 older.


>> Yeah.
 Quite
 older.
 They
 could
 blend
 in.


You
 also
 got
 up
 to
 some
 mischief
 in


college
 in
 the
 dead
 of
 night.
 Tell
 me


about
 that.


>> Yeah.
 So
 in
 college
 I
 found
 out
 about


rooftop
 climbing
 and
 this
 is
 some
 like
 a


secret
 thing
 that
 these
 students
 do
 um


where
 they're
 like
 we
 want
 to
 get
 in


trouble.
 So
 in
 our
 college
 um
 at
 Oxford


there
 is
 the
 bell
 tower


>> y


>> and
 it's
 not
 easy
 to
 get
 up
 there
 so
 you


have
 to
 go
 up
 to
 the
 top
 uh


>> yeah
 describe
 it
 for
 me
 in
 case
 I
 want


to
 ever
 go
 to
 Oxford
 and
 sort
 of
 climb


this.


>> I
 think
 you
 should
 not
 do
 that.
 I
 think


it's
 not
 allowed
 anymore,
 but
 if
 you


know,


>> so
 you
 go
 up
 to
 the
 top
 floor
 of
 the


main
 Talbert
 Hall,


>> okay?


>> And
 you
 get
 into
 this
 small
 room
 there,


and
 there's


a
 small
 window,
 and
 you
 open
 that


window,
 you
 sneak
 out
 through
 the


window,
 and
 there
 is
 this
 narrow
 um
 roof


um
 path,
 but
 it's
 very
 narrow.
 getting


soious,
 but
 keep
 going.
 Yes,


>> you
 could
 put
 like
 one
 foot
 at
 a
 time


basically
 like


>> like
 show
 me
 with
 your
 hands
 how
 narrow


is
 it.


>> Don't
 you
 even
 say
 that


>> it's
 very
 narrow.
 It's
 it's
 basically


like
 the
 roofs
 sort
 of
 the
 the
 edge,
 you


know,
 the
 side


>> you're
 clinging
 on
 basically.


>> And
 there's
 like
 another
 part
 where
 you


sort
 of
 have
 to
 like
 jump.
 Now
 this
 next


part
 of
 the
 the
 roof,
 it's
 very
 scary.


So
 I
 had
 like
 I
 had
 that
 mysterious


friend
 who
 took
 me
 there
 and
 and
 they


like
 you
 know
 were
 helping
 me
 and
 so


they
 jumped
 before
 and
 then
 I
 jumped


after.


>> It's
 night
 right?


>> It's
 it's
 midnight.
 It's
 very
 late
 at


night.


>> Are
 there
 lights
 around?
 Describe
 it.
 So


and
 and
 put
 me
 in
 that
 moment
 with
 you


the
 first
 time.
 So
 it's
 dark
 outside.


You're
 looking
 out
 right
 about
 to
 take


that
 jump.
 What's
 going
 through
 your


mind?


>> It's
 very
 dark
 in
 the
 college.


It's
 quiet
 and
 I
 felt
 like
 it
 was
 just


me
 who
 was
 in
 control
 of
 what
 was


happening
 and
 we
 were
 about
 to
 climb
 the


rooftop.
 It
 was
 a
 very
 risky
 journey


because
 you're
 walking
 on
 these
 very


narrow
 uh
 path
 of
 the
 roof
 and
 one


misstep
 you
 will
 fall
 from
 the
 fourth


floor
 of
 the
 building.
 I
 don't
 think
 you


will
 survive.


>> So
 then
 you
 go
 up
 to
 the
 bell
 tower
 and


you
 sort
 of
 sit
 in
 there
 and
 you
 could


see,
 you
 know,
 the
 the
 bell
 uh


>> above
 you
 and
 it's
 just
 so
 beautiful.


You
 look
 down,
 you
 could
 see
 the
 whole


college.
 You're
 wondering
 who's
 doing


what
 in
 their
 room.
 Some
 have
 their


lights
 on
 and
 some
 might
 be
 sleeping


right
 now.
 You
 look
 at
 the
 library
 who's


still
 studying
 at
 midnight
 and
 and
 you


look
 down
 and
 you're
 like,
 hm,
 are
 these


the
 the
 college
 security?
 I
 hope
 they're


not
 looking
 for
 you.
 Um
 and
 um
 I
 had


just
 told
 my
 security
 that
 night
 that
 I


was,
 you
 know,
 done
 with
 everything.
 You


guys
 can
 go
 to
 bed.
 So
 I
 was
 just


looking
 at
 sort
 of
 their
 room
 as
 well,


>> feeling
 alone


>> and
 hoping
 that
 um
 they
 do
 not
 suddenly


wake
 up
 and
 look
 for
 me.


>> It
 was
 a
 moment
 where


I
 felt
 so
 close
 to
 nature,
 so
 close
 to


myself.


I
 could
 hear
 my


my
 heart
 and
 it
 was
 just
 a
 magical


beautiful
 moment
 and
 there
 I
 was
 sitting


with
 a
 stranger
 just
 doing
 something


that
 uh
 I
 should
 not
 have
 been
 doing.


>> But
 I
 was
 okay
 to
 get
 in
 trouble.
 I


wanted
 to
 try
 things
 without
 feeling


like
 anybody
 was
 watching
 me,
 anybody


was
 judging
 me
 or
 commenting
 about
 me.


It
 sounds
 too
 dramatic
 when
 I
 talk
 about


it,
 but
 it
 was


>> truly
 a
 moment
 when
 I
 felt
 um
 that
 I
 am


living
 the
 true
 college
 experience.


>> It
 is
 to
 me
 a
 really
 profound
 moment
 of


like
 reckoning
 and
 introspection
 for


you,
 right?
 And
 you
 spoke
 about
 how


you'd
 accepted
 this
 role
 other
 people


had
 put
 you
 into
 and
 certainly
 that


you'd
 also
 stepped
 into
 on
 your
 own
 with


your
 work
 and
 your
 fund.
 But
 this
 is
 a


thing
 and
 I
 say
 this
 with
 utmost,
 you


know,
 care.
 It's
 a
 stupid
 thing
 to
 do


because
 it's
 so
 far
 up.
 But
 it's
 like


you're
 doing
 it
 because
 you
 want
 to,


right?


>> You're
 doing
 it
 because
 you're
 like,


"Let's
 do
 it."


>> Yeah.
 And
 that
 was
 my
 first
 time,
 but


not
 my
 last
 time.


>> And
 why
 would
 you
 keep
 doing
 it?


It's
 it's
 really
 hard
 to
 explain.
 Um


>> trying
 climbing
 to
 the
 rooftop
 made
 me


connect
 to


a
 part
 of
 me
 that
 I
 thought
 had
 gone


missing.


>> And
 I
 was
 a
 very
 adventurous
 person


growing
 up
 in
 Pakistan.
 I
 loved
 to
 try


new
 things.
 I
 was
 adventurous.
 And


you
 know
 when
 my
 life
 took
 a
 sharp
 turn


and
 I
 started
 a
 new
 life
 in
 a
 new


country
 I
 just
 thought
 I
 could
 never


connect
 back
 to
 that
 old
 self
 or
 I
 would


just
 never
 know
 what
 I
 would
 have
 been


like
 if
 none
 of
 these
 things
 had


happened
 if
 I
 hadn't
 been
 attacked
 if
 I


hadn't
 started
 this
 activist
 life
 um
 in


a
 new
 place
 that
 when
 I
 was
 in
 college


and
 when
 I
 was
 climbing
 rooftops
 I
 felt


like
 I
 was
 connecting
 ing
 with
 that
 old


part
 of
 me.
 With
 time,
 I
 have
 become


that
 person
 that
 I
 I
 try
 new
 things.
 I


don't
 care
 if
 I
 do
 it
 wrong
 or
 if
 I
 get


judged
 for
 it
 or
 what
 people
 think
 about


it.
 With
 time,
 you
 just
 realize
 you
 have


to
 live
 your
 life.


>> And
 you
 can't
 just
 dictate
 yourself
 or


do
 this
 self-sabotage
 on
 yourself
 where


you
 feel
 like
 you
 are
 expected
 to
 live


your
 life
 a
 certain
 way.
 And
 if
 you
 do


it
 otherwise
 then
 somehow
 you
 are
 not


satisfying
 the
 expectations.


So
 college
 was
 a
 time
 when
 I
 was
 slowly


testing
 it.


>> I
 mean
 what
 you're
 saying


is
 is
 really
 important.
 I
 think
 it


wasn't
 so
 much
 a
 discovery
 of
 a
 part
 of


yourself.
 It
 was
 rediscovery.


>> Yes.
 Yes.


Now
 this
 is
 a
 cheesy
 question
 but
 bear


with
 me.
 I
 I
 wonder
 and
 you
 can
 feel


free
 to
 say
 no,
 but
 when
 you
 were
 up


there,
 did
 you
 picture
 younger
 you,
 the


one
 who
 had
 that
 adventurous
 spark?


Yes,
 I
 could
 see
 the
 younger
 Malala.


I
 am
 not
 a
 person
 who
 thinks
 too
 much


about
 the
 past
 because
 my
 life
 has


changed
 so
 much
 that
 if
 I
 put
 myself
 in


that
 place
 where
 I'm
 thinking
 what
 it


could
 have
 been
 like
 is
 like
 you
 can
 you


can
 never
 be


satisfied
 with
 imagining
 your
 life


differently.


So
 in
 college
 rather
 than
 thinking
 too


much
 about
 what
 it
 would
 have
 been
 like


if
 I
 were
 here
 as
 you
 know
 just
 that


normal
 student
 and
 with
 no
 recognition


and
 people
 had
 knew
 nothing
 about
 me
 and


they
 were
 maybe
 not
 like
 watching
 me
 and


it
 felt
 like
 that
 and
 I'm
 not
 saying


that
 you
 know
 people
 are
 actually


watching
 you
 and
 people
 are
 actually


commenting
 about
 you
 sometimes
 they
 do


that's
 sometimes
 how
 the
 social
 media


world
 appears.


>> You
 have
 a
 level
 of
 scrutiny
 on
 you.


>> It's
 also
 how
 you
 feel.
 It's
 how
 how


because
 it
 affects
 you
 so
 much.
 I
 you


know
 I
 usually
 say
 it
 doesn't
 affect
 me


or
 it
 shouldn't.
 I
 agree
 with
 that.
 I


don't
 let
 it
 affect
 my
 work
 but
 in
 the


end
 the
 truth
 is
 yes
 it
 does
 even
 if
 you


are
 trying
 to
 fight
 it
 back
 or
 try
 to


not
 let
 it
 distract
 you
 but
 it
 is


somehow
 influencing
 you.


>> You
 mean
 this
 sort
 of
 people
 watching


you
 this
 this
 feeling?
 Yes.


>> Yes.
 So
 in
 college
 I
 felt
 like
 the
 the


eyes
 were
 were
 not
 on
 me.


>> Wow.
 and
 I
 was
 in
 my
 own
 secret
 world


and
 I
 thought
 I
 I
 don't
 know
 how
 I'm


supposed
 to
 be
 but
 I'm
 going
 to


experience
 these
 these
 uh
 these
 things


these
 emotions
 uh
 and
 that
 will
 tell
 me


something
 about
 myself.


>> I'm
 going
 to
 jump.


>> I'm
 going
 to
 jump.
 I'm
 going
 to
 climb.


I'm
 going
 to
 swim.
 No,
 I
 can't
 swim.


>> No
 swimming.


I
 appreciate
 that
 your
 book
 doesn't


paint
 too
 rosy
 a
 picture
 of
 of
 college,


right?
 You
 were
 having
 these
 this


freedom
 and
 you
 were
 going
 to
 parties


and
 you
 had
 these
 friends
 and
 you
 were


pulling
 all
 nighters,
 but
 you
 also
 dealt


with


>> some
 quite
 difficult
 stuff.


>> Can
 you
 describe,
 you
 do
 this
 so
 vividly


in
 the
 book.
 Can
 you
 describe
 the
 first


time
 you
 had
 what
 you
 later
 found
 out


was
 a
 panic
 attack?


>> Yes.


So
 I


this
 panic
 attack
 was
 a
 life-changing


moment
 because


I
 was
 attacked
 at
 age
 15.
 I
 healed
 from


a
 bullet
 and
 I
 thought


the
 recovery
 is
 done.
 But
 many
 years


later
 when
 I
 had
 the
 first
 uh
 panic


attack
 or
 the
 trauma
 or
 the
 flashbacks


of
 what
 had
 happened,
 it
 made
 me
 feel


like
 everything
 was
 coming
 back
 as
 if
 it


had
 never
 gone.


I
 felt
 like
 I
 was
 reliving
 those


moments.
 So
 it
 happened
 um
 you
 know
 at


this
 one
 night
 where
 initially
 it
 felt


like
 a
 normal
 night
 because
 I
 was


working
 on
 my
 essay
 and
 I
 had
 uh
 you


know
 an
 essay
 crisis.
 I
 was
 struggling.


So
 this
 friend
 called
 me
 to
 the
 college


gardens
 and


>> she
 said,
 "Yeah,
 let's
 hang
 out.
 Some


friends
 are
 here."


>> I
 was
 like, "Maybe
 she
 might
 just
 give


me
 her
 notes."
 So
 let's
 go
 and
 see
 her.


I
 go
 there.
 We
 are
 chatting.
 And
 I
 see


this
 thing
 for
 the
 first
 time
 and
 it's


called
 bong.


>> It's
 bong,
 right?


>> It's
 a
 bong
 and
 it's,
 you
 know,


basically
 weed
 and
 uh
 but
 you
 know,
 it's


a
 different
 way
 of
 uh
 inhaling
 it.


>> Totally.


>> It
 is
 tricky.
 I
 will
 also
 say


>> it's
 tricky
 and
 I
 had
 no
 idea
 how
 to


take
 it
 and
 what
 it
 was
 and
 how
 quickly


it
 affects
 you
 but
 my
 friends
 seemed


fine
 and
 on
 the
 first
 attempt
 I
 coughed


and
 then
 on
 the
 second
 attempt
 I
 felt


I
 inhaled
 it
 and
 it
 went
 all
 in.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 I
 don't
 know
 where
 time
 went


but
 that
 was
 the
 turning
 point.
 It
 felt


like
 a
 sharp
 turn
 where


immediately
 like
 my
 body
 froze.
 I
 could


not
 understand
 time
 or
 the
 surrounding


anymore.
 And
 I
 thought
 I
 was
 reliving


the
 attack
 that
 I
 could
 see
 the
 gunman


that
 I
 was
 experiencing
 that
 near-death


experience
 where
 I
 felt
 like
 you
 know


maybe
 I
 am
 dead
 maybe
 this
 is
 afterlife.


Am
 I
 alive
 or
 not?
 I
 just
 lost
 sense
 of


reality.
 I
 had
 many
 panic
 attacks
 after


that.
 My
 body
 would
 be
 sweating.
 I
 would


be
 shaking.
 My
 heart
 would
 be
 throbbing.


I
 could
 not
 sleep.
 Um,
 as
 soon
 as
 I


would
 try
 to
 close
 my
 eyes,
 I
 felt
 like


it
 was
 a
 nightmare
 again
 and
 I
 would


die.
 It
 was
 so
 scary.


I
 thought
 nobody
 would
 understand
 it.
 I


could
 not
 even
 talk
 to
 anybody
 about


this
 because
 how
 do
 you
 explain
 to


somebody
 that


I'm
 experiencing
 all
 of
 this?
 And
 yeah,


like
 an
 attack
 happened
 many
 years
 ago


and
 I
 was
 completely
 normal
 yesterday.


Like
 I
 never
 thought
 this
 would
 happen.


And
 it
 was
 so
 unexpected.


>> Yeah.


>> I'm
 so
 glad
 my
 friends
 were
 there
 for


me.
 They
 helped
 me
 in
 this
 time.
 They


could
 not
 explain
 it
 to
 me.
 They
 they


were
 not
 like
 my
 therapists,


>> but


>> they
 they
 did
 small
 things
 like
 sharing


meals
 with
 me
 or
 doing
 a
 sleepover.
 Like


their
 sleepover
 was
 everything.
 That
 was


the
 first
 time
 I
 could
 actually
 fall


asleep
 for
 the
 first
 time.


>> They
 have
 no
 idea,
 but
 they
 I'll
 always


remember
 that.
 And
 then
 in
 the
 end
 it


was
 uh
 another
 friend
 of
 mine
 who
 told


me
 that
 I
 should
 see
 a
 therapist.


>> I
 was


so
 skeptical.


>> Had
 you
 seen
 a
 therapist
 up
 to
 that


point?


>> No.
 The
 first
 time
 I
 had
 seen
 a


therapist
 briefly
 was
 at
 the
 hospital
 in


Birmingham
 when
 I
 was
 recovering
 from


the
 bullet
 injury.


>> Immediately
 after.


>> Yes.
 At
 the
 time
 I
 had
 to
 go
 through
 so


many
 other
 surgeries
 for
 the
 physical


body
 recovery
 that
 I
 thought
 what
 is


this
 person
 asking
 me?
 How
 do
 I
 feel?


Like
 come
 on.
 Like
 look
 at
 look
 at
 me.


I'm
 recovering.
 Um
 what
 has
 feelings
 got


to
 do
 with
 any
 of
 that?
 I
 felt
 work
 keep


me
 I
 felt
 work
 kept
 me
 busy
 and


distracted.


>> Yeah.
 And
 I
 just
 had
 no
 idea
 that


something
 like
 this
 Bong
 experience


could
 trigger
 and
 bring
 back
 the
 trauma


and
 PTSD.
 All
 of
 these
 things
 I
 had


heard
 of,
 but
 I
 just
 never
 understood


what
 that
 actually
 means
 when
 you


experience
 it.
 Um,
 so
 when
 I
 had
 my


first
 therapy
 session,


it
 was
 um
 a
 crazy
 experience
 because
 I


was
 telling
 everything
 to
 the
 therapist


and
 I
 was
 hoping
 that
 she
 would
 give
 me


the
 medication
 or
 whatever
 cure
 they


have,


>> right?
 And
 soon
 I
 realized
 that
 that's


not
 how
 it
 works.
 You
 have
 to
 accept
 and


embrace
 it.


>> That
 now
 this
 is
 a
 part
 of
 you.
 You


cannot
 banish
 it
 magically.


>> Yeah.


>> With
 time
 it
 can
 get
 smaller
 and
 smaller


and
 it
 will
 affect
 you
 less
 and
 less.


But
 you
 have
 to
 be
 willing
 to
 accept
 and


live
 with
 it.
 I
 no
 longer
 see
 it
 as
 yeah


like
 four
 sessions
 or
 10
 sessions.
 I


think
 the
 problem
 will
 be
 fixed
 by
 then.


>> Exactly.
 I
 mean,
 I
 really
 appreciate
 you


sharing
 it
 that
 that


>> it
 is
 so
 it
 was
 terrifying
 even
 reading


about
 it.
 I
 mean,
 it
 really
 was.


>> You
 know,
 it
 strikes
 me
 just
 as
 you're


talking
 like
 we
 spoke
 about
 this
 roof
 um


experience
 experiences


>> as
 this
 moment
 of
 discovering
 that
 your


past
 was
 still
 with
 you.


>> Yeah.
 And
 I'm
 realizing
 that
 this
 panic


attack
 was
 also
 the
 sort
 of
 like
 the


shadow
 side
 of
 that
 right
 with
 the
 past


with
 the
 sort
 of


more
 full
 embrace
 of
 the
 past
 is
 not


just
 you
 know
 the
 adventures
 and
 the
 you


know
 that
 that
 spirit
 it's
 also
 it's


also
 the
 attack.


>> Yes.
 And
 I
 think
 that's
 the
 part
 maybe


that
 frustrated
 me
 the
 most


>> because
 when
 you
 are
 labeled
 as
 a
 brave


girl
 who
 has
 overcome
 an
 attack
 and
 is


not
 afraid
 of
 the
 Taliban
 and
 suddenly


this
 moment


where
 you're
 witnessing
 that
 moment
 of


fear
 again
 and
 you
 feel
 the
 gunmen
 are


right
 in
 front
 of
 you
 again
 or
 you
 feel


you
 have
 lost
 your
 life
 again.
 Um
 it's


it's
 scary
 but
 it's
 also
 embarrassing.


Like
 I
 was
 feeling
 embarrassed
 a
 bit


>> that
 somehow
 I
 had
 failed
 in
 meeting


that
 label
 of
 being
 brave
 and


courageous.


>> Um
 I
 was
 in
 South
 Africa
 for
 this


campaign
 that
 we're
 doing
 for
 Afghan


women.
 I
 was
 giving
 the
 Nelson
 Mandela


lecture
 and
 we
 were
 you
 know
 bringing


attention
 to
 what's
 happening
 in


Afghanistan
 under
 the
 Taliban
 since
 they


took
 power
 four
 years
 ago
 is
 a
 gender


apartheite
 like
 it
 is
 systemic


oppression.
 Anyway,
 that
 was,
 you
 know,


a
 visit
 there.
 I
 gave
 a
 speech
 and
 there


I
 also
 had
 a
 panic
 attack.


>> Oh
 my
 gosh.
 Like
 on
 stage
 or
 or
 off?


>> No,
 it
 was
 like
 after
 I
 had
 done
 all
 the


events,
 the
 press,
 the
 speeches,
 there


was
 like
 nothing
 triggering
 and
 just
 all


of
 a
 sudden
 when
 I
 went
 to
 bed
 in
 the


middle
 of
 the
 night,
 I
 I
 just
 felt
 like


I
 was


I I
 felt
 I
 could
 not
 breathe
 anymore.


>> And
 my
 husband
 was
 with
 me.
 He
 helped
 me


through
 the
 whole
 night,
 but
 I
 was


shaking.
 I
 was
 shivering.
 recently.


>> Uh
 yeah,
 just
 like
 a
 few
 years
 ago.
 Wow.


>> But
 just
 to
 say
 that
 you
 know
 even
 in


moments
 when
 I
 go
 on
 the
 stage
 and
 give


a
 speech
 to
 stand
 up
 for
 women


and
 I
 say
 that
 we
 are
 not
 afraid
 of
 the


extremists
 and
 then
 I
 go
 you
 know
 back


to
 my
 room
 and
 that
 night
 like
 I'm


shaking
 I'm
 shivering
 because
 I'm
 having


a
 panic
 attack
 and
 I
 don't
 understand


because
 yet
 like
 in
 inside
 me
 I
 know
 I


can
 continue
 this
 fight
 and
 I
 will
 keep


on
 doing
 it
 but
 physically
 ally
 and


mentally
 my
 body
 is
 responding
 in
 a
 way


that
 I
 have
 no
 control
 on.
 But
 that


doesn't
 stop
 me
 from
 doing
 what
 I
 want


to
 do.
 I
 will
 advocate
 for
 the
 rights
 of


Afghan
 women
 and
 girls.
 We
 will
 stand
 up


to
 all
 extremists
 including
 the
 Taliban.


We
 will
 have
 a
 better
 future
 for
 women


and
 girls
 when
 they
 can
 just
 choose


their
 own
 future
 like
 whatever
 they


want.
 Just
 having
 more
 freedom
 and


liberation.


>> But
 it's
 not
 an
 easy
 journey
 and
 we
 have


to
 be
 honest
 about
 it.
 how
 it
 can


overwhelm
 us,
 how
 it
 can
 affect
 our
 own


mental
 health.
 And
 um
 so
 I'm
 I'm
 sharing


just
 a
 part
 of
 that
 in
 my
 book.


>> It's
 powerful
 and
 I
 and
 I
 appreciate
 you


sharing
 it
 with
 me
 here
 and
 I
 I
 think
 of


this
 word
 you
 used
 embarrassing.


>> Yeah.


>> Can
 you
 tell
 me
 more
 about
 that
 word


because
 it
 I
 think
 I
 understand
 but
 it's


a
 harsh
 word
 to
 to
 sort
 of
 turn
 on


yourself
 and
 I
 wonder
 about
 that.
 Why


did
 it
 feel
 embarrassing
 to
 have
 a
 panic


attack?


>> It
 felt
 embarrassing
 because
 I
 thought
 I


had
 failed
 in
 meeting
 up
 the
 expectation


of
 being
 brave
 and
 strong.


When
 people
 tell
 you
 that
 you
 stood
 up


to
 the
 Taliban,
 how
 did
 you
 do
 that?
 How


could
 you
 be
 so
 brave?
 I
 did
 not
 even


have
 an
 answer
 to
 that.
 I
 would
 just


simply
 say
 education
 is
 my
 right.
 Why


should
 anyone
 take
 it
 away
 from
 me?


And


now
 like
 many
 years
 later
 when
 I
 had


these
 panic
 attacks
 and
 I
 was
 just
 like


suddenly
 scared.
 It's
 not
 that
 the


Taliban
 were
 standing
 right
 in
 front
 of


me
 but
 I
 felt
 it.


>> Yeah.


>> It's
 something
 I
 wish
 like
 I
 can
 just


make
 disappear.
 But
 that
 is
 to
 say
 that


it
 is
 still
 brave
 when
 you
 are


embarrassed
 when
 you
 are
 scared
 when
 you


are
 afraid


but
 you
 still
 get
 up
 and
 do
 what
 you


believe
 in.
 I
 think
 that
 is
 true


bravery.


>> I
 want
 to
 get
 us
 into
 this
 zone
 of
 of


talking
 about
 romance
 and
 dating
 and


love
 because
 it's
 a
 it's
 a
 beautiful


part
 of
 your
 book
 as
 well.
 You
 mentioned


that
 you
 just
 weren't
 around
 guys
 so


much
 before
 you
 went
 to
 college
 and
 then


you
 were
 around
 them.
 Where
 was
 your


confidence
 in
 terms
 of
 dating
 boys,


romance?


>> I
 was
 more
 of
 a
 coach
 at
 the
 beginning.


>> Yeah.
 When
 it
 came
 to
 love
 life


conversations,
 I
 was
 giving
 advice
 to
 my


friends,
 you
 know,
 like
 if
 a
 guy
 is
 not


replying
 to
 your
 text
 for
 3
 days,
 it


>> not
 that
 that's
 happening
 to
 me,
 but


what
 do
 you
 think
 it
 means?


>> He
 doesn't
 want
 to
 talk
 like,
 you
 know,


and
 I
 don't
 think
 he
 deserves
 you
 like


it's


>> hear
 that.


>> Yeah.
 you
 know,
 like
 anyway,


>> and
 and
 my
 friends
 were
 just
 so
 shocked


that
 I
 knew
 so
 much
 about
 guys
 and


dating.
 And
 I
 told
 them,
 I
 have
 never


dated
 a
 guy.
 I
 don't
 even
 know
 what
 that


is.
 But


>> I
 would
 sometimes
 just
 joke
 with
 them


that
 I'm
 more
 of
 a
 coach
 than
 a
 player.


>> And
 the
 coaches
 know
 more
 than
 the


players.


>> You're
 observing.


>> Observing.


>> You
 were
 you
 had
 taken
 yourself
 off
 the


field
 to
 continue
 that
 metaphor.


>> And
 and
 really
 that
 actually
 is
 the


language
 I'd
 use.
 taken
 yourself
 sort
 of


out
 of
 the
 game.
 Can
 you
 describe
 why?


Why
 was
 dating
 not
 so
 much
 on
 your


radar?


>> There
 were
 two
 reasons
 for
 that.
 One
 was


more
 my
 personal
 decision
 and
 the
 second


one
 was
 cultural.


>> Yeah.


>> When
 I
 was
 attacked
 by
 the
 Taliban,
 the


bullet
 uh
 caused
 injuries
 including
 my


hearing
 loss
 and
 also
 my
 facial


symmetry.
 So
 I
 had
 become
 very
 insecure.


I
 thought
 like
 my
 smile
 was
 never
 the


same
 and
 you
 know
 like
 the
 facial


symmetry
 wasn't
 there
 anymore.
 I


received
 so
 many
 surgeries
 to
 work
 on


repairing
 the
 facial
 nerve.
 Even
 my
 last


surgery
 was
 to
 to
 do
 that.
 And


I
 thought
 like,
 oh,
 you
 know,
 like
 to


grapple
 with
 it,
 the
 best
 way
 is
 to
 just


say
 never
 date
 a
 guy
 or


and
 if
 I'm
 honest,
 I
 just
 thought
 like


nobody
 would
 like
 me
 and
 all
 of
 that.


But
 it
 was
 that's
 just
 a
 whole
 different


thinking.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 then
 on
 the
 other
 hand,
 it
 was
 also


the
 cultural
 pressure
 because
 in
 our


culture
 in
 Pakistan,


>> like
 girls
 are
 not
 allowed
 to
 date.


>> Sure.
 Um
 it's
 different
 in
 the
 cities


but
 in
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 villages
 in
 most
 of


Pakistan
 girls
 are
 even
 punished
 for
 it


>> if
 they're
 found
 dating
 or
 texting
 a


guy.
 And
 you
 know
 there's
 like
 crazy


things
 like
 honor
 killings
 and
 uh
 so
 I


thought
 okay
 like
 that's
 supposed
 to
 be


a
 bad
 thing
 and
 why
 put
 my
 family
 in


trouble?
 Why
 make
 my
 mom
 and
 dad
 angry?


um
 even
 though
 I
 knew
 we
 were
 now
 in
 a


different
 country
 and
 slightly
 different


culture
 but
 that
 is
 sort
 of
 still
 there


in
 the
 back
 of
 your
 mind.


>> So
 in
 college
 I
 thought
 yeah
 like
 these


two
 things
 I
 should
 just
 stay
 away
 from


boys.


>> I
 mean
 you're
 mentioning
 the
 the


insecurity
 and
 you
 share
 a
 bit
 about
 a


bit
 about
 that


>> in
 the
 book
 and
 there
 is
 one
 quote
 that


really


struck
 me.
 You
 were
 talking
 about
 sort


of
 grappling
 with
 self-image
 and
 you


said,
 "My
 face
 and
 body
 were
 now
 meant


for
 service,
 not
 romance.
 You
 don't
 need


to
 be
 attractive
 to
 be
 an
 activist."
 I


told
 myself


>> I
 was
 struck
 by
 that.
 I
 mean,
 unpack


that
 quote
 for
 me.
 What
 did
 that
 mean?


You
 didn't
 have
 to
 be
 attractive
 to
 be


an
 activist.
 So,
 it
 wasn't
 on
 your
 mind.


I
 thought
 um
 that
 activism
 was
 now
 the


mission
 of
 my
 life


>> and
 I
 did
 not
 have
 to
 think
 about


looking
 pretty
 for
 that.


>> On
 the
 other
 hand,
 I
 thought
 that
 to


have
 love
 in
 your
 life,
 you
 needed
 to
 be


looking
 all
 perfect
 and
 needed
 the


facial
 symmetry.
 And


so,
 yeah,
 I
 thought,
 okay,
 like
 I
 can't


have
 all
 of
 that,
 but
 at least
 I
 can
 do


my
 activism.
 M


>> did
 you
 think
 you'd
 ever
 be
 in
 a


relationship?
 Like
 was
 that
 something


that


>> No.


>> No.
 Really?


>> I
 never
 thought
 that.
 No.


>> And
 how
 and
 how
 did
 that
 make
 you
 feel


when
 you
 were
 to
 to
 contemplate
 a
 life


and
 and
 truly
 I
 say
 with
 without
 any


kind
 of
 veilance,
 positive
 or
 negative?


Like
 how
 did
 that
 make
 you
 feel
 to


contemplate
 a
 life
 without
 a
 romantic


relationship?


>> My
 life
 changed
 completely
 when
 I
 was
 in


love
 with
 a
 person.
 I
 could
 not
 fix
 my


my
 thinking.
 You
 know,
 before
 that
 I
 was


a
 strong
 advocate
 against
 marriages.
 I


had
 told
 all
 of
 my
 college
 friends
 that


do
 not
 get
 married
 or
 like
 at
 least
 I'm


not
 getting
 married.
 These
 boys
 are
 just


a
 waste
 of
 time.


>> I
 was
 so
 against
 the
 institution
 of


marriage
 in
 itself.
 I
 was
 questioning
 it


because
 growing
 up
 I
 had
 seen
 how
 girls


were
 forced
 into
 marriage
 or
 they
 were


married
 off
 when
 they
 were
 still


children
 and
 that
 is
 still
 a
 reality
 for


many
 girls.
 So
 I
 thought
 why
 would
 even


I
 consider
 it.
 I'm
 an
 advocate
 for


girls's
 rights.
 You
 know
 this
 is
 the


last
 thing
 I'll
 think
 about.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 here
 I
 was
 in
 love
 with
 a
 guy
 and
 I


knew
 that
 culturally
 for
 me
 to
 be
 with


this
 guy
 I
 need
 to
 be
 married
 to
 him


because
 in
 our
 culture
 like
 I
 cannot


just
 live
 with
 a
 guy.
 My
 parents
 will


never
 allow
 that.
 Um
 it's
 hard
 to


explain
 the
 cultural
 part
 because
 you


know
 it
 becomes
 a
 controversy
 and


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 backlash
 if
 you
 do
 not


follow
 the
 traditions
 and
 the
 tradition


is
 that


>> you
 have
 to
 like
 marry
 and
 it's
 usually


your
 parents
 agreeing
 and
 and
 all
 of


that.
 You
 cannot
 technically
 be
 dating


or
 be
 in
 love.


>> I
 was
 you
 know
 happy
 that
 my
 parents


sort
 of
 were
 were
 okay
 with
 me
 like


seeing
 the
 guy
 but
 my
 mom
 put
 so
 many


restrictions.
 She
 told
 me
 and
 this
 is


before
 co
 that
 you
 have
 to
 be
 6
 feet


apart.
 So,
 she
 kind
 of
 started
 that


trend.
 It
 sounds
 like


>> she
 started
 that
 before
 we
 had
 those


germs.


>> Looking
 at
 a
 future.


>> Yeah.


>> Without
 a
 romantic
 relationship,
 did
 it


make
 you
 feel
 I
 don't
 know.


>> It
 It
 made
 life
 easier
 for
 me.


>> Huh.
 That's
 okay.


>> I
 thought
 life
 would
 be
 so
 easy
 if
 there


were


no
 relationships,
 no
 love
 life
 to
 think


about,
 and
 no
 marriage
 and
 all
 of
 that


and
 kids
 and
 like


>> family
 stuff.
 I
 said,
 "Hey,
 stay
 away


from
 all
 of
 that.


>> Work,
 work,
 and
 work."
 Yeah.


>> And
 I
 will
 be
 honest
 that
 becoming
 an


activist
 at
 a
 young
 age
 and
 not
 knowing


so
 much
 about
 what
 the
 lives
 of


activists
 from
 history
 have
 been
 really


like.
 So
 in
 my
 head


>> like
 I
 thought
 like
 Martin
 Luther
 King


Jr.
 or
 Mother
 Teresa
 or
 Dalai
 Lama


Nelson
 Mandela
 all
 had
 these
 lives
 which


were
 all
 about
 work
 even
 though
 they
 had


like
 wives
 and
 like
 you
 know
 kids
 and


all
 of
 that.
 There's
 this
 like


perception
 that
 you
 have
 that
 life
 all


has
 to
 be
 about
 work.
 It
 can
 never
 be


about
 you
 about
 your
 love
 and
 these
 are


all
 sacrifices
 and
 compromises
 you
 have


to
 make.


>> But
 when
 I
 fell
 in
 love
 now
 let's
 bring


this
 man
 on
 stage.


Tell
 me
 about
 the
 guy
 you
 fell
 in
 love


with.


>> So
 I
 met
 Assur
 at
 university.
 He
 was


visiting
 a
 friend
 who
 was
 studying


there.
 And
 the
 moment
 I
 saw
 him,
 I
 knew


that
 he
 was
 my
 type.
 He
 was
 tall,


handsome,
 with
 trimmed
 beard


and
 just
 wide
 shoulders.
 And
 I
 thought,


"Oh
 my
 god."
 Like
 I
 had
 pictured
 this


guy
 in
 my
 imagination
 and
 somehow
 I
 see


him
 in
 reality.
 There
 is
 this
 3D
 print


of
 him.


>> You
 are
 making
 me
 jealous,
 girl.


>> Yeah.
 With
 a
 cute
 smile.
 And
 he
 was
 just


laughing
 the
 whole
 time.
 And
 he
 was


funny.
 and
 he
 was
 cracking
 jokes
 and


laughing
 at
 my
 jokes
 and
 I
 was
 like,


"Wow,
 he
 is
 the
 one."


>> Well,
 that's
 the
 dream,
 isn't
 it?


>> Yeah.
 But
 if
 you
 ask
 him,
 like
 the
 story


that
 he
 has
 starts
 at
 like
 a
 different


point
 and
 I'm
 like,
 "Ugh,
 let's
 not
 even


talk
 about
 it."


>> Talking
 about
 it.
 Let's
 just
 say
 you
 had


wide
 shoulders
 and
 you
 were
 tall.


>> I
 was
 like,
 "Can
 you
 just
 simply
 say,


yeah,
 like
 I
 fell
 in
 love
 with
 you
 the


moment
 I
 saw
 you."
 He's
 like, "No,
 I


have
 to
 be
 truthful."
 I
 was
 like, "No,


not
 not
 all
 the
 time."
 But
 then
 he


reminds
 me
 he
 says
 you
 have
 to
 remember


that


like
 you
 were
 Malala
 to
 me
 and
 sometimes


he
 says
 this
 joke
 that
 my
 right
 shoulder


was
 telling
 me
 that
 there's
 one
 person


in
 the
 world
 that
 you
 don't
 want
 to


offend
 or
 break
 the
 heart
 of
 it's


Malala.
 And
 then
 my
 left
 shoulder
 was


telling
 me
 that
 if
 you
 break
 Malala's


heart
 you
 are
 going
 to
 be
 her
 enemy


number
 one
 and
 you
 do
 not
 want
 that


life.
 So,


>> so
 basically
 both
 both
 angels
 and
 devils


were
 telling
 him
 like
 do
 not
 f
 this
 up.


Basically,


>> he
 was
 like
 I
 was
 just
 so
 scared.
 He


said
 he
 said
 like
 do
 you
 think
 like


somebody
 meets
 Malala
 and
 immediately


would
 say


>> yeah
 I
 want
 her
 to
 be
 my
 girlfriend
 or


like
 I
 want
 to
 marry
 her.
 He
 said
 like


no.
 He's
 like
 of
 course
 like
 you
 are
 so


fun
 and
 like
 I
 was
 so
 happy
 that
 you


know
 we
 were
 becoming
 friends


>> but


>> I
 could
 not
 imagine
 it
 and
 I
 was
 like


okay
 fine
 fine
 you
 can
 get
 away
 with
 it.


One
 story
 I
 remember
 which
 is
 really


funny.


When
 uh
 we
 were
 still
 like
 getting
 to


know
 each
 other,
 I
 took
 him
 to
 see
 this


movie.


>> Mhm.


>> Which
 was
 Toy
 Story
 4.


>> Okay.
 Yeah.


>> And
 I
 was
 like,
 you
 know,
 a
 bit
 flirty


and
 all
 of
 that.
 And
 I
 was
 like,
 why
 is


this
 guy
 like
 so
 nervous
 and
 like
 sort


of
 like
 tight
 and
 just
 like


>> why
 can't
 he
 just
 he
 why
 can't
 he
 just


relax?
 And
 I
 asked
 him
 and
 he's
 like,


you
 know,
 you
 have
 like
 security
 and


they're
 standing
 right
 behind
 me.


>> He's
 like,
 uh,
 maybe
 those
 two
 massive


guys


>> and
 you
 want
 me
 to
 be
 like
 relaxed
 and


all
 of
 that.
 So


later
 on
 I
 understood.
 I
 was
 like,
 oh


yeah,
 poor
 thing.
 I
 never
 thought
 about


it
 from
 his
 perspective.


>> So
 you're
 like,
 loosen
 up.
 He's
 like,


you
 know,
 just
 watching
 a
 movie.
 Enjoy.


Have
 fun.
 Be
 yourself.


>> I
 didn't
 even
 know
 they
 had
 Toy
 Story
 4.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 H
 how
 did
 he
 make
 you
 feel


like
 as
 you
 hung
 out
 with
 him
 more
 and


more
 as
 you
 talked
 as
 you
 got
 to
 know


him
 as
 a
 person
 not
 just
 a
 hottie
 like


how
 did
 Yeah.
 How
 did
 he
 make
 you
 feel?


>> Whenever
 I
 was
 with
 him
 I
 felt


that
 I
 was
 loved
 and
 he
 made
 me
 feel


like
 the
 present
 me
 it's


you
 know
 like
 when
 you
 meet
 people
 they


have
 this
 fixed
 image
 of
 you


>> and
 they
 feel
 like
 they
 know
 who
 you


are.


>> Well
 I
 will
 say
 you
 more
 so
 than
 someone


else
 of
 course.
 Absolutely.


>> But
 for
 him,
 it
 was
 it
 was
 just
 this


with
 him,
 I
 felt
 like
 I
 could
 grow
 as
 a


person.


>> Huh.


>> Yeah.
 I
 like
 what
 you're
 saying
 like
 as


opposed
 to


like
 a
 a
 fixed
 idea
 of
 who
 you
 were,


this
 vaunted,
 brave,
 you
 know,
 active.


It
 was
 like
 you
 felt


>> things
 felt
 um
 like
 they
 could
 change,


like
 they
 could
 mold,
 like
 they
 could


grow,
 like
 they
 were
 flexible
 almost.


Yes.
 And
 when
 I
 think
 about
 a
 life


partner,
 this
 is
 the
 person
 you
 want


with
 whom
 you
 can
 grow,


>> right?


>> You
 will
 never
 be
 the
 same
 person
 as
 you


are
 in
 this
 moment.
 He
 will
 also
 not
 be


the
 same
 person
 as
 he
 is
 in
 that
 moment.


>> And
 when
 you
 start
 your
 life
 together,


you
 can
 grow
 together.
 I
 immediately


felt
 that
 with
 Assur
 that
 he
 is
 so


adventurous.
 He
 likes
 trying
 new
 things.


He's
 funny.
 Life
 just
 looks
 more
 fun


with
 him.
 And
 I
 was
 imagining
 a
 life


with
 him
 and
 I
 thought,
 "Wow,
 like
 it


just
 looks
 so
 good."
 So
 I
 was
 very
 happy


like
 that
 I
 was,
 you
 know,


technically
 dating
 him
 and
 that
 I
 was


seeing
 him.


>> But
 at
 the
 same
 time,
 I
 was
 reminding


myself
 that
 no,
 I'm
 supposed
 to
 be
 an


activist
 and
 I
 can't
 get
 married
 and


this
 is
 all
 a
 distraction
 and


>> right


>> then
 um


>> and
 you
 were
 so
 staunchly
 opposed,
 you


know,
 you're
 right.
 You
 were
 so
 opposed


to
 marriage
 as
 an
 institution.


>> Yes.
 because
 of
 what
 it
 represented,
 you


know,
 the
 patriarchy.
 You
 didn't
 want
 to


be
 controlled.


>> Yeah.
 How
 did
 you
 reckon
 with
 those


things?
 What
 a
 bummer
 to
 really
 like


this
 guy
 and
 be
 like,
 "This
 could
 be


serious,
 but
 also
 I've
 I'm
 staunchly


opposed
 to
 marriage."


>> Like,
 I
 would
 be
 honest
 that
 I
 liked


Assur
 and
 everything
 was
 going
 well.
 I


was
 also
 scared
 if
 Assur
 would
 be
 the


same
 person
 as
 he
 is
 now.
 And


I
 had
 heard
 so
 many
 stories
 of
 girls
 who


>> find
 out
 that
 the
 husband
 is
 not
 the
 guy


who
 they
 thought
 would
 be
 after
 they
 get


married.


>> After
 they
 get
 married
 and
 things
 change


or
 then
 they
 have
 these
 expectations


from
 each
 other
 like
 the
 husband
 is


expecting
 the
 wife
 to
 do
 certain
 things


or
 like
 do
 chores
 or


change
 her
 career
 path
 and
 all
 of
 that.


And
 I
 knew
 like
 this
 was
 never
 going
 to


happen.
 And
 I
 knew
 that
 I
 knew
 about
 my


rights
 and
 like
 I
 am
 an
 activist
 for


girls
 everywhere.
 I
 can
 fight
 for


myself.
 But
 it
 was
 it
 just
 felt
 like
 I


you
 know
 I
 could
 not
 I
 just
 did
 not
 want


it
 to
 be
 a
 situation
 where
 now
 suddenly


I
 was
 like
 getting
 married
 and
 this
 guy


was
 like
 you
 know
 I
 was
 like
 I
 I
 have
 to


fix
 another
 guy
 and
 I
 have
 to
 fix


another
 problem
 while
 I'm
 advocating
 for


so
 many
 other
 things.


>> I
 did
 not
 want
 it
 to
 be
 like
 another


journey
 of
 activism
 for
 me.
 I
 was
 like


if
 marriage
 makes
 life
 easier
 and


happier
 then
 I
 should
 consider
 it.


>> Yeah.


>> In
 the
 end
 we
 spent
 some
 time
 together


in
 Lake
 Placid
 in
 the
 US
 and
 this
 was


the
 first
 time
 when
 it
 was
 just
 the
 two


of
 us
 and
 we
 had
 the
 best
 time
 together


and
 I
 had
 prepared
 a
 whole
 list
 of


questions
 because
 I
 thought
 I'll
 ask
 him


everything
 and
 figure
 out
 who
 he
 truly


is.
 And
 you
 know
 like
 I
 was
 like
 I
 just


want
 to
 know
 everything
 about
 this
 guy.


What
 is
 inside
 his
 mind?
 like
 what
 he's


showing
 what
 what
 I
 see
 right
 now
 is
 all


good.
 It's
 like
 10
 out
 of
 10.
 But


>> is
 there
 something
 mysterious
 in
 his


mind
 that
 I
 need
 to
 know?


>> You
 know,
 it's
 like


>> I
 know
 seriously
 I
 should
 change
 my
 job.


>> Come
 and
 work
 for


>> and
 I
 realized
 that
 the
 person
 is
 who


I
 realized
 that


he
 was
 this
 person
 the
 whole
 time
 that
 I


that
 that
 I
 saw
 him.
 It's
 like
 you
 you


keep
 looking,
 you
 keep
 peeling
 it
 off


and
 it's
 like
 a
 layer
 after
 a
 layer,
 but


it's
 still
 the
 same
 thing.


>> Yeah.
 Was
 there
 a
 moment
 where
 you


realize
 that
 like
 Yeah.
 that
 he
 was
 who


he
 said
 he
 was?
 Was
 there
 I
 don't
 know.


You
 look
 at
 him
 at
 breakfast
 and
 like


the
 lights
 hitting
 him
 and
 you're
 like


that's
 it,
 you
 know,
 that's
 him.
 Like


was
 there
 a
 moment?


>> I
 still
 feel
 that


>> when
 he
 is
 kind
 to
 somebody,
 when
 he


cares
 about
 his
 family
 members
 and


friends,
 he
 shows
 up.
 He
 checks
 on


people.
 He
 looks
 after
 me.
 He's
 just
 so


nice
 to
 me.
 I
 can't
 tell
 you.
 He
 can


listen
 to
 me
 rambling
 at
 midnight
 when


he's
 so
 tired
 and
 exhausted.


>> The
 yap
 does
 turn
 on
 at
 midnight.
 Huh.


>> And
 yeah,
 that's
 a
 thing.
 And
 he,


you
 know,
 can
 he
 cares
 about
 like
 what
 I


eat
 and
 if
 I'm
 busy
 with
 my
 work,
 he


makes
 sure
 that
 I
 have
 some
 fun
 time.
 So


he
 would
 arrange
 uh
 sports
 in
 the
 middle


of
 it
 to
 say
 you
 need
 to
 relax,
 you
 need


to
 take
 some
 time
 off.
 So
 like
 my
 life


is
 sort
 of
 still
 the
 same,
 but
 I
 feel


happier
 uh
 that
 he's
 with
 me
 now.


>> In
 this
 moment
 in
 Lake
 Placid,
 which
 is


fun
 that
 it
 was
 there.
 It's
 such
 a
 it's


cool
 that
 Yeah.
 Um


you
 realize


that
 you're
 ready
 to
 marry.
 What
 was
 it


about
 that
 trip
 that
 changed
 your
 mind?


Was
 it
 your
 mind
 changed
 about
 him
 or


your
 mind
 changed
 about
 the
 institution


of
 marriage
 or
 both
 or
 neither?
 Like


what
 shifted?


>> Oh,
 definitely
 not
 about
 the
 institution


of
 marriage
 at
 all.
 That
 is
 easy
 to


answer.
 We
 have
 to
 question
 marriage.
 We


have
 to
 make
 this
 an
 open
 conversation


because
 it
 is
 still
 affecting
 the
 lives


of
 tens
 of
 millions
 of
 girls
 every
 year.


And
 even
 in
 places
 where


women
 have
 more
 equal
 rights
 and
 even
 in


developed
 countries,
 marriage
 still


means
 more
 compromises
 for
 women.


>> So
 I
 think
 that's
 a
 whole
 separate


conversation
 and
 I
 don't
 have
 all
 the


answers
 but
 I
 think
 it's
 important
 for


us
 to
 to
 doubt
 it
 to
 question
 it.


In
 Lake
 Placid,
 I
 was
 sure
 about
 getting


married
 to
 Assur
 uh
 was
 because


I
 knew
 he
 was
 the
 right
 guy.


He


seemed
 to
 be
 this
 kind,


sweet,
 and


the
 best
 guy
 had
 ever
 seen.
 He
 like
 I


had
 the
 best
 time
 with
 him
 and
 I
 loved


him
 for
 sure.
 But
 I
 started
 loving


myself
 as
 well.
 And
 that's
 the


difference
 he
 made
 in
 my
 life
 that
 I


felt
 that


I
 should
 love
 myself
 and
 I
 should
 be


okay
 accepting
 that
 he
 loves
 me
 too.
 And


I
 realized
 I
 don't
 have
 to
 ask
 him
 every


question
 about
 so
 what
 do
 you
 think


about
 you
 know
 four
 marriages
 in
 Islam


or
 what
 do
 you
 think
 about
 a
 woman


earning
 more
 than
 the
 man?
 And
 he
 was


like
 yeah
 if
 he
 if
 she
 earns
 more
 that's


fine.
 Like
 he's
 like
 I'll
 be
 a
 heavier


man.


He's
 like,
 "Oh,
 you
 just
 get
 it
 right


every
 time."


>> It
 is
 so
 interesting.
 It's
 like
 this


list
 of
 you
 tried
 to
 sort
 of
 itemize
 all


of
 the
 things
 that
 could
 go
 wrong,


right?


>> And
 it's
 very
 beautiful
 to
 me
 that
 at


the
 end
 of
 this
 trip,


you
 you
 realized
 you
 just
 you
 didn't


have
 to
 do
 that.


>> Yes.
 He
 was
 quite
 surprised.
 He
 was


like,
 "So,
 where
 are
 the
 questions?


Like,
 when
 are
 you
 going to
 ask
 ripped


paper?"
 Yeah.


>> I
 was
 like,
 "You
 know,
 I
 know."
 because


you
 knew
 the
 answer
 was


>> yes


>> was
 what
 it's
 not
 even
 it's
 not
 even


about
 the
 answers
 to
 those
 questions
 the


answer
 is
 he
 loves
 you
 right


>> and
 I
 love
 myself


>> yes


>> you
 know
 we
 talked
 about
 how
 your


feelings
 about
 marriage
 as
 an


institution


>> yeah
 h


>> haven't
 changed
 you're
 still
 committed


to
 to
 doing
 to
 advocating
 for
 women's


independence
 and
 and
 right
 to
 choose


decide
 whether
 they
 want
 to
 get
 married


and
 I
 guess
 I
 I
 wondered
 now
 you
 are
 a


wife,
 right?
 Like
 has
 that
 ch
 what
 does


that
 mean
 to
 you?
 Like
 how
 are
 you
 able


to
 Yeah.
 What
 does
 that
 mean
 to
 you?


>> You
 know
 those
 words
 still
 sound
 quite


heavy.


>> Wife
 and
 husband.


>> Do
 you
 use
 different
 words?


>> Yeah.
 Bestie.


>> You
 use
 bestie.


>> Oh,
 I
 love
 that.
 Yeah.


>> It's
 We
 don't
 call
 each
 other
 husband


and
 wife.
 It's
 when
 people
 ask
 us
 or


when
 people
 bring
 it
 up,
 that's
 when


we're
 like,
 "Oh,
 so
 we
 are
 husband
 and


wife."
 Okay.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Does
 it
 feel
 so
 that
 doesn't


that
 word
 doesn't
 feel
 like
 it
 fits
 so


much?


>> I
 have
 a
 very
 stereotypical


idea
 of
 what
 a
 wife
 means
 and
 I
 hated


the
 word.
 Yeah.


>> Genuinely
 hated
 the
 word


>> growing
 up.
 I
 thought
 like
 gh
 you
 want


to
 be
 a
 wife
 come
 on.
 And
 husband
 I
 was


like
 you
 know
 just
 because
 you
 grow
 grow


up
 with
 it.
 You
 cannot
 suddenly
 take
 it


away
 from
 yourself.
 And


you
 know,
 I
 I
 just
 thought
 that
 was
 not


a
 cool
 thing
 to
 be
 a
 wife.


>> Yeah.
 Do
 you
 feel
 married?
 I
 guess


that's
 really
 the
 question
 I
 want
 to


ask.
 Like,
 do
 you
 feel
 married?
 Yeah.


>> It's
 about
 redefining
 what
 marriage
 is.


M


>> I
 know
 that
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 uh
 will
 be


already
 embracing
 it
 in
 this
 new
 way


where
 it
 means
 equal
 partnership
 between


two
 people
 where
 they
 respect
 each
 other


and
 they
 love
 each
 other
 and
 they
 make


lives
 easier
 for
 each
 other.
 They
 make


lives
 more
 fun
 for
 each
 other.
 M


>> but
 where
 I
 come
 from
 and
 what
 I
 have


experienced


seeing
 things
 like
 child
 marriages
 and


just
 how
 women's


futures
 change
 completely
 with
 marriage.


I
 cannot
 fully
 take
 it
 away
 from
 me
 that


I
 still
 have
 that
 traditional
 idea
 of
 it


and
 that
 just
 causes
 that
 trigger
 for
 me


and
 I
 sometimes
 think
 that
 am
 I
 giving


up
 to
 the
 old
 systems
 but
 I
 know
 it
 it


is
 it
 is
 different
 it
 is
 different
 when


you
 are
 in
 a
 new
 country
 it's
 different


when
 you
 are


>> redefining
 it
 it's
 different
 when
 the


partner
 actually
 has
 you
 know
 good


values
 and
 has
 you
 know
 a
 common


understanding
 of
 respects,
 you
 know,


>> and
 respects
 you
 and
 and
 he's
 like,


"Yeah,
 marriage,
 whatever.
 I
 just
 want


to
 be
 with
 you."
 Like,
 that's
 the
 most


important
 thing
 for
 him.
 So,
 that


changes
 everything.
 I'm
 like,
 "Yeah,


sure.
 Let's
 call
 it
 marriage.
 Let's
 call


it
 whatever
 we
 want
 to
 call
 it.
 Uh,
 it's


about
 us
 sharing
 this
 journey
 of
 life


ahead
 together."


>> I
 want
 to
 turn
 back
 to
 your
 book.
 You


know,
 I'm
 struck
 that
 the
 title
 Finding


My
 Way
 is
 it's
 an
 active
 title.
 It's
 not


I
 found
 my
 way.
 No,


>> it's
 finding,
 right?
 You're
 in
 the


process
 of
 and
 I
 guess
 I
 Yeah,
 I
 wonder


like
 what
 do
 you
 feel
 like
 you're
 still


figuring
 out
 about
 yourself?


Actually,


um
 wanted
 a
 title
 like
 finding
 my
 way


because
 I
 do
 not
 feel
 comfortable
 with


books
 that
 feel
 like
 they
 have
 cracked


the
 code
 and
 figured
 it
 all
 out.
 That
 if


you
 read
 this
 book,
 you
 have
 no
 worries


in
 life
 anymore.
 That's
 just
 not
 the


reality.


>> Finding
 my
 way
 is


a
 true
 reflection
 of
 what
 the
 journey
 is


actually
 like
 where
 things
 are
 happening


for
 the
 first
 time.
 You
 may
 not
 have


even
 planned
 them
 to
 be
 a
 part
 of
 your


life.


You
 are
 having
 these
 experiences
 in


college
 like
 Bong


>> like
 bong.


>> Or
 you
 are
 climbing
 rooftops
 like
 that


was
 never
 part
 of
 my
 plan.
 Getting


ghosted
 by
 my
 crush
 that
 was
 never
 part


of
 my
 plan.
 nearly
 failing
 my
 exams.


That
 wasn't
 part
 of
 my
 plan,
 right?


>> These
 things
 happen.
 You
 meet
 the
 love


of
 your
 life
 at
 a
 time
 when
 you
 were


like,
 "Wait
 a
 second.
 I'm
 sort
 of
 still


in
 university.
 I
 wish
 this
 like
 I
 wish
 I


was
 not
 thinking
 about
 marriage
 and
 all


of
 these
 things
 right
 now."
 Um
 or
 like


you
 know
 you
 are
 recovering
 from
 the


last
 uh
 you
 are
 recovering
 from
 the


bullet
 of
 the
 Taliban
 and
 having
 your


last
 surgery
 and
 the
 Taliban
 take


control
 of
 Afghanistan
 and
 you
 have
 to


think
 about
 evacuating
 the
 people
 who


you
 are
 supporting
 and
 at
 the
 same
 time


thinking
 about
 the
 future
 of
 women
 and


girls
 and
 what
 does
 that
 mean
 for
 you


like
 all
 of
 these
 things
 is
 about


finding
 your
 way.
 You
 do
 not
 have
 the


answer
 immediately,
 but
 it
 is
 embracing


those
 moments
 and
 accepting
 the
 emotions


and
 the
 feelings
 you're
 going
 through.


You
 cannot
 make
 them
 disappear.
 Asking


for
 help
 when
 you
 need
 to.
 Talking
 to


your
 friends
 and
 family,
 your


colleagues,
 and
 knowing
 that
 together


you
 will
 be
 able
 to
 make
 a
 way
 through


it.
 You
 will
 find
 your
 way
 through
 it.


>> You're
 28
 right
 now.


>> Yes.


>> Yeah.
 What
 would
 what
 would
 you
 say
 to


to


15-year-old
 Malala.


>> Oh,


I
 might
 give
 her
 my
 book.


Girl,
 read
 this
 book.
 There
 is
 so
 much


ahead
 of
 you.


>> There's
 so
 much
 ahead
 of
 you.
 Do
 not
 get


distracted
 by


what
 people
 around
 you
 are
 telling
 you,


who
 you
 are
 supposed
 to
 be,
 what
 media


outlet
 wants
 to
 speak
 to
 you,
 and
 how


you
 need
 to


go
 and
 give
 a
 speech
 at
 this
 conference


and
 that
 event.
 Follow
 your
 heart.


Make
 friends.
 Be
 cheeky
 sometimes.


It's
 okay
 if
 you
 don't
 know
 all
 the


answers.
 It's
 okay
 if
 you
 get
 scared.


That's
 all
 fine.
 You
 will
 find
 your
 way


through
 it.


>> Malala,


thank
 you
 so
 much.
 What
 a
 pleasure
 to


have
 this
 conversation.


>> Thank
 you.
 So
 nice
 speaking
 to
 you
 as


well.
