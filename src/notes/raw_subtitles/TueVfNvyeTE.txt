From
 the
 New
 York
 Times,
 I'm
 Natalie


Kitroof.

Tariffs
 are
 at
 their
 highest
 rate
 in


nearly
 a
 century.
 The
 labor
 market
 is


weakening.
 Over
 and
 over
 again,
 Trump


has
 meddled
 with
 corporate
 America
 and


the
 country's
 most
 important
 economic


institutions.


And
 yet,
 the
 S&P
 at
 an
 all-time
 high.


Same
 for
 the
 NASDAQ,
 by
 the
 way.


>> The
 stock
 market
 has
 kept
 on
 going
 up


and
 up
 and
 up.
 Markets
 continue
 to
 hit


all-time
 highs.
 All
 of
 this
 despite


lingering
 uncertainty
 caused
 by


President
 Trump's
 tariff
 agenda.
 Today,


my
 colleague
 Joe
 Renison
 explains
 why,


at least
 until
 now,
 the
 market
 has


stayed
 so
 strong
 in
 such
 volatile
 times


and
 what
 we
 know
 about
 how
 long
 this
 can


really
 last.


It's
 Monday,
 October
 20th.


>> Wow.
 You
 brought
 a
 Bloomberg
 terminal


print
 out
 today.


>> In
 case
 you
 ask
 me
 what
 companies
 have


done
 well
 since
 tariffs,
 then
 I'll
 be


prepared.


>> It's
 beautiful.
 I
 just
 caught
 a
 glimpse


of
 it
 and
 that
 orange
 that
 bright
 orange


letter.


>> It's
 very
 distinctive,
 isn't
 it?


>> Yeah.
 You
 can't
 miss
 it.
 Yeah.
 Um,
 well,


Joe,
 welcome
 to
 the
 show.
 Thanks
 for


being
 in
 the
 studio.


>> Thanks
 ever
 so
 so
 much
 for
 having
 me.


So,
 we're
 coming
 to
 you
 because
 there


has
 been
 this
 question
 on
 my
 mind
 for
 a


while
 now,
 and
 I
 think
 it's
 been
 on
 a


lot
 of
 people's
 minds.
 And
 the
 question


is,
 what
 is
 up
 with
 the
 markets?
 Because


it
 seems
 as
 though
 every
 few
 weeks
 or


so,
 something
 happens.
 Whether
 it's
 a


new
 Trump
 policy,
 whether
 it's
 weak
 jobs


data,
 whether
 it's
 new
 tariffs,
 and
 at


least
 for
 the
 past
 few
 months
 or
 so,
 the


market
 has
 not
 really
 had
 a
 huge
 or


lasting
 reaction
 to
 those
 things.
 Now,
 a


week
 ago,
 we
 did
 see
 a
 decline
 when


Trump
 threatened
 new
 China
 tariffs,
 but


then
 the
 markets
 seem
 to
 recover.
 And
 at


this
 point,
 they've
 been
 in
 all-time


high
 territory
 for
 a
 while.
 And
 the


mystery
 for
 me
 has
 been,
 how
 can
 that


be?
 How
 can
 it
 be
 that
 all
 these


theoretically
 destabilizing
 events
 are


not
 seriously
 rattling
 investors?


>> Right?
 Well,
 you're
 not
 alone.
 There's


plenty
 of
 people
 asking
 that
 exact
 same


question
 right
 now.
 And
 it
 makes
 sense


from
 a
 sort
 of
 intuitive
 perspective


when
 you
 see
 so
 much
 what
 at least
 some


people
 would
 describe
 as
 chaos
 or
 at


least
 unorthodox
 things
 happening
 in
 the


world.
 Why
 hasn't
 there
 been
 a
 stronger


reaction
 in
 financial
 markets?
 Surely


there
 is
 an
 economic
 consequence
 to


these
 things.
 And
 so
 it
 is
 an
 important


question
 and
 it's
 an
 important
 question


as
 well
 because
 it's
 important
 to


understand
 what
 the
 signal
 is
 from
 the


stock
 market.
 you
 know,
 markets
 are


still
 doing
 very
 well.
 Should
 we
 take


that
 as
 a
 sign
 that
 things
 are
 okay?


Maybe
 we're
 being
 hyperbolic
 and
 we're


being
 worried
 about
 nothing.
 And
 so,
 if


that
 is
 the
 signal
 markets
 are
 sending,


we
 should
 listen
 to
 that.
 Equally,
 if


there's
 another
 explanation,
 we
 should


understand
 that
 explanation
 as
 well.


>> So,
 you're
 saying
 the
 signals
 the
 market


sends
 matter.


>> Yeah.


>> What
 do
 you
 mean
 by
 that?
 You
 know,


believe
 it
 or
 not,
 a
 majority
 of


Americans
 are
 actually
 invested
 in
 the


stock
 market
 either
 through
 retirement


plans
 or
 pension
 plans
 or
 the
 rise
 of


retail
 investors
 day
 trading
 that
 kind


of
 picked
 up
 during
 the
 pandemic.
 And


then
 while
 the
 stock
 market
 might
 not
 be


the
 economy
 and
 maybe
 it
 doesn't
 feel


like
 it
 has
 this
 kind
 of
 direct
 effect


on
 most
 Americans
 lives,
 the
 companies


in
 the
 stock
 market
 are
 huge
 employers.


They
 employ
 thousands
 and
 thousands
 of


people.
 They
 are
 responsible
 for
 the


paychecks
 of
 many
 many
 Americans.
 And
 if


those
 companies
 start
 to
 do
 worse
 or


start
 to
 come
 under
 pressure,
 that
 tends


to
 affect
 how
 they
 spend
 money
 in
 the


economy,
 whether
 that's
 on
 labor
 or


infrastructure
 projects
 or
 whatever
 it


happens
 to
 be.
 So
 there
 is
 this
 kind
 of


relationship
 between
 markets
 in
 the


economy,
 even
 if
 they
 don't
 always
 send


exactly
 the
 same
 message.
 And
 they're


also
 forward-looking.
 So
 markets
 are


constantly
 trying
 to
 understand
 where
 we


go,
 not
 where
 we
 are
 now.
 And
 so
 they're


a
 really
 good
 barometer
 in
 a
 sense
 of


where
 the
 many
 many
 investors
 that
 are


putting
 money
 to
 work
 every
 single
 day


buying
 and
 selling
 stocks,
 bonds,


currencies,
 and
 other
 things,
 where
 do


they
 see
 things
 headed?
 And
 again,
 at


the
 moment,
 from
 a
 very
 cursory
 look
 at


the
 financial
 markets,
 one
 would
 think


that
 people
 think
 we're
 on
 a
 reasonably


safe
 path.


>> Okay.
 Well,
 let's
 get
 into
 the
 signals


that
 we
 are
 getting
 from
 investors
 right


now.
 It
 feels
 like
 maybe
 one
 of
 the
 most


helpful
 recent
 examples
 of
 that
 kind
 of


barometer
 that
 you're
 talking
 about
 was


during
 the
 initial
 market
 reaction
 to


Trump's
 tariffs
 back
 in
 the
 spring.
 The


market,
 the
 stock
 market
 and
 the
 bond


market
 reaction
 in
 particular
 were


initially
 negative.
 Many
 people
 saw
 that


as
 a
 strong
 signal
 to
 the


administration.
 The
 administration
 pulls


back.
 It's
 not
 surprising
 that
 the


market
 recovered
 once
 Trump
 retreated


from
 those
 initial
 really
 high
 tariffs.


But
 what
 was
 surprising
 to
 me
 was
 that


the
 markets
 kept
 going
 up
 and
 up.
 Even


though
 Trump
 did
 eventually
 raise
 tariff


rates,
 it
 was
 more
 gradual,
 but
 those


tariffs
 hit
 multiple
 sectors
 and


multiple
 countries.
 Can
 you
 just
 explain


that?
 Break
 that
 down
 for
 me.


>> Absolutely.
 So
 coming
 into
 this
 year,


we're
 in
 a
 pretty
 good
 place.
 There
 was


some
 enthusiasm
 around
 Trump
 being


elected,
 a
 sort
 of
 more
 pro
 business


president,
 at least
 perceived
 to
 be
 a


more
 pro
 business
 president
 and
 a
 sort


of
 unleashing
 of
 growth
 and
 opportunity


in
 the
 US
 for
 big
 business.
 And
 then
 the


tariffs
 hit
 and
 whilst
 these
 were


expected,
 they
 came
 through
 a
 lot
 more


punitive,
 a
 lot
 more
 harsh
 than


investors
 had
 anticipated.
 And
 so
 there


was
 a
 sharp
 reaction.
 And
 the
 reason


that
 sharp
 reaction
 kind
 of
 hit
 almost


more
 than
 the
 tariffs
 themselves,
 almost


more
 than
 sort
 of
 what
 it
 said
 about
 the


direction
 of
 travel
 for
 the


administration
 was
 that
 it
 was


unexpected.


>> Markets
 investors
 hate
 uncertainty.
 They


can't
 price
 uncertainty.
 It's
 impossible


to
 price
 what
 you
 don't
 know,


>> right?
 whether
 the
 economy
 could
 sustain


through
 such
 a
 shock,
 whether
 the


employment
 market
 would
 come
 under


strain,
 whether
 inflation
 would
 rapidly


rise.
 And
 so
 you
 ended
 up
 with
 this
 kind


of
 paralyzing
 of
 business
 and
 financial


markets
 because
 they
 just
 didn't
 know


what
 was
 going
 to
 happen.
 Now,
 where
 we


are
 now,
 sure,
 there's
 still
 a
 lot
 of


uncertainty
 in
 the
 world,
 but
 we
 at


least
 roughly
 know
 what
 the
 base
 rate
 on


tariffs
 is
 going
 to
 be.
 We
 roughly
 know,


we
 at least
 have
 some
 data
 on
 what
 the


income
 from
 tariffs
 looks
 like
 to
 the


government,


>> which
 is
 considerable,
 right?


>> Yeah.
 Much
 higher
 than
 people
 were


anticipating
 initially.
 We've
 seen


inflation
 not
 get
 out
 of
 control.
 Yes,


there's
 pressure
 on
 inflation,
 but
 it's


not
 got
 out
 of
 control.
 There's
 an
 awful


lot
 that
 we've
 just
 had
 a
 little
 bit
 of


time
 to
 kind
 of
 analyze,
 get
 our
 head


around
 to
 a
 point
 where
 there
 is
 at


least
 less
 uncertainty
 than
 there
 was
 6


months
 ago.
 So,
 it
 sounds
 like
 what


you're
 saying
 is
 we
 moved
 from
 this


really
 unpredictable
 environment
 to
 a


relatively
 at
 least
 more
 predictable
 one


and
 that
 with
 that
 shift,
 some
 of
 the


anxiety
 has
 fallen
 away.


>> Yeah,
 exactly.
 Certainly,
 some
 of
 the


big
 causes
 of
 constellation
 and


uncertainty
 have
 eased
 somewhat.
 And
 it


isn't
 just
 tariffs.
 We
 also
 have
 the
 big


beautiful
 bill,
 the
 tax
 cut
 that
 went


through.
 It's
 an
 extension
 of
 a
 tax
 cut,


but
 it
 still
 is
 a
 tailwind
 for
 the


market.
 Fed
 looks
 like
 it's
 now
 lowering


interest
 rates.
 Those
 lower
 interest


rates
 will
 also
 offer
 a
 tailwind
 to
 the


market.
 It
 reduces
 borrowing
 costs.
 It


broadly
 reduces
 costs
 for
 companies
 in


the
 stock
 market.


>> Tax
 cuts
 and
 reduced
 interest
 rates
 are


two
 things
 that
 businesses
 love.
 Good


news.


>> Yes.
 Yes.


>> So
 there's
 more
 certainty
 in
 a
 bunch
 of


areas.
 Tariffs,
 taxes,
 and
 interest


rates.
 Isn't
 there
 though,
 Joe,
 still
 a


lot
 of
 uncertainty
 just
 at
 a
 systemic


level?
 As
 in,
 aren't
 there
 concerns


about
 how
 much
 trust
 we
 can
 have
 in
 the


ability
 of
 the
 most
 important
 economic


institutions
 in
 this
 country
 to
 do
 their


jobs
 like
 the
 Fed,
 the
 Bureau
 of
 Labor


Statistics.
 These
 have
 both
 been


attacked
 by
 Trump.
 He's
 moved
 to
 fire
 a


Fed
 governor.
 He
 fired
 the
 head
 of
 the


labor
 agency.
 What's
 the
 impact
 of
 all


that?


>> There
 is
 absolutely
 concern
 around
 these


sorts
 of
 things.
 Whether
 that
 gets


reflected
 in
 markets
 is
 a
 little
 bit


different.
 Markets
 aren't
 moral.
 They


don't
 have
 a
 system
 of
 governance
 that


they
 are
 wedded
 to.
 What
 they


fundamentally
 care
 about
 is
 that
 policy,


especially
 monetary
 policy
 coming
 from


the
 Federal
 Reserve,
 is
 consistent
 with


the
 sort
 of
 economic
 fundamentals
 that


we're
 facing.
 In
 authoritarian


governments,
 that
 can
 sometimes
 become


dislocated
 where
 the
 politicians
 are


making
 those
 decisions,
 not
 the
 policy


makers.
 And
 then
 you
 can
 end
 up
 with


economic
 policy
 that
 doesn't
 fit
 the


economy
 you
 have.
 And
 that
 can
 lead
 to


some
 very
 unpleasant
 results,
 let's
 say.


We're
 not
 in
 that
 situation.
 We're
 in
 a


situation
 where
 yes,
 the
 administration


is
 putting
 a
 lot
 of
 pressure
 on
 the


Federal
 Reserve.
 They're
 putting


pressure
 on
 Federal
 Reserve
 independents


through
 the
 attempt
 to
 fire
 Lisa
 Cook,


>> the
 Fed
 governor.


>> Yeah.
 But
 at least
 for
 now,
 the
 policy


that
 they
 are
 pushing
 through
 is


consistent
 with
 the
 economic


fundamentals
 we're
 facing.
 So
 the
 fact


that
 Jerome
 Powell
 is
 now
 lowering


interest
 rates
 is
 more
 a
 coincidence


that
 that's
 what
 Trump
 wants
 as
 well.


because
 you
 know
 for
 a
 large
 chunk
 of


this
 year
 Trump
 wanted
 lower
 interest


rates
 and
 it
 was
 not
 the
 right
 time
 and


Pal
 didn't
 want
 to
 do
 that.


>> Now
 they're
 aligned
 and
 so
 whether


that's
 a
 question
 of
 independence
 or


lack
 of
 independence
 if
 the
 policy
 fits


the
 market
 then
 the
 market
 will
 be
 okay.


>> You're
 saying
 that
 the
 markets
 don't
 see


the
 Fed's
 move
 to
 lower
 interest
 rates


as
 a
 response
 to
 Trump
 pressure.
 They


see
 it
 as
 a
 response
 to
 the
 economic


signals.


>> Yeah.


>> Okay.
 But
 the
 Fed
 is
 cutting
 interest


rates
 in
 part
 because
 of
 weakness
 in
 the


labor
 market.
 Isn't
 that
 concerning
 to


investors
 that
 weakness?


>> It
 is,
 but
 we're
 at
 the
 very
 early
 days


of
 that
 right
 now.
 The
 labor
 market
 is


still
 by
 historical
 measures
 very,
 very


strong.
 Unemployment
 is
 still
 very,
 very


low.
 The
 Fed
 is
 sensing
 or
 seeing
 in
 the


data
 some
 turn
 in
 that
 strength.
 We
 are


starting
 to
 see
 unemployment
 tick
 up


slightly.
 we
 are
 starting
 to
 see
 the


number
 of
 jobs
 added
 sort
 of
 slowing


down
 and
 so
 they're
 trying
 to
 get
 ahead


of
 this
 before
 the
 labor
 market
 actually


buckles
 and
 cracks
 and
 we
 get
 to
 that


point.


>> So
 all
 of
 this
 it
 helps
 explain
 why
 the


markets
 aren't
 reacting
 very
 strongly
 to


some
 of
 the
 more
 extreme
 Trump
 moves.
 It


doesn't
 totally
 explain
 though
 why
 we're


in
 alltime
 high
 territory.
 What's
 behind


that?
 What's
 that
 story?


>> Yeah,
 sure.
 So
 I
 think
 it's
 good
 that


we're
 coming
 to
 this
 point
 now
 because


there
 is
 a
 really
 big
 driving
 force
 in


the
 market
 right
 now
 and
 that's


artificial
 intelligence.
 The
 enthusiasm


over
 the
 sort
 of
 transformational


potential
 of
 AI
 is
 driving
 the
 stock


market
 through
 the
 roof
 because
 the


biggest
 companies
 that
 stand
 to
 benefit


from
 AI
 adoption
 are
 listed
 in
 the
 US.


These
 companies
 have
 grown


astronomically
 over
 the
 past
 sort
 of


four
 years
 or
 so
 and
 they
 have
 become


these
 bares
 in
 the
 market.
 You
 have
 the


magnificent
 7
 which
 is
 a
 name
 given
 to
 a


group
 of
 seven
 stocks.
 It
 includes


Alphabet,
 Amazon,
 Apple,
 Meta,


Microsoft,
 Nvidia
 and
 Tesla.
 Those
 seven


companies
 now
 are
 more
 than
 a
 third
 of


the
 S&P
 500.


>> Wow,
 I
 didn't
 know
 that.


>> Right.
 So
 there's
 500
 companies,
 seven


of
 them
 are
 dictating
 a
 third
 of
 the


price.


>> That's
 unbelievable.


>> So
 if
 you
 get
 a
 2%
 rise
 in
 Nvidia
 one


day,
 it's
 really
 hard
 for
 the
 S&P
 500
 to


be
 down.


>> A
 huge
 impact.
 Totally
 outsized.


>> Exactly.
 Big
 big
 outsiz
 impact
 of
 the


stock
 prices
 of
 just
 a
 handful
 of


companies.
 And
 all
 of
 those
 companies


pretty
 much
 are
 fairly
 intertwined
 with


artificial
 intelligence.
 Mhm.


>> And
 you
 know
 when
 you
 have
 such
 driving


force
 as
 artificial
 intelligence
 in
 the


market,
 this
 is
 a
 potentially


transformational
 technology
 that
 could


drive
 profits
 in
 the
 stock
 market
 for
 a


long
 time.
 So
 even
 if
 you're
 kind
 of


worried
 about
 the
 attack
 on
 the
 Fed's


independence
 or
 some
 of
 the
 geopolitical


situations
 that
 are
 playing
 out,
 you


probably
 don't
 want
 to
 miss
 out
 on
 a


generational
 technology
 that
 will
 really


bolster
 US
 markets,
 the
 US
 economy


because
 other
 people
 around
 the
 world


are
 going
 to
 want
 to
 be
 invested
 in
 that


trade
 as
 well.
 And
 that
 brings
 money


into
 the
 US,


>> right?
 It's
 just
 very
 hard
 to
 sit
 this


out
 on
 the
 sidelines
 right
 now.


>> Yeah,
 absolutely.


>> Okay.
 And
 what
 about
 the
 concerns
 that


this
 AI
 boom
 could
 really
 just
 be
 a
 big


bubble
 that
 that
 these
 companies
 are


overvalued
 that
 they
 may
 not
 deliver
 on


their
 promise?


>> Yeah,
 it's
 a
 concern.
 Jamie
 Diamond,
 the


chief
 executive
 of
 JP
 Morgan,
 biggest


bank
 in
 the
 US,
 he
 warned
 of
 something


similar.
 The
 market
 does
 seem


overvalued.
 It
 does
 seem
 a
 little
 bit


frothy.
 There
 is
 room
 for
 a
 pullback


here.
 And
 all
 we
 have
 to
 look
 at
 are


some
 of
 the
 sort
 of
 classical
 market


metrics
 for
 assessing
 valuation.
 And
 on


pretty
 much
 all
 of
 those,
 let's
 take
 a


company
 like
 Nvidia
 for
 example,
 we're


blasting
 through
 historical
 precedent.


>> We're
 way
 outside
 of
 normal
 ranges
 on


what
 you
 would
 pay
 for
 a
 company
 with


the
 sort
 of
 current
 track
 record
 behind


it.
 And
 the
 expectations,
 you
 know,
 when


you
 pay
 more
 for
 a
 share,


the
 idea
 at
 least
 behind
 that
 is
 that


you
 think
 this
 company
 is
 going
 to
 be


able
 to
 make
 that
 money
 in
 the
 future


and
 give
 it
 back
 to
 you,
 you're
 trying


to
 profit,
 right?
 So,
 if
 you're
 paying


more
 for
 something,
 you
 think
 it's
 going


to
 make
 more
 money
 over
 the
 long
 term.


And
 while
 some
 of
 these
 numbers
 look


bananas
 on
 a
 piece
 of
 paper,
 Nvidia
 has


met
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 targets
 in
 recent


years.
 Like,
 this
 is
 a
 $500
 billion


company
 in
 2021
 that
 is
 now
 over
 $4


trillion.


And
 so,
 when
 Nvidia
 hit
 a
 trillion,
 do


you
 start
 saying,
 "Well,
 it
 looks
 a
 bit


overvalued."
 When
 Nvidia
 hits
 $2


trillion,
 do
 you
 think
 it's
 overvalued?


It's
 4
 trillion.
 Is
 it
 overvalued
 or
 is


it
 actually
 worth
 8
 trillion?
 I
 don't


know.
 And
 I
 don't
 think
 a
 lot
 of


investors
 know
 for
 sure
 either.
 With


almost
 any
 big
 fundamental
 change,


whether
 it's
 crypto
 and
 Bitcoin
 or


whether
 it's
 artificial
 intelligence
 or


whether
 it's
 the
 internet,
 these
 sorts


of
 technologies,
 to
 some
 extent
 at


least,
 when
 you
 don't
 have
 the
 full
 set


of
 numbers
 you
 need
 to
 value
 a
 company,


it
 comes
 down
 to
 belief.
 Part
 of
 what


you're
 saying
 is
 that
 while
 this
 could


be
 a
 bubble,
 all
 of
 this
 AI
 investment,


even
 in
 that
 scenario,
 it's
 very
 hard


for
 investors
 to
 not
 throw
 their
 money


into
 this
 sector
 because
 the
 potential


windfall
 that
 comes
 from
 making
 the


right
 bet
 on
 the
 right
 company
 is
 just


huge.


>> Yeah.
 And
 the
 and
 the
 risk
 of
 being


uninvested
 in
 this
 environment
 is
 like


you
 can
 fall
 behind
 very
 very
 quickly


>> as
 an
 investor.
 Maybe
 it's
 worth
 sort
 of


looking
 back
 to
 the.com
 period.
 The


internet
 revolution,
 the
 computing


revolution
 that
 kind
 of
 taken
 hold


earlier.
 Those
 things
 are
 still
 with
 us.


The
 technologies
 are
 still
 here.


Artificial
 intelligence
 isn't
 going
 to


be
 going
 away
 anytime
 soon.
 The


difference
 is
 which
 companies
 are
 going


to
 actually
 still
 be
 around
 in
 5
 or
 10


years.
 Is
 it
 going
 to
 be
 a
 case
 of
 one


of
 the
 many
 companies
 that
 went
 bust
 in


20201
 or
 is
 it
 going
 to
 be
 a
 case
 of


being
 Amazon
 which
 was
 also
 valued?


in
 similar
 ways
 that
 were
 also
 off
 the


chart
 in
 1999,
 that
 company
 is
 still


here
 and
 it
 would
 have
 made
 you
 an
 awful


lot
 of
 money
 to
 be
 invested
 over
 those


25
 years.


>> One
 of
 the
 concerns
 that
 comes
 up
 with


this,
 however,
 is
 that
 because
 of
 the


size
 of
 these
 companies
 and
 because
 of


how
 well
 they've
 been
 performing
 more


recently,
 they're
 also
 able
 to
 then
 mask


a
 lot
 of
 the
 pain
 that
 sort
 of
 sits
 just


beneath
 the
 surface
 of
 the
 stock
 market.


M


>> it's
 quite
 possible
 to
 have
 a
 large


chunk
 of
 the
 S&P
 500
 for
 example
 down
 on


a
 day
 where
 some
 idiosyncratic
 news


about
 Nvidia
 or
 Amazon
 that
 lifts
 those


stocks
 1
 2%
 can
 outweigh
 moves
 in
 the


opposite
 direction
 amongst
 a
 large
 chunk


of
 the
 index.
 So
 it
 kind
 of
 comes
 back


to
 the
 message
 that
 the
 market
 is


sending
 us
 on
 any
 given
 day
 that
 the
 S&P


500
 rises.
 Maybe
 that
 is
 a
 verdict
 on


the
 administration's
 policies.
 Maybe


that
 is
 a
 verdict
 on
 the
 economy
 at


large.
 But
 maybe
 it's
 also
 just


artificial
 intelligence.


>> H


>> and
 if
 you're
 only
 looking
 at
 that


highle
 number
 whether
 the
 S&P
 500
 has


risen
 or
 fallen,
 then
 you
 may
 be
 missing


some
 of
 the
 underlying
 concern
 that


still
 sits
 beneath
 the
 surface.


[Music]


We'll
 be
 right
 back.


[Music]


So
 let's
 talk
 about
 some
 of
 those


underlying
 concerns,
 these
 warning
 signs


in
 the
 markets.
 What
 are
 you
 seeing?
 So,


one
 of
 the
 most
 obvious
 would
 be
 gold.


Gold
 has
 been
 rising
 for
 a
 while
 at
 this


point,
 but
 it's
 really
 taken
 off
 in


recent
 months.
 We've
 gone
 above
 $4,000


on
 gold
 for
 the
 first
 time.
 And
 the


signal
 that
 sends
 is
 one
 of
 worry.
 Why


do
 people
 buy
 gold?
 It
 doesn't
 offer
 any


return.
 It's
 not
 going
 to
 enrich
 you
 in


the
 way
 that
 maybe
 a
 rapidly
 rising


stock
 will.
 You
 go
 there
 because
 you


don't
 want
 to
 lose
 money.
 It's
 less


about
 making
 money.
 It's
 more
 about
 not


losing
 that
 money.
 People
 tend
 to
 invest


in
 gold
 when
 they're
 feeling
 insecure.


>> Yeah,
 exactly.
 And
 we've
 seen
 central


banks
 around
 the
 world
 move
 more
 into


gold.
 That's
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 shift
 away
 from


dollar
 assets.
 That's
 a
 concern
 about


the
 sort
 of
 safety
 and
 soundness
 of
 US


markets
 kind
 of
 continuing
 in
 the
 way


that
 they
 have
 for
 so
 long.
 We're
 also


seeing
 some
 of
 that
 reflected
 in
 money


moving
 away
 from
 the
 US
 stock
 market.


Yes,
 we
 have
 these
 big
 tech
 companies


that
 are
 leading
 and
 are
 at
 the


forefront
 of
 AI,
 but
 we've
 also
 had
 that


for
 a
 while.
 So,
 there's
 been
 a
 lot
 of


money
 come
 in
 from
 international
 markets


into
 the
 US
 market
 chasing
 those


returns.
 We're
 starting
 to
 see
 that
 eb
 a


little
 bit.


>> We're
 seeing
 more
 money
 going
 into


European
 markets
 or
 other
 emerging


markets
 as
 people
 dial
 down
 some
 of


their
 exposure
 to
 the
 US.


>> Got
 it.
 So,
 so
 far
 you've
 talked
 about


gold,
 the
 prices
 going
 up,
 that
 being
 a


sign
 of
 of
 potential
 unease.
 You've


talked
 about
 money
 moving
 into


international
 markets.
 What
 else?


>> Perhaps
 one
 of
 the
 most
 obvious
 or


classic
 signs
 of
 concern
 is
 in
 defaults.


So,
 companies
 unable
 to
 pay
 their
 debts


back
 and
 actually
 going
 into
 either


bankruptcy
 or
 having
 to
 negotiate
 with


their
 creditors.
 We
 saw
 this
 recently
 in


the
 subprime
 auto
 lending
 space.
 So,
 car


loans
 to
 people
 that
 are
 considered


risky
 borrowers.


>> It
 does
 hint
 and
 show
 there
 is
 some


fraying
 of
 the
 strength
 of
 the
 consumer


that
 has
 driven
 the
 economy
 since
 the


pandemic
 and
 there
 is
 some
 sign
 that


consumers
 are
 coming
 under
 strain.
 If


that
 follows
 through,
 you
 can
 see
 how


that
 lowers
 consumer
 spending
 at
 big
 box


stores.
 You
 can
 then
 see
 how
 that
 flows


through
 into
 the
 stock
 market
 as


revenues
 decline
 for
 some
 of
 those


companies
 and
 things
 like
 that.
 It


sounds
 like
 more
 than
 just
 a
 red
 flag


for
 markets.
 Those
 rising
 defaults
 are
 a


sign
 that
 like
 a
 growing
 number
 of


people
 in
 the
 regular
 real
 economy
 are


are
 struggling.


>> Yeah,
 it
 is.
 But
 it
 is
 still
 at
 the


margin.
 It's
 not
 broad-based
 yet.


>> When
 we
 started
 talking,
 I
 mentioned


that
 there
 had
 been
 this
 drop
 in
 the


markets
 after
 Trump
 threatened
 new
 China


tariffs.
 We
 know
 obviously
 that
 the
 US


China
 trade
 negotiations
 have
 not
 been


resolved.
 Having
 two
 major
 economic


superpowers
 in
 an
 escalating
 trade
 war


certainly
 doesn't
 seem
 like
 it
 would


bode
 well
 for
 investors.
 Is
 anyone


you're
 talking
 to
 worried
 about
 these


tensions
 heating
 up
 again?


>> Yeah,
 absolutely.
 It
 remains
 a
 sort
 of


outstanding
 cause
 of
 concern.
 This
 is


the
 big
 trading
 relationship.
 This
 is


the
 one
 that
 really
 matters.
 And
 if


there
 is
 a
 sense
 that
 that
 relationship


is
 breaking
 down,
 then
 yeah,
 markets
 are


going
 to
 react
 to
 that.
 We
 saw
 that
 this


month
 with
 some
 of
 the
 back
 and
 forth


between
 DC
 and
 Beijing
 where
 you
 know


Trump
 comes
 out
 sort
 of
 threatens
 these


100%
 tariffs
 on
 China
 and
 that
 prompted


a
 very
 strong
 reaction.
 It
 shows
 this


sensitivity
 to
 the
 unknown
 to
 the


potential
 for
 a
 crisis
 coming
 out
 of


left
 field.
 There
 are
 definitely
 still


these
 risks
 looming
 out
 there
 and


investors
 are
 sensitive
 to
 them.


>> So
 Joe,
 how
 worried
 should
 we
 be?
 H
 how


should
 we
 be
 interpreting
 these
 warning


signs?
 Is
 it
 a
 signal
 that
 the
 historic


run
 that
 we've
 been
 on
 is
 about
 to
 end?


>> I
 don't
 know.


Uh


>> darn
 it.


>> Yeah,


>> I
 was
 really
 hoping
 you
 did.


>> Um
 yeah,
 I
 don't
 know.
 It's
 kind
 of


fascinating
 in
 a
 sort
 of
 purely


intellectual
 way,
 but
 it
 it's
 also


baffling
 in
 its
 own
 right
 to
 see
 how


little
 effect
 maybe
 some
 of
 the
 things


that
 we
 think
 of
 as
 being
 very
 impactful


in
 our
 own
 lives
 have
 not
 necessarily


translated
 into
 financial
 markets.
 But


it
 also
 hopefully
 uh
 at
 the
 end
 of
 this


conversation
 makes
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 sense


in
 the
 sense
 that
 the
 reality
 that


companies
 are
 dealing
 with,
 the
 reality


that
 investors
 are
 dealing
 with
 is
 not


that
 bad.
 You
 know,
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of


people
 will
 feel
 maddened
 by
 some
 of


this,
 especially
 those
 who
 are
 being


affected
 by
 Trump's
 policies.
 Yeah.
 You


know,
 I'm
 thinking
 of
 thousands
 of


federal
 workers,
 you
 know,
 who
 who
 who


don't
 have
 a
 job
 or
 or
 the
 small


businesses
 who
 are
 struggling
 with


tariffs


>> because
 I
 think
 people
 at least
 going


into
 this
 term,
 they
 expected
 markets
 to


be
 a
 guard
 rail,
 to
 be
 a
 check
 on
 the


president,
 for
 them
 to
 be
 maybe
 one
 of


the
 only
 effective
 checks
 on
 the


president's
 most
 extreme
 instincts.
 And


that
 just
 doesn't
 seem
 to
 be
 happening.


>> Yeah,
 you're
 right.
 People
 certainly
 did


come
 into
 this
 year
 expecting
 markets
 to


be
 more
 of
 a
 guard
 rail
 than
 they
 have


been.
 But
 you
 know
 when
 investors
 are


actually
 confronted
 with
 the
 landscape


in
 front
 of
 them,
 they
 have
 to
 consider


the
 good
 and
 the
 bad.
 Companies
 are


earning.
 We've
 had
 double
 digit
 earnings


growth
 in
 the
 first
 quarter
 and
 in
 the


second
 quarter
 and
 we're
 looking
 like
 we


might
 get
 it
 in
 the
 third
 quarter
 as


well
 as
 we
 go
 into
 earning
 season
 now.


And
 you
 know,
 when
 you
 consider
 the


attack
 on
 Fed
 independence,
 when
 you


consider
 some
 of
 the
 more
 extreme


policies
 that
 have
 kind
 of
 come
 out
 from


this
 administration,
 when
 you
 consider


all
 these
 things,
 do
 you
 think
 Nvidia
 or


Google
 or
 Apple,
 these
 big
 companies
 are


not
 going
 to
 be
 making
 a
 lot
 of
 money
 in


5
 years


>> or
 two
 years?


>> I
 think
 they're
 probably
 going
 to
 be


doing
 all
 right.
 And
 I
 don't
 often
 have


opinions.


That's
 pretty
 much
 the
 mildest
 opinion
 I


think
 anyone
 can
 have.
 think
 so.


>> Um,
 and
 so,
 you
 know,
 sometimes
 it's


just
 answering
 a
 different
 question
 than


the
 one
 investors
 are
 asking
 of
 it.
 And


that's
 kind
 of
 why
 we
 are
 where
 we
 are.


>> You're
 saying
 basically
 that
 the
 markets


are
 filtering
 all
 the
 noise
 of
 the


volatility
 in
 this
 Trump
 term
 or
 or


maybe
 investors
 are
 just
 holding
 their


nose
 because
 they
 can't
 resist
 the
 pull


of
 AI.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah,
 I
 mean
 I
 I
 speak
 to
 a
 lot
 of


investors
 who
 have
 talked
 about
 how


they've
 evolved
 their
 investment
 process


a
 little
 bit
 this
 year,
 learning


somewhat
 from
 the
 first
 Trump
 term,
 but


then
 also
 just
 trying
 to
 really,
 as
 you


said,
 filter
 out
 the
 noise.
 What's
 real?


You
 know,
 if
 Joe
 Biden
 had
 tweeted


something
 that
 resembled
 a
 policy


announcement
 one
 random
 afternoon,
 then


markets
 would
 have
 responded
 to
 it
 and


they'd
 have
 reacted
 very
 quickly
 because


they'd
 have
 taken
 it
 seriously.
 We
 don't


have
 that
 level
 of
 reaction
 function
 now


because
 there
 is
 a
 sense
 that


>> you
 know
 and
 I
 do
 not
 mean
 this
 with
 any


kind
 of
 value
 judgment
 attached
 to
 it


but


>> the
 sense
 at
 least
 among
 investors
 is


that
 this
 administration
 says
 and
 does
 a


lot
 of
 stuff
 that
 doesn't
 actually


happen


>> that
 changes
 the
 next
 day
 and
 so
 I
 think


investors
 have
 really
 started
 to
 try
 not


to
 react
 to
 those
 more
 superfluous


things
 and
 instead
 focus
 on
 what's


what's
 actually
 happened,
 what's


actually
 been
 said
 and
 done
 rather
 than


what
 might
 happen.


>> So
 to
 a
 certain
 extent,
 markets
 have


kind
 of
 become
 inured
 to
 the
 daily


seessaw
 of
 drama
 that
 maybe
 affects
 us


regular
 folks
 a
 little
 more.
 I
 guess
 my


question
 is,
 is
 there
 a
 way
 in
 which


Trump
 has
 also
 affected
 the
 tolerance
 of


investors
 for
 the
 actual
 things
 he's


doing
 in
 some
 way
 by
 throwing
 us
 all


into
 this
 kind
 of
 crazy
 experiment
 of


what
 unprecedented
 tariff
 rates
 will
 do


to
 an
 economy
 and
 what
 unprecedented


levels
 of
 government
 intervention
 will


do?
 Has
 he
 made
 us
 more
 comfortable
 with


some
 things
 that
 before
 we
 might
 have


thought
 were
 a
 little
 out
 of
 bounds?
 You


know,
 has
 he
 normalized
 these
 moves
 to


the
 point
 where
 investors
 are
 just


adapting
 to
 them?


>> Yeah.
 You
 know,
 if
 you'd
 asked
 an


economist
 in
 January,
 what
 would


introducing
 the
 highest
 tariffs
 in
 what


a
 century
 do
 to
 the
 economy?
 I
 don't


think
 they'd
 have
 said,
 "Well,
 I'm


pretty
 sure
 the
 S&P
 500
 will
 be
 at
 a
 new


record,"


>> right?


>> Um,
 but
 we
 are
 in
 that
 position.
 So,
 we


can
 look
 at
 what's
 happening
 to


companies.
 We
 can
 look
 at
 what's


happening
 to
 the
 data.
 We
 can
 look
 at


what
 companies
 are
 doing
 in
 response
 to


these
 increased
 costs.
 We
 can
 see


whether
 they're
 trying
 to
 absorb
 those


costs
 or
 pass
 them
 on
 to
 consumers.
 And


certainly,
 for
 the
 first
 half
 of the


year,
 it
 looked
 like
 they
 were
 absorbing


those
 costs.
 Now,
 it's
 looking
 like


they're
 beginning
 to
 start
 passing
 those


on
 to
 consumers.
 that
 would
 potentially


be
 another
 warning
 sign.
 But
 you


actually
 end
 up
 just
 having
 to
 look
 at


what's
 really
 happening,
 not
 the
 sort
 of


gut
 check
 or
 emotional
 response
 to


what's
 happening.
 It
 has
 to
 be
 the


reality
 of
 it
 and
 how
 does
 it
 affect


company
 profitability.
 We
 could
 easily


see
 a
 future
 in
 which
 the
 sort
 of


positives
 driving
 the
 market
 continue
 to


outweigh
 and
 I
 can
 see
 a
 future
 where


some
 of
 those
 negatives
 that
 are


beginning
 to
 creep
 in
 could
 also


outweigh.
 But
 at least
 for
 now,
 a
 lot
 of


the
 worst
 fears
 that
 were
 sort
 of


surrounding
 this
 stuff
 at
 the
 beginning


of
 the
 year
 have
 not
 been
 met
 yet.


[Music]


Oh,
 and
 before
 I
 let
 you
 go,
 I
 want
 to


actually
 make
 use
 of
 that
 printout
 that


you
 brought.
 That
 was
 supposed
 to
 help


you
 answer
 a
 question
 about
 what


companies
 have
 done
 well
 since
 Trump


instituted
 all
 these
 tariffs.
 So,
 let's


hear
 it.
 Who's
 killing
 it?
 Oh
 my


goodness.
 All right,
 let's
 look
 at
 the


scores
 on
 the
 board.
 Looking
 at
 this


piece
 of
 paper
 in
 front
 of
 me,
 it's
 very


clear
 why
 the
 market
 has
 been
 doing
 so


well.
 There's
 seven
 companies
 on
 here


that
 have
 risen
 more
 than
 100%
 since
 the


start
 of
 April.


>> Wow.


>> That's
 doubling
 in
 value.
 There's


Broadcom,
 Palunteer,
 Oracle,
 companies


that
 have
 done
 big
 business
 with
 the


government.
 It's
 pretty
 staggering.


>> I
 was
 really
 hoping
 you
 were
 going
 to


say
 the
 New
 York
 Times.


>> Alas.
 Alas.
 But
 it's
 easy
 looking
 at


that
 list
 to
 understand
 why
 the
 market


is
 doing
 okay.


>> Well,
 Joe,
 thanks
 so
 much.


>> Thank
 you.


[Music]


We'll
 be
 right
 back.


[Music]


here's
 what
 else
 you
 should
 know
 today.


>> We
 want


>> across
 the
 country
 on
 Saturday,
 large


crowds
 gathered
 for
 dayong
 no
 kings


protests
 against
 President
 Trump.


The
 rallies
 took
 place
 in
 small
 towns


and
 big
 cities
 and
 drew
 particularly


large
 turnouts
 in
 Washington
 DC,
 New


York,
 and
 Chicago.


>> The
 demonstrations
 were
 aimed
 at
 calling


out
 what
 protesters
 see
 as
 the


authoritarian
 actions
 of
 the
 president


and
 were
 largely
 peaceful.


>> Will
 we
 sit
 by
 while
 the
 president
 slow


walks
 us
 into
 authoritarianism?


[Music]


>> Will
 we
 bend
 the
 knee
 or
 grace?


[Applause]


And
 on
 Sunday,
 Israel
 launched
 its


heaviest
 attacks
 on
 Gaza
 since
 a


ceasefire
 took
 hold
 a
 week
 ago
 and


suspended
 humanitarian
 aid
 to
 the


enclave
 after
 accusing
 Hamas
 of


violating
 the
 truce
 by
 killing
 two


Israeli
 soldiers.


By
 nightfall,
 following
 a
 series
 of


significant
 strikes,
 the
 Israeli


military
 said
 it
 had
 quote
 begun
 the


renewed
 enforcement
 of
 the
 ceasefire.


Gaza's
 health
 officials
 reported
 44


Palestinian
 deaths
 across
 the
 territory


on
 Sunday.
 The
 flare
 up
 of
 violence
 and


the
 temporary
 halt
 in
 aid
 were
 the
 most


serious
 tests
 yet
 of
 the
 ceasefire,


which
 was
 negotiated
 under
 heavy


pressure
 from
 the
 White
 House
 and
 signed


by
 Trump
 himself.


Finally,
 in
 a
 brazen
 daylight
 robbery
 at


the
 Louve
 Museum
 in
 Paris,
 thieves
 made


off
 with
 jewelry
 of
 incalculable
 value.


According
 to
 France's
 interior
 minister,


the
 heist
 unfolded
 around
 9:30
 a.m.
 when


thieves
 used
 a
 lift
 mechanism
 on
 a
 truck


to
 break
 into
 the
 museum
 and
 snatch


eight
 precious
 objects
 before
 fleeing
 on


motor
 scooters
 with
 their
 loot.
 All


within
 just
 7
 minutes.
