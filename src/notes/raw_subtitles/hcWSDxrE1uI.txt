[Music]


hi
 everybody
 I'm
 Nicola
 tangan
 the
 CEO


of
 the
 Norwegian
 SN
 wealth
 fund
 and


today
 I'm
 in
 really
 good
 company
 because


I'm
 here
 with
 Ruth
 porat
 the
 president


and
 chief
 investment
 officer
 of
 alphabet


which
 is
 the
 parent
 company
 of
 Google


now
 of
 course
 Google
 needs
 no


introduction
 but
 alphabet
 in
 addition


also
 makes
 self-driving
 cars
 AI
 chips
 it


owns
 YouTube
 and
 many
 more
 things
 and
 we


own
 1.3%
 of
 the
 company
 totaling
 roughly


$30
 billion
 so
 big
 welcome
 Ru
 it's
 great


to
 be
 with
 you
 thank
 you
 who
 is
 going
 to


win
 the
 AI
 race
 well
 we
 feel
 we're
 um
 in


a
 really
 strong
 position
 for
 a
 number
 of


reasons
 I
 think
 when
 you
 look
 at
 the


history
 of
 Google
 focused
 on


AI
 uh
 we
 started
 many
 many
 years
 ago
 and


at
 this
 point
 we
 have
 a
 very


differentiated
 approach
 which
 starts


with
 the
 extraordinary
 team
 we
 have
 led


by
 Demis
 aabas
 who
 obviously
 just
 won


the
 Nobel
 Prize
 that
 goes
 to
 the


strength
 of
 the
 mod
 models
 you
 look
 at


what
 we're
 doing
 on
 chips
 with
 our
 tpus


and
 then
 we're
 already
 really
 using
 it


across
 our
 various
 platforms
 so
 billions


of
 people
 are
 benefiting
 from
 AI
 so
 this


full
 stack
 approach
 we
 think
 is
 an


important
 element
 that
 being
 said
 what's


exciting
 to
 see
 is
 how
 much
 Innovation


there
 is
 broadly
 and
 so
 what
 we're


looking
 at
 is
 the
 opportunity
 I
 think


collectively
 globally
 to
 have
 an
 unlock


from
 the
 upside
 given
 the
 Innovation


that
 we're
 seeing
 not
 just
 at
 Google
 but


at
 other
 places
 so
 is
 it
 now
 a
 matter
 of


who's
 got
 the
 best
 people
 or
 the
 most


money
 or
 the
 best
 data
 or
 the
 best
 chips


what
 is
 it
 what
 is
 it
 about
 well
 the


reason
 I
 started
 with
 what
 we're
 really


proud
 of
 our
 full
 stack
 approach
 from


talent
 and
 models
 to
 the
 platforms
 and


chips
 is
 it
 really
 is
 taking
 this
 full


stack
 approach
 and
 I
 think
 very


importantly
 um
 this
 intense
 focus
 on


Innovation
 and
 continuing
 to
 push
 forth


you
 know
 one
 of
 the
 things
 that
 really


struck
 me
 when
 Demus
 was
 awarded
 the


Nobel
 Prize
 this
 last
 fall
 and
 he
 was


asked
 what
 was
 it
 that
 really
 started


him
 on
 this
 journey
 and
 he
 said
 what


motivates
 him
 is
 to
 take
 on
 the
 most


intractable
 what
 were
 thought
 to
 be
 the


most
 intractable
 problems
 facing


humanity
 and
 I
 think
 that
 ethos
 is


another
 really
 important
 element
 of
 how


one
 continues
 to
 drive
 forth
 and
 have


the
 biggest
 impact
 with
 AI
 do
 you
 think


generative
 AI
 can
 be
 monetized
 the
 same


way
 as
 search
 is
 I
 think
 generative
 AI


is
 continuing
 to
 enable
 us
 and
 others
 to


uh
 expand
 kind
 of
 the
 quality
 of
 what
 is


being
 delivered
 across
 a
 a
 various
 a


wide
 set
 of
 opportunities
 so
 just
 to


give
 you
 two
 examples
 you
 know
 I'm
 often


asked
 where
 do
 we
 where
 are
 we
 investing


ex
 you
 know
 extensively
 and
 probably
 not


surprisingly
 you
 know
 this
 well
 given


how
 close
 you
 are
 to
 all
 that
 we've
 been


doing
 but
 search
 remains
 so
 core
 to
 who


we
 are
 and
 we've
 evolved
 search


meaningfully
 over
 the
 years
 and
 we're


continuing
 to
 apply
 generative
 AI
 to


what
 is
 that
 experience
 that
 one
 has
 um


when
 you
 search
 and
 what
 we're
 finding


is
 that
 it
 opens
 the
 the
 types
 of


queries
 that
 are
 being
 explored
 it
 goes


for
 a
 deeper
 richer
 engagement
 so
 that's


one
 area
 the
 other
 area
 that's
 really


important
 is
 what
 we're
 seeing
 on
 the


Enterprise
 side
 and
 the
 abil
 to
 help


companies
 and
 the
 public
 sector


transform
 the
 businesses
 and
 their


approach
 whether
 it's
 engaging
 with


customers
 or
 on
 the
 efficiency
 side
 or


on
 risk
 analytics
 or
 with
 constituents


each
 of
 those
 provides
 opportunity
 for


monetization
 some
 of
 your
 competitors


say
 that
 you
 were
 a
 bit
 slow
 out
 of
 the


box
 when
 it
 cames
 to
 AI
 models
 but
 um


your
 latest
 Gemini
 is
 uh
 it's
 it's


phenomenal
 so
 so
 what
 happened
 here
 well


a
 search
 Google
 search
 for
 decades
 has


really
 stood
 for
 Extraordinary
 quality


it's
 what
 everybody
 around
 the
 globe


expects
 of
 us
 when
 you
 go
 to
 Google


quality
 answer
 uh
 very
 rapidly
 surfaced


for
 you
 in
 the
 most
 potent
 way
 and
 one


of
 the
 very
 important
 questions
 for
 us


slind
 talked
 about
 this
 in
 the
 early


days
 of
 generative
 AI
 internally
 we
 were


all
 talking
 about
 uh
 the
 risk
 of


hallucination
 and
 that
 term
 now
 is
 very


well
 known
 quite
 broadly
 and
 one
 of
 the


concerns
 is
 if
 you
 in
 the
 middle
 of
 the


night
 wake
 up
 your
 child
 is
 sick
 you


want
 to
 figure
 out
 how
 much
 TI
 andol
 to


give
 to
 a
 three-year-old
 there
 can
 be
 no


margin
 for
 error
 yeah
 that's
 what
 our


brand
 stands
 for
 and
 so
 it's
 very


important
 to
 us
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 as
 we


were
 evolving
 and
 applying
 generative
 AI


we
 did
 it
 in
 a
 way
 that
 was
 consistent


with
 the
 quality
 that's
 expected


appropriately
 from
 Google
 and
 I


appreciate
 your
 question
 because
 what


you've
 seen


is
 the
 really
 ongoing
 momentum
 in
 models


and
 introducing
 models
 more
 broadly


externally
 what
 we've
 done
 with
 for


example
 AI
 overviews
 where
 when
 you


search
 you'll
 get
 this
 kind
 of
 an
 AI


cockpit
 is
 the
 way
 I
 like
 to
 think
 about


it
 you're
 seeing
 more
 and
 things
 like
 a


model
 advancement
 that
 can
 be
 applied
 in


in
 other
 uh
 in
 other
 applications
 and
 so


we're
 excited
 about
 the
 momentum
 that


people
 have
 seen
 through
 2024
 and
 what


is
 ahead
 in
 2025
 talking
 a
 you
 told
 the


late
 you
 call
 the
 latest
 model
 for
 um


the
 model
 for
 the
 agentic
 area
 what
 what


does
 that
 mean
 or
 what
 what
 do
 you
 put


in
 that
 so
 that's
 one
 area
 that
 I
 I
 know


SAR
 and
 Demis
 and
 the
 team
 are
 really


excited
 about
 which
 is
 how
 can
 AI


actually
 be
 an
 agent
 working
 on
 our


behalf
 how
 can
 it
 help
 you
 do
 some
 of


the
 administrative
 tasks
 that
 are
 going


to
 make
 your
 life
 easier
 and
 actually


free
 you
 up
 to
 do
 something
 else
 book
 a


reservation
 for
 you
 um
 research


something
 for
 you
 how
 can
 it
 even
 be


applied
 for
 example
 in
 science
 to
 do


some
 of
 the
 basic
 inquiries
 so
 set
 it


out
 to
 do
 something
 to
 work
 on
 your


behalf
 so
 three
 three
 years
 from
 now


what
 does
 your
 day
 look
 like
 how
 is
 it


changing
 your
 life
 you
 know
 that's
 it's


a
 great
 question
 as
 it
 relates
 broadly


to
 AI
 I
 think
 one
 of
 the
 most
 um


important
 things
 for
 all
 of
 us
 is
 that


AI
 can
 really
 be
 an
 assist
 it
 can
 be


operating
 leverage
 for
 every
 one
 of
 us


you
 when
 I
 started
 my
 career
 on
 Wall


Street
 how
 was
 it
 as
 you
 were
 moving


from
 Bas
 you
 know
 big
 computers
 to


laptops
 to
 phone
 this
 becomes
 operating


leverage
 if
 appropriately
 applied
 and
 so


what
 one
 scientist
 once
 said
 to
 me
 that


they
 view
 this
 as
 augmented
 intelligence


not
 artificial
 intelligence
 and
 wish


that
 had
 been
 the
 word
 that
 was
 used


that's
 what
 it
 is
 for
 each
 one
 of
 us
 and


I
 think
 what's
 really
 important
 is
 to


understand
 that
 in
 fact
 it's
 not
 that
 we


will
 be
 replaced
 by
 AI
 in
 our
 roles
 but


we
 can
 be
 replaced
 by
 someone
 who's


using
 AI
 who's
 getting
 that
 operating


leverage
 if
 we're
 not
 and
 so
 it's
 so


important
 for
 people
 to
 just
 start


experimenting
 just
 start
 playing
 so
 that


you're
 on
 that
 Learning
 Journey
 now
 you


make
 your
 own
 AI
 chips
 the
 tpus
 why


could
 you
 explain
 just
 how
 they
 are


different
 from
 other
 chips
 and
 why
 why


you
 do
 this
 well
 we
 work
 very
 closely


with
 Nvidia
 they're
 a
 strong
 partner
 of


ours
 so
 we
 use
 both
 gpus
 and
 tpus
 and


many
 years
 ago
 the
 team
 started
 on
 this


journey
 of
 developing
 our
 our
 own
 chips


tpus
 to
 address
 some
 of
 the
 specific


requirements
 that
 we
 felt
 we
 needed
 and


what
 we
 found
 is
 that
 we
 continue
 to


have
 the
 type
 of
 performance
 that
 we're


looking
 for
 in
 particular
 in
 training
 um


and
 as
 we've
 Advanced
 the
 tpus
 what


we're
 seeing
 is
 we're
 continuing
 to


drive
 greater
 efficiency
 in
 all
 elements


of
 uh
 energy
 requirements
 with
 tpus
 so


they
 there's
 a
 cost
 benefit
 for
 us
 and


and
 impact
 benefit
 and
 so
 we're
 using


both
 in
 the
 fleet
 talking
 about
 various


versions
 of
 things
 so
 now
 we've
 had
 deep


seek
 um
 being
 launched
 which
 is
 uh
 an


open-
 Source
 model
 uh
 now
 just
 how
 do


you
 look
 at
 open
 versus
 closed


Source
 models
 now
 so
 open
 source
 has


been
 core
 to
 Google
 really
 for
 since


Inception
 if
 you
 think
 about
 something


like
 Android
 uh
 which
 is
 uh
 such
 an


important
 operating
 system
 globally
 it


reflects
 who
 we
 are
 when
 you
 think
 about


the
 trans
 former
 paper
 which
 has
 been
 so


critical
 for
 anybody
 who's
 thinking


about
 how
 do
 you
 build
 in
 this
 AI
 world


like
 what's
 the
 next
 step
 to
 the
 next


iteration
 so
 open
 source
 has
 been


important
 to
 us
 at
 the
 same
 time
 this
 is


a
 really
 powerful
 technology
 and
 so
 what


we're
 looking
 at
 is
 how
 does
 one


maximize
 upside
 but
 have
 the
 appropriate


guard
 rails
 and
 controls
 over
 certain


elements
 of
 it
 to
 ensure
 that
 you're


protecting
 how
 it's
 used
 used
 and
 where


it's
 used
 and
 getting
 that
 balance
 right


will
 continue
 to
 be
 very
 important
 for


all
 of
 us
 what
 are
 you
 personally
 most


excited
 about
 in
 terms
 of
 usage
 I
 mean


you
 you
 talked
 about
 um
 um
 medicine


Alpha
 fold
 and
 so
 on
 you
 you
 personally


what
 do
 you
 what
 do
 you
 feel
 more


strongly
 about
 oh
 I
 so
 when
 we
 look
 at


at
 AI
 I
 think
 there
 are
 four
 primary


areas
 that
 are
 really


exciting
 um
 first
 is
 the
 economic
 upside


you
 know
 it
 globally
 the
 estimates
 are


there
 can
 be
 20
 trillion
 added
 to
 GDP
 in


the
 next
 decade
 again
 if
 appropriately


executed
 if
 adopted
 across
 industry
 when


you
 think
 about
 the
 benefit
 to
 society


if
 in
 fact
 we
 have
 anything
 close
 to


that
 economic
 uplift
 I
 get
 excited
 about


it
 it's
 not
 to
 be
 taken
 for
 granted
 as
 I


said
 it
 requires
 what
 economists
 call


diffusion
 across
 industry
 adoption
 a


radical
 rethink
 of
 many
 elements
 of
 the


way
 the
 public
 sector
 and
 the
 private


sector
 Works
 excited
 about
 that
 very


excited
 about
 the
 breakthroughs
 in


science
 what
 Demis
 aavas
 and
 John
 jumper


awarded
 the
 Nobel
 this
 past
 fall
 you


know
 that
 was
 for
 something
 called
 Alpha


fold
 which
 you're
 familiar
 with
 which


has
 been
 described
 as
 the
 greatest


contribution
 to
 drug
 discovery
 that
 is


exciting
 then
 just
 even
 sitting
 here


today
 the
 Practical
 applications
 of
 AI


in
 health
 care
 in
 education
 are
 really


exciting
 um
 so
 I
 would
 put
 those
 at
 the


top
 of
 the
 list
 now
 talking
 about


something
 uh
 um
 slightly
 different
 you


uh
 before
 the
 holiday
 season
 sent
 shocks


waves
 through
 the
 world
 with
 your
 willow


Quantum
 chip
 so
 why
 why
 is
 that
 such
 a


leap
 forward
 so
 we've
 been
 working
 on


Quantum
 AI
 Quantum
 Computing
 for
 quite


some
 time
 uh
 well
 over
 I
 think
 a
 decade


at
 this
 point
 uh
 and
 what's
 really


exciting
 is
 the
 computational


capabilities
 with
 Quantum
 so
 the
 willow


chip
 is
 able
 to
 um
 to
 handle
 a


computation
 in
 less
 than
 5
 minutes


that
 previously
 on
 the
 best


supercomputers
 on
 the
 planet
 today
 would


take
 10
 septian
 years
 which
 even
 I
 had


to
 Google
 it's
 it's
 24
 zeros
 on
 the
 back


of
 it
 so
 what
 that
 means
 in
 terms
 of
 the


ability
 to
 see
 and
 analyze
 more
 whether


it's
 in
 biology
 or
 other
 areas
 is


exciting
 and
 profound
 and
 so
 we
 see
 this


as
 another
 path
 that
 we
 will
 continue
 to


execute
 against
 how
 do
 you
 view
 uh


Microsoft's
 version
 of
 it
 uh
 we're


really
 proud
 of
 our
 own
 we
 think
 that
 uh


that
 what
 you've
 seen
 time
 and
 time


again
 is
 the
 breakthroughs
 from
 that


team
 led
 by
 an
 extraordinary
 leader


Hartman
 Nevan
 um
 U
 published
 in
 all


sorts
 of
 different
 places
 and
 we
 just


continue
 to
 build
 success
 to
 success


with
 the
 willow
 chip
 being
 the
 most


recent
 when
 do
 you
 think
 this
 will
 be


commercial
 yeah
 that's
 a
 great
 question


not
 surprisingly
 I
 ask
 that
 question
 all


the
 time
 as
 well
 and
 have
 been
 for
 um


some
 time
 you
 know
 I
 think
 it's
 there's


still
 a
 number
 of
 years
 ahead
 it's


starting
 to
 to
 point
 to
 different


applications
 that
 we're
 excited
 about


but
 whether
 we're
 three
 years
 five
 years


you
 know
 hard
 to
 say
 uh
 but
 it's
 it's


getting
 closer
 since
 I
 started
 asking


that


question
 and
 when
 when
 you
 talk
 about


these
 kind
 of
 24
 zeros
 uh
 uh
 and
 so
 on


just
 what
 are
 the
 what
 are
 the


implications
 for
 what
 are
 the
 kind
 of


things
 we
 can
 do
 when
 we
 have
 that
 kind


of
 compute
 power
 well
 when
 you
 think


about
 it
 take
 something
 like
 the
 human


body
 and
 the
 complexity
 of
 the
 human


body
 or
 anything
 in
 nature
 that's
 you


know
 multi-dimensional
 um
 the
 ability
 to


actually
 crunch
 data
 more
 efficiently
 to


have
 better
 insights
 is
 one
 area
 that's


very
 exciting
 for
 for
 us
 to
 think
 about


and
 the
 possibilities
 that
 come
 from


that
 and
 other
 things
 where
 you
 are


where
 you
 are
 strong
 is
 a
 self
 uh


self-driving
 taxi
 company
 now
 I'm
 not


sure
 what
 the
 latest
 number
 is
 in
 terms


of
 rides
 per
 week
 where
 where
 are
 you


now
 it's
 uh
 200,000
 rides
 paid
 rides
 so


what
 will
 the
 city
 look
 like
 in
 5
 years


time
 or
 10
 years
 time
 when
 do
 you
 think


it
 would
 be
 properly
 rolled
 out
 well
 I


think
 if
 I
 just
 step
 back
 and
 talk
 a
 bit


about
 wayo
 because
 we
 are
 very
 excited


about
 it
 you
 know
 we
 started
 on
 that


Journey
 more
 than
 a
 decade
 ago
 as
 well


and
 the
 original
 thesis
 is
 that
 more


than
 a
 million
 people
 die
 on
 the
 road


every
 year
 in
 accidents
 and
 if
 AI
 can


help
 improve
 the
 safety
 of
 driving


because
 our
 wayo
 self-
 driver
 the
 AI


does
 not
 get
 tired
 it
 does
 not
 get


distracted
 it
 you
 know
 it
 stays
 focused


on
 the
 road
 you've
 got
 camera
 sensors


everywhere
 we
 can
 improve
 safety
 we
 can


help
 save
 lives
 and
 that
 was
 a
 really


exciting
 motivator
 for
 the
 team
 we've


been
 rolling
 it
 out
 it's
 been


extraordinary
 to
 see
 the
 takeup
 it's
 now


one
 of
 the
 top
 attractions
 in
 San


Francisco
 if
 anyone's
 out
 this
 way
 but


we're
 also
 in
 LA
 in
 Phoenix
 and
 Austin


and
 expanding
 and
 we're
 going
 to


continue
 to
 expand
 because
 you
 see
 both


the
 um
 the
 reaction
 to
 it
 when
 people


get
 in
 some
 people
 are
 anxious
 about
 it


at
 first
 and
 then
 within
 literally
 under


a
 minute
 they
 see
 they
 they
 just
 go


right
 into
 to
 whatever
 it
 is
 they
 wanted


to
 be
 doing
 there's
 a
 safety
 element


around
 it
 uh
 so
 we
 think
 it'll
 continue


to
 be
 rolled
 out
 uh
 we're
 doing
 a
 pilot


in
 Japan
 right
 now
 and
 there's
 an


opportunity
 we
 think
 to
 help
 save
 lives


and
 are
 excited
 about
 doing
 that
 so
 10


years
 from
 now
 who
 is
 going
 to
 own
 a
 car


you
 know
 I
 think
 it's
 too
 early
 to
 call


um
 I
 you
 know
 a
 couple
 of
 reasons
 one


many
 people
 in
 particular
 in
 the
 states


other
 developed
 markets
 own
 more
 than


one
 car
 they're
 good
 reasons
 to
 own
 a


car
 uh
 and
 so
 we'll
 see
 human
 human


nature
 and
 human
 behavior
 changes
 over


time
 the
 other
 is
 that
 weo
 is
 primarily


now
 focused
 on
 what
 are
 these
 Robo
 taxis


as
 you
 described
 it
 but
 it's
 it's


reasonable
 to
 assume
 that
 this


capability
 this
 extraordinary
 technology


can
 also
 be
 an
 assist
 with
 um
 with
 cars


that
 are
 owned
 and
 so
 there
 are
 a
 lot
 of


execution
 paths
 which
 enable
 you
 me


others
 to
 decide
 how
 they
 actually
 want


to
 get
 around
 now
 you're
 also
 the
 chief


investment
 officer
 and
 you
 are
 uh
 in
 a


very
 fortunate
 position
 in
 that
 you
 are


sitting
 on
 roughly
 hundred
 billion


dollars
 and
 you
 have
 all
 these


interesting
 areas
 just
 how
 do
 you


allocate
 Capital
 between
 them
 so
 Capital


allocation
 like
 I
 think
 one
 of
 the
 core


elements
 in
 capital
 allocation
 is
 that


you
 need
 to
 ensure
 that
 you're


continuing
 to
 invest
 aggressively
 for


the
 long
 run
 um
 if
 you
 don't
 invest
 for


the
 long
 run
 you're
 sewing
 the
 seeds
 of


your
 own
 destruction
 and
 that's
 a
 lesson


I've
 seen
 throughout
 my
 career
 over
 and


over
 and
 so
 very
 important
 it's
 been


core
 to
 the
 ethos
 obviously
 of
 this


company
 since
 Inception
 the
 early
 days


there
 was
 a
 a
 a
 kind
 of
 a
 mantra
 which


is
 70
 in
 your
 core
 20%
 adjacent
 10%


moonshots
 and
 that's
 evolved
 over
 time


but
 this
 core
 sense
 of
 you've
 got
 to


continue
 to
 invest
 aggressively
 for
 the


long
 run
 remains
 core
 to
 who
 we
 are
 and


we're
 at
 such
 an
 exciting
 time
 in


history
 given
 the
 opportunity
 with
 AI


you
 know
 both
 on
 the
 consumer
 side
 on


the
 Enterprise
 side
 so
 we're
 certainly


making
 Investments
 there
 I
 end
 up


spending
 a
 lot
 of
 my
 time
 globally


because
 what
 is
 really
 key
 is
 every
 head


of
 state
 is
 saying
 the
 same
 type
 of


thing
 which
 is
 I
 want
 to
 be
 a
 part
 of


this
 digital
 transformation
 it
 is
 key


for
 all
 the
 reasons
 that
 we've
 already


talked
 about
 and
 so
 what
 we
 spend
 time


looking
 at
 is
 as
 we're
 continuing
 to


invest
 in
 our
 technical
 infrastructure


globally
 in
 other
 words
 data
 centers


subc
 cables
 how
 do
 we
 link
 up
 the
 world


the
 the
 the
 opportunity
 is
 how
 do
 we


engage
 more
 deeply
 how
 what
 work
 are
 we


doing
 on
 their
 behalf
 to
 help
 accelerate


their
 digital
 transformation
 how
 do
 we


engage
 on
 the
 public
 C
 side
 and
 so


there's
 a
 really
 global
 view
 to
 this
 now


you
 you
 have
 this
 moonshot
 Factory
 in


house
 what
 are
 the
 type
 of
 things
 you're


working
 on
 there
 so
 the
 moonshot
 factory


as
 it
 was
 lovingly
 named
 years
 ago
 um
 uh


is
 the
 core
 one
 of
 the
 core
 areas
 within


other
 bets
 it's
 called
 X
 and
 out
 of
 X


came
 for
 example
 whmo
 it
 was
 incubated


in
 X
 and
 then
 got
 um
 moved
 out
 to
 become


an
 independent
 uh
 company
 they've
 also


worked
 on
 for
 example
 Wing
 or
 incubated


Wing
 which
 is
 our
 drone
 business
 excited


about
 Wing
 they're
 doing
 work
 as
 an


example
 with
 Walmart
 and
 we're
 seeing
 uh


really
 exciting
 results
 there
 and
 see


the
 upside
 they're
 also
 incub
 they've


been
 incubating
 and
 you'll
 hear
 more


about
 a
 company
 called
 intrinsic
 which


is
 a
 robotics
 um
 operating
 system
 and
 so


they
 have
 a
 number
 of
 different
 things


that
 they've
 been
 working
 on
 I
 think
 one


of
 the
 very
 important
 ele
 elements
 there


is
 that
 when
 um
 they
 are
 approaching
 any


incubation
 their
 mindset
 is
 obviously


you
 can't
 incubate
 everything
 and
 have


it
 work
 well
 and
 so
 kill
 things
 fast
 in


order
 to
 move
 into
 the
 areas
 that
 are


the
 most
 promising
 that
 sounds
 really


fun
 I
 think
 it
 was
 Charlie
 Monger
 who


said
 that
 Google
 appeared
 like
 a
 very


rich


kindergarten
 well
 it's
 we've
 got


everything
 from
 kindergarten
 all
 the
 way


through
 to
 postgraduate


robotics
 now
 you
 mentioned
 um
 uh
 sub


cables
 the
 fact
 that
 you
 also
 do
 subsy


cables
 and
 so
 on
 does
 it
 make
 you
 more


resilient
 you
 think
 as
 a
 tech
 company
 I


think
 there
 are
 a
 lot
 of
 elements
 that


build
 resilience
 and
 one
 of
 the
 are
 one


of
 the
 important
 areas
 is
 continuing
 to


invest
 in
 subc
 cables
 but
 it's
 also
 the


what
 we
 call
 technical
 infrastructure


more
 broadly
 so
 it's
 data
 center


resilience
 data
 center
 redundancy
 so


that
 you
 can
 actually
 be
 positioned
 to


serve
 customers
 when
 and
 where
 needed


and
 in
 the
 event
 of
 something
 that


happens
 and
 things
 unfortunately
 always


seem
 to
 happen
 around
 the
 world
 you've


got
 the
 resilience
 needed
 to
 continue
 to


operate
 at
 a
 high
 level
 it's
 our
 cyber


security
 defenses
 one
 of
 the
 things
 I've


learned
 in
 my
 career
 is
 is
 much
 easier


to
 prevent
 than
 to
 fix
 a
 problem
 and
 so


building
 in
 this
 strength
 upfront
 is
 key


and
 it's
 technical
 infrastructure
 I
 can


I'm
 happy
 to
 talk
 more
 about
 cables


because
 really
 proud
 of
 the
 network
 we


have
 globally
 but
 it's
 the
 other


elements
 like
 a
 zero
 trust
 approach
 on


cyber
 security
 so
 that
 you're
 fortifying


defenses
 in
 a
 world
 that
 is
 continuing


to
 become
 ever
 more
 challenging
 and
 I


think
 that's
 one
 of
 the
 key
 additional


applications
 of
 AI
 that's
 important
 and


how
 do
 you
 look
 at
 these
 additional


challenges
 I
 mean
 we
 are
 seeing
 attacks


on
 subsy
 cables
 we
 are
 seeing
 of
 course


accelerating
 cyber
 attacks
 how
 do
 you


how
 do
 you
 assess
 the
 state
 of
 the
 world


uh
 it's
 better
 to
 remain
 paranoid
 which


we
 do
 and
 build
 in
 resilience
 as
 you


said
 and
 so
 when
 we're
 looking
 at
 our


subc
 cable
 network
 we
 uh
 do
 build
 in


resilience
 to
 have
 alternate
 approaches


we're
 building
 globally
 we've
 been


building
 now
 in
 the
 southern
 hemisphere


as
 well
 um
 when
 we
 build
 cables
 as
 an


example
 one
 of
 the
 things
 that
 has


multiple
 benefits
 is
 we
 will
 build
 what


I
 will
 call
 a
 trunk
 from
 say
 Africa
 to


Australia
 and
 then
 we
 will
 have
 it
 in


chunks
 with
 nodes
 along
 the
 way
 that


builds
 in
 a
 resilience
 for
 the
 cable


itself
 but
 it
 also
 provides
 something


else
 that
 we're
 really
 proud
 of
 it


provides
 the
 ability
 off
 of
 a
 node
 to


light
 up
 island
 nations
 along
 the
 way


oftentimes
 working
 with
 governments
 that


say
 we
 want
 to
 help
 light
 up
 a
 nation


which
 maybe
 Google
 otherwise
 wouldn't
 so


as
 an
 example
 one
 of
 the
 ones
 I'm
 really


proud
 of
 is
 when
 we
 lit
 up
 Fiji
 uh
 and
 I


was
 talking
 about
 this
 at
 the
 Asia


Pacific
 economic
 um
 conference
 and
 we


had
 the
 prime
 minister
 of
 Fiji
 happen
 to


be
 in
 the
 room
 I
 said
 we
 lit
 up
 Fiji
 and


his
 comment
 was
 it
 was
 a
 gift
 to


everyone
 in
 Fiji
 because
 what
 that
 does


is
 link
 them
 to
 all
 the
 opportunities


that
 come
 otherwise
 from
 being
 having


access
 and
 what's
 really
 important
 to


remember
 is
 a
 third
 of
 the
 globe
 still


is
 not
 online
 still
 is
 not
 connected
 so


this
 gives
 us
 that
 added
 ability
 to


provide
 something
 that
 as
 he
 described


is
 an
 economic
 opportunity
 for
 Fiji
 for


generations
 to
 come
 with
 all
 um
 these


tech
 companies
 chasing
 the
 opportunities


here
 do
 you
 think
 tech
 companies
 are
 now


accepting
 lower
 returns
 for
 their


Investments
 well
 I
 think
 that
 at
 this


point
 what
 we're
 all
 looking
 at
 is
 this


theoretical
 economic
 upside
 which


assuming
 it


materializes
 creates
 the
 opportunity
 for


attractive
 returns
 and
 I
 think
 there's
 a


self-calibrating
 element
 to
 the
 pace
 of


investment
 that
 comes
 from
 that
 thesis


now
 when
 I
 said
 you
 know
 20
 trillion


theoretical
 economic
 upside
 globally


it's
 four
 trillion
 in
 the
 us
 alone
 what


is
 it
 require
 to
 get
 that
 you
 know
 it's


not
 applying
 using
 chat
 Bots
 it's


actually
 radically
 rethinking
 every


element
 of
 your
 business
 it's
 how
 do
 you


interact
 with
 with
 customers
 to
 drive


more
 Revenue
 it's
 what
 are
 operating


efficiencies
 in
 the
 business
 it's
 what


are
 risk
 analytics
 thinking
 front
 to


back
 on
 your
 operating
 processes
 because


this
 gives
 you
 an
 opportunity
 to


approach
 them
 differently
 that's
 what


leads
 to
 that
 the
 economic
 upside
 which


then
 drives
 the
 returns
 and
 so
 I
 think


that
 uh
 it's
 we've
 each
 got
 to
 make
 sure


that
 we're
 we're
 calibrating
 as
 we
 go


regarding
 the
 upside
 and
 then
 the
 other


part
 to
 your
 question
 about
 returns
 that


we're
 very
 focused
 on
 and
 others
 are
 as


well
 is
 how
 do
 you
 increase
 the


efficiency
 of
 that
 denominator
 all
 the


capex
 that
 it's
 being
 invested
 and
 so


we're
 approaching
 that
 in
 a
 number
 of


ways
 Sundar
 talked
 about
 it
 the


meaningful
 improvements
 in
 model


efficiency
 the
 meaningful
 improvements


you've
 already
 asked
 about
 in
 tpus
 our


Trillium
 chip
 our
 most
 recent
 chip
 is


about
 67%
 more
 efficient
 than
 the
 prior


one
 so
 we're
 continuing
 to
 drive


efficiency
 in
 the
 cap
 capex
 utilization


while
 also
 trying
 to
 help
 unlock
 um


really
 that
 monetization
 upside
 now


related
 to
 this
 is
 is
 the
 corpor
 culture


and
 how
 you
 structure
 Innovation
 is


there
 a
 particular
 way
 that
 you


structure
 Innovation
 at
 Google
 it's
 been


such
 a
 core
 part
 of
 who
 we
 are
 I
 think


the
 driver
 of
 everything
 that
 we
 do
 and


there
 are
 elements
 of
 it
 that
 are
 about


how
 we
 bring
 in
 bring
 in
 Talent
 and
 and


apply
 them
 to
 explore
 uh
 different


Avenues
 we
 have
 an
 extraordinary


research
 team
 as
 an
 example
 everything


that's
 being
 done
 in
 Google
 deepmind
 the


demises
 leading
 and
 then
 on
 top
 of
 that


we
 have
 efforts
 I
 think
 more
 to
 your


question
 for
 example
 in
 the
 early
 days


of
 Google
 there
 was
 something
 called


Google
 Labs
 small
 Scrappy
 teams
 and
 told


go
 find
 something
 and
 Sundar


reconstituted
 that
 a
 couple
 of
 years
 ago


and
 you've
 seen
 already
 a
 number
 of


really
 exciting
 things
 come
 out
 of
 a


small
 Scrappy
 f
 focused
 empowered
 team


so
 for
 example
 hopefully
 you
 and
 others


listening
 have
 used
 notebook
 LM
 it's
 one


of
 my
 favorite
 it's
 the
 opportunity
 to


take
 your
 own
 your
 content
 speeches


you're
 interested
 in
 anything
 you're


interested
 in
 ingested
 into
 notebook
 LM


it
 can
 give
 you
 some
 of
 the
 information


that
 you
 need
 but
 you
 can
 also
 listen
 to


it
 as
 an
 AI
 podcast
 that
 can
 make
 things


sort
 of
 more
 accessible
 maybe
 within
 an


Enterprise
 or
 I've
 talked
 to
 some
 people


in
 the
 public
 sector
 and
 their
 wow


moment
 was
 wow
 you
 mean
 I
 can
 take
 all


these
 things
 that
 we
 publish
 that
 people


probably
 don't
 read
 and
 make
 it
 easier


for
 them
 to
 ingest
 the
 information
 the


answer
 is
 yes
 it
 was
 the
 time
 Innovation


product
 innovation
 of
 the
 year
 last
 year


and
 that's
 an
 example
 of
 something
 that


came
 out
 of
 of
 lab
 so
 we're
 continuing


to
 add-
 on
 in
 a
 lot
 of
 different
 ways
 to


make
 sure
 we're
 inspiring
 people
 to


dream
 big
 and
 think
 big
 but
 if
 I
 walk


around
 at
 Google
 and
 let's
 say
 now
 you


took
 down
 all
 the
 Google
 signs
 I
 mean


you
 got
 a
 Google
 sign
 behind
 you
 right


you
 take
 away
 all
 the
 G's
 all
 the
 Google


signs
 just
 how
 would
 I
 how
 would
 I
 know


that
 I
 was
 in
 Google
 how
 do
 you
 do
 you


relate
 to
 each
 other
 in
 a
 different
 way


do
 you
 talk
 to
 each
 other
 in
 a
 different


way
 do
 you
 behave
 in
 a
 different
 way


compared
 to
 the
 other
 tech
 companies
 I


have
 so
 many
 different
 ways
 to
 answer


that
 when
 I
 when
 I
 first
 got
 here
 I
 saw


how
 different
 it
 was
 in
 the
 way
 we


worked
 and
 granted
 I
 was
 coming
 from
 a


financial
 institution
 not
 another
 tech


company
 but
 it's
 literally
 embedded
 in


the
 technology
 that
 we
 use
 so
 it
 just


starts
 right
 from
 square
 one
 with
 Google


Docs
 collaborative
 docs
 every
 every
 way


we're
 constantly
 interacting
 and
 it
 just


adds
 a
 velocity
 to
 the
 work
 that
 you
 do


U
 right
 across
 the
 street
 from
 me
 here


we
 have
 a
 wonderful
 building
 that
 we
 we


put
 up


recently
 uh
 that
 that
 is
 where
 our
 our


AI
 team
 gdm
 Google
 be
 mind
 team
 is


operating
 you
 just
 see
 people
 constantly


coming
 together
 in
 ways
 that
 are
 exactly


what
 the
 founders
 talked
 about
 at


Inception
 it's
 about
 serendipity
 and
 the


joy
 that
 comes
 from
 that
 but
 then
 it
 is


in
 the
 mindset
 that
 goes
 through
 our


people
 Ops
 and
 our
 workplace
 Services


teams
 to
 have
 s
 dipity
 in
 a
 lot
 of


places
 so
 that
 people
 do
 congregate
 and


exchange
 ideas
 but
 I
 think
 the
 core


point
 is
 it's
 the
 ethos
 from
 the
 people


come
 in
 there's
 a
 high
 bar
 that's
 set
 we


want
 to
 make
 the
 maximum
 difference
 to


humanity
 that's
 what
 we
 talk
 about
 a
 lot


it's
 you
 know
 I
 I'll
 give
 you
 one
 more


Demus
 story
 um
 when
 he
 was
 embarking
 on


Alpha
 fold
 and
 the
 concept
 of
 predicting


the
 protein
 structure
 for
 every
 protein


known
 to
 humanity
 previously
 it
 would


take
 a
 year
 or
 two
 just
 to
 do
 one
 he


wanted
 to
 do
 all
 200
 million
 it
 was
 one


of
 the
 grand
 challenges
 that
 had
 been


out
 there
 for
 a
 long
 time
 and
 some


scientists
 said
 how
 could
 this
 be


possible
 and
 his
 answer
 was
 why
 not
 and


that
 ethos
 that
 why
 not
 is
 a
 large
 part


of
 how
 I
 answer
 your
 question
 and
 you


hear
 it
 in
 meetings
 it's
 like
 why
 not


take
 it
 on
 so
 that
 to
 me
 is
 is
 the


explainer
 so
 um
 tell
 me
 about
 a
 time


recently
 when
 you
 learned
 something


about
 a
 project
 and
 you
 just
 thought
 wow


this
 is
 just
 like
 way
 cool
 or
 does
 it


happen
 all
 the
 time
 it
 does
 frankly


that's
 why
 I'm
 like
 where
 do
 I
 go
 you


know
 it's
 um
 you
 know
 when
 I
 saw


notebook
 LM
 I'm
 like
 wow
 this
 is
 really


amazing
 though
 the
 ability
 and
 starting


to
 think
 about
 what
 are
 all
 the


applications
 I
 remember
 calling
 the
 guy


who
 runs
 Google
 Labs
 is
 extraordinary


and
 I
 said
 if
 I'm
 if
 I'm
 running
 a


government
 can
 I
 ingest
 report
 from


across
 agencies
 and
 see
 where
 their


inconsistencies
 he's
 like
 why
 not
 yes


I'm
 going
 back
 to
 the
 why
 not
 Point
 uh


so
 that's
 really
 exciting
 uh
 you
 know
 a


little
 further
 back
 this
 was
 years
 ago


actually
 but
 we
 now
 have
 20
 billion


searches
 a
 month
 using
 your
 camera
 with


Google
 Lens
 if
 I
 want
 your
 shirt
 you


know
 I
 can
 take
 a
 photo
 of
 it
 and
 then
 I


can
 find
 where
 to
 buy
 it
 and
 priced
 and


everything
 else
 or
 I
 can
 I
 do
 with
 other


things
 like
 art
 who's
 that
 artist
 I


still
 get
 an
 ohow
 moment
 from
 that
 I


ride
 Whos
 all
 the
 time
 in
 San
 Francisco


and
 you
 know
 I
 always
 tell
 people
 when


I'm
 in
 the
 car
 watch
 the
 left
 turn


because
 the
 left
 turn
 that's
 like
 that's


really
 that's
 pretty
 cool
 and
 gives
 you


a
 sense
 of
 what
 the
 engineers
 have


accomplished
 so
 I
 think
 the
 awe
 of
 what


the
 team
 continues
 to
 do
 is
 there


constantly
 and
 then
 and
 then
 there
 are


the
 human
 moments
 like
 I
 am
 completely


in
 awe
 of
 what
 we're
 able
 to
 do
 with


Healthcare
 and
 you
 because
 you
 had
 you


had
 breast
 cancer
 right
 exactly
 had


breast
 cancer
 twice
 actually
 and


Google
 the
 amazing
 Engineers
 identified


um
 the
 opportunity
 to
 diagnose
 early


stage
 metastatic
 breast


cancer
 and
 what's
 extraordinary
 is
 in


the
 testing
 of
 it
 they
 found
 that


relative
 to
 the
 80,000
 sample
 set
 they


found
 20%
 more
 cases
 more
 incidences
 of


cancer
 and
 no
 false
 positives
 and
 as
 we


all
 know
 the
 difference
 between
 survival


or
 not
 or
 a
 really
 difficult
 course
 of


treatment
 at
 stage
 four
 versus
 two
 is


really
 meaningful
 and
 so
 the
 ability
 I


still
 have
 a
 wow
 moment
 with
 that
 that


we
 with
 AI
 and
 with
 breakthroughs
 like


that
 can
 give
 people
 the
 opportunity
 for


the
 early
 diagnosis
 that's
 needed
 and


what's
 really
 important
 in
 discussing


this
 with
 my
 oncologist
 he
 said
 what
 it


does
 is
 it
 enables
 any
 doctor
 anywhere


across
 the
 us
 around
 the
 globe
 to
 be


operating
 at
 the
 highest
 level
 because


they
 have
 this
 this
 assist
 this


augmented
 intelligence
 to
 me
 that


becomes
 an
 extraordinary
 wow
 moment
 when


you
 think
 about
 what
 we
 can
 do
 and
 we're


doing
 it
 not
 just
 in
 breast
 cancer


there's
 early
 diagnosis
 in
 lung
 cancer


in
 something
 called
 diabetic
 retinopathy


which
 is
 Blindness
 from
 diabetes
 and
 in


that
 instance
 early
 detection
 leads
 to


early
 intervention
 that's
 manageable


around
 the
 globe
 many
 places
 you
 know


early
 detection
 isn't
 the
 Panacea
 it's


not
 an
 answer
 it's
 an
 assist
 but
 then


you
 need
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 treatment
 as


well
 so
 there
 are
 a
 lot
 of
 wow
 moments


that
 come
 um
 and
 I
 think
 it
 goes
 back
 to


the
 importance
 of
 each
 of
 us
 asking
 how


can
 we
 apply
 it
 well
 thanks
 for
 sharing


that
 now
 how
 has
 the
 culture
 de
 evolved


during
 the
 during
 your
 time
 at
 Google


you
 know
 when
 I
 got
 here
 I
 think
 the
 one


of
 the
 first
 questions
 I
 asked
 because
 I


I've
 always
 believed
 that
 culture
 is


more
 important
 than
 rules
 regulations


coming
 from
 a
 regulated
 Financial


Services
 environment
 it's
 such
 an


important
 explainer
 and
 so
 I
 that's


where
 I
 spent
 some
 of
 my
 early
 time


asking
 people
 so
 how
 do
 you
 define
 the


culture
 and
 I
 do
 think
 it
 comes
 back
 to


inquisitive
 people
 who
 are
 who
 believe


that
 with
 technology
 we
 can
 have
 a


positive
 impact
 on
 Humanity
 it's
 not
 a


Panacea
 but
 we're
 technology
 optimists


we
 always
 we
 often
 use
 that
 phrase
 and


you
 know
 it
 goes
 back
 to
 deus's
 comment


I
 want
 to
 take
 on
 the
 most
 intractable


problems
 in
 society
 that's
 very
 much
 the


ethos
 of
 the
 founders
 of
 what
 sundar's


been
 pushing
 and
 it's
 what
 I've
 seen


throughout
 and
 I
 think
 it's
 what
 is


inspiring
 um
 for
 a
 lot
 of
 what
 we've


done
 and
 I've
 seen


the
 application
 of
 it
 so
 when
 I
 got
 here


as
 a
 former
 Banker
 I
 was
 very
 excited
 to


look
 under
 the
 hood
 and
 see
 so
 what


really
 are
 the
 numbers
 the
 Mantra
 as
 you


may
 recall
 back
 in
 2015
 when
 I
 arrived


was
 the
 desktop
 is
 dead
 can
 Google


actually
 make
 the
 transition
 to
 mobile


and
 who
 knows
 about
 YouTube
 and
 it
 was


sort
 of
 we've
 been
 sort
 of
 sliding
 for
 a


bit
 and
 obviously
 history
 has


shown
 the
 application
 of
 Solutions
 on


mobile


has
 been
 it's
 been
 a
 pretty
 wonderful


decade
 and
 it's
 that
 intense
 focus
 on


Innovation
 and
 providing
 better
 ways
 for


advertisers
 for
 people
 around
 the
 globe


to
 use
 mobile
 get
 what
 they
 want
 access


how
 and
 where
 they
 it's
 this
 Innovation


cycle
 that
 we've
 continued
 to
 see
 and
 so


I
 got
 here
 2015
 the
 market
 cap
 was
 400


billion
 it's
 now
 north
 of
 two
 trillion


and
 I
 think
 to
 that
 questioning
 back


then
 um
 and
 yet
 the
 whole
 series
 of


innovation
 that
 we've
 seen
 since
 then


and
 that
 is
 the
 evolution
 and
 it's
 been


this
 recurring
 let's
 keep
 pushing
 it
 and


there's
 another
 really
 important
 element


and
 I
 think
 it's
 two
 sides
 of
 the
 same


coin
 which
 is
 there's
 an
 incredible


humility
 here
 a
 sense
 every
 year
 that


this
 is
 the
 last
 great
 year
 and
 that


started
 the
 moment
 I
 got
 here
 and
 I


remember
 as
 I
 was
 listening
 to
 the


stories
 like
 well
 they're
 all
 these


headwinds
 they're
 always
 headwinds
 and


so
 that
 humility
 I
 think
 inspires
 people


to
 push
 higher
 on
 for
 themselves
 and


their
 team
 and
 try
 and
 figure
 out
 what


else
 can
 we
 do
 um
 and
 that's
 been
 an


ethos
 I
 think
 search
 for
 Innovation


coupled
 with
 humility
 how
 do
 you
 install


humility
 in
 an
 organization
 it
 starts


from
 the
 tone
 from
 the
 top
 I
 mean
 if
 you


look
 at
 Sundar
 as
 a
 leader
 he
 brings


this
 um
 integrity
 and
 Ethos
 about
 him


and
 that's
 the


expectation
 uh
 I
 think
 for
 the
 entire


team
 we
 are
 privileged
 to
 be
 at
 this


moment
 in
 history
 with
 the
 opportunity


set
 that
 we've
 talked
 about
 and
 we


better
 approach
 it


responsibly
 and
 boldly
 to
 have
 the
 right


to
 continue
 to
 execute
 in
 the
 way
 that


we
 are
 I
 think
 it's
 it's
 got
 to
 come


tone
 from
 the
 top
 do
 you
 think
 it
 makes


a
 difference
 that
 the
 founders
 are
 still


around
 well
 I
 think
 it's
 been
 you
 know


Sergey
 in
 particular
 um
 at
 the
 couple


years
 ago
 as
 the
 team
 was
 pushing
 forth


on
 on
 Gemini
 uh
 was
 very
 engaged
 and


back
 in


uh
 sitting
 with
 them
 and
 he
 made
 a


comment
 that
 this
 is
 the
 most
 exciting


time
 in
 computer
 science
 that
 we
 had


only
 just
 scratched
 the
 surface


previously
 and
 when
 you
 think
 Google's


done
 pretty
 well
 like
 when
 he
 first
 said


that
 to
 me
 I
 got
 chills
 because
 I
 think


about
 how
 much
 has
 been
 accomplished
 by


Google
 but
 that
 level
 of
 excitement
 and


the
 magic
 of
 what's
 to
 come
 you
 know
 has


to
 be
 infectious
 um
 for
 every
 one
 and
 so


it's
 been
 yeah
 it's
 been
 a
 joy
 I
 just


saw
 him
 um
 uh
 in
 an
 interview
 saying


that
 uh
 60
 hour
 work
 during
 the
 week
 is


perfect
 that's
 where
 you
 have
 your


optimal
 production
 and
 Innovation
 and


creativity
 so
 he's
 yes
 he's
 certainly


motivated
 and
 uh
 as
 I
 said
 he's
 vieing


this
 is
 the
 most
 exciting
 time
 in


computer
 science
 I
 think
 that
 when
 you


look
 at
 uh
 the
 that
 building
 over
 there


that
 I
 described
 with
 uh
 the
 Google


deepmind
 team
 team
 and
 the
 effort


everyone's
 focused
 in
 it
 people
 are


working
 because
 they're
 getting
 a
 real


charge
 out
 of
 what
 they're
 doing
 and
 you


don't
 need
 to
 tell
 you
 or
 me
 how
 many


hours
 to
 work
 you
 know
 there's
 a
 joy


that
 comes
 from
 it
 you
 know
 at
 at
 Google


we're
 still
 um
 of
 the
 view
 that
 the
 way


we
 get
 the
 best
 outcome
 is
 we
 want


people
 in
 three
 days
 or
 more
 a
 week
 and


teams
 can
 figure
 out
 what
 works
 best
 for


them
 to
 get
 maximum
 kind
 of
 Maximum


productivity
 progress
 who
 do
 you
 hire


really
 smart
 people


and
 uh
 it's
 a
 it
 remains
 a
 a
 rigorous


process
 the
 number
 of
 applicants
 remains


you
 know


daunting
 um
 I
 think
 that
 depending
 on


the
 area
 you
 know
 there's
 there's
 a
 mix


of
 um
 I
 you
 know
 what
 I
 would
 say
 what
 I


would
 look
 for
 is
 a
 mix
 of
 those
 people


who
 um
 come
 with
 what
 I
 will
 call


pattern
 recognition
 the
 experience
 that


gives
 you
 a
 sense
 that
 of
 predicting


what's
 going
 to
 come
 from
 here
 or
 very


specific
 domain
 expertise
 but
 then


evidence
 uh
 high
 performance
 and


creativity
 pushing
 themselves
 achieving


achieving
 remarkable
 things
 along
 the


way
 talking
 of
 which
 uh
 Ruth
 you've
 uh


achieved
 remarkable
 things
 uh
 and
 you


worked
 in
 Morgan
 Stanley
 before
 you


before
 you
 joined
 Google
 uh
 and
 you
 were


there
 during
 the
 financial
 crisis
 and
 uh


uh
 did
 a
 did
 an
 incredible
 job
 what
 did


you
 what
 did
 you
 learn
 from
 the


financial
 crisis
 because
 you
 were
 really


involved
 at
 the
 very
 top
 yeah
 I
 learned


a
 I
 learned
 a
 lot
 at
 the
 the
 time
 I
 was


running
 the
 financial
 institutions
 Group


which
 meant
 responsible
 for
 banks


insurance
 companies
 Asset
 Management
 I


was
 on
 the
 investment
 banking
 side
 and


one
 of
 the
 most
 privileged
 times
 in
 my


career
 is
 when
 secretary
 Hank
 pulson


Secretary
 of
 the
 Treasury
 gon
 said
 he


wanted
 a
 team
 to
 basically
 be
 Sanda
 down


um
 at
 US
 Treasury
 and
 initially
 we
 went


I
 went
 down
 in
 in
 July
 of'
 08
 to
 focus


on
 the
 housing
 crisis
 Fanny
 May
 Freddy


Mack
 and
 to
 try
 and
 understand


understand
 and
 diagnose
 what
 could
 be
 a


trigger
 for
 what
 we
 would
 call
 a
 run
 on


the
 bank
 run
 on
 on
 agencies
 so
 we
 went


through
 Fanny
 May
 Freddy
 Mack
 with
 him


and
 then
 I
 led
 the
 group
 that
 went
 um


through
 the
 AIG
 crisis
 as
 well
 and
 then


onward
 and
 there
 were
 a
 lot
 of
 really


important
 lessons
 that
 came
 out
 of
 it


and
 when
 I
 got
 to
 Google
 I
 was
 asked


about
 them
 which
 struck
 me
 as
 a
 bit
 odd


because
 Google
 had
 only
 seen
 sunny
 days


and
 I
 think
 really
 importantly
 the


lessons
 are
 good
 for
 good
 times
 and
 bad


and
 for
 said
 it
 is
 easier
 to
 to
 fortify


oneself
 ahead
 of
 an
 issue
 to
 prevent


than
 to
 deal
 with
 it
 in
 the
 moment
 the


first
 most
 the
 most
 important
 lesson


from
 the
 crisis
 is
 to
 identify
 your


greatest
 source
 of
 vulnerability
 ahead


of
 time
 and
 protect
 against
 it
 so
 for


financial
 institutions
 that
 would
 be


liquidity
 without
 liquidity
 nothing
 you


couldn't
 operate
 and
 in
 that
 moment
 in


that
 September
 October
 2008
 moment
 you


couldn't
 procure
 liquidity
 durable


liquidity
 if
 you
 tried
 and
 we
 did
 and


you
 couldn't
 um
 but
 six
 months
 prior
 you


could
 have
 and
 I
 think
 a
 really


important
 lesson
 for
 everyone
 is
 do
 that


question
 what
 is
 your
 greatest
 source
 of


vulnerability
 you
 can
 protect
 against
 it


early
 on
 but
 not
 in
 the
 moment
 the


second
 really
 came
 out
 of
 AIG
 as
 we
 now


all
 know
 the
 crisis
 in
 AIG
 really


started
 because
 of
 the
 derivative
 sub
 in


the
 UK
 not
 the
 op
 not
 the
 insurance


operation
 and
 the
 problem
 was
 there


wasn't
 visibility
 about
 the
 risk
 that


was
 being
 taken
 on
 by
 the
 derivative
 sub


and
 so
 the
 metaphor
 that
 I've
 used
 since


then
 is
 you
 would
 not
 drive
 a
 car
 with


mud
 on
 the
 windshield
 you
 cannot
 run
 a


business
 or
 a
 country
 with
 mud
 on
 the


windshield
 use
 data
 and
 analytics
 to


clear
 away
 that
 mud
 and
 then
 you
 can


actually
 go
 faster
 because
 you're
 taking


calculated
 risk
 you're
 taking
 swor
 risk


I
 think
 the
 other
 really
 important


lesson
 uh
 was
 that
 there
 are
 no
 good


choices
 in
 a
 crisis
 and
 so
 go
 for
 the


least
 worst
 and
 just
 keep
 moving
 because


standing
 still
 can
 actually
 just
 amplify


magnify
 and
 you're
 not
 going
 to
 end
 up


with
 a
 good
 solution
 in
 any
 event
 by


definition
 you're
 in
 a
 crisis
 say


actually
 the
 last
 one
 is
 make
 sure
 you


have
 a
 team
 with
 horizontal
 Vision


because
 you
 got
 to
 connect
 the
 dots


across
 a
 lot
 of
 different
 issues
 it's
 a


lot
 of
 wisdom
 here
 now
 how
 do
 you


protect
 the
 Google
 against
 future


vulnerability
 so
 I
 asked
 myself
 that
 I


then
 said
 okay
 I
 need
 to
 apply
 those


same
 rules
 here
 I
 think
 the
 greatest


source
 of


vulnerability
 for
 us
 and
 frankly
 really


across
 Industries
 is
 around
 Innovation


and
 long-term


investing
 and
 notably
 when
 you
 come
 to


campus
 um
 you
 will
 see
 that
 Larry
 and


Sergey
 put
 a
 dinosaur
 on
 our
 campus
 that


it's
 name
 Stan
 to
 remind
 us
 every
 day


that
 if
 we
 don't
 innovate
 we
 too
 can


become
 dinosaurs
 and
 I
 think
 it's
 really


important
 to


maintain
 um
 efforts
 like
 what
 sunar
 did


with
 Labs
 Google
 Labs
 other
 things
 that


are
 continual
 Catalyst
 to
 continue
 to


really
 SP
 spur
 small
 teams
 to
 think
 big


and
 and
 also
 from
 a
 capital
 allocation


perspective
 to
 make
 sure
 you're


investing
 for
 long-term
 long-term
 growth


talking
 a
 bit
 about
 the
 personal
 growth


you
 worked
 with
 what
 is
 called
 the


trillion
 dollar
 coach
 Bill


Campbell
 who
 has
 uh
 well
 worked
 with
 a


lot
 of
 in
 successful
 people
 but
 how
 did


you
 how
 did
 you
 end
 up
 working
 with
 him


and
 just
 what
 did
 you
 learn
 from
 him
 so


when
 I
 was
 at
 Morgan


Stanley
 I've
 always
 had
 this
 view
 in


life
 that
 I
 should
 ask
 what's
 my
 highest


and
 best
 use
 and
 keep
 learning
 and
 I


loved
 being
 CFO
 with
 James
 Gorman
 he
 was


an
 absolutely
 extraordinary
 CEO
 I
 joined


him
 as
 his
 CFO
 the
 day
 he
 began
 as
 C
 we


we
 we've
 had
 him
 on
 the
 podcast
 and
 I


fully
 agree
 extraordinary
 person
 EX
 so
 I


started
 his
 his
 CFO
 January
 1st
 2010
 the


day
 he
 started
 as
 CEO
 but
 after
 about


five
 years
 I
 thought
 you
 know
 I
 feel


like
 I'm
 plateauing
 here
 and
 I'm


wondering
 what
 my
 next
 chapter
 is
 and
 as


you
 said
 Bill
 Campbell
 is
 um
 one
 of
 the


most
 extraordinary
 people
 that
 anyone


could
 meet
 trillion
 dollar
 coach
 because


he
 had
 coached
 Steve
 Jobs
 and
 Larry
 and


Sergey
 um
 and
 I
 sat
 down
 with
 him
 and


said
 I
 don't
 know
 what
 my
 next
 chapter


should
 be
 and
 I'd
 love
 to
 get
 your


thinking
 about
 it
 I
 was
 out
 at
 a


Stanford
 board
 meeting
 where
 I'd
 served


for
 years
 and
 so
 got
 together
 at
 his


house
 and
 we
 spent
 a
 couple
 hours


together
 and
 he
 started
 by
 saying
 so
 the


one
 thing
 you
 know
 is
 you
 won't
 leave


Morgan
 Stanley
 as
 CFO
 to
 be
 CFO
 anywhere


else
 and
 I'm
 like
 that's
 the
 only
 thing


I
 know
 but
 what's
 the
 next
 chapter
 and


at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 two
 hours
 he
 said
 I


have
 the
 perfect
 role
 for
 you
 CFO
 of


Google
 we
 both
 sort
 of
 laughed
 because
 I


had
 been
 so
 adamant
 the
 one
 thing
 I


wouldn't
 do
 was
 be
 CFO
 again
 I'm
 like
 if


it's
 Google
 of
 course
 I
 had
 run
 Tech


banking
 at
 Morgan
 Stanley
 involved
 with


the
 Google
 IPO
 loved
 Google
 for
 years


and
 um
 so
 that's
 how
 I
 ended
 up
 here
 and


then
 he
 was
 always
 an
 adviser
 who
 was


here
 on


campus
 and
 just
 the
 wise
 Voice


who
 um
 was
 blunt
 and
 clear
 and
 when


something
 didn't
 make
 sense
 you
 know
 he


was
 famous
 for
 saying
 kind
 of
 throwing


the
 flag
 on
 the
 field
 um
 and
 just
 truly


brought
 out
 the
 best
 in
 everyone
 made


told
 each
 of
 us
 make
 sure
 you
 always


have
 that
 human
 connection
 and
 then
 go


into
 the
 business
 item
 he
 tragically


passed
 away
 with
 cancer
 shortly
 after
 I


arrived
 uh
 but
 it
 was
 a
 he
 is
 a
 gift


that
 is
 a
 gift
 that
 keeps
 giving
 do
 you


Mentor
 people
 yes
 what's
 the
 key
 to
 good


mentorship
 well
 I
 think
 you
 know
 when


I
 when
 you
 asked
 that
 question
 I


immediately
 thought
 of
 one
 of
 the
 most


important
 discussions
 I
 had
 with
 someone


who
 ended
 up
 becoming
 with
 a
 mentor


sponsor
 uh
 a
 key
 person
 in
 my
 career
 and


it
 was
 back
 in


1996
 and
 I
 was
 asked
 to
 uh
 lead


technology
 Equity
 Capital
 markets
 the


part
 within
 a
 bank
 that's
 between


Banking
 and
 sales
 and
 trading
 that


really
 launches
 IPOs
 and
 this
 was
 right


at
 the
 beginning
 of
 the
 whole
 internet


run
 of
 IPOs
 there
 were
 not
 very
 many


women
 on
 the
 trading
 floor
 and
 the
 guy


who
 ran
 institutional
 equities
 called
 me


into
 his
 office
 and
 he
 said
 I
 think


you're
 going
 to
 soar
 but
 if
 you
 stumble


I'm
 here
 I
 will
 back
 stop
 you
 I
 am
 your


senior
 air
 cover
 and
 what
 really
 struck


me
 is
 that
 we
 all
 need
 senior
 air
 cover


and
 we
 all
 need
 to
 be
 senior
 air
 cover


for
 someone
 and
 what
 he
 was
 saying
 is
 I


know
 you're
 going
 to
 run
 far
 and
 you're


going
 to
 run
 hard
 and
 but
 I'm
 here
 if


there's
 ever
 an
 issue
 if
 you
 need
 me
 for


something
 something
 and
 so
 for
 me
 on


people
 who
 work
 hard
 for
 me
 and
 I
 see


this
 is
 a
 star
 who
 needs
 to
 be
 sort
 of


unleash
 to
 run
 to
 to
 soar
 um
 I
 try
 and


give
 them
 the
 advice
 that
 I
 think
 has


served
 me
 best
 throughout
 my
 career
 and


it's
 about
 continuing
 to
 learn
 and
 have


that
 senior
 air
 cover
 and
 really
 apply


data
 and
 Analysis
 to
 everything
 you
 do


and
 I
 just
 keep
 coming
 back
 to
 those


rules
 in
 particular
 I
 think
 it's
 so


important
 we
 each
 have
 SE
 air
 cover
 and


our
 senior
 air
 cover
 did
 you
 have
 a
 need


air
 cover
 you
 know
 there
 was
 I
 was
 I've


reflected
 on
 did
 I
 actually
 run
 into


issues
 there
 were
 small
 ones
 there


wasn't
 a
 crisis
 moment
 where
 I
 needed
 to


go
 to
 him
 but
 the
 insurance
 policy
 of


knowing
 he
 was
 there
 and
 the
 message


that
 he
 said
 I
 know
 you'll
 soar
 but
 I'm


here
 to
 back
 stop
 you
 in
 case
 there's
 an


issue
 is
 actually
 a
 real
 Catalyst
 it's


empowering
 you
 mentioned
 um
 the
 need
 and


wish
 to
 continue
 to
 learn
 what
 are
 you


what
 are
 you
 most
 exciting
 about


learning
 now
 well
 there's
 there's
 a


there's
 so
 much
 when
 I
 talk
 about
 AI
 in


this
 moment
 and
 the
 conversations
 I'm


having
 globally
 about
 the
 economic

 the
 real
 question
 is
 what
 does
 it


mean
 to
 radically
 rethink
 your
 business


or
 radically
 rethink
 the
 way
 you
 run
 the


public
 sector
 you
 know
 I've
 had
 quite
 a


number
 at
 this
 point
 of
 public
 sector


leaders
 Finance
 minist
 who
 said
 I'm
 not


going
 to
 get
 more
 budget
 how
 do
 I
 get


more
 out
 of
 my
 budget
 and
 really
 trying


to
 get
 drill
 into
 what
 can
 we
 do
 that


makes
 a
 difference
 how
 can
 we
 be


specific
 so
 for
 example
 one
 of
 my


favorite
 in
 the
 state
 of
 Minnesota
 they


wanted
 to
 do
 a
 better
 job
 delivering


services
 to
 their
 constituents
 and
 they


came
 to
 us
 and
 said
 um
 we
 can
 you
 help


us
 in
 four
 of
 our
 critical
 we
 have
 four


critical
 languages
 in
 Minnesota
 we
 said


of
 course
 Google
 translate
 250
 languages


no
 problem
 there
 we're
 going
 to
 help
 you


rethink
 how
 you
 engage
 within
 six
 months


they
 came
 back
 and
 they
 said
 actually
 we


need
 another
 26
 languages
 now
 that


Minesota
 experience
 for
 me
 can
 be


repeated
 over
 and
 over
 around
 the
 globe


like
 how
 do
 you
 interact
 better
 with


customers
 constituents
 but
 there's
 more


to
 it
 about
 efficiency
 unlock
 so
 I
 I'm


just
 a
 I
 think
 we're
 at
 this
 very
 early


stage
 of
 something
 that's
 huge
 and


possible
 and
 excited
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 I


understand
 how
 does
 it
 actually
 work
 and


what
 are
 the
 implications
 how
 do
 you


relax


um
 I
 love
 what
 I
 do
 so
 that's
 source
 of


relaxation
 and
 then
 beyond
 that
 you
 know


there's
 the
 biggest
 Joy
 is
 family
 and


kids
 U
 taking
 hikes
 with
 my
 kids
 I've


got
 a
 book
 club
 with
 my
 kids
 comparing


notes
 on
 books
 had
 dinner
 with
 one
 of
 my


kids
 last
 night
 it's
 um
 everything
 that


we
 can
 do
 together
 travel
 explore
 new


places
 um
 and
 I
 work
 out
 last
 question


so
 we
 both
 went
 to
 Wharton
 and
 if
 you


were
 giving
 the
 commencement


speech
 which
 I'm
 actually
 doing
 in
 May


uh
 what
 would
 you
 be
 telling
 The


Graduate
 students
 you
 know
 I
 actually


did
 do
 that
 a
 number
 of
 years
 ago
 and


what
 would
 you
 tell
 them
 now
 I
 mean
 have


you
 changed
 your
 mind
 probably
 not


because
 I
 think
 the
 core
 principles
 for


me
 never
 stop
 learning
 my
 father
 was
 a


holocaust
 Refugee
 he
 had
 no
 high
 school


or
 college
 education
 he
 ended
 up
 up


enlisting
 in
 the
 British
 Army
 and
 he


fought
 in
 the
 two
 battles
 of
 aliman
 and


he
 taught
 himself
 engineering
 and


physics
 because
 he
 knew
 or
 he
 assumed


that
 if
 he
 survived
 he
 wanted
 to
 get
 to


a
 place
 that
 was
 safe
 and
 he
 needed
 a


skill
 that
 people
 would
 value
 and
 he


thought
 engineering
 and
 physics
 would
 be


that
 skill
 and
 as
 a
 child
 he
 always
 told


me
 that
 his
 fellow
 soldiers
 would
 tease


him
 and
 say
 you're
 going
 to
 be
 dead


before
 you
 can
 ever
 use
 this
 and
 he


would
 say
 I'd
 rather
 die
 an
 educated
 man


and
 then
 the
 lesson
 for
 me
 as
 a
 child
 my


siblings
 was
 education
 as
 a
 passport
 for


life
 and
 I
 firmly
 believe
 that
 and
 I


think
 that
 one
 of
 the
 most
 important


things
 is
 never
 stop
 learning
 so
 that's


why
 I
 said
 when
 I
 found
 myself
 plateau


in
 my
 career
 I
 would
 go
 to
 somebody
 I


respected
 and
 say
 what
 is
 my
 highest
 and


best
 use
 and
 I
 was
 open
 to
 change
 and


continuing
 to
 grow
 I
 think
 that's
 one


really
 important
 one
 the
 other
 is
 Anchor


everything
 everything
 in
 data
 at
 Wharton


you
 clearly
 get
 great
 analytical
 skills


a
 lot
 of
 other
 places
 as
 well
 you
 can


argue
 with
 me
 in
 my
 approach
 to


something
 but
 you
 can't
 argue
 with
 data


and
 I
 always
 say
 don't
 give
 me
 flat
 data


put
 it
 into
 a
 sensitivity
 analysis
 so


that
 we
 can
 debate
 your
 assumptions


about
 the
 state
 of
 the
 world
 growth


rates
 how
 much
 do
 I
 need
 to
 invest
 let


me
 engage
 you
 with
 the
 data
 and
 that


should
 be
 the
 basis
 for
 the
 argument
 and


then
 the
 other
 thing
 I
 believe
 I
 told


them
 and
 I
 believe
 it
 is
 today
 as
 I
 did


then
 is
 Embrace
 Life
 as
 it
 comes
 don't


defer
 to
 a
 later
 time
 something
 which


you
 can
 do
 now
 because
 as
 I
 saw
 with


cancer
 you
 don't
 know
 if
 you're
 gonna


have
 that
 later
 time
 unfortunately
 that


was
 20
 years
 ago
 and
 I'm
 fine
 but
 in
 the


moment
 I
 didn't
 know
 but
 I
 was
 grateful


my
 bucket
 list
 wasn't
 very
 long
 I
 had


done
 what
 I
 wanted
 been
 married
 to
 the


same
 guy
 for
 many
 many
 decades
 have


three
 amazing
 kids
 I
 Professional
 Care
 I


wanted
 don't
 put
 it
 off
 because
 life


doesn't
 actually
 stick
 to
 your
 predes


predefined
 schedule
 well
 Ru

 uh
 uh


really
 motivational
 and
 beautiful
 place
