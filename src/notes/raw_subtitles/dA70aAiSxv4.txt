LA
 in
 a
 lot
 of
 ways
 is
 is
 sort
 of
 you


you
 could
 describe
 it
 as
 like
 it's
 the


ar
 ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar


ar ar ar ar ar ar ar archetypal
 American


city.
 Here's
 the
 larger
 significance
 of


Once
 Upon
 a
 Time
 in
 Hollywood
 or
 my
 view


of
 it,
 which
 is
 it
 captures
 a
 time
 and


place
 that
 was
 absolutely
 critical
 to


the
 evolution
 of
 modern
 America.


>> The
 reaction
 from
 the
 audience
 is


extreme
 laughter.
 You
 are
 laughing


during
 the
 most
 violent
 sequence
 for
 20


minutes.


>> Well,
 uh
 excited
 to
 have
 the
 Modern
 the


Situation
 crew
 back
 for
 another
 episode


on
 movies.
 Uh
 Mark,
 thanks
 for
 joining


again.
 Yes.
 Excited.


>> So,
 we
 want
 to
 go
 deeper
 into
 some
 of


our
 in
 some
 of
 our
 favorite
 movies.


Mark,
 I
 know
 from
 watching
 movies
 with


you
 that
 one
 of
 your
 genres
 you
 enjoy
 is


movies
 about
 Hollywood.
 And
 so,
 we


wanted
 to
 start
 with
 Once
 Upon
 a
 Time
 in


Hollywood.
 Why
 don't
 you
 talk
 about


what's
 so
 remarkable
 about
 that
 or
 why


you
 wanted
 to
 talk
 about
 it?


>> The
 reason
 I
 movies
 about
 Hollywood,
 I


mean,
 one
 is
 they
 tend
 to
 be
 very


entertaining
 because
 of
 course
 the


people
 who
 make
 movies
 about
 Hollywood


are
 from
 Hollywood
 and
 they
 they
 know


where
 all
 the
 bodies
 are
 buried.
 Um,
 and


they
 tend
 to
 put
 them
 all
 in
 in
 the


movies.
 Um,
 and
 so
 they're,
 you
 know,


all
 run
 spectacular
 Hollywood
 movies.
 So


for
 people
 who
 haven't
 seen,
 I
 would


recommend
 Mahal
 and
 Drive.
 Um,
 it's
 one


of
 Eric's
 favorites.
 Um,
 and


>> nightmares
 run
 it


>> and,
 uh,
 and
 then
 The
 Player,
 um,
 which


also
 is
 an
 alltime
 alltime
 one
 there.


You
 know,
 there's
 there's
 a
 bunch
 of,
 of


course,
 you
 know,
 famous
 ones
 like


Sunset
 Boulevard,
 but,
 you
 know,
 the
 the


iconic,
 you
 know,
 clearly
 the
 the
 the


iconic
 Hollywood
 movie,
 you
 know,
 now
 is


is
 Once
 Upon
 a
 Time
 in
 Hollywood,
 you


know,
 by
 by
 Quentyn
 Tarantino.
 Um,
 and


so,
 uh,
 the
 the
 reason
 I
 like
 Hollywood


movies
 is
 because
 like,
 you
 know,
 there


are
 a
 handful
 of
 cities
 that
 have
 a


claim
 to
 be
 like
 the
 ultimate
 American


city.
 Um,
 and
 you
 know,
 New
 York
 City
 is


one
 of
 those.
 You
 know,
 I
 think
 you


know,
 San
 Francisco
 in
 some
 ways,
 you


know,
 where
 we
 are
 is.
 Uh,
 but
 LA
 and


Las
 Vegas
 also
 put
 on
 the
 list.
 But,
 by


the
 way,
 for
 Las
 Vegas,
 see
 Bugsy
 talk


about
 that
 another
 time.
 But,
 um,
 that's


the
 iconic
 Vegas
 movie.
 Um
 but
 uh
 LA
 in


a
 lot
 of
 ways
 is
 is
 sort
 of
 you
 you


could
 describe
 it
 as
 like
 it's
 the
 ar


archetypal
 American
 city
 and
 and


literally
 it's
 a
 um
 there's
 a
 great
 book


we
 can
 we'll
 put
 put
 in
 the
 notes
 called


thinking
 big
 where
 it
 goes
 actually
 the


creation
 of
 the
 city
 of
 Los
 Angeles
 and


basically
 like
 Los
 Angeles
 you
 could


argue
 is
 the
 ultimate
 air
 American
 city


because
 it
 was
 the
 ultimate
 fake
 it


until
 you
 make
 it
 uh
 thing
 like
 it
 was


the
 theos
 of
 cities
 um
 and
 so
 and
 and


and
 very
 specifically
 like
 it
 was
 desert


like
 there
 was
 absolutely
 nothing
 uh
 in


LA
 And
 then
 um
 you
 know
 literally
 it
 was


like
 a
 land
 development
 deal
 by
 a
 bunch


of
 wealthy
 families
 in
 the
 in
 the
 in
 the


late
 1800s.
 And
 they
 they
 literally


placed
 newspaper
 ads
 in
 eastern


newspapers.
 You
 know
 this
 is
 you
 know


this
 is
 before
 you
 know
 photography
 made


it
 into
 newspapers.
 And
 so
 like
 you
 know


when
 there
 was
 like
 a
 a
 picture
 of


something
 in
 newspaper
 it'
 be
 a
 drawing.


Um,
 and
 so
 they
 they
 would
 uh
 they
 would


uh
 they
 would
 they
 would
 list
 land
 plots


for
 sale
 in
 Los
 Angeles
 and
 they
 would


have
 like
 line
 drawings
 of
 like
 you
 know


orchards
 and
 like
 you
 know
 beautiful


everything's
 green
 and
 palm
 trees
 and


then
 you
 know
 people
 would
 like
 buy
 the


land
 move
 across
 country
 and
 discover


that
 it
 was
 just
 like
 blasted
 out
 desert


um
 and
 then
 you
 know
 they
 they
 famously


created
 you
 know
 they
 created
 the
 city


they
 carved
 it
 carved
 it
 out
 of
 the


desert
 and
 um
 and
 then
 you
 know
 they


they
 famously
 um
 you
 know
 it's
 a
 famous


saga
 of
 how
 they
 went
 to
 get
 the
 water


you
 know
 which
 which
 turned
 into
 you


know
 another
 great
 another
 great
 LA


movie
 uh
 you
 know
 um
 uh
 Chinatown.
 Um,


and
 you
 know,
 it
 as
 as
 you'd
 expect,
 you


know,
 Hollywood
 kind
 of
 goes
 for
 the,


you
 know,
 kind
 of
 goes
 for
 a
 certain


interpretation
 of
 history.
 And
 so
 it,


you
 know,
 sort
 of
 painted
 in
 retrospect


as
 like
 a
 purely
 evil
 activity,
 but
 um,


you
 know,
 there's
 actually,
 you
 know,


there's
 actually
 like
 a
 very
 kind
 of


straightforward
 reading,
 which
 is
 like


this
 is
 what
 was
 actually
 required
 to


create
 a
 city.
 Um,
 and
 it
 was
 it
 wasn't


as
 black
 and
 white
 as
 as
 as
 sort
 of
 a


you
 know,
 the
 Hollywood
 history
 has
 it.


It
 was
 more
 complex
 story,
 but
 still,


you
 know,
 very
 very
 interesting,
 amazing


story.
 And,
 you
 know,
 cities
 like
 what


Los
 Angeles
 are
 created
 every
 day.
 So,


you
 know,
 that's
 a
 pretty
 big
 deal.
 Um,


so
 anyway,
 like
 movies
 about
 LA,
 I
 think


it
 when
 when
 they're
 when
 they're
 when


when
 they
 reach
 the
 level
 of
 capital
 A


art,
 you
 know,
 they
 they
 become
 movies


about
 America.
 Um,
 and
 so
 it's
 like
 a


great,
 you
 know,
 it's
 like
 a
 great
 test


bed
 um
 or
 a
 great
 subject,
 you
 know,
 or


a
 great
 lens
 through
 which
 to
 look
 at


look
 at,
 you
 know,
 the
 history
 of


America.
 And
 Once
 Upon
 a
 Time
 in


Hollywood
 is,
 I
 would
 say,
 one
 one
 of


the
 top
 movies
 u
 in
 that
 along
 that


theme.
 Um,
 let
 me
 start
 by
 saying
 if
 if


anybody
 watching
 this
 hasn't
 seen
 Once


Upon
 Time
 in
 Hollywood,
 pause
 the


podcast
 immediately.
 Um,
 go
 watch
 the


movie


>> and
 then
 come
 back
 because
 I
 would
 just


we
 going
 to
 spoil
 the
 on
 it.
 Um,


and
 it's
 tremendously
 fun
 to
 watch
 if


you
 haven't
 if
 you
 haven't
 if
 you


haven't
 read
 about
 it.
 By
 the
 way,
 I'd


also
 say
 like
 it's
 a
 tremendously


entertaining
 movie.
 Like
 it's
 one
 of
 the


most
 entertaining
 Ponfor
 Pond
 movies.


You
 know,
 it's
 like
 infinitely


rewatchable.
 You
 know,
 the
 the
 cast
 is


ridiculous.
 Um,
 you
 know,
 every
 frame
 of


the
 thing
 is
 amazing.
 Um
 so
 it's
 also
 a


very
 fun
 movie
 but
 um
 so
 okay
 so
 here


here's
 the
 larger
 significance
 of
 once


upon
 a
 time
 time
 at
 Hollywood
 or
 my
 view


of
 it
 which
 is
 um
 it
 it
 it
 captures
 a


time
 and
 place
 um
 that
 was
 absolutely


critical
 to
 the
 evolution
 of
 modern


America
 um
 in
 um
 and
 I
 think
 Katherine


you'll
 remind
 me
 but
 I
 think
 of
 the
 year


was
 it
 60
 was
 it
 69


>> 69
 yeah


>> 69
 yeah
 69
 and
 so
 to
 to
 put
 this
 in


context
 and
 the
 movie
 you
 know
 kind
 of


goes
 through
 this
 but
 it
 the
 movie


doesn't
 explain
 all
 the
 cultural


backstory
 it
 shows
 you
 what
 happened
 but


it
 does
 explain
 the
 backtory
 so
 I'll


just
 go
 through
 the
 back
 story.
 So,
 you


know,
 basically
 like
 what
 we
 now


consider
 to
 be
 the
 kind
 of
 the
 cultural


revolution
 of
 the
 1960s,
 you
 know,


really
 started,
 you
 know,
 probably
 in


like
 around
 1964
 with
 the
 Berkeley
 free


speech
 movement
 and
 then
 kind
 of,
 you


know,
 sort
 of,
 you
 know,
 kind
 of


expanded
 or
 metastasized
 to
 include,
 you


know,
 the
 the
 sort
 of
 hippie
 movements


and
 then,
 you
 know,
 the
 sort
 of
 birth
 of


like
 modern
 rock
 and
 roll
 and
 the
 rise


of
 the
 counterculture.
 Um,
 and
 you
 know,


all
 of
 a
 sudden
 everybody's,
 you
 know,


has
 long
 hair
 and
 they've
 got
 beads
 and


they're,
 you
 know,
 they're
 wearing,
 you


know,
 suede,
 uh,
 you
 know,
 jackets
 and


they're,
 you
 know,
 wearing
 they're
 not


washing
 their
 Levis's.
 Um,
 and
 you
 know,


sort
 of
 the
 whole
 counterculture.
 And
 so


there
 was
 this
 like
 just
 like
 incredible


explosion
 of
 um,
 you
 know,
 this
 when
 the


baby
 boomers
 were,
 you
 know,
 you
 know,


coming
 of
 age
 as
 as
 as
 basically
 high


school
 and
 college
 kids.
 this
 incredible


explosion
 of
 art,
 uh,
 culture,


creativity,
 uh,
 social
 innovation,
 you


know,
 the
 the
 birth
 of,
 you
 know,
 the


commutes,
 you
 know,
 the
 the,
 you
 know,


the
 the
 entire
 hippie
 movement.
 And


then,
 of
 course,
 this
 is
 also
 when
 world


when
 the
 Vietnam
 war
 was
 ramping
 up.
 And


so
 this
 was,
 you
 know,
 the
 the
 ramp
 up


in
 um,
 you
 know,
 in
 uh,
 in
 conscription


of
 uh,
 you
 know,
 people,
 you
 know,


American
 kids
 being
 sent
 off
 to
 to to


Vietnam,
 but
 you
 know,
 kind
 of,
 you


know,
 say
 non-volunteers.
 And
 so,
 you


know,
 the
 kind
 of
 anti-war
 movement


kicked
 in,
 the
 campus,
 the
 college


protest
 kicked
 in.
 Um,
 and
 like
 the


entire
 thing
 was
 like,
 you
 know,
 and
 we


kind
 of
 remember
 it
 as
 like
 this
 like


incredibly
 like
 sort
 of
 spontaneous
 and,


you
 know,
 largely
 positive
 explosion
 of


kind
 of,
 you
 know,
 breaking
 out
 of
 the


staltified
 cultural
 norms
 of
 the
 1940s,


1950s,
 you
 know,
 the
 creation
 of
 kind
 of


the
 modern
 kind
 of
 liberated
 American


society.
 By
 the
 way,
 obviously
 also


right
 alongside
 that,
 you
 know,
 the


civil
 rights
 movement
 and
 the
 feminism,


the
 gay
 rights
 and,
 you
 know,
 kind
 of


all,
 you
 know,
 kind
 of
 the
 the
 whole


explosion
 of
 of
 of
 sort
 of
 modern
 modern


morality
 through
 that
 period.
 Um
 and


anyway
 from
 from
 like
 if
 you
 read
 the


histories
 of
 the
 time
 basically
 from
 '


64
 to
 69
 it
 was
 just
 basically
 this
 like


just
 glorious
 wonderful
 thing
 with
 like


absolutely
 no
 downside
 like
 you
 know


these
 kids
 that
 were
 like
 rioting
 on


their
 college
 campuses
 or
 protesting
 in


the
 streets
 or
 like
 you
 know
 getting


stoned
 all
 day
 or
 you
 know
 having
 their


whole
 hippie
 thing
 or
 moving
 to
 communes


and
 going
 back
 to
 the
 earth
 like
 they


had
 they
 had
 discovered
 a
 far
 superior


way
 to
 live,
 right?
 They
 they
 had


discovered
 a
 far
 superior
 way
 to
 like


coexist
 with
 nature
 and
 to
 be
 like
 to


fight
 against
 the
 man
 and
 to
 fight


against
 you
 know
 evil
 corporations
 and


you
 know
 you
 know
 fight
 for
 the


environment
 to
 fight
 for
 the
 planet


fight
 for
 peace
 and
 the
 whole
 thing
 and


so
 it
 was
 this
 it
 was
 this
 like


incredible
 kind
 of
 wave
 of
 of
 positivity


and
 look
 you
 know
 the
 a
 very
 good


argument
 that
 there
 was
 a
 lot
 too
 you


know
 a
 lot
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 do
 believe


that
 and
 then
 um
 you
 know
 and
 then
 look


it
 was
 like
 a
 time
 of
 great
 cultural


creativity
 that
 you
 know
 led
 to
 enormous


amounts
 of
 like
 amazing
 art
 that
 we


still
 have
 today
 um
 and
 so
 that
 you
 know


there there's
 a
 lot
 to
 like
 about
 it
 and


then
 And
 then
 basically
 what
 happened
 is


in
 1969
 is
 it
 sort
 of
 came
 that
 the
 sort


of
 positivity
 came
 to
 a
 screeching
 halt.


Um
 and
 sort
 of
 the
 movement
 you
 know


basically
 like
 you
 know
 turned
 um
 you


know
 very
 much
 the
 dark
 side
 and
 you


know
 that
 sort
 of
 began
 the
 long
 slide


into
 the
 sort
 of
 1970s.
 Um
 and
 that
 that


slide
 was
 basically
 a
 slide
 into
 you


know
 variously
 among
 other
 things
 you


know
 it
 was
 a
 slide
 into
 like
 you
 know


drugs
 you
 know
 going
 you
 know
 very
 bad


drug
 overdoses
 you
 know
 the
 shift
 from


sort
 of
 soft
 drugs
 to
 hard
 drugs
 um
 you


know
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 who
 participated
 in


the
 the
 the
 sort
 of
 this
 cult
 sort
 of


cultural
 movement
 60s
 ended
 up
 like


dying.
 Well,
 we'll
 talk
 we'll
 talk
 about


the
 death
 later
 on
 because
 you
 know
 the


movie
 directly
 directly
 hits
 that
 but


like
 there's
 just
 an
 extraordinary


amount
 of
 death
 that
 followed
 you
 know


degradation
 and
 that
 you
 know
 it
 it
 uh


you
 know
 turned
 into
 you
 know
 the
 sexual


liberation
 it
 turns
 out
 has
 dark
 sides


and
 you
 know
 maybe
 it
 isn't
 so
 great
 for


everybody
 and
 specifically
 maybe
 it


isn't
 so
 great
 for
 women
 uh
 you
 know


it's
 like
 at
 least
 in
 some
 ways
 um
 and


then
 you
 know
 and
 then
 look
 you
 know
 in


the
 70s
 it
 was
 like
 you
 know
 Vietnam


went
 very
 bad
 and
 then
 the
 energy
 crisis


and
 economic
 recession
 and
 then


inflation
 and
 you
 know
 just
 you
 know


this
 very
 kind
 of
 you
 know
 bitter


divisive
 of,
 you
 know,
 politics.
 Um,
 you


know,
 in
 a
 lot
 of
 ways,
 you
 know,
 the


sort
 of
 the
 the
 beginning
 of
 the


political
 kind
 of
 dynamic
 that
 we
 see


playing
 out
 today.
 And
 so,
 so,
 so
 the


70s
 kind
 of
 things
 went
 really
 bad.
 And


then,
 and
 then,
 you
 know,
 you
 know,
 the


book
 ending
 movie,
 uh,
 uh,
 Once
 Upon
 a


Time
 is
 the
 movie
 sort
 of
 about
 that


pivot
 point.
 I'll
 talk
 about
 that.
 And


then,
 you
 know,
 Boogie
 Knights
 is
 maybe


the
 movie
 on
 the
 other
 side
 of
 that,


right?
 Which
 is
 like,
 you
 know,
 once
 the


culture
 is
 kind
 of
 sliding
 down
 a
 hill


into
 chaos
 and
 madness
 and
 disease
 of


death,
 you
 know,
 you
 know,
 kind
 of


Boogie
 Nights
 captures
 that
 on
 the
 other


side.
 But
 for
 the
 purpose
 of
 today's


discussion,
 we
 can
 focus
 on
 on on
 1969.


And
 so
 if
 you
 read
 the
 history
 of
 the


time,
 basically
 what
 happened
 was
 it
 was


the
 Charles
 Manson
 murders
 uh


specifically
 in
 Los
 Angeles.
 And
 then


sort
 of
 on
 behalf
 of
 America,
 it
 was
 the


Manson
 murders
 that
 basically
 were
 the


turning
 point.
 It's
 the
 Manson
 murders


are
 the
 thing
 that
 people
 point
 to
 and


they
 kind
 of
 say,
 "Oh,
 that
 was
 the


moment
 when
 we
 all
 kind
 of
 realized,
 oh


 uh
 like
 there's
 a
 dark
 side
 of


this
 whole
 thing
 and
 like,
 oh
 my
 god,


here
 we
 go."
 Um
 and
 so
 and
 and
 so
 let's


talk
 about
 that
 at
 length.
 Um,
 let
 me


just
 uh
 close
 off
 this
 this
 intro


introductory
 part
 though
 with
 kind
 of


the
 most
 amazing
 thing
 about
 the
 movie


that
 I
 found
 which
 is
 you
 know
 if
 you


know
 the
 history
 of
 that
 period
 you
 know


about
 the
 I
 mean
 the
 Mansa
 murders
 were


super
 famous
 at
 the
 time.
 You
 know
 there


you
 know
 they're
 still
 famous
 in


American
 culture
 kind
 of
 everybody
 knows


that
 there
 was
 this
 guy
 Charles
 Mansion


that
 had
 this
 death
 cult.
 He
 was
 able
 to


get
 these
 kids
 to
 like
 go
 out
 and
 kill


random
 people.
 Um
 and
 you
 know
 there's


still
 like
 all
 these
 you
 know
 questions


like
 how
 the
 hell
 did
 he
 did
 he
 do
 that?


Um,
 right.
 And
 so,
 uh,
 everybody
 knows


that
 he
 was
 kind
 of
 intertwined
 with


Hollywood
 and
 intertwined
 with
 the
 the


the
 movie
 industry
 and
 the
 music


industry
 and
 and
 like
 he
 he
 was
 part
 of


that
 whole
 thing.
 Um,
 and
 so,
 uh,
 you


know,
 everybody
 kind
 kind
 of
 kind
 of


knows
 that,
 but
 I
 think
 that
 what
 is,


um,
 oh,
 and
 then
 specifically
 for
 for


people
 who
 know
 anything
 about
 that,


they're
 sort
 of
 famously
 the
 Manson


murders
 are
 also
 known
 as
 the
 Sharon


Tate
 murders.
 Uh
 because
 there
 was
 this


like
 incredibly,
 you
 know,
 vivaceious,


attractive,
 bubbly,
 you
 know,


enthusiastic
 young
 blonde
 actress
 named


Sharon
 Tate.
 Um
 who
 at
 the
 time
 famously


was
 was
 actually
 married
 to
 Roman


Palansky
 who
 was,
 you
 know,
 one
 of
 the


leading,
 you
 know,
 kind
 of
 new,
 you


know,
 Hollywood
 movie
 directors
 of
 that


time.
 They
 were
 this
 basically
 this
 this


new
 Hollywood
 glamour
 power
 couple.
 Um


and
 then
 Sharon
 Tate
 and
 among
 other


people,
 you
 know,
 Sharon
 Tate
 was
 was


one
 of
 the
 people
 murdered.
 So
 Quentyn


Tarantino
 comes
 out,
 you
 know,
 when
 he


first
 announces
 the
 movie,
 he
 comes
 out


and
 he
 says,
 you
 know,
 Quentino
 Quinton


Tarantino
 is
 going
 to
 make
 the
 movie


about
 the
 Charles
 Manson
 murders,
 right?


And
 if
 you've
 seen,
 you
 know,
 any
 other


Tarantino
 movie
 like
 Pulp
 Fiction,
 for


example,
 you're
 just
 like,
 "Oh
 my
 god,


you
 know,
 this
 is
 going
 to
 be
 a
 like


this
 is
 going
 to
 be
 horrible."
 like
 like


like
 the
 Mansa
 murders
 are
 bad
 enough,


but
 like
 you
 know
 turning
 them
 into
 like


a
 you
 know
 Tarantino
 style
 you
 know
 mass


slaughter
 violence
 you
 know
 reservoir


dogs
 you
 know
 just
 like
 blood
 and
 guts


you
 know
 uh
 exploit
 you
 know
 basically


super
 high
 exploitation
 movie
 as
 he
 had


done
 in
 the
 past
 u
 just
 like
 it
 was
 a


horror
 show
 and
 I
 was
 actually
 I
 was


actually
 personally
 worried
 about
 it
 cuz


my
 my
 wife
 got
 all
 excited
 to
 to
 to
 see


the
 movie
 uh
 cuz
 you
 know
 she
 you
 know


because
 it's
 going
 to
 star
 Leo
 the


Cabrio
 and
 Brett
 Kit
 and
 it's
 going
 to


be
 about
 Hollywood
 and
 it's
 about


fashion
 and
 you
 know
 all
 this
 you
 know


design
 and
 all
 this
 creativity
 and
 she's


like, "We
 got to
 go
 see
 this
 movie."
 And


I'm
 like,
 I'm
 like,
 "We
 can't
 go
 see
 the


movie
 because
 you
 are
 going
 to
 be
 so


traumatized
 by
 what
 he
 puts
 on
 screen,


but
 like
 you're
 never
 going
 to
 want
 to


ever
 see
 a
 movie
 ever
 again.
 And
 you're


going
 to
 hold
 it
 against
 me
 for
 the
 rest


of
 my
 life,
 but
 it
 didn't
 prevent
 you


from
 seeing
 this
 movie
 cuz
 it's


obviously
 just
 going
 to
 be
 a
 complete


horror
 show.
 Like,
 it's
 just
 going to
 be


a
 disaster."
 And
 actually
 Sharon
 Tate's


family
 actually
 came
 out
 and
 and


basically
 said
 when
 this
 movie
 is
 first


announced,
 basically
 said
 like,
 "Wait
 a


minute,
 hold
 on."
 And
 like
 you
 know
 we


don't
 want
 the
 memory
 of
 our
 you
 know
 of


our
 you
 know
 of
 our
 of
 our
 family
 member


you
 know
 who
 you
 know
 we
 we
 still
 love


you
 know
 many
 decades
 later
 you
 know


kind
 of
 you
 know
 turned
 into
 basically


fodder
 for
 you
 know
 basically
 Hollywood


exploitation.
 Um,
 and
 then
 there
 was


this
 like
 amazing
 thing
 that
 happened


and
 nobody
 knew
 anything
 about
 the
 movie


which
 is
 uh
 Tarotino
 at
 least
 the
 way


story
 is
 recorded
 Tarotino
 actually
 let


I
 think
 it
 was
 Sharon
 Tate's
 it
 was


either
 sister
 and
 maybe
 sister
 or


something
 like
 that
 read
 read
 the
 script


uh
 and
 immediately
 um
 the
 family
 did
 a


180
 um
 and
 they
 came
 right
 out
 and
 they


said
 we
 completely
 approved


that
 he's
 paying
 him
 and
 I
 remember
 at


the
 time
 reading
 that
 and
 I
 was
 like


what
 the
 hell
 like


>> how
 how
 is
 it
 that
 he
 could
 possibly
 get


the
 that
 that
 the
 tape
 family
 of
 all


people
 on
 with
 putting
 this
 on
 screen.


And
 of
 course,
 you
 know,
 that
 that
 that


leads
 to
 kind
 of
 that,
 you
 know,
 the


movie
 sort
 of
 turn turns
 into
 a


valentine
 a
 valentine
 to
 Hollywood
 and


to
 America
 and
 specifically
 to
 Sharon


Tate.
 Um,
 you
 know,
 it's
 like
 it's
 like,


you
 know,
 it
 it
 really,
 you
 know,
 kind


of
 restores
 her
 memory
 in
 in
 an
 amazing


way.
 Yeah.


>> He
 did
 something
 very
 smart
 in
 the
 movie


for
 those
 of
 us
 who
 who
 love
 Tarantino


and
 follow
 his
 work.
 So,
 I
 think
 there


that
 was
 like
 the
 common
 theme
 was
 like,


"Oh
 god,
 this
 is
 going
 to
 be
 horrific."


Right?
 And
 especially
 if
 you've
 read


about
 if
 you
 know
 the
 Manson
 murders,
 if


you've
 read
 about
 how
 gruesome
 they
 are,


like
 yes,
 that
 was
 sort
 of
 the
 the


dominant
 theme.
 But
 his,
 you
 know,
 he
 he


had
 he
 made
 a
 few
 films
 between,
 but


like
 I'd
 say
 the
 last
 other
 fantastic


Tarantino
 film
 was
 the
 revenge
 fantasy


and
 Glorious
 Bastards,
 which
 is
 of


course,
 you
 know,
 again,
 like
 could
 have


been
 it
 is
 extremely
 gruesome,
 but
 at


the
 same
 time,
 it's
 a
 revenge
 fantasy
 of


what
 could
 have
 happened.
 What
 could


have
 happened
 if
 someone
 had
 killed


Hitler?
 And
 so
 in
 the
 very
 beginning
 of


the
 movie,
 there's
 a
 scene
 with
 Leonardo


DiCaprio
 also
 at
 the
 end,
 but
 there's
 a


scene
 in
 the
 very
 beginning
 where
 it


shows
 all
 of
 his
 films
 and
 he
 has
 the


famous
 flamethrower
 from
 Englorious


Bastards.
 And
 so
 if
 you're
 a
 Tarantino


fan,
 you're
 like,
 "Wait,
 wait,
 wait.


Which
 direction
 are
 we
 going
 in?
 Are
 we


going
 in
 gruesome
 violence
 with
 no


purpose,
 which
 I
 would
 argue
 Tarantino


is
 always
 misunderstood
 in
 that
 way,
 or


are
 we
 going
 in
 a
 are
 we
 going
 in
 a


different
 direction,
 a
 little
 more


fantastical,
 a
 little
 more
 what
 could


have
 happened?
 Um,
 and
 so
 for
 those
 of


us
 with
 like
 the
 eagle
 eye
 in
 the


theater,
 I
 think
 uh
 I
 think
 we
 kind
 of


we
 kind
 of
 knew,
 you
 know,
 especially
 as


you
 said,
 like
 the
 family
 said,
 "Oh,


it's
 it's
 great.
 It's
 going
 to
 be
 fine."


We
 kind
 of
 knew,
 okay,
 this
 this
 film
 is


not
 going
 to
 be
 nearly
 as
 bad.
 Um,
 and


Tarantino
 is
 going
 to
 take
 us
 in
 a
 in
 a


different
 direction,
 but
 he
 did
 put
 that


little
 Easter
 egg
 in
 there
 for
 us
 in


like
 the
 first
 10
 minutes
 of
 the
 film.


>> So,
 it's
 funny
 you
 bring
 that
 up
 because


I
 of
 course
 totally
 missed
 that
 when
 I


was
 watching
 the
 movie.
 Um,
 I
 just


thought
 it
 was
 like
 it
 was
 like
 a
 re,


you
 know,
 he
 So,
 so
 for
 people
 who


haven't
 seen
 it,
 Leo
 Caprio
 plays
 a
 sort


of
 a
 Steven
 McQueen
 style
 movie
 star
 on


1960s
 named
 Rick
 is
 kind
 of
 as
 the
 movie


starts,
 his
 kind
 of
 career
 is
 imploding.


Um,
 he's
 trying
 to
 figure
 out
 how
 to


kind
 of
 turn
 things
 around
 or
 stay


relevant
 to
 the
 times
 and
 it
 it
 does
 it


shows
 these
 clips
 from
 his
 his
 prior


movies
 in
 the
 universe.
 Um,
 and
 what
 but


I
 just
 figured
 it
 was
 just
 like
 a


throwaway.
 Oh
 yeah,
 I
 see
 with
 the


flamethrower.
 That's
 funny.
 Haha.
 Um,


like
 it
 didn't
 even
 for
 a
 minute
 occur


to
 me.
 I
 mean,
 you
 know,
 just
 since


we're
 going
 to
 spoil
 it,
 we'll
 just
 say


the
 flamethrower
 plays
 a
 critical
 role.


>> A
 very
 critical
 role.


>> Have
 you
 ever
 been
 happier
 to
 see
 the


flamethrower
 get
 taken
 out
 um
 than


at
 the
 at
 the
 end
 of
 that
 movie?
 But


yeah,
 I
 mean
 I
 I
 just
 I
 was
 like


literally
 I
 I
 enjoyed
 the
 movie
 so
 much


when
 I
 was
 watching
 it,
 but
 I
 I
 did
 not


know.
 I
 mean,
 I
 I
 knew
 it
 had
 to
 be


something
 amazing
 that
 I
 wasn't


expecting
 in
 order
 to
 get
 the
 Tate


family
 on
 board,
 but
 like
 I
 I
 I
 still


was
 I
 I
 still
 was
 like
 sitting
 there
 in


a
 state
 of
 dread
 throughout
 the
 entire


movie,
 you
 know,
 still
 anticipating
 that


he
 would
 somehow
 Anyway,
 so
 to
 spoil
 the


movie,
 he
 he
 once
 upon
 a
 time
 in


Hollywood,
 he
 he
 basically
 he
 basically


tells
 you
 the
 story
 of
 the
 man
 called
 of


Hollywood
 at
 that
 time
 and
 sort
 of
 how


that
 all
 intertwined
 and
 he
 takes
 it
 all


the
 way
 up
 to
 the
 night
 of
 the
 murders,


but
 then
 he
 he
 takes
 a
 left
 turn
 um
 in


the
 history
 as
 he
 does
 this
 alternative


history.
 And
 so
 it
 and
 and
 so
 the
 the


the
 kid
 the
 Manson
 cultists
 who
 who
 in


real
 life
 culture
 take
 in
 the
 movie
 they


they
 they
 go
 they
 go
 they
 go
 in
 the
 the


house
 next
 door
 which
 is
 which
 which
 is


Leo's
 house
 um
 with
 with
 and
 with
 Leo's


friend
 Brad
 Pitt
 uh
 and
 Brad
 Pitt's


character
 by
 the
 way
 I
 don't
 know
 you
 I


don't
 know if
 you
 know
 this
 Kevin
 I'm


curious
 if
 you
 know
 the
 backstory
 on
 the


Brad
 Pitt
 character
 is
 it
 he
 doesn't


quite
 say
 this
 in
 the
 movie
 but
 it


explains
 a
 lot
 which
 is
 basically


Tarantino's
 conception
 of
 him
 is
 he's


basically
 the
 most
 deadly
 man
 in
 the


world
 at
 that
 time.
 So
 he's
 he's
 like
 a


you
 know
 he
 plays
 not
 just
 a
 war
 hero


but
 like
 a
 greed
 beret
 like
 you
 know


super
 highly
 decorated
 you
 know


basically
 super
 soldier
 uh
 who's
 who's


become
 a
 Hollywood
 stunt
 man.
 Um
 and
 so


basically
 the
 um
 you
 know
 the
 the


mansion
 killer
 is
 basically
 walked


exactly
 to
 the
 wrong
 house
 because


number
 one
 they're
 up
 against
 this
 guy


who
 basically
 like
 you
 know
 spent
 the


preceding
 whatever
 you
 know
 20
 years
 you


know
 killing
 people
 for
 America.
 Um
 you


know
 basically
 Captain
 America
 and
 then


and
 then
 number
 two
 it
 turns
 out
 Leo


still
 had
 the
 flamethrower
 in
 his


garage.
 Um,


>> well,
 there's
 also
 there's
 also
 the


backstory
 that
 you're
 you're
 not
 totally


sure
 how
 good
 Cliff
 is.
 Like
 there's
 a


whole
 backstory
 of
 did
 he
 kill
 his
 wife.


Um,
 which
 is
 actually
 in
 the
 film
 and


also
 in
 sort
 of
 the
 backstory,
 but
 like


there
 he
 he
 is
 he
 is
 he
 is,
 you
 know,
 a


deadly,
 as
 you
 said,
 like
 a
 very
 deadly


person.
 Um,
 but
 that
 final
 scene,
 um,


and
 yeah,
 there's
 no
 way
 you
 can


anticipate,
 like
 even
 if
 you
 knew,
 okay,


maybe
 it's
 not
 going
 to
 be
 as
 gruesome


or
 there's
 going
 to
 be
 some
 sort
 of
 like


revenge
 fantasy,
 there's
 no
 way
 you
 can


anticipate
 how
 genius
 like
 the
 run-up
 to


it
 is.
 And
 then
 also
 the
 final
 scene


because
 there's
 this
 whole
 other
 thing


that
 happens
 in
 the
 movie
 where
 you


forget
 that
 you're
 watching
 a
 movie


about
 the
 Mansims.
 like
 you
 forget
 that


you're
 watching
 this
 this
 horrific
 like


what
 what
 it's
 supposed
 to
 be
 and


there's
 a
 there's
 like
 a
 30
 minute
 scene


um
 of
 Rick
 Dalton
 who's
 the
 who's
 sort


of
 this
 you
 know
 um
 aging
 like
 he's


losing
 his
 place
 in
 Hollywood
 he
 sort
 of


you
 know
 is
 is
 is
 sort
 of
 a
 at
 a
 at
 a


loss
 for
 why
 he's
 no
 longer
 powerful


right
 like
 and
 and and
 he
 has
 this


moment
 where
 he
 stars
 in
 this
 like
 kind


of
 cheesy
 western
 with
 this
 like


11-year-old
 girl
 and
 it's
 like
 a
 movie


within
 a
 movie
 and
 And
 it
 is
 like


probably
 the
 best
 encapsulation
 of
 like


what
 happens
 to
 actors
 in
 Hollywood.
 So


you
 kind
 of
 lose
 track
 of
 the
 fact
 it's


like
 here's
 Sher
 Sharon
 Tate
 and
 she's


at
 the
 Playboy
 Mansion.
 She's
 dancing.


She's
 this
 new
 generation
 but
 here's


this
 old
 generation
 of
 like
 hyper


masculine
 figures
 who
 can't
 get
 work.


And
 there's
 there
 it's
 just
 a
 genius


movie
 within
 a
 movie
 where
 the
 little


girl
 says
 to
 him
 and
 it's
 probably
 like


one
 of the
 most
 memorable
 lines.
 She's


like
 that's
 the
 best
 acting
 I've
 ever


seen
 in
 my
 whole
 life.
 And
 I
 mean
 it's


like
 just
 even
 if
 they'd
 stopped
 the


movie
 there,
 it
 would
 have
 been
 just
 as


brilliant,
 right?
 But
 then
 it
 goes
 on
 to


this
 other
 sequence
 where
 you're
 like,


"Oh
 yeah,
 we're
 watching
 we're
 about
 to


see
 the
 most
 gruesome,
 you
 know,


possible
 like
 this.
 I
 mean,
 and
 you


know,
 I
 wasn't
 alive
 in
 1969,
 but
 I
 can


imagine
 it's
 like
 if
 you
 know,
 if


Jennifer
 Lauren,
 if
 it
 happened
 to


Jennifer
 Lawrence
 or
 if
 it
 happened
 to


Margot
 Roby
 or
 Robbie,
 who's
 actually


playing
 her,
 right?
 It
 would
 just
 be


this
 horrific
 thing.
 Um,
 but
 you
 kind
 of


forget
 because
 there's
 all
 of
 these
 just


beautiful,
 hilarious
 sequences
 that
 run


up
 to
 it.
 You
 forget
 that
 you're


watching
 a
 movie
 that's
 supposed
 to
 end


in
 this
 horrific
 violence.
 Um,
 and
 of


course,
 I'll
 let
 you
 continue,
 Mark,
 but


it
 doesn't.
 It
 ends
 it
 ends
 in
 a


different
 type
 of
 horrific
 violence,
 but


not
 female
 on
 female
 violence
 that


characterized
 the
 the
 Manson
 murders,


which
 I
 think
 is
 is
 another
 kind
 of


subtext
 of
 of
 the
 of
 the
 film.
 Um,
 it's


just
 how
 how
 gory
 and
 violent
 the
 actual


episode
 is,
 but
 you
 you
 don't
 actually


see
 that.
 So,
 I'll
 let
 you
 continue,
 but


there
 whole
 other
 part
 of
 the
 Hollywood


story
 that's
 really
 fascinating.


>> Yeah.
 No,
 that's
 that's
 exactly
 right.


And
 by
 the
 way,
 pop
 quiz,
 Katherine,
 the


the the
 little
 girl
 the
 the
 little
 girl


actress,
 uh,
 who
 who
 was
 she
 in
 who
 was


that
 intended
 to
 be
 in
 real
 life?
 I


>> I
 I
 don't
 know,
 actually.
 Um,


>> Jodyie
 Foster.


>> Oh.
 Oh,
 is
 that
 Oh,
 that's
 who
 she's


supposed
 to
 be.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 I
 didn't
 realize.
 Okay.


>> She's
 not
 under
 that
 name,
 but
 that's


basically
 the
 character
 is
 supposed
 to


be
 Jody
 Foster.


>> That
 makes
 sense.


>> And
 so,
 and
 I
 bring
 that
 up
 because
 like


representative
 of
 of
 new
 Hollywood.
 So,


so
 cuz
 so
 Jodie
 Foster
 was
 in
 that
 in


that
 era
 was
 like
 a
 rising
 biscuit
 child


star.
 Uh
 and
 then
 she
 she
 had
 her


breakup
 role
 in
 I
 think
 in
 um
 in
 Taxi


Driver
 um
 you
 know
 where
 she's
 just
 like


you
 know
 it's
 like
 incredibly
 revoly
 you


know
 acting
 performance
 uh
 uh
 and
 so


she's
 sort
 of
 representative
 of
 the
 new


of
 the
 new
 of
 the
 quote
 unquote
 new


Hollywood
 um
 with
 the
 much
 more


naturalistic
 like
 the
 actually


naturalistic
 acting
 style
 that
 took
 over


from
 the
 much
 more
 stylized
 style
 of
 the


50s
 and
 60s.
 And
 so,
 so
 I
 bring
 that
 up


because
 to
 to
 your
 point,
 part
 of
 the


story
 there
 is
 Rick
 Dalton,
 you
 know,


basically
 trying
 to
 get
 out
 of
 basically


making
 clichéed
 haty
 genre
 stuff,
 right,


where
 he
 just
 plays
 the
 same
 tough
 guy


over
 and
 over
 again.
 Well,
 so
 so
 the


running
 joke
 up
 until
 that
 point
 is
 that


Rick
 Dalton
 starts
 started
 out
 his


career
 as
 like
 a
 tough
 guy
 movie
 star.


Um,
 and
 then
 basically,
 you
 know,
 over


the
 years
 like
 that
 that
 that
 archetype


was
 kind
 of
 fading
 in
 1969.
 And
 so
 he


was
 increasingly
 being
 uh
 being
 cast
 as


the
 bad
 guy.
 Um
 and
 then
 and
 you
 know


then
 the
 thing
 is
 you
 know
 the
 bad
 guy


you
 know
 gets
 like
 punch
 is
 not
 the
 guy


who
 punches
 and
 knocks
 other
 people
 out.


He's
 the
 guy
 who
 gets
 punched
 and


knocked
 out
 and
 he's
 sort
 of
 on
 this


dumber
 slide
 and
 he
 has
 absolutely
 no


idea
 how
 to
 adapt
 itself
 to
 this
 new


world.
 In
 fact,
 and
 again,
 and
 the
 way


the
 movie
 the
 way
 this
 intersects
 with


the
 other
 the
 other
 part
 of
 the
 movie


is,
 you
 know,
 uh
 is
 literally
 when
 Roman


Palansky
 and
 share
 a
 tape
 move
 in
 next


door,
 you
 know,
 to
 his
 character
 and
 he


and
 literally
 he's
 like,
 "Oh
 my
 god,
 if


I
 could
 just
 figure
 out
 a
 way
 to
 like


get
 invited
 over
 for
 like
 a
 barbecue
 or


something
 where
 I
 could
 just
 meet
 Roman


Pansky,
 who's
 like
 the,
 you
 know,
 the


the
 leading
 kind
 of
 new
 Hollywood
 movie


director
 of
 that
 time.
 If
 I
 could
 just


get
 captioned
 one
 of
 his
 movies,
 then
 I


could
 stay
 relevant,
 you
 know,
 for
 the


next
 decade."
 And
 he
 just
 had
 like


absolutely
 there
 was
 just
 absolutely
 no


reason
 for
 like
 Roman
 philosopher
 Sher


tape
 to
 give
 to
 give
 this
 Rick
 Dalton


character
 you
 know
 the
 time
 of
 day


because
 he
 just
 he
 represent
 the
 past


they
 represent
 the
 future
 um
 until
 of


course
 at
 the
 very
 end
 of
 the
 movie
 you


know
 Rick
 Dalton
 saves
 you
 know
 saves


her
 life
 um
 and
 then
 in
 that
 she
 you


know
 that's
 that's
 the
 significance
 of


of
 him
 being
 invited
 over
 at
 the
 end
 of


the
 movie
 is
 is
 sort
 of
 his
 entree
 into


Hollywood
 having
 basically
 been
 taught


by
 Jodie
 Foster
 as
 an
 11-year-old
 in


actually
 how
 to
 act
 right


basically
 it
 comes
 together
 in
 it's
 in


such
 a
 genius
 way.
 Anyway,
 yeah.
 So,
 so


so
 basically
 like
 the
 the
 the
 sort
 of


macro
 the
 macro
 relevance
 of
 this
 just


to
 kind
 of
 restate
 the
 thesis
 is
 you


know
 like
 if
 the
 Manson
 murders
 were


were
 kind
 of
 where
 the
 cultural


revolution
 of
 the
 1960s
 went
 bad
 then


once
 upon
 a
 time
 in
 Hollywood
 is
 sort
 of


the
 it's
 sort
 of
 the
 fantasy
 or
 the
 love


letter
 to
 a
 different
 America
 in
 which


that
 didn't
 happen
 right
 and
 and
 and
 and


basically
 things
 kept
 going
 in
 like
 a


much
 more
 much
 a
 much
 more
 positive


direction.
 Um,
 but
 by
 putting
 on
 screen


the
 alternate
 direction,
 my
 view
 is
 like


he
 really
 highlights
 how
 bad
 it
 was
 that


that's
 not
 what
 happened.
 And
 so
 that


the
 tragedy
 of the
 Manson
 murders
 was


not
 just
 the
 tragedy
 for
 the
 people
 who


were
 killed
 and
 for
 their
 families.
 U


and
 which
 is
 a
 profound
 tragedy,
 but
 the


tragedy
 was
 like
 for
 basically
 for
 all


of
 LA
 cuz
 like
 LA,
 if
 you
 talk
 to
 people


who
 were
 who
 were
 around
 during
 that


period,
 like
 things
 got
 dark
 in
 LA
 like


very
 quickly.
 Like
 people
 people
 were
 so


freaked
 out
 by
 the
 Manson
 murders
 like


they
 didn't
 know
 how
 many
 other
 serial


killers
 were
 running
 around.
 They
 didn't


know
 how
 many
 other
 cults
 there
 were.


They
 like
 everybody
 all
 of a
 sudden
 had


to
 like
 lock
 their
 doors.
 Like
 people


stopped
 going
 out.
 Like
 it
 became
 like


and
 and
 by
 the
 way
 this
 was
 the


beginning
 of
 the
 heyday
 of
 the
 serial


killer,
 you
 know,
 with
 Ted
 Bundy
 and
 you


know
 like
 it
 was
 the
 beginning
 of
 this


like
 wave
 of
 these
 things
 where
 people


got
 like
 really
 really
 seriously
 freaked


out.
 Um
 and
 and
 so
 that
 was
 the
 other


but
 but
 then
 just
 generally
 in
 America


that
 you
 know
 as
 I
 said
 like
 that
 was


the
 beginning
 of
 the
 downward
 slide
 in


the
 70s.
 And
 so
 by
 by
 making
 the
 what
 if


and
 positive
 kind
 of
 you
 know
 all
 you


know
 counterfactual
 so
 clear
 it
 sort
 to


me
 it
 sort
 of
 highlights
 and
 illustrates


in
 in
 maybe
 the
 way
 that
 nothing
 else


has
 been
 able
 to
 do
 kind
 of
 the
 darkness


that
 actually
 played
 out
 in
 real
 life.


>> Totally.


>> Totally.
 And
 and
 and
 like
 I
 I
 went
 back


and
 watched
 uh
 the
 beginning
 of
 the


sequence
 because
 it's
 actually
 a
 long


sequence
 of
 violence.
 Um
 but
 what
 I


remember
 so
 much
 I
 read
 the
 reviews


before
 not
 know
 you
 know
 they
 they
 try


to
 not
 have
 spoiler
 alerts
 and
 critics


were
 very
 divided.
 It
 was
 like
 this
 is


so
 violent.
 This
 is
 extremely
 violent.


And
 what
 what's
 funny
 about
 seeing
 it
 in


the
 theater
 um
 which
 was
 I'm
 so
 glad
 I


saw
 in
 the
 theater
 is
 that
 the
 reaction


from
 the
 audience
 and
 these
 are
 again


it's
 like
 if
 you've
 been
 opening
 weekend


these
 are
 people
 who
 like
 really
 wanted


to
 see
 this
 movie
 or
 are
 Tarantino
 fans


is
 extreme
 laughter.


>> Yes.


>> As
 it
 is
 you
 are
 laughing
 during
 the


most
 violent
 sequence
 for
 20
 minutes.


And
 what's
 what's
 really
 funny
 about


what's
 happening
 on
 screen
 too
 is
 that


Cliff
 Cliff
 who's
 the
 you
 know
 the


stuntman
 um
 that
 and
 again
 this
 is
 a


spoiler
 like
 turn
 this
 off.
 I'm
 going to


go
 into
 detail
 the
 he
 takes
 an
 edible


like
 or
 LSD
 I
 can't
 remember
 if
 it's
 an


edible
 or


>> smokes
 smokes
 an
 LSD
 cigarette.


>> Yes.
 So
 so
 right
 before
 so
 he
 is
 like


high
 as
 a
 kite
 when
 these
 guys
 come
 in


which
 is
 also
 like
 a
 funny
 part
 of
 it.


And
 then
 and
 the
 other
 part
 that
 you


have
 to
 like
 Tarantino
 is
 so
 particular


about
 details
 and
 so
 the
 music
 that
 is


playing
 when
 they
 come
 in
 is
 actually


this
 like
 uh
 psychedelic
 rock
 band
 like


and
 and
 he
 shows
 the
 kind
 of
 transition


of
 the
 ' 60s
 through
 music
 through
 the


entire
 thing
 which
 is
 really
 important


but
 that
 scene
 he's
 listening
 to
 um
 uh


the
 Supremes
 set
 me
 free
 why
 don't
 you


babe
 right
 like
 so
 it's
 this
 perfect


moment
 of
 like
 set
 me
 free
 and
 these


guys
 come
 in
 he's
 high
 and
 he's
 like
 is


this
 is
 this
 real?
 But
 but
 Cliff
 Cliff's


response
 is
 like
 laughter.
 He's
 laughing


at
 these
 women,
 right?
 And
 these
 women,


you
 know,
 they
 have
 their
 their
 knives


like
 they
 they
 are
 ready
 to
 to
 do
 to
 do


the
 deed,
 you
 know,
 and
 um
 and
 and
 he's


laughing.
 And
 I
 think
 it's
 in
 some
 ways


it's,
 you
 know,
 Tarantino
 always
 has


sort
 of
 these
 like
 takes
 on
 like


masculine
 violence
 and
 and
 you
 know,
 can


can
 you
 kind
 of
 can
 you
 can
 you
 can
 take


the
 power
 out
 of
 whatever
 situation


happened
 in
 history
 by
 just
 like
 this


extreme
 violence
 and
 like
 you
 know
 it's


about
 to
 happen
 and
 there's
 like
 a
 I


won't
 ruin
 the
 pit
 bull
 part,
 but
 like


there
 is
 something


>> let's
 ruin
 it.
 Let's
 ruin
 it.
 We're


running.


>> No.
 Okay.
 Like
 he
 he
 sixs
 his
 pit
 bull


on
 on
 these
 women,
 right?
 But
 it
 but
 the


what
 watching
 it
 again,
 you're
 like
 this


is
 it's
 fascinating
 because
 if
 if
 the


Manson
 had
 been
 met
 with
 laughter,


right?
 Like
 instead
 they
 were
 met
 with


these
 are
 the
 most
 evil.
 They're
 they're


you
 know
 they're
 they're
 they're
 taken


by
 the
 devil,
 right?
 Like
 they
 were
 met


with
 fear
 and
 and
 to
 Mark's
 point,
 like


that
 set
 off
 serial
 killers.
 Like
 it


gave
 power
 to
 this
 extraordinary
 evil


for
 for
 decades.
 And
 I
 think
 the
 point


of
 it
 is
 like
 what
 if
 Cliff,
 the
 most


masculine
 deadly
 man
 in
 the
 room,
 had


just
 been
 high
 and
 laughed
 and
 like,
 you


know,
 sick
 as
 pitull
 on
 on
 on
 these
 on


these
 women
 who,
 you
 know,
 are
 kind
 of


silly
 and
 high
 themselves.
 And
 like
 the


whole
 thing
 had
 become
 a
 comedy,
 which


it
 turns
 into
 like
 20
 minutes
 of
 just


sheer
 hilarity.
 Like
 just
 absolute


hilarity,
 even
 though
 it's
 the
 most


violent
 thing
 you've
 probably
 seen
 in


the
 last
 several
 years.
 He
 he
 he


the
 Bradford
 character
 beats
 a
 Himei
 to


death
 with
 a
 telephone
 and
 it's
 just
 the


funniest
 thing
 you've
 ever


>> It's
 like
 it's
 it's
 Yeah.
 It's
 like
 a


And
 the
 flamethrower
 shows
 up,
 right?


Like
 I
 mean
 it's
 it
 is
 there
 you
 could


not
 conceive
 of
 the
 type
 of
 violence.
 It


it
 meets
 it
 meets
 the
 most
 horrific


violence
 that
 we
 know
 is
 coming,
 right?


And
 like
 that's
 the
 backstory
 to
 this


too
 is
 like
 you
 know
 what
 really


happened.
 So
 you
 have
 this
 weird


anthropolic
 response
 of
 you
 know
 what


actually
 happened
 and
 it's
 so
 tragic.
 uh


and
 it
 was
 women
 on
 you
 know
 I
 always


think
 it's
 interesting
 that
 it
 was
 like


the
 Manson
 family
 right
 they
 called


themselves
 family
 it
 was
 a
 perversion
 of


the
 family
 and
 they
 actually
 killed
 a


woman
 who
 was
 8
 months
 pregnant
 starting


a
 family
 so
 it's
 like
 this
 horrific
 all


that's
 a
 hor
 narrative
 to
 this
 but
 like


the
 fact
 that
 it's
 met
 with
 even
 more


extreme
 violence
 and
 and
 at
 the
 time
 it


was
 during
 you
 know
 it
 was
 during
 me
 too


as
 well
 so
 it
 was
 violence
 against
 women


but
 of
 course
 everyone
 wants
 that


violence
 to
 happen
 because
 you
 don't


want
 the
 alternative
 to
 happen.
 So,
 it


it's
 this
 very
 strange
 um
 moviegoing


experience
 u
 that
 is
 both
 delightful
 but


also
 like
 you
 know
 a
 lot
 of
 mixed


emotions
 that
 I
 think
 you
 know
 probably


that's
 why
 I
 think
 critics
 were
 so


divided
 on
 it.
 Um
 I
 loved
 it
 but
 that's


why
 I
 think
 critics
 were
 divided
 on
 it.


>> Yeah.
 And
 then
 if
 you
 if
 you
 kind
 of


telescope
 up
 you
 know
 one
 one
 notch
 it's


it's
 caffing
 your
 point.
 It's
 like
 it's


like
 the
 ultimate
 square
 in
 the
 form
 of


Rick
 Dalton
 who's
 like,
 you
 know,
 still


putting
 bro
 cream
 in
 his
 hair
 and
 trying


to
 be
 like,
 you
 know,
 kind
 of
 James
 Dean


tough
 guy,
 you
 know,
 you
 know,
 when


that's
 not
 what
 the
 world
 wants.
 Um,
 and


then,
 yeah,
 and
 then,
 you
 know,


basically,
 like
 I
 said,
 you
 know,


Captain
 America,
 like
 an
 icon
 of
 the


American
 military,
 you
 know,
 at
 the


time,
 you
 know,
 by
 the
 way,
 the
 time
 of


Vietnam
 in
 which,
 you
 know,
 the
 military


was,
 you
 know,
 not
 was,
 you
 know,
 it
 was


not
 viewed
 at
 the
 level
 of
 respect
 that


that
 American
 culture
 has
 for
 it
 today.


you
 know,
 the
 the
 fact
 that
 those
 two,


you
 know,
 end
 up
 basically
 beating
 and


and
 roasting
 a
 bunch
 of
 hippies
 to
 death


at
 the
 height
 of
 the
 counterculture.


It's
 an
 incredibly
 crowd-pleasing
 movie


and
 that,
 as
 you
 said,
 it
 kind
 of


happened
 in
 sort
 of
 the
 sort
 of,
 you


know,
 very
 very
 close
 to
 peak
 woke
 um


kind
 of
 during
 our
 cultural
 revolution


of
 the
 last
 decade.
 like
 it
 it's
 it's
 I


I
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 you
 I
 don't
 know if


it's
 properly
 characterized
 as
 like
 a


reactionary
 movie,
 but
 it
 it
 it
 it's


definitely
 not
 it
 was
 definitely
 not
 the


arc
 the
 moral
 arc
 of
 of
 of
 other


attempts
 at
 arc
 during
 that
 time
 period.


>> Totally.
 Totally.
 And
 and
 and
 just
 even


the
 the
 final
 scene
 of
 as
 you
 said
 him


getting
 invited
 over
 and
 her
 sort
 of


being
 blissfully
 unaware
 this
 happens.
 I


mean
 that's
 all
 magical
 of
 like
 she
 had


no
 idea
 that
 someone
 this
 happens.
 Um,


and
 you
 see
 like
 the
 camera
 sort
 of
 pan


up
 and
 it's
 like
 this
 is
 like
 it
 it
 just


genuinely
 feels
 like
 this
 is,
 you
 know,


in
 the
 same
 way
 that
 Glorious
 Bastards


was
 a
 revenge
 drama
 of
 what
 could
 have


possibly
 happened,
 this
 is
 also
 like
 the


Once
 Upon
 a
 Time
 in
 America
 story,
 like


what
 could
 have
 happened.
 Um,
 and
 and
 it


was
 a
 weird
 movie
 going
 experience
 in


2019
 to
 be
 surrounded
 by
 people
 who
 were


laughing,
 who
 loved
 it.
 you
 know,
 it
 it


it
 kind
 of
 went
 against
 everything
 you


were
 reading
 in
 the
 news,
 which
 is
 that


like,
 you
 know,
 no,
 no
 one
 agrees
 with


with
 sort
 of
 this
 this
 alternative


history.
 I
 mean,
 it
 was
 it's
 just
 a


brilliant
 film.
 Um
 that
 that
 Yeah,
 I'm


excited.
 There's
 a
 sequel
 coming,
 right,


Mark?


>> There
 is
 indeed.
 There
 is
 a
 there's
 a


deed,
 which
 is
 going
 to
 be
 Let
 me
 also


say,
 number
 one,
 there's
 a
 sequel


coming,
 which,
 you
 know,
 is
 going
 to
 be


just
 incredible,
 I'm
 sure.
 Uh
 but
 also,


um
 there
 was
 a
 there
 Tarantino,
 it's
 so


funny.
 So,
 you
 guys
 may
 both
 remember


this,
 but
 back
 before
 the
 internet
 and


even
 back
 before
 like
 DVDs
 and
 video


rentals,
 if
 if
 you
 like
 if
 you
 if
 you


didn't
 see
 a
 movie
 when
 it
 was
 in
 the


theater,
 like
 you
 didn't
 see
 it.
 And


like
 it
 might
 show
 up
 on
 TV
 like
 two


years
 later,
 but
 if
 they
 would
 have
 cut


all
 the
 good
 parts
 out,
 then
 they
 would


have,
 you
 know,
 stuck
 in
 all
 the


commercials.
 Um,
 and
 so
 you
 like


basically
 in
 one
 shot
 to
 see
 movie
 in


the
 theater
 and
 then
 if
 you
 wanted
 to


see
 it
 again
 and
 it
 was
 out
 of
 theater,


you
 couldn't.
 And
 so
 there
 was
 this


there
 was
 this
 genre
 of
 paperback


novelizations
 um
 of
 of
 movies.
 And
 so


what
 you
 would
 do
 is
 you
 would
 buy
 the


paperback
 novelization
 and
 then
 you


could
 read
 that
 as
 many
 times
 as
 you


want.
 So
 you
 know
 my
 I
 had
 a
 shot
 these


things
 when
 I
 was
 a
 kid
 you
 know
 Star


Wars
 and
 all
 these
 things
 you
 read
 them


all
 like
 14
 times.
 Um,
 and
 so
 anyway,
 so


Tarantino
 being,
 you
 know,
 sort
 of
 a


child
 of
 this
 era,
 you
 know,
 like
 I
 am,


um,
 Tarantino
 actually
 wrote
 a
 paperback


novelization
 of
 the
 movie
 Once
 Upon
 a


Time
 in
 Hollywood.
 And
 he
 specifically


wrote
 it
 as
 a
 paperback
 novelization.


Uh,
 and
 so
 it
 came
 out
 in
 paperback.
 Um,


uh,
 and,
 you
 know,
 very
 much
 as
 an


homage
 to
 this,
 but
 of
 course
 being


Tarantino,
 it's
 it
 actually
 turns
 out,


of
 course,
 it's
 not
 just
 a
 paperback


novelization.
 It
 turns
 out
 it's
 like
 an


entirely
 new
 novel.
 Um,
 and
 so
 and
 and


it's
 actually
 funny
 because
 it
 doesn't


it's
 it's it's
 it's
 it's
 it's
 the
 novel


is
 set
 in
 the
 same
 world
 of
 the
 movie


and
 has
 and
 and
 and
 goes
 much
 deeper


into
 the
 themes
 of
 the
 movie,
 but
 like


he
 doesn't
 even
 get
 he
 doesn't
 care
 at


all
 about
 like
 having
 the
 plot
 of
 the


movie
 actually
 in
 the
 novel
 and
 so
 he


just
 throws
 it
 away
 right
 up
 front
 in


the
 novel.
 Oh
 yeah.
 Yeah.
 And
 then
 Rick


D
 Rick
 Dalton
 like
 roasted
 a
 bunch
 of


hippies,
 you
 know,
 in
 his
 swimming
 pool


that
 night,
 right?
 So
 like
 it's
 like
 the


plot's
 not
 the
 point
 for
 for
 the


novelization.
 So
 the
 the
 novelization
 I


think
 I
 think
 as
 a
 as
 a
 very
 few
 people


have
 read
 it
 you
 know
 kind
 of
 just
 by
 by


virtue
 of
 how
 he
 how
 he
 came
 out
 with
 it


I
 think
 because
 I
 think
 people
 didn't


know
 what
 to
 make
 of
 like
 literally
 a


paperback
 novelization
 in
 like
 2022
 or


whatever
 it
 came
 out.
 Uh
 but
 I
 think
 it


has
 he
 does
 a
 reasonable
 claim
 on
 being


a
 great
 American
 novel.
 Um
 because
 and


the
 reason
 specifically
 uh
 Keith
 I
 think


you
 enjoyed
 it
 a
 lot
 because
 it
 it
 just


it
 goes
 much
 deeper
 into
 all
 the
 themes


of
 you
 know
 that
 we're
 talking
 about.


And
 so
 it
 like
 it
 goes
 really
 deep
 into


the
 transformation
 of
 Hollywood
 that
 was


happening
 at
 that
 time.
 you
 know,
 it


goes
 really
 deep
 into
 the
 making,
 you


know,
 this
 the
 western
 show
 that
 happens


inside
 the
 movie,
 which
 is
 actually
 a


real
 show
 called
 Lancer.
 Uh,
 it
 was


actually
 a
 real
 show
 with
 with
 that,
 you


know,
 with
 that
 setup
 and
 with
 those


actors.
 Um,
 and
 it
 goes
 much
 deeper
 into


into
 all
 the
 characters
 and
 it
 goes


deeper
 into
 the
 Manson
 family.
 Uh,
 and


so
 it's
 um,
 uh,
 yeah,
 it's
 really


amazing.
 And
 by
 the
 way,
 I
 should
 also


say,
 um,
 uh,
 yeah,
 the
 the
 movie
 does


have
 a
 scene
 in
 which
 it
 is
 left


ambiguous
 as
 to
 whether
 or
 not
 Cliff


Booth
 killed
 his
 wife.
 Uh,
 by
 the
 way,


let
 me
 just
 say
 the
 wife
 played
 by


Rebecca
 Dehart,
 um,
 who
 just
 like
 I


think
 she's
 in
 the
 movie
 for
 like
 30


seconds
 and
 she
 almost
 steals
 the
 movie.


Like
 she's
 just
 hysterically
 funny
 and


she
 plays
 like
 the
 meanest
 like
 wife
 in


the
 world.
 She's
 just
 like
 hectoring
 and


like
 screaming
 at
 Brad
 Pitt
 and
 they're


literally
 on
 a
 fishing
 boat.
 Brad
 Pitt


has
 a
 spear
 gun
 in
 his
 lap.
 Um,
 and
 it's


sort
 of
 and
 in
 the
 movie
 it's
 it's
 like


set
 up
 as
 basically,
 you
 know,
 there
 was


a
 spear
 gun
 accident
 um,
 you
 know,


following
 this
 argument
 and
 and
 did
 did


Brett
 B
 actually
 actually
 deliberately


kill
 his
 wife
 or
 not?
 Um,
 and
 of
 course


in
 the
 novelization
 it
 makes
 her
 fair.


Yes,
 he
 he
 in
 fact
 yes,
 he


>> I
 think
 it's
 I
 think
 it's
 in
 the
 I
 think


it's
 in
 the
 novel.
 I
 think
 it's
 like


yes,
 Brad
 Pitt
 definitely
 killed
 his


wife
 and
 got
 away
 with
 Cliff
 Booth


killed
 his
 wife
 and
 got
 away
 with
 it.


Um,
 and
 then
 I
 think
 that
 I
 think
 I


think
 he
 says
 the
 novel
 he
 says
 and
 that


was
 one
 of
 the
 three
 times
 that
 Cliff


Booth
 committed
 murder
 and
 got
 away
 with


it.


So
 anyway,
 anyway,
 for
 those
 of
 you


who've
 only
 seen
 the
 movie,
 it
 turn
 it


turns
 it
 turns
 out
 the
 click
 poof


character
 actually
 yes
 has
 a
 real
 dark


side
 and
 and
 yes,
 the
 the
 hippies
 picked


the
 wrong
 house
 to
 stumble
 into


>> and
 and
 so
 is
 the
 we
 were
 talking


offline
 about
 how
 it's
 you
 know
 there's


some
 relevance
 to
 today
 is
 is
 the


connection
 that
 you
 know
 the
 2010s
 to
 to


some
 people
 was
 seen
 as
 a
 sort
 of


glorious
 march
 towards
 uh
 you
 know


progress
 and
 then
 you
 know
 whether
 it's


the
 2020
 Floyd
 riots
 or
 more
 recently


the
 Louis
 G
 you
 know
 murder
 or
 or
 the


murder
 of
 Charlie
 Kirk
 there's
 kind
 of


this
 moment
 of
 oh
 my
 god
 that
 this
 thing


has
 gone
 off
 there
 is
 that
 that
 kind
 of


the


>> so
 I
 would
 say
 whichever
 side
 of
 the


political
 and
 social
 spectrum
 you're
 on


like
 the
 world
 that
 we
 live
 in
 today
 is


a
 much
 darker
 version
 of
 what
 everybody


thought
 we
 were
 going
 to
 be
 living
 in
 I


mean
 like
 so
 for
 people
 who
 were
 like


100%
 on
 board
 with
 like
 the
 social
 back


up
 a
 second
 there Eric
 to
 your
 point
 so


like
 I
 think
 there's
 a
 very
 direct


analogy
 of
 let's
 call
 it
 1964
 to
 1972
 or


something
 um
 with
 the
 re-election
 of


Richard
 Nixon.
 Um
 like
 that
 cultural


revolution
 that
 happened
 during
 the
 60s


kind
 of
 the
 hippie
 Vietnam,
 you
 know,


kind
 of
 revolution.
 Um
 I
 I
 think
 what
 we


what
 we
 in
 America
 been
 through
 the
 last


decade
 is
 sort
 of
 another
 version
 of


that.
 Like
 I
 think
 we
 we
 went
 through


our
 version
 of
 that.
 It
 started
 around
 I


would
 date
 it
 to
 like
 2015
 2014
 and
 then


you
 know
 it
 basically
 that
 era
 sort
 of


ended
 November
 November
 November
 2024.


You
 know
 obviously
 if
 you're
 on
 the


right
 you're
 like
 oh
 my
 god
 thank
 god


that's
 over.
 um
 and
 you
 know
 the
 the


world
 could
 move
 on.
 If
 you're
 on
 the


left,
 of
 course,
 you're
 like,
 "Oh
 my


god,
 what
 just
 happened?
 How
 did
 you


know
 how
 did
 the
 revolution
 revolution


go
 so
 bad?"
 That
 that
 is
 precisely
 what


happened
 at
 the
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the


revolution
 in
 the
 1960s
 and
 and


specifically
 I
 mentioned
 1972.
 So


Richard
 Nixon
 was
 elected
 president
 1968


and
 it
 was
 like
 a
 hard
 fought
 race
 and


very
 dramatic
 in
 Minnesota,
 right?
 But


then
 he
 was
 reelected
 in
 1972
 in
 a


landslide
 like
 I
 was
 cas
 49
 state


landslide
 or
 some
 crazy
 thing
 like
 it


was
 just
 like
 an
 overwhelming
 landslide.


So,
 it's
 like
 the
 American
 people


basically
 rose
 up
 and
 and
 basically


said,
 "Yeah,
 no
 more
 of
 this.
 It's


over."
 Um,
 and
 and
 so
 we,
 you
 know,
 we


we
 I
 mean
 that
 the
 echoes
 are
 just
 like


profound


of
 of
 how
 this
 played
 out
 and,
 you
 know,


and
 they're
 echoes,
 right?
 It's
 not


exactly
 comparable,
 you
 know, in
 Iraq


and
 Vietnam,
 you
 know,
 play
 different


roles
 and
 so
 forth
 and
 the
 economy,
 you


know,
 developed
 in
 different
 ways
 and,


you
 know,
 Trump
 and
 Nixon
 are
 different


people
 and
 so
 forth,
 but
 and
 the
 social


movements
 are
 different
 uh,
 you
 know,


and
 times
 have
 changed,
 but
 still
 like


there
 there there
 was
 there
 was
 a


cultural
 revolution.
 it
 was,
 you
 know,


either
 glorious
 or
 terrible
 for
 some


period
 of
 time
 and
 then
 get
 ended,


right?
 It
 was
 just
 like
 a
 sequence
 of


events
 happened
 where
 just
 like
 it
 was


over
 and
 you're
 out
 the
 other
 side
 and


you're
 in
 a
 new
 world.
 Um,
 and
 and
 and


and
 and
 then
 I
 I
 would
 argue
 like
 that's


exactly
 what
 that
 that's
 exactly
 the


process
 kicked
 off
 in
 69
 with
 the


Massenberers
 and
 then
 sort
 of
 book
 ended


with
 72
 with
 Nix's
 re-election
 and
 then


kind
 of
 the
 slide
 into
 the
 1970s
 and


then
 ultimately
 1980s
 like
 that


transformation
 and
 then
 I
 I
 would
 argue


like
 that
 that's
 pre precisely
 the
 same


kind
 of
 transition
 that
 we're
 going


through
 right
 now.
 Um
 and
 I
 I
 think
 it's


either
 it's
 either
 thrilling
 or


horrifying
 people
 in
 a
 very
 similar
 way


um
 that
 the
 that
 the
 end
 of
 the
 60s


either
 thrilled
 or
 horrifying
 people.


Yeah,
 Katherine,
 would
 you
 agree
 with


that?


>> I
 would
 I
 would.
 Um
 and
 I
 I
 also
 since


you
 mentioned
 Vietnam,
 I
 I
 want
 to


transition
 to
 the
 best
 Vietnam
 war
 film


ever
 made.


>> Okay.
 This
 is
 this
 is
 everything
 we've


said
 up
 until
 now
 is
 milk
 toast
 as


compared
 to
 the
 extremely
 controversial


plane
 that
 Katherine
 is
 about
 to
 make.


Please
 go
 for
 It
 is
 it
 is
 it
 is
 by
 far


the
 best
 Vietnam
 war
 film
 ever
 made.
 Um


and
 of
 course
 it
 incorporates
 every


Vietnam
 war
 film
 ever
 ever
 made
 in


including
 Deer
 Hunter,
 Full
 Metal


Jacket.
 Um
 you
 know
 once
 or
 or
 um
 Born


on
 the
 Fourth
 of
 July,
 Apocalypse
 Now.


The
 best
 Vietnam
 war
 film
 ever
 made
 is


Tropic
 Thunder.
 Uh
 but
 it
 also
 happens


to
 be
 one
 of
 the
 best
 films
 about


Hollywood.
 Um,
 actually
 our
 I
 would


actually
 say
 that
 Once
 Upon
 a
 Time
 in


Hollywood,
 while
 it
 is
 an
 incredible


film,
 is
 more
 about
 America,
 but
 Tropic


Thunder
 is
 also
 about
 America
 in


different
 ways
 and
 reveals
 a
 lot
 about


America,
 but
 is
 is
 by
 far
 the
 best


Hollywood
 film
 ever
 made.
 I'll
 let
 Mark


talk
 about
 why
 that
 is.
 Um,


>> well,
 let's
 tell
 us
 dated.
 Traffic


Thunder
 was
 what
 year?


>> It
 was
 2008,
 which
 is
 actually
 very


important.
 Um
 because
 I
 think
 one
 of
 the


things
 that
 people
 forget
 is
 that
 um


2008
 was
 also
 the
 year
 where
 we
 had
 a
 a


P
 from
 the
 Vietnam
 War
 running
 for


office
 against
 the
 first
 black
 president


in
 history.
 And
 that
 is
 in
 very


important
 context
 for
 all
 of
 the
 themes


dealt
 with
 inside
 of
 Tropic
 Thunder,


which
 of
 course
 is
 a
 comedy.
 Um
 it's
 a


satire,
 but
 it
 satarizes
 everything
 in


the
 kind
 of
 Before
 Times
 2008.
 Um,
 but
 I


think
 that
 is
 a
 very
 important
 subtext


to
 what
 came
 out
 during
 an
 election
 year


where
 those
 two
 themes
 were
 on
 display.


Um,
 but
 I'll
 let
 Mark
 get
 into
 the


summary.
 Um,
 since
 it's
 also
 one
 of
 his


favorite
 films.


>> Well,
 it
 it
 is
 although
 I
 I
 I'm
 going to


defer
 so
 because
 you
 know
 I
 think
 it's
 I


think
 it's
 historically
 fun.
 You
 know,


it's
 maybe
 the
 funniest
 movie
 funniest


Hollywood
 movie
 the
 last
 25
 years
 or


something
 like.
 It's
 just
 it's
 just
 like


an
 incredibly
 entertaining
 movie.
 Um,


and
 just
 for
 people
 to
 just
 have
 a
 sense


of
 like
 how
 much
 times
 have
 changed,


like
 the
 most
 I
 mean
 there's
 many


amazing
 things
 about
 it,
 but
 one
 of the


most
 amazing
 things
 about
 it
 is,
 you


know,
 the
 the
 great
 actor
 Robert
 Downey


Jr.
 uh
 plays
 the
 entire
 movie
 of


Blackface


and
 not
 only
 plays
 the
 entire
 movie
 of


Blackface,
 like
 I
 would
 say


extraordinarily
 commits
 for
 the
 bit.
 Um,


>> yes,
 he's
 a
 method
 actor
 playing
 a


method
 actor.


>> Entire
 movie
 in
 method
 playing
 another


method
 actor,
 you
 know,
 playing
 an
 actor


in
 in in
 a
 type
 of
 blackface.
 Um,
 again,


which
 which
 to
 your
 point
 on
 on
 um
 Once


Upon
 a
 Time
 in
 Hollywood
 when
 the
 film


was
 first
 announced,
 this
 was
 known
 that


that
 Robert
 Downey
 Jr.
 was
 was
 going
 to


be
 playing
 an
 actor
 in
 blackface.
 And
 as


you
 can
 imagine,
 it
 was
 the
 same
 thing


that
 happened
 with
 Once
 Upon
 a
 Time
 in


Hollywood
 where
 it
 was
 like
 like
 the,


you
 know,
 in
 the
 same
 way
 that
 the
 the


Tate
 family
 was
 terrified
 of
 what
 would


happen
 in
 the
 film.
 Um,
 there
 was
 a


whole
 kind
 of,
 you
 know,
 terror
 of
 what


what
 is
 going
 to
 like
 Robert
 Downey
 Jr.


like
 like like
 he's
 destroying
 his


career
 like
 who
 does
 Ben
 Stiller
 think


he
 is
 doing
 this
 movie,
 right?
 Like
 no


one
 actually
 knew
 the
 backstory
 or
 how


it
 would
 be
 satarizing
 Hollywood
 actors


who
 will
 go
 through
 any
 extreme
 length


to
 win
 an
 Oscar.
 Um
 but
 but
 when
 you
 get


into
 the
 film
 it
 is
 handled
 so


beautifully
 indelically
 and
 actually
 I


was
 I
 was
 reading
 um
 I
 was
 reading
 about


sort
 of
 how
 they
 handled
 it
 um
 when
 they


were
 producing
 it
 which
 was
 that
 they


invited
 you
 know
 a
 number
 of
 members
 of


the
 NAACP.
 They
 invited,
 you
 know,
 a


number
 of
 different
 like
 very
 thoughtful


critics
 and
 said,
 "You
 have
 to
 see
 this


film
 first
 and
 see."
 And
 it
 was
 again


the
 same
 sort
 of
 thing
 where
 it's
 like


everyone
 saw
 it
 first
 and
 they
 said,


"Don't
 worry,
 it's
 perfect."
 Right?
 It's


hilarious.
 Um,
 and
 so
 I'll
 let
 you


continue,
 but
 it
 like
 they
 handled
 it
 in


a
 way.


>> Did
 did
 they
 have
 to
 apologize
 in
 the


2010s?
 I
 remember
 Jimmy
 Kimmel
 had
 to


apologize
 for
 blackface
 uh
 or
 or
 one
 of


these
 people.
 Did
 they
 get
 away
 with
 it?


>> Interesting
 point.
 So
 they
 didn't
 So


when
 it
 came
 out
 it
 was
 so
 clearly


satarizing


um
 white
 actors
 who
 were
 trying
 to
 win


an
 Oscar,
 right?
 Like
 so
 it
 was
 clearly


satarizing
 everyone.
 It
 it
 was
 not
 it


was
 you
 know
 it
 was
 it
 was
 sort
 of


universally
 beloved.
 So
 much
 so
 that


that
 Robert
 Downey
 Jr.
 was
 nominated
 for


an
 Oscar
 which
 is
 a
 whole
 other


backstory
 to
 how
 they
 made
 that
 happen


because
 it
 was
 kind
 of
 a
 continuation
 of


the
 movie
 that
 they
 as
 a
 joke
 petitioned


the
 Academy.
 you
 know,
 it
 said
 for
 your


consideration
 and
 the
 Academy
 actually


nominated
 him
 for
 an
 Oscar
 for
 the
 role.


So,
 it
 was
 so
 it
 was
 so
 like
 beloved


like
 what
 he
 did
 and
 how
 how
 how


brilliant
 the
 role
 was
 that
 no
 one


cared.
 But
 I
 believe
 it
 was
 like
 2017
 or


2018
 when
 this
 sort
 of
 like
 new
 crop
 of


young
 people
 came
 through
 journalism
 and


said
 like
 this
 is
 horrible.
 They
 tried


to
 sort
 of
 cancel
 him.
 You
 might
 know


Mark
 better
 if
 how
 he
 handled
 it,
 but


like
 it
 it
 clearly
 they
 did
 not
 cancel


Robert
 Downey
 Jr.
 for
 doing
 a


satarization
 of
 of
 the
 role
 he
 played.


>> So,
 just
 to
 just
 to
 fill
 this
 in
 and


then
 we
 we'll
 get
 to
 I
 want
 to
 get
 to


the
 Katherine
 your
 the
 Vietnam
 aspects


of
 this,
 but
 uh
 Vietnam
 war
 movie


aspects
 to
 this.
 Uh
 but
 yeah,
 so
 just


specifically
 what
 happened
 was
 correct


me
 if
 I
 have
 this
 wrong.
 Um
 Robert


Downey
 Jr.,
 a
 white
 American
 actor,


plays
 a
 white
 Australian
 actor
 um
 who
 is


a
 method
 actor
 who
 I
 think
 was
 sort
 of


loosely
 inspired
 by
 Daniel
 D.
 Lewis
 as


sort
 of
 a,
 you
 know,
 sort
 of
 that
 that


kind
 that
 kind
 of
 sort
 of,
 you
 know,


super
 elite.
 You
 know,
 there
 there's
 a


couple
 scenes
 where
 you
 see
 where
 you


see
 where
 you
 see
 Robert
 out
 of
 black


face,
 but
 but
 dressed
 up
 with
 as
 uh


dressed
 up
 as
 the
 u
 as
 the
 Australian


actor
 who
 like
 has
 like
 I
 forget
 what's


like
 translucent
 green
 eyes
 or
 something


as
 this
 very
 striking
 striking
 look
 and


like
 this
 very
 plumby
 Australian
 accent.


Um
 and
 so
 it's
 a
 white
 American
 actor
 in


real
 life
 playing
 a
 white
 Australia


actor
 playing
 a
 southern
 black
 man
 in


blackface


for
 the
 entire
 movie.
 On
 top
 of
 that,
 I


believe
 Robert
 Downey
 often
 often


improvises
 uh
 through
 throughout
 his


movies.
 And
 I
 I
 think
 a
 fair
 amount
 of


the
 uh
 uh
 I
 think
 a
 fair
 a
 fair
 amount


of
 the
 portrayal
 was
 was
 was
 him
 on
 on


the
 spur
 of
 the
 moment,
 which
 is
 which


is,
 you
 know,
 fairly
 incredible
 uh
 uh


when
 you
 see
 it
 uh
 because
 he
 he
 fully


fully
 inhabits
 the
 world.
 And
 then
 of


course
 he's
 he's
 actually
 in
 the
 he's


actually
 he's
 in,
 you
 know,
 in
 in
 in
 the


movie
 inside
 the
 movie.
 He's
 in
 he's
 in


a
 platoon
 with
 of
 course
 an
 actual
 black


guy
 who's
 a
 young
 black
 actor
 whose
 name


I
 can't
 recall,
 but
 he
 just
 like
 was


impressed
 having
 this.
 It
 was
 such
 a
 to


him.
 He's
 a
 br
 it's
 a
 brilliant
 like
 the


way
 they
 play
 off
 each
 other
 is


brilliant.
 His
 name
 in
 the
 film
 is


Alpuccino.
 But
 Alpacino


>> Alino
 who's
 a
 rapper
 who's
 a
 rapper
 who


becomes
 an
 actor.


>> Yes.
 It
 and
 and
 there's
 a


>> there's
 a
 whole
 other


>> Go
 ahead.
 Sorry.


>> Oh
 no,
 no.
 I
 was
 going
 to
 say
 there's
 a


whole
 other
 through
 line
 there
 of
 his


his
 role
 because
 I
 think
 one
 of the


things
 that
 everyone
 remembers
 of
 the


film
 is
 they
 have
 the
 fake
 um
 trailers


before
 the
 film
 starts
 and
 he
 is


Alpuccino
 the
 rapper
 and
 he's
 selling
 a


drink
 that
 he
 calls
 Booty
 Sweat.
 Uh
 and


and
 what's
 so
 funny
 about
 like
 how


brilliant
 this
 film
 is
 because
 not
 only


like
 not
 only
 do
 they
 satize
 Hollywood


in
 the
 film,
 they
 were
 like
 first


Barenheimimer
 like
 what
 they
 did
 they're


like
 we're
 going
 to
 market
 this
 in
 so


many
 funny
 ways.
 is
 they
 did
 incredible


things
 before
 and
 after
 the
 film,
 but


one
 of
 the
 things
 that
 the
 that
 they
 did


was
 they
 made
 Booty
 Sweat
 into
 an
 actual


drink,
 marketed
 it
 through
 the
 entire


Oscar
 petition.
 Like
 they
 they
 went
 so


far.
 I
 mean,
 the
 only
 film
 that's
 done


this
 as
 as
 exceptional
 as
 Drop
 of


Thunder
 was
 was
 Barbie.
 Um,
 but
 they


they
 they
 they
 figured
 out
 how
 to
 turn


every
 aspect
 of
 this
 film
 into
 a
 into


marketing
 genius.
 The
 other
 smart
 thing


that
 they
 did,
 by
 the
 way,
 the
 one
 of


the
 actors
 that
 that
 Ben
 Stiller,
 Ben


Stiller
 plays
 this
 guy
 named
 Tug


Speedman,
 who
 is
 based
 on
 a
 dumb
 Tom


Cruz.
 His
 name
 is
 Tug
 Speedman,
 right?


Like,
 where
 did
 they
 get
 that
 name?
 It's


Tom
 Cruz.
 But
 they
 also
 have
 Tom
 Cruz
 in


the
 movie
 as
 as
 the
 producer
 who's
 based


on
 Harvey
 Weinstein.
 Uh,
 less
 less
 I
 I


can't
 remember.


>> What?
 Less
 Gman.


>> Less
 Grossman.
 Yes.
 Um,
 and
 so
 but
 they


didn't
 want
 anyone
 to
 know
 Tom
 Cruz
 was


in
 the
 film.
 So
 they
 actually
 sued


anyone
 any
 of
 the
 paparazzi
 who
 took


pictures
 of
 him
 before
 because
 they


wanted
 people
 to
 come
 to
 the
 theater
 and


not
 know
 that
 Tom
 Cruz
 was
 in
 it.
 And
 of


course
 he
 like
 wrote
 his
 entire
 role


like
 like
 he
 he
 to
 to
 your
 point
 in


improv
 like
 he
 improvised
 that
 entire


role
 and
 wrote
 it
 like
 it
 was
 sort
 of


Tom
 Cruz's
 brainchild.
 I
 think
 they


originally
 offered
 him
 something
 else


and
 he's
 like, "No,
 no,
 I
 I
 want
 to
 play


Harvey
 Weinstein."
 And
 it
 is
 genius,
 but


they
 did
 so
 many
 things
 to
 make
 sure


that
 the
 entire
 sort
 of
 cult
 of
 the


movie
 outside
 of
 the
 movie
 was
 like


Hollywood
 produced.
 Um,
 where
 you
 to
 to


to
 Mark's
 point,
 you
 have
 this,
 you


know,
 method
 actor
 playing
 a
 method


actor
 who
 is
 trying
 to
 get
 an
 Oscar


through
 his
 method
 acting
 who
 ultimately


ends
 up
 getting
 nominated
 for
 the
 Oscar,


losing
 to
 Heath
 Ledger
 the
 the
 year
 that


Ledger
 died
 posthumously.
 um
 when
 it
 was


awarded
 to
 him.
 But
 it
 it's
 like
 they


they
 could
 not
 have
 this
 is
 a
 20-year


project.
 That's
 the
 other
 that's
 the


other
 very
 interesting
 thing
 about
 this


was
 like
 Ben
 Stiller
 has
 been
 working
 on


this
 since
 the
 80s.
 And
 it
 was
 just
 that


year
 where
 they
 were
 finally
 able
 to
 get


it
 made
 and
 it
 is
 this
 brilliant


commentary
 on
 all
 of
 Hollywood.
 And
 we


can
 get
 into
 the
 Vietnam
 stuff
 too


because
 I
 think
 it's
 also
 commentary
 on


that.
 But
 it's
 it's
 it
 is
 the
 best


Hollywood
 film
 ever
 made
 even
 in
 the


fact
 that
 they
 were
 able
 to
 successfully


sway
 the
 Oscars.


>> Right.
 Well,
 it
 was
 also
 Catherine
 to


your
 point.
 It
 was
 also
 the
 recite
 of


the
 Tom
 Cruz
 image
 issues
 at
 the
 time


cuz
 this
 was
 after
 the
 sort
 of
 run
 of


controversy
 around
 him
 and
 psychology


and
 his
 personal
 life
 and
 all
 those


things.
 And
 there
 there
 was
 so
 this
 run


of
 very
 bad
 publicity.
 A
 lot
 of
 people


in
 the
 industry
 were
 worried
 that
 he
 was


not
 going
 to
 be
 a
 bankable
 movie
 star


anymore.
 And
 I
 I
 think
 this
 role
 in
 this


movie
 was
 basically
 his
 recovery
 from


that
 which
 which
 was
 pulled
 off


absolutely
 perfectly.
 And
 of
 course
 he


then
 went
 on
 to
 be
 an
 even
 bigger
 movie


star
 than
 before.


>> Totally.


>> Yeah.
 So
 it's
 a
 great
 career


resurrection
 in
 in
 the
 middle
 of
 this.


Yeah.
 And
 then
 yeah
 just
 just
 in
 terms


of
 like
 how
 how
 much
 times
 have
 changed


or
 you
 know
 somebody
 once
 said
 that
 the


past
 is
 a
 is
 a
 foreign
 planet
 or
 another


country.
 Um


is
 yeah
 like
 you
 you
 had
 an
 American


actor
 being
 nominated
 for
 an
 Oscar
 for


for
 a
 character
 performed
 at
 black


blackface
 in
 2008.


directed
 by
 a
 Hollywood
 filmmaker
 who's


obviously
 a
 genius
 but
 you
 know
 within


10
 years
 was
 like
 he
 you
 know
 Ben
 Ben


Stellar
 subsequently
 became
 one
 of
 the


wokest
 Hollywood
 figures
 uh
 you
 know
 in


in
 the
 years
 that
 follow
 like
 you
 know


all
 all
 through
 the
 last
 decade
 like
 Ben


Stellar
 has
 been
 like
 you
 know
 you
 know


to
 to
 the
 left
 of
 Shavara
 on
 every


social
 and
 political
 issue
 and
 so
 and
 I


I
 you
 know
 I
 I
 don't
 know
 I've
 never
 met


him
 I've
 met
 great
 admirer
 of
 his
 art


but
 like
 I
 wonder
 how
 much
 of
 his
 shift


to
 the
 far
 left
 politically
 and
 socially


was
 a
 was
 a
 reaction
 having
 made
 this


it.


>> Well,
 well,
 and
 the
 other
 thing
 is


everyone
 focuses
 on
 Robert
 Downey
 Jr.,


but
 there
 are
 like
 at least
 four
 other


untouchable
 things
 that
 happened
 in
 that


film.
 Um,
 so
 the
 the
 disability


advocates
 actually
 when
 the
 film
 came


out,
 the
 the
 people
 who
 were
 most
 upset


in
 2008
 were
 the
 disability
 advocates
 um


because
 of
 the
 um
 commentary
 on
 what's
 I


believe
 it's
 on
 what's
 eating
 Gilbert


Grape,
 right?
 Never
 like
 I'll
 just
 say


>> oh
 and
 forest
 Forest
 and
 Forest
 Gup.


Yes.
 Yes.


>> And
 Rayman
 and
 Rayman.
 Yeah.
 Um
 um
 uh
 uh


Simple
 Jack.


>> Simple
 Jack.
 Yes.
 So
 the
 the
 the
 famous


line
 that
 is
 said
 is
 and
 and
 again
 I'm


I'm
 quoting
 the
 film,
 never
 go
 full


 Um
 which
 was
 okay
 to
 say
 in
 2008


except
 for
 the
 disability
 advocates
 um


who
 were
 who
 were
 very
 upset
 about
 it.


And
 of
 course,
 like
 they
 were
 sort
 of
 on


the
 fringe
 in
 2008,
 but
 that
 was


actually
 the
 thing
 that
 that
 Ben
 Stiller


had
 to
 apologize
 for
 because
 they
 they


didn't
 they
 didn't
 test
 the
 film
 on


SimpleJack.
 But
 it
 was
 commentary
 from


from
 Robert
 Downey
 Jr.
 in
 blackface


saying
 everybody
 knows
 and
 then
 saying


the
 line,
 right?
 Because
 because
 Tug


Speedman
 doesn't
 play
 it
 as
 he
 should.


Um
 he
 he he
 does
 the
 full
 Leo
 DiCaprio


what
 what's
 eating
 Gilbert
 Grape
 sort
 of


like,
 you
 know,
 full
 on,
 right?
 He


doesn't
 do
 Rain
 Maker.
 But
 there's
 two


other
 things
 that
 happen.
 Um,
 so
 the
 the


other
 thing
 that
 I
 think
 people
 didn't


realize
 is
 that
 be
 it
 is
 so
 much
 of
 a


commentary
 on
 Vietnam
 War
 film
 because
 a


lot
 of
 Vietnam
 war
 memoirs
 in
 later


years
 have
 been
 proven
 to
 be
 completely


disingenuous,
 right?
 So
 it's
 like
 people


who
 said
 they
 went
 to
 Vietnam
 didn't
 go


to
 Vietnam.
 And
 so
 in
 the
 storyline
 and


the
 film,
 the
 guy
 whose
 memoir,
 Tropic


Thunder,
 the
 movie
 is
 actually
 based
 on,


>> right,


>> is
 a
 is
 a
 member
 of
 the
 Coast
 Guard
 who


never
 got
 sent
 to
 Vietnam
 who
 worked
 for


the
 sanitation
 department,
 right?
 Like


that's
 like
 a
 whole
 theme
 in
 the
 movie.


And
 so
 there's
 this
 like
 brilliant


commentary
 also
 on
 like,
 you
 know,


veterans
 issues
 and
 I
 think
 some


veterans
 groups
 were
 upset
 about
 it.


There
 were
 also
 people
 who
 were
 very


upset
 with
 um
 Tom
 Cruz's
 portrayal.
 Um,


and
 it
 was,
 you
 know,
 it
 was
 before
 we


kind
 of
 all
 knew
 who
 he
 was
 betraying


and
 everything,
 but
 there
 were
 people


who
 were
 very
 upset
 that
 they
 felt
 that


that
 was
 the
 stereotype.
 So,
 like
 pretty


much
 every
 character,
 like
 there
 was


there
 was
 people
 who
 were
 and
 again


these
 were
 cringes.
 It
 wasn't
 like
 mass


commentary
 on
 this,
 but
 there
 like
 they


managed
 to
 insult
 like
 every
 protected


group
 uh
 in
 a
 way
 that
 like
 ev
 like


everyone
 kind
 of
 was
 like,
 well,
 yeah,


but
 it's
 it's
 satire,
 right?
 So,
 it
 it


was
 a
 totally
 different
 time
 in
 America,


but
 it
 wasn't
 just
 um
 you
 know,
 focus
 on


on
 race
 relations.
 I
 mean,
 it
 was
 on,


you
 know,
 we
 had
 a
 again,
 we
 had
 a


Vietnam
 P
 running
 for
 president
 that


year


>> and
 and
 basically
 a
 mockery,
 like
 the


greatest
 mockery
 of
 Vietnam
 film
 ever


made.
 So,
 in
 some
 ways,
 it's
 like
 this


film
 was
 just
 like
 so
 perfectly
 timed


for
 the
 era
 we
 were
 living
 in.


>> Well,
 we
 still
 have
 to
 this
 day,
 let's


not
 names
 on
 on
 a
 on
 a
 otherwise
 a
 fun
 a


fun
 podcast,
 but
 there
 there
 are
 sitting


United
 States
 politicians
 in
 in
 serious


offices
 who
 like
 literally
 faked
 Vietnam


War
 records.


>> Like
 that
 like
 that's
 not
 over.
 like


that's
 actually
 still
 the
 case.
 Um,
 and


so
 to
 to
 your
 point
 like
 you
 know
 there


there
 were
 many
 people
 obviously
 who


served
 very
 honorably
 in
 Vietnam
 and


then
 there
 were
 people
 who
 like
 made
 up


completely
 fake
 stories
 and
 wrote
 them


the
 rest
 of
 their
 career.
 Um,
 and
 like


you
 know
 that
 Yeah.
 So
 the
 movie
 takes


like
 it's
 your
 point
 movie
 among
 other


things
 takes
 direct
 aim
 at
 that


>> and
 I
 I
 believe
 the
 guy
 wears
 a
 hook
 the


whole
 film
 with
 glasses
 hand.
 I
 mean


like
 there's
 like
 this
 movie
 is
 so


brilliant.
 It's
 so
 brilliant
 and
 the


levels
 of
 of
 commentary
 um
 just
 are
 are


remarkable
 to
 this
 day.


>> Yes.
 Yes.
 And
 so
 yes.
 Yes.
 Cute.
 Yes.
 I


mean
 just
 like
 so
 yeah
 maybe
 this
 is


book
 ends
 the
 the
 previous
 previous


conversation
 of
 just
 like
 Yes.
 This
 is


clearly
 made
 before
 the
 culture
 before


our
 version
 of
 the
 cultural
 revolution.


Um
 and
 so
 it's
 it's
 it's
 like
 a
 it's


like
 it's
 like
 an
 ancient
 artifact.
 Um


uh
 um
 like
 I
 say
 only
 now
 are
 we


re-emerging
 into
 a
 world
 in
 which
 a


movie
 like
 that
 could
 be
 made
 like
 for
 a


movie
 like
 that
 for
 the
 last
 probably


what
 13
 years
 or
 something
 would
 have


been
 totally
 off
 limits.
 Um
 and
 we're


coming
 out
 into
 a
 world
 now
 where
 movies


like
 that
 can
 get
 made
 again.


>> Yeah.
 Jimmy
 Kimmel
 is
 not
 going to
 bring


back
 the
 man
 show


to
 his
 uh
 his
 his
 roots.
 Um


>> for
 people
 who
 followed
 Yes.
 For
 people


who
 don't
 get
 the
 reference,
 for
 anybody


who
 followed
 the
 recent
 Jimmy
 Kimmel
 uh


sort
 of
 affair
 and
 all
 of
 the
 outrage,


uh
 it
 is
 worth
 going
 on
 YouTube
 and
 just


yeah,
 looking
 at
 clips
 from
 a
 Jimmy


Kimmel
 show
 20
 years
 ago,
 which
 was


literally
 called
 The
 Man
 Show.
 Um
 and
 uh


to
 just
 to
 get
 a
 sense
 of
 the
 uh
 the
 the


long
 and
 twist
 the
 long
 and
 twisty
 road


that
 some
 of
 our
 uh
 some
 of
 our
 highest


most
 famous
 public
 figures
 have


followed.


>> And
 also
 a
 tale
 of
 a
 tale
 of
 two


comedians,
 right?
 Because
 it's
 him
 and


and
 Adam
 Corolla,
 right?
 And
 it's
 like


their
 their
 careers
 have
 detoutored


dramatically
 since
 since
 the
 show.


>> Yes,
 that's
 right.


>> Two
 other
 films
 we
 wanted
 to
 discuss
 uh


were
 Oenheimer
 and
 Fight
 Club.


>> So,
 let's
 start
 with
 let's
 start
 with


let's
 start
 with
 Oppenheimer
 just


because
 it's
 it's
 more
 it's
 it's
 more


recent.
 So,
 I
 I
 I
 will
 make
 the
 case.


So,
 I'm
 a
 I'm
 a
 you
 know
 enormous


Christopher
 Nolan
 fan.
 I've
 seen
 all
 his


movies.
 I
 love
 all
 his
 movies.
 I
 I
 think


they're
 really
 tremendous.
 Um
 you
 know,


I
 I
 think
 that
 I
 you
 know,
 let
 me
 say


this.
 I'm
 I
 think
 Tenant
 is
 one
 of the


best
 movies
 I've
 ever
 seen.
 Um,
 and
 like


I
 I
 I
 I
 sat
 through
 Tenant
 with
 a
 giant


smile
 on
 my
 face
 the
 entire
 movie.
 Like


I
 just
 thought
 that
 was
 just
 like


absolute
 magic.
 Obviously
 I
 loved


Inception.
 Uh,
 I
 loved
 many
 of
 his


movies.
 Um,
 and
 I
 think
 Oenheimer
 was


like
 an
 incredibly
 well-made
 movie.
 Um,


and
 had,
 you
 know,
 incredible


performances
 and
 was
 was
 like,
 you
 know,


put
 together
 really
 well.
 It
 was,
 you


know,
 tremendously
 interesting
 to
 watch.


I
 I
 I
 I
 will
 argue
 that
 it
 did
 not
 re


reach
 our
 level
 of
 capital
 A
 art.
 Uh,
 I


think
 it
 it
 actually
 quite
 badly
 fell


short
 um
 on
 sort
 of
 uh
 I
 would
 say


morality
 and
 um
 and
 uh
 and
 ultimately


and
 and
 in
 importance
 uh
 to
 our
 culture.


But
 uh
 yeah,
 let
 me
 I'm
 be
 happy
 to
 get


my
 feel
 on
 that.
 But
 let
 me
 just
 start


by
 saying
 C
 Katherine,
 would
 just
 out
 of


the
 gate,
 would
 you
 agree
 with
 me
 on


that
 or
 would
 you
 like
 to
 would
 you
 like


to
 take
 that
 would
 you
 like
 to
 take
 the


pro
 side
 that
 Oppenheimer
 was
 great
 art?


No,
 I
 I I
 agree
 with
 you,
 but
 I
 probably


I
 probably
 concur
 like
 I
 probably
 have


different
 reasons
 um
 than
 you
 as
 to
 why


I
 didn't
 think
 it
 worked.
 Like
 and
 I


should
 I
 should
 preface
 it
 with
 like
 I
 I


had
 hyped
 this
 movie
 so
 much
 where
 my


expectations
 might
 have
 been
 so


ridiculously
 high
 that
 when
 I
 finally


saw
 it,
 I
 was
 like
 me.
 But
 I
 do
 think


it's
 interesting
 Robert
 Downey
 Jr.
 was


all
 he
 won
 the
 Academy
 Award
 finally
 for


Oenheimer.
 He
 deserved
 it
 for
 Tropic


Thunder.
 I
 he
 was
 fantastic
 in
 the


movie,
 but
 I
 will
 say
 he
 deserved
 it
 for


Tropic
 Thunder
 and
 if
 not
 for
 Heath


Ledger,
 he
 would
 have
 won
 it
 for
 Tropic


Thunder
 and
 I
 feel
 like
 that
 that
 would


have
 been
 really
 the
 role
 he
 should
 have


won
 it
 for,
 but
 he
 was
 fantastic
 in


Oenheimer
 as
 well.
 So,
 to
 your
 point,


like
 there
 there
 were
 there
 were
 many


good
 uh
 performances.
 My
 my
 sort
 of


criticism
 is
 probably
 different
 than


yours,
 but
 it
 probably
 has
 a
 lot
 more
 to


do
 with
 like
 the
 actual
 sort
 of


storytelling
 and
 film
 making
 than
 the


actual
 um
 content
 of
 of
 the
 of
 the
 work.


>> Okay,
 got
 it.
 Yeah.
 So
 I
 because
 I
 would


say
 so
 for
 people
 who
 haven't
 seen
 it,


we're
 going
 to
 spoil
 it.
 So,
 uh,
 Robert


Robert
 Robert
 Downey
 plays,
 uh,
 a
 real


life
 guy
 named
 Lewis
 Strauss,
 uh,
 who


was
 a,
 um,
 he
 was
 a
 very
 high
 ranking


like
 sort
 of
 important
 person
 of
 the
 of


the
 of
 the
 1950s,
 1960s
 in
 the


government.
 Um,
 and,
 uh,
 ended
 up
 I


forget
 the
 exact
 role,
 but
 basically


ended
 up
 overseeing
 um,
 uh,
 Oppenheimer


having
 a
 security
 clearance
 stripped
 and


and
 basically
 being
 booted
 out
 of
 the


out
 of
 the
 military-industrial
 complex


after
 after,
 you
 know,
 basically
 leading


the
 creation
 of
 the
 atomic
 bomb.
 Um,
 and


the
 the
 movie
 kind
 of
 goes
 through
 that


whole
 story.
 Um,
 uh,
 and
 you
 know,
 it's


a
 fantastic
 performance.
 All
 the
 all
 I


mean,
 look,
 all
 the
 performances
 in
 the


movie
 were
 fantastic.
 Uh,
 Jillian
 Murphy


was
 just
 outstanding
 as
 Oppenheimer
 and


and
 then
 was
 it
 Benny,
 I
 think
 it's


Benny
 Safy,
 one
 of
 the
 Safety
 brothers,


uh,
 played
 um,
 Edward
 Teller
 um,
 and


like
 almost
 just
 stole
 the
 movie
 just


with
 that
 portrayal.
 Um,
 and
 again,
 you


know,
 a
 real
 person,
 the
 creator
 of the


later
 the
 creator
 of
 the
 hydrogen
 bomb.


Anyway,
 so
 fantastic
 performances,


fantastic
 direction.
 Um
 I
 I
 will
 argue


my
 my
 critique
 of
 the
 movie
 though
 it


involves
 the
 following
 claim
 which
 is


that
 Louiswis
 Strauss
 is
 actually
 the


hero
 of
 the
 movie.


>> Yes.
 May
 maybe
 go
 into
 that
 history
 so


people
 understand
 um
 because
 that
 is


definitely
 not
 the
 takeaway
 from
 the


film.


>> Yes.
 That
 is
 not
 what
 the
 film
 intent
 uh


uh
 you
 know
 the
 film
 intended
 I
 think


the
 film
 in
 see
 if
 Katherine
 would
 agree


with
 this.
 The
 film
 intended
 to
 contrast


basically
 a
 great
 man
 Oppenheimer
 to


basically
 a
 u
 an an
 as
 an
 an
 aspirate
 to


greatness
 who
 you
 know
 fell
 badly
 short


in
 in
 the
 Louis
 Dra
 character
 who
 sort


of
 brought
 the
 great
 man
 low
 and
 in
 a
 in


a
 fun
 fundamentally
 unfair
 way.
 And
 then


it
 sort
 of
 the
 movie
 sort
 of
 sets
 up


both
 uh
 Oppenheimer
 and
 actually
 also


specifically
 Albert
 Einstein
 as
 sort
 of


the
 key
 moral
 authorities
 um
 of
 of
 the


era
 with
 respect
 to
 use
 of
 nuclear


weapons.
 Both
 both
 claims
 of
 which
 I


believe
 are
 like
 deeply
 incorrect
 um
 on


substance.
 Um
 and
 this
 is
 my
 critique
 of


so
 my
 critique
 of
 the
 movie
 is
 not
 in
 it


execution
 or
 any
 of
 the
 performances.
 My


critique
 is
 the
 morality
 of
 the
 movie
 I


think
 is
 very
 badly
 upside
 down.
 Um
 and


and
 it's
 upside
 down
 in
 a
 way
 that
 kind


of
 flatters
 our
 current
 politics
 but


like
 is
 very
 badly
 upside
 down
 in
 terms


of
 what
 actually
 happened
 at
 the
 time.


Um
 and
 so
 the
 the
 movie
 basically
 tells


the
 story
 of
 course
 Robert
 Oenheimer
 the


the
 sort
 of
 person
 who
 ran
 the
 the


Manhattan
 project
 created
 the
 atomic


bomb
 which
 was
 then
 you
 know
 at least


his
 story
 where
 he
 gets
 credit
 for
 you


know
 helping
 to
 end
 World
 War
 II
 you


know
 when
 when
 when
 the
 US
 dropped


dropped
 you
 know
 there
 won't
 be
 only
 two


uses
 of
 the
 atomic
 bomb
 in
 wartime
 you


know
 to
 date
 where
 you
 know
 the
 US


dropped
 dropped
 a
 bomb
 on
 Japan
 twice
 in


1945
 and
 you
 know
 and
 there
 you
 know


there's
 even
 still
 to
 this
 day
 debate


about
 this
 but
 you
 know
 generally


accepted
 history
 I
 think
 is
 that
 that


you
 know
 that
 ended
 the
 the
 the
 Pacific


theater
 conflict,
 you
 know,
 sooner
 than


it
 would
 have.
 It
 it
 prevented
 the
 need


for
 a
 land
 invasion
 of
 Japan,
 you
 know,


you
 know,
 conceivably,
 you
 know,
 saved


like
 a
 million
 lives
 or
 something
 like


that.
 Now,
 by
 the
 way,
 it
 was
 dropping


the
 atomic
 bomb
 on
 two
 civilian
 cities,


right?
 So,
 again,
 you
 know,
 like
 the


morality
 of
 the
 time
 was,
 you
 know,


quite
 a
 bit
 different
 than,
 you
 know,


than
 maybe
 ours
 today,
 but
 but
 anyway,


so
 that's
 that's
 kind
 of the
 history
 of


it.
 And
 then,
 you
 know,
 famously,
 the


Manhattan
 Project
 was
 sort
 of
 this


assembly
 of
 of
 sort
 of
 the
 finest
 minds


uh
 in
 America.
 Many
 many
 of
 whom
 by
 the


way
 were
 you
 know
 refugee
 you
 know
 uh


not
 not
 up
 I'm
 up
 and
 I
 character


actually
 is
 a
 is
 a
 is
 a
 in
 in
 the
 movie


in
 in
 reality
 and
 in
 the
 movie
 is
 German


Jewish
 whose
 you
 know
 had
 who
 his
 family


had
 arrived
 much
 earlier
 um
 and
 but
 then


a
 lot
 of
 the
 other
 key
 members
 of
 the
 uh


Manhattan
 project
 you
 know
 kind
 of
 been


one
 of the
 great
 twists
 of
 irony
 were


Hungarian
 Jewish
 refugees
 from
 you
 know


from
 from
 basically
 the
 Nazi
 kind
 of


rampage
 through
 Europe
 you
 know
 who
 came


to
 the
 US
 and
 and
 and
 basically
 you
 know


helped
 arm
 up
 the
 US
 which
 Edward
 Teller


was
 an
 example
 of
 that
 um
 and
 So
 anyway,


so
 the
 movie
 tells
 this,
 you
 know,
 kind


of
 the
 amazing
 story
 of
 of
 the
 Manhattan


Project,
 but
 specifically
 in
 the
 arc
 of


of
 Oppenheimer,
 um,
 I
 guess
 I
 would
 say


that
 the
 the
 the
 the


conventional,
 let
 me
 back
 up
 for
 a
 sec.


I
 think
 the
 first
 half
 of
 the
 movie
 I


think
 is
 actually
 quite
 historically


grounded
 and
 I
 think
 has
 like
 I
 I
 like
 I


at
 least
 I
 agreed
 with
 this


interpretation
 of
 history.
 And
 so
 it
 is


the
 following.
 So
 the
 first
 half
 and
 I


think
 the
 movie
 is
 maybe
 a
 little
 bit


schizophrenic
 and
 I
 should
 give
 it
 a


little
 bit
 more
 credit
 than
 I
 than
 I


was.
 But
 like
 the
 first
 half
 of
 the


movie
 is
 actually
 a
 it's
 one
 of
 the
 only


recreations
 on
 film
 of
 what
 American


elite
 culture
 and
 society
 and
 American


um
 uh
 research
 establishment
 of
 kind
 of


the
 leading
 experts
 at
 the
 time
 the


1920s
 and
 30s
 like
 how
 thoroughly


saturated
 that
 that
 world
 was
 communism.


Um
 and
 and
 specifically
 it
 sort
 of


recreates
 uh
 you
 know
 this
 sort
 of
 the


there's
 actually
 there's
 actually
 a
 joke


in
 the
 movie
 there's
 a
 line
 in
 the
 movie


that
 sort
 of
 one
 of
 these
 one
 of
 these


jokes
 is
 not
 really
 a
 joke
 which
 is
 the


joke
 is
 you
 know
 cuz
 the
 a
 lot
 of
 the


movie
 takes
 place
 as
 is
 set
 up
 as
 at
 UC


Berkeley
 um
 and
 uh
 there's
 sort
 of
 a


joke
 a
 joke
 in
 the
 movie
 which
 is
 like


you
 know
 well
 you
 know
 you
 know
 it's
 so


and
 so
 on
 the
 Berkeley
 faculty
 you
 know


is
 a
 communist
 somebody
 else
 will
 says


yes
 like
 half
 the
 Berkeley
 faculty
 are


communists
 like
 every
 like
 everybody


knows
 that
 like
 it's
 just
 completely


taken
 for
 granted
 and
 of
 course
 you
 know


the
 the
 politics
 of
 that
 aside
 the
 issue


becomes,
 okay,
 now
 they're
 working
 on
 a


classified
 weapons
 program.
 Um,
 you


know,
 the
 US
 is,
 you
 know,
 is
 kind
 of


variously
 at
 odds
 with
 not
 just
 Germany,


but
 also
 with
 Soviet
 Russia.
 Um,
 and,


you
 know,
 there's
 this
 very
 big
 concern,


you
 know,
 we're,
 you
 know,
 the
 the
 this


effort
 is
 is
 is
 inventing
 this,
 you


know,
 super
 weapon.
 Uh,
 and
 there
 was
 a,


you
 know,
 very
 high
 degree
 of
 concern


that
 the
 the
 secrets
 of
 of
 the
 atomic


bomb
 were
 going
 to,
 you
 know,
 just
 walk


their
 way
 out
 the
 out
 the
 door
 from
 Los


Alamos.
 were
 going
 to
 end
 up
 at,
 you


know,
 bad
 people's
 hands,
 you
 know,
 and


one
 fear
 obviously
 was
 that
 they'd
 end


up
 in
 Hitler's
 hands,
 but
 another
 fear


was
 they
 would
 end
 up
 in
 Stalin's
 hands.


And
 by
 the
 way,
 spoiler
 alert,
 that's


exactly
 what
 happened.
 So
 So
 in
 fact,


the
 nuclear
 secrets
 will
 walk
 right
 out


the
 door.
 Um
 and
 um
 you
 know
 and
 and


basically
 the
 both
 the
 the
 the
 concepts


of
 the
 atomic
 bomb
 and
 then
 actually
 the


specific
 wiring
 instructions
 uh
 for
 the


atomic
 bomb
 were
 actually
 walking
 right


out
 the
 back
 door
 of
 Los
 Alamos
 into


into
 into
 into
 Soviet's
 hands
 and
 Stalin


got
 the
 bomb
 very
 quickly
 after
 that
 and


it
 was
 directly
 derived
 from
 the
 work


that
 actually
 happened
 on
 the
 Manhattan


project.
 And
 so
 it
 turned
 out
 the


Manhattan
 project
 like
 it
 really
 was


riddled
 in the
 contra
 spies
 and
 there


there's
 these
 famous
 names
 in
 history


like
 the
 Rosenbergs
 and
 David
 Greenlass


that
 you
 can
 go
 through
 and
 read
 about


if
 you
 want.
 But
 like
 it
 like
 the
 the


fears
 of
 all
 of
 the
 people
 who
 are


worried
 about
 this
 were
 actually


correct.
 It
 is
 actually
 what
 happened.


Um
 by
 the
 way
 there's
 a
 character
 in
 the


movie
 Boris
 Pash
 who
 is
 sort
 of
 the


security
 officer
 at
 the
 Manhattan


Project
 both
 in
 real
 life
 and
 in
 the


movie.
 In
 the
 movie,
 he's
 sort
 of


portrayed
 as
 this
 like
 guy
 with


basically
 essentially
 a
 stick
 up
 his


butt
 like
 this
 like
 guy
 who's
 like,
 you


know,
 like
 constantly
 like,
 you
 know,


cross-examining
 and
 not
 trusting
 the


scientists
 and
 thinks
 that
 I'm


Oenheimer's
 probably
 a
 spy
 and
 the
 whole


thing.
 He's
 kind
 of
 portrayed
 as
 this


like
 over
 the
 top,
 you
 know,
 kind
 of


thing.
 But
 like
 if
 you
 if
 you
 go
 if
 you


read
 his
 Wikipedia
 entry
 of
 like
 what


his
 life
 story
 had
 been
 up
 until
 that


point,
 he's
 another
 one
 of
 these
 guys


where
 just
 like
 he
 has
 just
 this


incredibly
 impressive
 backstory
 of
 like


service
 to
 the
 country
 at
 fighting


commiss.
 Um
 and
 then
 you
 know
 and
 then


like
 you
 know
 whether
 he
 was
 right
 about


Oenheimer
 we
 could
 talk
 about
 but
 like


he
 was
 right
 that
 like
 Los
 Alamos
 would


run
 with
 cognitive
 spies
 and
 this
 is


going
 to
 lead
 to
 catastrophe
 you
 know


with
 with
 Stalin
 getting
 the
 bomb.
 Um


and
 then
 you
 know
 the
 Strauss
 character


was
 also
 very
 worried
 about
 that
 and


again
 you
 know
 outside
 of
 whether
 he
 was


right
 about
 Oppenheimer
 per
 se.
 He
 was


he
 was
 right
 about
 the
 he
 was
 right


about
 the
 broader
 issue.
 Um
 and
 so
 so so


that
 is
 what
 actually
 that
 that
 is
 what


actually
 happened.
 Um,
 and
 so
 like
 all


of
 the
 security
 concerns
 that
 are
 kind


of
 a
 setup
 to
 what
 you
 know
 is
 sort
 of


portrayed
 as
 the
 persecution
 of
 Robert


Oppenheimer,
 like
 they
 were
 all


completely
 legitimate
 security
 concerns.


And
 in
 fact,
 the
 worst
 case
 scenario


actually
 did
 happen.
 Like
 all
 the


secrets
 like
 walked
 right
 out
 the
 door,


went
 straight
 to
 Stalin.
 The
 first


Soviet,
 we
 now
 know
 this,
 the
 first


Soviet
 atomic
 bomb
 was
 wire
 for
 wire


compatible
 with
 the
 US
 Nagasaki
 bomb,


right?
 So,
 so,
 so,
 so,
 so
 they
 got


literally
 the
 wiring
 threats.
 And,
 you


know,
 for
 for
 people
 who
 have
 read
 about


nuclear
 weapons,
 like
 it's
 actually
 very


hard
 to
 detonate
 a
 nuke
 and
 they
 have
 to


be
 wired
 in
 a
 very
 specific
 way.
 Uh
 it's


like
 you
 can't
 they're
 very
 difficult
 to


set
 off
 and
 like
 the
 Soviet
 spies
 on
 the


Manhattan
 project
 literally
 like


transferred
 that
 information
 to
 to to
 to


Russia
 B
 nuclear
 power.
 Um
 and
 so
 anyway


like
 within
 that
 there's
 this
 arc
 of


basically
 Oenheimer
 you
 know
 was
 he
 or


was
 he
 not
 there's
 one
 arc
 actually


which
 is
 was
 he
 or
 was
 he
 not
 himself
 a


Soviet
 asset
 which
 is
 it's
 generally


viewed
 historically
 that
 he
 wasn't


literally
 a
 Soviet
 asset
 although
 I


think
 there
 are
 still
 questions
 around


that
 in
 fairness
 and
 we
 could
 talk
 about


that
 but
 then
 there's
 just
 this
 broader


thing
 which
 is
 even
 if
 he
 wasn't
 like


was
 he
 trustworthy
 and
 could
 could
 he
 be


relied
 upon
 and
 then
 there
 was
 this


specific
 thing
 that
 actually
 happened


which
 the
 movie
 presents
 a
 version
 of


that
 I
 think
 is
 not
 is
 my
 understanding


history
 is
 not
 correct
 but
 which


Oppenheimer
 basically
 u
 worked
 his
 butt


off
 to
 to
 deliver
 the
 atomic
 bomb
 for


the
 purpose
 of
 beating
 Germany
 and


Japan.
 Um
 but
 then
 immediately
 upon
 that


happening,
 the
 US
 weapons
 program


shifted
 into
 making
 the
 hydrogen
 bomb


which
 was
 going
 to
 be
 the
 you
 know
 the


big
 one
 that
 was
 going
 to
 be
 used


ultimately
 you
 know
 ultimately
 was
 going


to
 be
 used
 in
 the
 cold
 war
 you
 know
 as


as
 a
 deterrent
 against
 the
 Soviet
 Union


you
 know
 at
 a
 project
 led
 by
 Edward


Teller
 um
 and
 um
 and
 and
 the
 accusation


always
 was
 Oenheimer
 deliberately
 slow


roll
 the
 development
 of
 the
 hydrogen


bomb
 like
 he
 he
 tried
 to
 prevent
 that


from
 happening
 of
 course
 the
 the
 the
 you


know
 and
 you
 know
 Oppenheimer's
 version


of
 the
 story
 is
 it's
 one
 thing
 to
 like


have
 a
 nuc
 take
 out
 a
 city
 if
 to
 end
 a


war
 it's
 another
 thing
 to
 have
 a
 nuke


that
 could
 take
 out
 the
 planet.
 Uh,
 you


know,
 and
 and
 and
 so
 like,
 you
 know,


should
 we
 really
 be
 doing
 this?
 But


there's
 another
 version
 of
 the
 story


which
 is
 you
 were
 completely
 in
 favor
 of


beating
 Germany
 and
 Japan
 and
 then
 but


the
 minute
 it
 came
 to
 beating
 the
 Soviet


Union,
 you
 know,
 you
 got
 cold
 feet.
 Hm.


You
 know,
 isn't
 that
 interesting?
 Right?


That
 that
 that
 that's
 the
 thing
 that
 you


didn't
 want
 to
 have
 happen.
 And
 then


there's
 just
 the
 reality
 that
 like


Oppenheimer's
 background
 and
 political


activities
 and
 like
 all
 of
 the
 people


around
 him
 including
 his
 wife
 and
 his


girlfriend
 and
 his
 brother
 were
 actual


like
 I
 don't
 believe
 this
 to
 be
 the


case.
 I
 think
 his
 wife,
 his
 girlfriend,


and
 and
 his
 brother
 were
 all
 actual


communists,
 like
 actual
 capital
 C
 carry


communists.
 And
 then
 Alenheimer
 himself


was
 like
 embroiled
 in
 communism
 and
 it's


it's
 sort
 of
 communist,
 you
 know,
 sort


of
 adjacent
 organizations,
 you
 know,
 his


entire
 life.
 He
 he's
 not
 known
 ever
 have


been
 a
 member
 of
 the
 Communist
 Party.


Although
 again
 there's
 there's
 there's
 u


there's
 ambiguity
 there
 because
 the


Soviets
 had
 a
 practice
 of
 having
 their


best
 placed
 assets
 actually
 never
 become


members
 of
 the
 communist
 party
 because


of
 course
 they
 were
 trying
 to
 protect


them
 against
 exactly
 the
 kind
 of


persecution
 that
 Oppenheimer
 got
 got got


leveled
 against
 him.
 U
 so
 anyway
 so
 in


in
 the
 movie
 ultimately
 his
 security


clearance
 gets
 gets
 stripped
 and
 he
 sort


of
 resigns
 to
 disgrace.
 The
 movie
 paints


this
 as
 like
 a
 great
 act
 of
 moral


heroism
 on
 his
 part
 where
 basically
 he


wanted
 credit
 for
 the
 little
 bomb,
 but


he
 didn't
 want
 the
 big
 bomb
 to
 happen


and
 certainly
 didn't
 want
 to
 have


anything
 to
 do
 with
 it.
 Um,
 you
 know,


and
 and
 look,
 you
 know,
 he's
 dead.


They're
 all
 dead.
 Like,
 you
 know,
 I
 I


don't
 know
 that
 we'll
 ever
 know
 like


what
 what
 what
 lay
 in
 their
 hearts,
 but


there
 are
 very
 interesting
 questions


around
 this.
 Um,
 and
 then
 there's
 the


the
 and
 then
 there's
 my
 most
 stinging


indictment
 of
 the
 movie,
 which
 is


Einstein
 was
 the
 exact
 opposite
 of


immoral
 exemplar.
 Uh,
 Einstein
 was
 a


Stalinist.
 like
 Einstein
 was
 like
 a


fullon
 like
 Einstein
 was
 proto
 Stalin


like
 not
 even
 just
 procommunism
 was


actually
 like
 pro
 Stalin
 and
 Einstein


thought
 but
 like
 American
 democracy
 was


like
 not
 going
 to
 cut
 it
 and
 like
 we


clearly
 needed
 to
 get
 to
 communist


dictatorship
 and
 there's
 a
 there's
 a


book
 that
 goes
 through
 this
 called
 when


reason
 goes
 on
 holiday
 uh
 that
 came
 out


a
 few
 years
 ago
 that
 kind
 of
 goes


through
 all
 of
 Einstein's
 writings
 and


speeches
 and
 kind
 of
 reconstructs
 this


history
 and
 so
 the
 movie
 kind
 of


presents
 Oenheimer
 and
 Einstein
 as
 like


the
 adults
 and
 especially
 Einstein
 as


like
 the
 moral
 adults
 in
 the
 room
 uh
 to


a
 degree
 that
 I
 just
 think
 is
 like


basically
 at
 this
 point
 bizarre
 and
 the


and
 the
 reason
 it's
 bizarre
 is
 because


you
 know
 the
 whole
 thing
 is
 set
 up
 of


like
 oh
 my
 god
 what
 if
 the
 atomic
 bomb


destroys
 the
 world
 oh
 my
 god
 you
 know


this
 whole
 thing
 and
 all
 politics


involved
 in
 that
 so
 the
 beginning
 and
 so


forth
 but
 like
 we're
 sitting
 here
 80


years
 later
 and
 and
 the
 thing
 that
 we


know
 today
 and
 I
 don't
 know
 that
 any
 of


us
 would
 choose
 to
 have
 had
 the
 events


play
 out
 this
 way
 and
 maybe
 the
 world


would
 be
 better
 without
 the
 bomb
 or


whatever
 but
 like
 what
 we
 know
 today
 is


World
 War
 II
 didn't
 happen
 um
 and
 so


basically
 like
 everybody
 everybody
 in


sort
 of
 the
 military
 political


establishment
 in
 1945
 kind
 of
 took
 it


for
 granted
 that
 there
 was
 going
 to
 be


World
 War
 II
 with
 the
 Soviet
 Union
 at


some
 point.
 Um,
 and
 it
 was
 going to
 be a


land
 war,
 you
 know,
 in
 Europe
 and
 around


the
 world
 and
 it
 was
 going
 to
 kill


probably,
 you
 know,
 on
 the
 order
 of
 200


million
 people
 and
 it
 was
 just
 going to


be
 absolutely
 devastating.
 And
 like,
 you


know,
 in
 any
 other
 era
 like
 of
 of
 of


sort
 of
 geopolitics,
 like
 that
 almost


certainly
 would
 have
 happened
 given
 how


given
 how
 tense
 everything
 got,


especially
 in
 the
 ' 60s
 and
 ' 70s.
 Like,


literally,
 it
 didn't
 happen.
 Like
 World


War
 II
 is
 is
 is
 the
 dog
 that
 didn't


bite.
 And
 and
 the
 reason
 World
 War
 II


didn't
 happen
 is
 sort
 of,
 I
 think,


fairly
 obvious,
 which
 was
 mutually


assured
 destruction,
 right?
 that
 the


fact
 that
 both
 sides
 had
 nukes
 basically


meant
 that
 neither
 side
 could
 go
 to
 war


with
 the
 other
 and
 that
 resulted
 in
 you


know
 it
 resulted
 in
 a
 cold
 war
 but
 not
 a


hot
 war.
 Um,
 and
 so
 I,
 you
 know,
 I
 think


if
 you
 kind
 of
 stack
 up
 Oppenheimer
 and


Teller
 and
 these
 guys,
 you
 kind
 of
 say,


you
 know,
 by
 by
 by
 by
 building
 bombs


that
 could
 destroy
 the
 world,
 they


prevented
 at
 least
 one,
 you
 know,
 major


world
 war,
 if
 if,
 you
 know,
 by
 the
 way,


if
 if
 not
 many.
 Uh,
 and
 by
 the
 way,
 the


existence
 of
 nukes
 may
 prevent
 another


world
 war
 for
 500
 years,
 right?
 You


know,
 we
 don't
 know
 yet,
 but
 like,
 you


know,
 like
 that
 that
 mutually
 assured


destruction
 is
 is is
 still
 in
 effect.


They
 may
 be
 they
 may
 be
 uh
 they
 may
 be


causing
 us
 to
 not
 have
 a
 hot
 war
 with


with
 China,
 right?
 The
 fact
 that
 both


the
 US
 and
 China
 have
 nukes.
 Um,
 and
 so


anyway,
 so
 and
 and
 by
 the
 way,
 that's


all
 debatable
 and
 you
 could
 argue
 that,


but
 like
 that's
 the
 argument
 that's
 the


argument
 that
 ought
 to
 happen
 like


especially
 with
 what
 we
 know
 today.
 And


I
 just
 thought
 the
 movie
 like
 I
 thought


the
 movie
 just
 like
 really
 cheated
 on


the
 morality
 of
 it
 because
 it
 kind
 of


presented
 this
 as
 slam
 dunk
 that
 the


nuke
 was
 bad
 and
 that
 these
 people
 were


bad
 and
 the
 whole
 thing
 was
 bad
 and
 that


Einstein
 was
 like
 a
 or
 sorry
 that
 both


Einstein
 and
 Oenheim
 were
 moral
 heroes


in
 some
 extent
 kind
 of
 trying
 to
 line
 up


against
 this
 and
 I
 just
 thought
 that


that
 really
 cheated
 the
 audience.
 I
 I
 I


think
 uh
 I
 think
 you
 and
 I
 are
 much


closer
 on
 our
 critique
 of
 it.
 My
 my


sense
 is
 very
 similar
 to
 yours
 that
 it


started
 out
 very
 strong,
 right?
 Like


like
 your
 your
 the
 portrayal
 in
 Berkeley


like
 was
 a
 very
 interesting,
 you
 know,


like
 you
 kind
 of
 you
 saw
 this
 complex


figure
 and
 complex
 character
 and
 then


there's
 this
 whole
 middle
 section
 um
 on


the
 Manhattan
 Project
 that
 kind
 of


culminates
 in
 what
 I
 would
 say
 is
 like


incredible
 like
 visuals
 and
 sound.
 Like


actually
 like
 the
 movie
 excels
 in
 both


score
 and
 sound.
 And
 if
 you
 saw
 it
 in
 a


theater,
 you
 were
 like
 the
 the the
 sound


editing
 is
 like
 the
 thing
 that
 won
 the


Oscar,
 right?
 I
 think
 they
 won
 10


Oscars.
 I
 mean,
 they
 won
 everything,
 but


it's
 like
 like
 sound
 editing
 and
 score


like
 just
 incredible
 movie
 making.
 And


then
 to
 your
 to
 use
 your
 word,


schizophrenic,
 like
 the
 third
 part,


which
 is
 all
 about,
 you
 know,
 Robert


Downey
 Junior's
 Junior's
 character
 being


like
 a
 villain.
 It
 sort
 of
 ends
 with


this,
 you
 know,
 there's
 this
 brilliant


scene
 that
 I
 think
 everyone
 remembers


where
 they
 show
 him
 giving
 a
 speech
 to


all
 the
 people
 at
 Los
 Alamos
 and
 then


they
 show
 like
 him
 envisioning
 bodies
 um


in
 in
 you
 know
 in
 in
 Hiroshima,
 right?


And
 and
 you
 kind
 of
 see
 the
 justosition.


You
 see
 him
 sort
 of
 losing
 his
 his
 sort


of
 um
 his
 his
 sort
 of
 you
 know


conviction
 that
 he
 did
 the
 right
 thing.


And
 I
 feel
 like
 if
 they
 had
 just
 stopped


the
 movie
 there,
 it
 would
 have
 been
 the


commentary
 on
 like
 okay
 like
 we
 don't


really
 understand
 his
 legacy.
 But


instead
 they
 had
 to
 tie
 it
 up
 with
 it


was
 almost
 like
 if
 you
 know
 for
 for


writers
 and
 artists
 like
 if
 you
 don't


know
 how
 to
 end
 something
 you
 kind
 of


tie
 things
 up
 with
 neat
 bows
 that
 have


nothing
 to
 do
 with
 the
 thing
 that


happened
 before.
 And
 it
 felt
 like
 the


third
 section
 on
 the
 security
 clearance


and
 on
 him
 being
 a
 hero
 was
 almost
 like


the
 filmmaker's
 apology.
 Like
 actually,


no,
 no,
 I'm
 going
 to
 side
 I'm
 actually


going
 to
 paint
 this
 for
 everyone
 and


side
 that
 he
 was
 actually
 a
 good
 man
 and


and
 there's
 there's
 no
 sort
 of
 moral


ambiguity
 about
 this
 this
 figure.
 like


he
 was
 actually
 a
 good
 man
 and
 actually


the
 the
 real
 villains
 are
 the
 national


security
 hawks
 and
 the
 people
 in


Washington
 and
 the
 bureaucrats
 and
 like


and
 then
 it
 was
 just
 this
 sort
 of


portrayal
 of
 you
 know
 the
 evil


bureaucracy
 coming
 for
 the
 beautiful


scientists
 and
 and
 it
 sort
 of
 mimicked
 I


think
 also
 a
 conversation
 that
 was


happening
 in
 2023
 when
 it
 came
 out
 which


is
 all
 of
 these
 great
 AI
 scientists


basically
 saying
 oh
 well
 no
 AI
 is


actually
 going
 to
 kill
 us
 all
 and
 you


know
 I
 know
 this
 because
 I'm
 an
 expert


it
 was
 like
 the
 same
 sort
 of
 thing
 and
 I


kind
 of
 felt
 like
 that
 was
 also
 the
 the


sort
 language
 of
 the
 end
 of
 the
 film
 is


like,
 "No,
 no,
 it's
 normal
 for
 people


who
 who
 build
 incredible
 things
 to
 like


actually
 regret
 their
 innovation."
 And


it
 just
 felt
 like
 way
 too
 buttoned
 up


for
 a
 film
 that
 has
 a
 lot
 more


complexity
 and
 that
 if
 they
 had
 just


ended
 it
 at
 hour
 two,
 it
 would
 have
 been


a
 masterpiece.


>> Yeah.
 It
 felt
 like
 it
 wanted
 to
 conform


with
 present
 day
 morale
 like
 very
 badly.


>> Yeah.


>> Um
 Yeah.
 Exactly.
 Um
 and
 so
 that
 anyway,


so
 that's
 my
 like
 long
 extended
 argument


for
 why
 Leo
 Strauss
 was
 actually
 the


hero
 of
 the
 movie.
 U
 was
 correct.
 uh


Oppenheimer
 could
 not
 be
 trusted.


Oppenheimer
 needed
 to
 be
 rejected
 from


the
 project.
 Also,
 Lewis
 Strauss
 is


shown
 in
 the
 movie
 as
 being
 very
 jealous


of
 of
 Einstein,
 but
 if
 you
 squint,
 you


could
 say
 he
 also
 had
 Einstein's
 number.


He
 knew
 Einstein
 was
 not
 to
 be
 trusted.


Um
 uh
 which
 was
 100%
 true.
 And
 then


yeah,
 Katherine
 to
 your
 point
 like
 it


like
 if
 you
 again
 I
 guess
 exactly
 right


what
 you
 just
 said
 the
 comparison
 to
 AI


like
 if
 you
 read
 the
 history
 of
 of
 those


people
 at
 that
 time
 specifically
 people


like
 Oppenheimer
 you
 realize
 yeah
 the


people
 who
 invent
 the
 technology
 have
 no


special
 moral
 claim.
 uh
 they
 have
 no


special
 predictive
 power
 for
 the


consequence
 of
 the
 technology
 and
 they


have
 no
 no
 basis
 for
 a
 superior
 moral


claim
 on
 the
 implications
 of
 the


technology.
 Um
 and
 and
 I
 will
 say
 this


the
 movie
 you
 know
 the
 movie
 being
 made


by
 geniuses
 like
 there
 was
 a
 scene
 in


the
 movie
 that
 actually
 did
 kind
 of
 hit


that
 uh
 which
 was
 which
 was
 which
 was


based
 on
 a
 real
 life
 thing
 that
 happened


which
 was
 Oenheimer
 after
 the
 war


visited
 Harry
 Truman
 at
 the
 in
 the
 White


House.
 Um
 and
 basically
 and
 and
 this
 is


sort
 of
 in
 in
 the
 histories
 in
 the
 real


world
 histories
 Oenheimer
 basically
 went


to
 Truman
 and
 bas
 essentially
 basically


confessed
 enormous
 guilt
 uh
 for
 having


built
 the
 atomic
 bomb
 and
 for
 for
 having


you
 know
 for
 the
 US
 having
 dropped
 it
 on


on
 Japan
 and
 and
 actually
 in
 real
 life


Truman
 is
 I
 forget
 the
 exact
 quote
 but


it's
 in
 the
 Truman
 biographies.
 Uh
 you


know
 Truman
 basically
 said
 uh
 it


basically
 uh
 you
 know
 basically
 like
 got


him
 out
 of
 his
 office
 as
 fast
 as


possible
 and
 told
 his
 chief
 of
 staff


like
 I
 think
 I
 think
 the
 exact
 line
 was


never
 let
 that
 weepy
 son
 of
 a
 in


here
 again.
 Um,
 and
 then
 I
 think
 the


line
 of
 the
 movie
 is
 based
 on
 something


Truman
 apparently
 actually
 said,
 which


was,
 you
 know,
 Robert,
 you
 didn't
 make


the
 decision
 to
 drop
 the
 bomb.
 It's
 not


on
 you.
 I
 made
 the
 decision.
 Right.


Which,
 right,
 which
 which
 is
 like
 which


is
 like
 an
 incredibly
 powerful
 thing,


which
 is
 the
 dulyeleed


commander-in-chief
 of
 the
 country
 made


that
 decision
 as
 he
 should
 have
 that
 the


the
 the
 scientist
 does
 not
 have
 the


moral
 authority
 to
 decide
 how
 the


technology
 is
 used.
 It's
 it's
 the
 it's


it's
 our,
 you
 know,
 in
 our
 system
 of
 of


government
 that
 the
 the


commander-in-chief
 has
 that
 authority,


you
 know,
 in
 our
 elected


representatives.
 Um,
 and
 so
 I
 like
 to


the
 movie's
 enormous
 credit,
 it
 did


include
 that.
 It
 did
 show
 that.
 Um,
 and


again
 like
 in
 my
 fantasy
 cut
 of
 the


movie,
 that's
 the
 end
 of
 the
 movie.
 Um,


so
 they
 kind
 of
 nodded
 that,
 but
 like


like
 I
 said,
 they
 then
 then
 they
 let


then then
 they
 let
 him
 off
 the
 hook
 um


uh
 at
 the
 end.


>> Shall
 we
 close
 with
 uh
 with
 Fight
 Club?


>> Fight
 Club.
 Well,
 we
 could
 spend
 an


entire
 we
 could
 spend
 hours
 on
 just


Fight
 Club
 and
 we
 probably
 should
 at


some
 point.
 I
 I
 will
 just
 say
 about


Fight
 Club.
 Bike
 Club's
 an
 amazing
 I


it's
 like
 I
 think
 it's
 I
 I
 think
 it's


it's
 100%
 true
 art
 with
 capital
 A.
 I


think
 it's
 amazing.
 I
 think
 it's
 you


know
 definitely
 going
 to
 stand
 the
 test


of
 time,
 you
 know,
 already
 is.
 Um
 and


it's
 one
 of
 those
 movies
 and
 it's
 it's


one
 of
 those
 movies
 that
 has
 that


characteristic
 we
 talked
 about
 last
 time


where
 like
 if
 you
 watched
 it
 the
 week
 it


came
 out
 versus
 a
 year
 later
 versus
 5


years
 later
 versus
 10
 years
 later
 versus


20
 years
 versus
 30
 years
 later.
 Like
 it


it
 has
 new
 meanings
 uh
 as
 as
 as
 our


society
 evolves
 and
 and
 it's
 got
 and
 you


can
 kind
 of
 you
 can
 kind
 at
 any
 kind
 of


point
 in
 time
 you
 can
 kind
 of
 use
 it
 as


a
 prism
 on
 our
 society.
 Um
 it's
 it's


it's
 amazing
 in
 retrospect.
 I
 guess
 my


my
 sort
 of
 so
 social
 political
 kind
 of


kind
 of
 analysis
 of
 it
 would
 be
 like
 it


was
 clearly
 intended
 as
 a
 leftwing
 movie


um
 at
 the
 time
 because
 it
 was
 sort
 of
 it


was
 sort
 of
 um
 and
 you
 know
 and
 the


novel
 that
 you
 know
 this
 the
 famous


novel
 that
 it's
 based
 on
 you
 know
 and


sort
 of
 this
 you
 know
 almost
 like
 what


was
 it
 remember
 the
 original
 like


there's
 the
 sort
 of
 leftwing
 anti-


capitalism
 of
 that
 era
 like
 leftwing


anarchism
 um
 you
 know
 a
 little
 bit
 like


that
 you
 know
 the
 '90s
 version
 of
 like


Luigi
 leftism
 or
 something
 where
 it's


like
 you
 know
 capitalism
 is
 this
 you


know
 basically
 this
 horrible
 right-wing


machine
 that's
 like
 crushing
 everybody's


spirits


Um
 and
 of
 course
 in
 the
 movie
 Andart
 in


place
 you
 know
 sort
 of
 an
 office
 drone


who
 just
 like
 absticates
 his
 life.
 Um


and
 you
 know
 has
 no
 future
 in
 my
 case


himself
 and
 you
 know
 ends
 up
 doing
 all


all
 the
 things
 that
 that
 you
 know
 kind


of
 play
 out
 in
 the
 movie
 which
 you
 know


and
 then
 by
 the
 way
 the
 movie
 culminates


in
 basically
 the
 the
 the
 destruction
 of


capitalism.
 Um
 you
 know
 basically
 what


is
 it
 he
 they
 they
 they
 he
 takes
 down


the
 buildings
 containing
 I
 think
 it's


like
 all
 the
 what
 is
 it
 all
 the
 bank


records
 or
 credit
 card
 records
 uh
 to


kind
 of
 you
 know
 wipe
 the
 slate
 clean


and
 start
 start
 the
 economy
 and
 society


over
 again.
 Um,
 so
 at
 the
 time
 it's
 just


like,
 wow,
 that's
 like
 a
 really
 leftwing


message.
 And
 of
 course
 it's,
 you
 know,


it's
 like
 it's,
 you
 know,
 David
 Fincher


and
 it's
 Edn
 Brad
 Pitt.
 It's
 like
 one
 of


the
 best
 most
 entertaining,
 you
 know,


most
 captivating
 movies
 ever
 made.
 It's


it's
 phenomenal,
 but
 like
 it's


fundamentally
 a
 leftwing
 movie.
 You


watch
 it
 today
 and
 you're
 just
 like,


"Wow,
 it's
 like
 ultra
 rightwing."
 Like


it's
 like
 ultra
 ultra
 ultra
 rightwing


cuz
 it's
 a
 to
 start
 with
 it's
 a
 white


guy,
 right?
 Um,
 right.
 And
 so
 like
 it's


literally
 you
 view
 it
 today
 and
 you're


like
 wow
 it's
 you
 know
 it's
 it's
 you


know
 the
 stereotype
 would
 be
 it's
 a


right
 you
 know
 it's
 a
 it's
 a
 it's
 a


white
 you
 know
 it's
 a
 privileged
 white


male
 incel
 uh
 you
 know
 basically
 right
 u


you
 know
 with
 like
 every
 advantage
 in


the
 world
 who
 suddenly
 you
 know


nevertheless
 has
 built
 up
 this


persecution
 complex
 right
 and
 you
 just


lines
 you're
 just
 like
 wow
 that's
 like


an
 ultra
 right-wing
 movie
 and
 then
 by


the
 way
 the
 the
 sort
 of
 argument
 the


movie
 makes
 about
 like
 capitalism
 is


like
 the
 great
 you
 know
 atomization
 of


society
 and
 like
 nobody
 has
 any
 type


anything
 and
 people
 are
 just
 like


interchangeable
 cogs
 in
 the
 great
 you


know
 kind
 of
 you
 know
 in
 the
 great
 kind


of
 machine
 of
 modernity
 um
 you
 know
 they


kind
 of
 put
 on
 this
 assembly
 line


through
 complete
 meaningless
 until
 they


die
 and
 like
 all
 concept
 of
 like
 family


and
 community
 is
 like
 completely


ruptured
 and
 like
 capitalism
 is
 like
 you


know
 basically
 the
 machine
 that
 does


that
 you
 know
 neoliberal
 capitalism
 is


the
 machine
 that
 does
 that
 like
 sitting


here
 today
 that's
 a
 rightman
 critique
 um


and
 so
 and
 so
 I
 I
 I
 probably
 shouldn't


name
 names
 but
 I
 did
 talk
 to
 somebody


who
 was
 involved
 in
 the
 making
 of
 the


movie
 because
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 it
 was
 a
 I


don't
 want
 to
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 represent


his
 his
 views
 but
 I
 specifically
 by


name,
 but
 I
 talked
 to
 somebody
 who
 made


the
 movie
 and
 I
 laid
 up
 my
 theory
 that


it
 was
 a
 leftwing
 movie
 at
 the
 time
 and


now
 it's
 a
 right
 movie.
 And
 this
 this


person
 basically
 said,
 "Oh,
 no."
 He's


like,
 it's
 very
 clear
 in
 the
 movie
 that


at
 the
 end,
 you
 know,
 that
 he
 greatly


regrets
 what
 he's
 doing.
 Like,
 you
 know,


he
 he
 like
 has,
 you
 know,
 he's
 filled


with
 regret.
 Like,
 it's
 a
 very,
 you


know,
 kind
 of
 sad
 tragic
 ending.
 Um,
 and


and
 I
 was
 like,
 "Oh,
 well
 then
 if
 you


just
 like
 used
 AI
 to
 just
 go
 in
 there


and
 tweak
 the
 final
 scene
 of
 of
 the
 Ed


Norton
 character
 standing,
 you
 know,


watching
 the
 buildings
 come
 down
 and
 if


you
 just
 tweak
 the
 final
 scene
 to
 where


he
 would
 have
 like
 a
 sly
 little
 smile
 on


his
 face,
 like
 all
 of
 a
 sudden
 like
 the


entire
 movie
 becomes
 like
 this,
 you


know,
 basically
 ultra
 rightwing
 from


start
 to
 finish."
 Um,
 and
 anyway,
 I
 I'll


pause
 there.
 I
 just
 I
 just
 got
 to
 say


whichever
 way
 you
 interpret
 it,
 like
 I


think
 that
 movie
 definitely
 is


definitely
 a
 art.
 I
 think
 it's
 amazing.


I
 think
 it'll
 I
 think
 people
 will
 be


watching
 it
 and
 discussing
 it,
 you
 know,


100
 years
 from
 now.


>> Yeah.
 to
 to
 bring
 it
 back
 to
 the


original
 thesis
 of
 this
 podcast,


monitoring
 the
 situation
 that's
 going
 on


in
 the
 internet.
 Um,
 what
 went
 viral


this
 week
 related
 to
 Fight
 Club
 was
 the


PSAs
 that
 Brad
 Pitt
 and
 Edward
 Norton


put
 out
 before
 the
 movie
 came
 out
 in


theaters.
 And
 if
 you
 have
 I
 won't
 this


is
 one
 thing
 I
 won't
 spoil,
 but
 it
 was


going
 viral
 like
 why
 don't
 we
 make
 PSAs


about
 like
 staying
 silent
 in
 the
 theater


like
 this
 uh
 anymore.
 You
 have
 to
 watch


it.
 It's
 like
 90
 seconds.
 Um,
 and
 it


just
 confirms
 that
 Brad
 Pitt
 is
 the


goat.
 he
 is
 hilarious.
 Um,
 and
 that
 he


puts
 serious
 thought
 into
 everything
 he


does,
 including
 the
 please
 stay
 quiet
 in


the
 theater
 uh
 PSAs
 that
 went
 out
 before


the
 movie
 came
 out
 in
 theaters
 25
 years


ago.
 So,
 watch
 it.
 Uh,
 I'm
 glad
 it's


going
 viral
 again.
 And
 we
 should


definitely
 make
 actors
 do
 those
 PSAs
 for


theaters.


>> So,
 Katherine,
 that
 movie
 came
 out
 in


what
 year?


>> 1999.


>> 99.
 Yeah.
 1999,


>> which
 is
 kind
 of
 universally
 I
 remember


like
 a
 year
 of
 like
 absolutely
 amazing


movies.


>> Yes.
 Maybe
 that
 maybe
 the
 best
 single


year
 for
 movies
 in
 the
 last
 like
 40


years.
 Yes.


>> Or
 longer.
 So
 um
 question
 um
 could
 that


movie
 So
 number
 one
 is
 that
 movie
 was
 at


least
 according
 to
 the
 accounts
 that


I've
 read
 that
 movie
 was
 very
 difficult


to
 make.
 Um
 and
 then
 once
 they
 had
 in


the
 can
 like
 people
 the
 original
 people


who
 saw
 it
 like
 were
 you
 know
 it
 was


just
 like
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 just
 like


didn't
 know
 what
 to
 make
 of
 it
 you
 know


cuz
 there's
 a
 very
 simplistic
 reading
 of


it
 right
 which
 is
 just
 like
 total


nihilism
 and
 like
 just
 destruction
 and


you
 know
 sex
 and
 violence
 you
 know
 to
 no


purpose.
 It's
 one
 of
 those
 movies
 where


like
 you
 you
 have
 to
 have
 a
 lens
 on
 the


movie.
 You
 have
 to
 have
 an
 idea
 of
 the


movie
 or
 the
 movie
 has
 to
 get
 its
 idea


across
 to
 you
 and
 you
 have
 to
 you
 have


to
 catch
 the
 idea
 before
 you
 can


actually
 watch
 it
 properly
 because
 if


you
 just
 watch
 it
 otherwise
 it
 just


seems
 like
 it's
 just
 like
 tremendously


nihilistic
 which
 I
 you
 know
 very
 much
 I


very
 much
 don't
 believe
 that
 it
 is
 but


uh
 you
 know
 I
 think
 it
 was
 very


controversial
 at
 the
 time
 u
 it
 was
 very


hard
 to
 get
 made
 you
 know
 it's
 it
 was


misinterpreted
 by
 many
 people
 over
 the


years
 and
 by
 the
 way
 the
 people
 who
 made


it
 me
 is
 misinterpreting
 it
 um
 and
 so


that
 movie
 could
 get
 made
 during
 that


era.
 Could
 that
 movie
 have
 gotten
 made


uh
 after
 the
 '90s?


>> I
 I
 feel
 like
 it's
 the
 like
 the


consumate
 90s
 film,


>> right?
 Like
 like
 just
 the
 the
 as
 you


said
 like
 the
 critique
 on
 consumerism


like
 the
 uh
 sort
 of
 early
 critique
 on
 um


you
 know
 kind
 of
 the
 consumerism


affecting
 masculine
 like
 traits,
 right?


like
 like
 the
 whole
 the
 whole
 reaction


of
 you
 know
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 a
 fight


club
 to
 kind
 of
 reclaim
 our
 our


masculinity
 and
 sort
 of
 our
 life
 and
 our


you
 know
 that
 that
 felt
 like
 was


actually
 I
 mean
 it's
 it's
 interesting


because
 it's
 the
 same
 critique
 it's
 the


same
 conversation
 that's
 happening
 right


now
 but
 it
 really
 was
 also
 a
 '9s


conversation
 um
 just
 sort
 of
 you
 know


and
 that's
 the
 same
 thing
 as
 um
 I


believe
 1999
 was
 also
 American
 Beauty


and
 that's
 a
 similar
 sort
 of
 like
 all
 of


these
 movies
 had
 the
 same
 sort
 of
 to


your
 point
 nihilism
 but
 sort
 of
 this


David
 Foster
 Wallaceesque
 sort
 of


consumerism
 M
 is
 destroying
 us.
 We're


moving
 to
 the
 suburbs
 and
 we
 have
 to


reclaim
 in
 some
 way.
 And
 like
 the
 sort


of
 I
 I
 I
 don't
 like
 the
 portrayal
 of
 any


man
 feeling
 like
 constrained
 in
 their,


you
 know,
 it
 was
 it
 was
 always
 sort
 of


like
 the
 consumerism
 and
 the


suburbanization
 of
 America
 is
 destroying


sort
 of
 like
 masculine
 freedom,
 right?


So
 there
 were
 like
 that
 was
 like
 a
 very


'9s


>> coded
 end
 of
 the
 '9s
 film
 era.
 Like
 I


don't
 So
 part
 of
 me
 is
 like
 I
 don't
 I
 it


could
 probably
 be
 made
 but
 it
 would


probably
 be
 made
 with
 totally
 different


ethos
 and
 maybe
 a
 totally
 different
 take


on
 that
 um
 thesis
 now.
 Like
 the
 thesis


is
 slightly
 different
 than
 what
 it
 was


in
 the
 '9s
 which
 is
 that
 like
 you
 know


like
 Walmart
 is
 destroying
 you,
 right?


Like
 it's
 a
 very
 different
 now
 it's
 like


tech
 is
 destroying
 you
 but
 at
 the
 time


it
 was
 Walmart
 and
 capitalism
 are


destroying
 you.
