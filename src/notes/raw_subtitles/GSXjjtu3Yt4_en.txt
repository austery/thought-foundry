What is it?
Listen, I said what I think so many
people around Los Angeles, throughout
L.A.
and this whole region feel, especially
after reading the after action report.
I don't know if any of you have read it,
but it's very clear that this fire was
preventable and it's very clear that
they didn't have a plan to do anything
about it, because if she had a plan, she
would have responded in that question by
saying, this is the plan I had.
And, you know, we did our best to
implement it.
But, you know, going forward, we've got
to solve these problems.
Because when you read that after action
report, glaring failures, systematic
failures of our system, our city are
outlined in there, and there are
solutions to all of them.
And, you know, the focus has got to be
making sure this kind of thing doesn't
happen again.
But I'm not going to dwell on on the
fact that the city failed because, boy,
it's in black and white now and very
clear.
Well, Rick, just to follow that, Mayor
Bass said that you guys were together
just recently working together on
things.
So I'm just curious,
you know, conversations sometimes are
things we hear in public versus things
we hear behind the scenes.
I mean, one of the things we got from
Mayor Bass's talking about members of
the Trump administration that certainly
L.A., California in general have have
clashed with, but that she talks to them
on a regular basis, people she knew from
her time, certainly in D.C..
So I'm just curious, what are the
conversations or what can you share with
us about maybe the constructive
conversation you're having with Mayor
Bassett behind the scenes about what
happened, what can be done better going
forward?
Yeah, well, here's something that's
really important that she said in the
next question, because she said politics
is performative
and, you know, they would go out,
beat each other up and then go have
dinner or something like that that she
talked about.
I don't think politics is performative.
I think what we learned from this fire
is that leadership matters, that these
positions, when you're the head of a
city, the head of a state
in any kind of very important elected
office, you actually impact lives.
And it's not about putting on a show.
It's actually about making a difference
in people's lives every day.
So I was really stunned by her
statement.
And listen, I have met with her.
My job through Steadfast.
We are working very hard
with the city, with the county, with the
state to get people back in their homes
quickly and safely, get these
neighborhoods rebuilt.
And so we have a number of initiatives
that we have delivered to the city to
help them do their job better and
quicker.
And I have met with her and I will work
with anybody to help rebuild Altadena,
Malibu and the Palisades and do that
with great honesty, great dedication,
because that is the mission right now,
is to get people's lives rebuilt that
have been shattered.
And but it's not performative.
It's real.
And it's also real in my criticism,
because that criticism is factually
true.
And
I think what we need to be doing is
spending a lot of time, like I just
said, going through that after action
report, asking some really tough
questions, How could this have happened
and what are the solutions?
So it never happens again, whether it's
a fire or an earthquake or a flood or
whatever it may be.
It clearly points out that there wasn't
a plan and the system failed and a
community burned down and 11 people
died.
Let's not forget about that.
So, you know, are there tens and tens of
thousands of people who are sad and
angry?
There sure are.
And yesterday, after that announcement
came out, it read triggered a lot of
emotions and a lot of people and I stand
with them.
I understand it because of the losses
that we incurred that my daughter lost
her house, my son lost his house.
And that emotion is a true raw emotion.
It's important to recognize and it's
frankly important to sympathize and be
compassionate about because people are
really hurting.
I'm fortunate we have a number of
options, but the far majority of the
people that lost their homes or lost
their jobs, they don't have options and
they need help and help quickly.
And that's what we're doing at Steadfast
is making a real difference in people's
lives.
And I'm proud of that.
Well,
Rick, last time you were on with us, it
was just over a month ago, you said you
were still deciding whether or not you
were going to run for mayor or for
governor.
Have you made up your mind yet?
It's not because I don't like Mel, but
I'm working hard at it.
I've been spending a lot of time going
across the state.
I was in San Francisco last night, had a
great dinner with a bunch of tech
executives and entrepreneurs.
And I was in Bakersfield and I've been
all over the place.
So I'm I'm doing what I want to do.
Meaning I'm on this tour of the state,
in the city.
I'm meeting people, I'm listening to
people.
I'm understanding what the issues are,
developing policies where we can make a
big difference, whether it's the city of
the state and at the right time, I'll
make my decision and I'll announce it,
and you guys will be one of the first to
know.
He's got a couple of things coming in.
Thank you.
We are talking with Rick Caruso, founder
and executive chair of Caruso Weight.
Having said that, you know, I'm not
going to let this go completely.
You said you're in San Francisco talking
to tech executives, you're in
Bakersfield.
You're all you're all over the place.
You're in L.A.
right now.
That sounds to me like a broader scope.
So are you leaning maybe towards being
governor versus mayor?
I just you know, I'm just curious.
You're leaning a little bit.
That is a great follow up.
I love you.
But I am keeping both options very open.
I have two different teams.
I have two different teams that are
working on both and both are really
important positions.
And I want to do my best to end up in a
position where I could do the greatest
good, to make a difference in people's
lives.
And that that is my motivation.
It's not a career move for me.
It's really to give back like I've done
before, working with three different
mayors.
And, you know, you're
your L.A.
lead guy, John, who you just wrote the
article about me.
You know, there was a great statement in
there that three mayors turned to me to
help with critical problems that needed
to be fixed at the time.
And and I was honored to be able to do
that.
So to me, that's what public service is
all about, is having the trust of people
and really making a difference in
people's lives.
And
I'll let you know where I end up when I
make a decision.
Well, John Gittleson is going to be
speaking with you on stage here at
screen time just a little later, if you
have not yet seen that story.
And Bloomberg Businessweek, check it out
at Bloomberg.com and on the Bloomberg
terminal as well.
I want to talk a little bit about
Hollywood and what you think the fix is
here.
As we know, the film industry has been
under tremendous pressure.
COVID, the fires, technological
disruption.
What is the right fix?
That's how we've got to be competitive
with Atlanta.
We've got to be competitive with New
Jersey.
We've got to save the film industry.
You know, people that are below the line
are just getting destroyed.
You know, the is the drivers, all of the
people that support the entertainment
industry.
There's an arrogance, I think, in our
leadership that because they know the
entertainment industry was born here,
it's going to stay here.
They're just not dealing with reality.
And this is where I think leadership and
executive skills really matter to
identify a problem and solve it.
If we're the fourth largest economy as a
state in the world, let's act like it
and let's give the resources to keep the
entertainment industry in California and
in Los Angeles.
And we we've got to be competitive and
not allow and force people, quite
frankly, to go to London.
Like I said, don't in New Jersey.
I mean, the mayor of New Jersey.
You know, Phil did a hell of a job
getting Netflix, gave a lot of money to
build a studio there.
And that's a sucking sound of jobs
coming out of California.
So I would reverse that course
immediately so that we're competitive
and keep people in our state is going to
be a priority.
So this is why I'm not sure.
20 seconds, very quickly, do you think a
tariff on movies made outside the United
States makes sense?
And forgive me really quickly now.
Now, let's let's just be competitive and
let's not be punitive.
Okay.
And if we can't win the industry by
being competitive, shame on us.
I think we can.
