The
 school
 doesn't
 like
 AI.
 They
 don't


really
 allow
 it
 technically.
 But
 what
 I


think
 is
 over
 the
 past
 few
 years,


there's
 been
 the
 rise
 of
 AI
 products.


Naturally,
 over
 the
 past
 couple
 years,


we
 all
 use
 AI
 on
 a
 daily
 basis
 at
 school


like
 notes
 sometimes
 or
 for
 like
 general


answers.
 And
 I
 think
 the
 rise
 of
 AI
 like


in
 schools
 like
 uh
 try
 CBT
 and
 those


types
 of
 things.
 I
 think
 that
 also
 kind


of
 inspired
 me
 to
 do
 flow
 because
 it


opened
 up
 a
 new
 bridge.
 My
 name
 is


Michael
 and
 I'm
 the
 founder
 of
 Flow
 AI.


Over
 the
 past
 few
 months,
 I've
 been


building
 something
 by
 Lucer,
 a
 general


AI
 agent
 that
 actually
 gets
 things
 done.


From
 booking
 flights
 to
 cancel


subscriptions
 to
 making
 presentations,


Flo
 can
 do
 it
 all.
 This
 is
 one
 step


closer
 to
 AGI
 and
 a
 glimpse
 of
 the


future.


Um,
 my
 name
 is
 Michael
 Goldstein.
 I'm
 13


years
 old.
 Uh
 I
 live
 in
 Toronto,
 Canada.


I'm
 the
 founder
 of
 Flow
 AI.
 Flowey
 is
 a


general
 AI
 agent.
 So
 it's
 an
 agent
 that


can
 do
 a
 wide
 variety
 of
 tasks,
 not
 only


one
 certain
 thing.
 So
 a
 couple
 months


ago,
 I
 had
 the
 idea
 and
 I
 reached
 out
 to


multiple
 developers
 to
 ask
 if
 they


wanted
 to
 help.
 And
 none
 of
 them
 really


said
 yes.
 I
 don't
 know,
 probably
 because


my
 age
 and
 a
 bunch
 of
 other
 things.
 So
 I


started
 building
 it
 myself
 using
 like
 a


bunch
 of
 AI
 tools
 to
 help.
 Um
 so
 I
 also


I
 do
 coding
 lessons
 now
 every
 week
 so
 I


can
 in
 the
 future
 do
 it
 myself.
 No
 help


from
 anyone
 right
 now.
 I'm
 actually
 like


a
 paying
 user.
 Someone
 else
 said
 I


should
 do
 normal
 a
 normal
 kid
 life.
 But


what
 I
 think
 is
 just
 build
 build


like
 I
 have
 a
 group
 of
 friends
 right


like
 our
 little
 bubble
 and
 we
 all
 are


kind
 of
 have
 a
 similar
 spirit
 for


entrepreneur.
 So,
 a
 project
 we
 did
 and


still
 do
 more
 of
 is
 weather
 balloon


launches.
 Um,
 and
 those
 are
 really
 big


balloons
 that
 go
 to
 100,000
 ft
 and
 then


come
 back
 down.
 And
 the
 first
 one
 was
 on


CNN.
 Yeah.
 For
 the
 solar
 eclipse,
 we
 did


it
 during
 there.
 And
 I
 think
 it's
 fun
 to


see
 it
 actually
 working.
 So,
 my
 friends,


they
 they
 they
 know
 I
 have
 this
 a


spirit.
 So,
 they
 weren't
 that
 surprised.


And
 I
 think
 my
 family,
 I
 think
 it's
 the


same.
 My
 family
 knows
 that
 I
 have
 this


type
 of
 spirit.
 Uh
 so
 I
 think
 um
 they


weren't
 surprised
 also
 when
 I
 launched


it.
 They
 were
 very
 excited
 and
 happy
 and


I
 don't
 know
 if
 they
 expected
 it
 to
 work


also.


I
 had
 extracted
 all
 the
 emails
 of
 users


from
 Subbase
 and
 I
 sent
 an
 email
 to


everyone
 giving
 them
 everyone
 a
 discount


and
 I
 woke
 up
 and
 I
 got
 a
 response
 from


one
 person
 who
 was
 saying
 the
 code


wasn't
 working.


Um,
 so
 I
 had
 to
 fix
 that
 glitch
 and
 I


responded
 and
 then
 I
 got
 the
 message


from
 Stripe.
 I
 got
 my
 first
 sale.
 It


happened
 when
 I
 was
 walking
 downstairs.


Um,
 so
 I
 was
 very
 excited.
 I
 told
 all
 my


friends
 and
 family
 and
 parents.
 So
 I
 ran


into
 my
 parents
 room.
 I
 was
 like,
 "Ah,
 I


made
 it.
 Yay."


So
 uh,
 my
 experience
 has
 been
 good,
 I


guess.
 Um,
 of
 course
 there's
 advantages


like
 when
 I
 when
 I
 posted
 the
 launch


video
 that
 did
 pretty
 well
 and
 I
 bet
 my


age
 was
 a
 factor
 of
 that.
 A
 lot
 of


people
 are
 also
 more
 curious
 because
 I'm


younger.
 Uh,
 so
 I
 think
 it
 opens
 up
 a


lot
 more
 opportunities
 like
 this


interview
 for
 example.
 I
 don't
 know
 if


it
 would
 have
 happened
 if
 I
 was
 much


older.
 Um,
 so
 a
 lot
 of
 opportunities


open
 up
 when
 I'm
 younger.
 Uh,
 like


Founders
 Inc.
 also
 that's
 a
 very
 big


accomplishment
 also.
 Um
 I'm
 the
 youngest


accepted
 there.
 Also
 I
 was
 invited
 to
 a


summit
 in
 Paris,
 one
 of
 the
 top
 AI


summits.
 So
 that
 was
 that
 was
 something


that
 happened
 from
 the
 interview.
 And


the
 disadvantages
 are
 probably


um
 it's
 hard
 to
 get
 people
 to
 trust
 you


also.
 So
 on
 top
 of
 the
 advantages
 that


some
 people
 don't
 really
 trust
 me,
 for


example.
 And
 I
 guess
 like
 I
 mentioned


earlier,
 uh
 recruiting
 is
 really
 hard
 um


when
 you're
 much
 younger
 because
 I
 have


no
 capital,
 right?
 I
 guess
 my
 birthday


money,
 right?
 So
 I
 think
 that
 was
 the


hardest
 part.
 It
 took
 a
 couple
 of
 months


before
 I
 could
 recruit
 two
 developers


and
 one
 guy
 who
 does
 who
 helps
 with


strategy.
 They
 actually
 reached
 out
 to


me
 first,
 all
 three
 of
 them.
 Uh
 they
 all


reached
 out
 saying
 they're
 interested


and
 they
 would
 love
 to
 help.
 uh
 right
 I


reached
 out
 to
 a
 lot
 of
 adults
 and


mentors
 and
 all
 types
 of
 people
 to
 help


and
 a
 lot
 of
 them
 helped.
 So
 I
 think
 I


have
 to
 give
 back
 to
 everyone
 not
 just


them
 but
 everyone.


We're
 all
 interested
 in
 AI.
 Uh
 we
 all


use
 AI
 on
 a
 daily
 basis
 at
 school.
 Uh
 I


think
 not
 only
 my
 friends
 I
 think
 the


whole
 everyone
 at
 school
 all
 the
 kids


now
 use
 AI.
 So
 I
 think
 we're
 all


interested
 in
 in
 it
 in
 terms
 of
 my


friends
 and
 the
 school.
 There's
 a
 lot
 of


AI
 tools
 available
 but
 I
 really
 think
 we


only
 use
 one
 main
 one
 which
 is
 CHBT.
 I


think
 a
 lot
 of
 kids
 at
 school
 don't
 know


about
 the
 other
 tools
 and
 I
 think
 you


have
 to
 be
 more
 involved
 in
 AI
 to
 know


the
 other
 tools.
 So
 yeah
 I
 think
 most
 of


the
 school
 or
 the
 kids
 or
 my
 friends
 are


using
 child
 only
 which
 is
 unfortunate.


Um
 only
 recently
 really
 is
 when
 I
 really


learned
 in
 depth
 about
 AI
 and
 how
 it


works
 and
 for
 the
 idea
 of
 flow
 it
 came


when
 I
 when
 I
 realized
 that
 there's
 a


big
 gap
 and
 that
 there
 was
 something


that
 wasn't
 being
 done
 which
 is


automated
 tasks.
 Uh
 I
 think
 it
 it
 can


really
 help
 humans
 with
 efficiency.
 uh


like
 my
 parents
 for
 example,
 we
 all


waste
 time
 filling
 out
 forms.
 But
 I


think
 that's
 the
 biggest
 one
 because


there's
 not
 many
 platforms
 that
 are


doing
 that
 like
 claw
 doesn't
 do
 that
 or


open
 AAI.
 I
 think
 that's
 the
 biggest
 gap


that
 there
 is.
 It's
 the
 browser


automation.
 So
 I
 think
 in
 general
 by


next
 year
 I
 hope
 to
 have
 many
 more


features
 in
 it
 and
 I
 hope
 for
 it
 to
 be


more
 smooth
 of
 course
 because
 there's


many
 many
 bugs
 still
 which
 is
 uh
 going


to
 be
 fixed
 over
 time
 and
 that
 I
 think


in
 terms
 of
 more
 of
 the
 money
 type.
 I


set
 a
 goal
 on
 Twitter
 for
 $10,000
 in


recur
 monthly
 recurring
 revenue
 and
 it


might
 take
 plenty
 of
 years.
 I'm
 not
 sure


how
 long
 it
 will
 take
 but
 I
 hope
 in
 a


year
 we
 can
 get
 somewhere
 close
 to
 that.


So
 I
 hope
 Floy
 is
 able
 to
 you
 know


become
 part
 of
 everyone's
 life
 almost


right
 um
 I
 think
 the
 goal
 that
 you'll
 be


able
 to
 do
 that
 can
 be
 automated
 right


we
 get
 to
 see
 how
 AI
 evolves
 and
 that


kind
 of
 stuff
 I
 think
 the
 longterm
 goal


for
 me
 is
 in
 some
 way
 to
 help
 people
 you


know
 give
 back
 Almost.
