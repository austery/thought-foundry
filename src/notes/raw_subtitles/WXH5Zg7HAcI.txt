Hi
 everyone,
 I'm
 Nicolola
 Tangan,
 the


CEO
 of
 the
 Norwegian
 Sovereign
 Wealth


Fund
 and
 today
 I'm
 in
 really
 good


company
 with
 Nikesh
 Aurora,
 the
 CEO
 of


Palo
 Alto
 Networks.
 Palo
 Alto
 Networks


is
 the
 world
 leader
 within
 cyber


security
 which
 has
 never
 been
 more


important
 than
 today.
 We
 own
 1.2%
 of
 the


company
 translating
 into
 more
 than
 $1


billion.
 Thank
 you
 so
 much
 Dash
 for


taking
 the
 time.
 Thank
 you
 Nikolai.


Lovely
 to
 see
 you
 again.
 Now,
 uh
 let's


uh
 start
 off
 with
 the
 basics.
 What
 do


you
 guys
 do?
 That's
 a
 good
 question.


Look,
 as
 the
 world
 has
 digitized,
 as


we've
 all
 adopted
 technology,
 whether


it's
 on
 our
 smartphones
 or
 as
 companies


make
 applications
 available
 to
 everyone,


um
 the
 possibilities
 of
 bad
 actors


getting
 into
 company
 systems
 or
 our


personal
 systems
 goes
 up
 and
 our
 job
 is


to
 protect
 that
 technology


infrastructure
 from
 bad
 actors.
 So
 we


are
 in
 the
 business
 of
 cyber
 security


which
 is
 to
 protect
 our
 enterprise


customers,
 governments
 and
 individuals


from
 being
 hacked
 or
 attacked
 or
 coerced


by
 bad
 actors.
 Now
 the
 thing
 is
 that


everything
 is
 digital
 these
 days
 right


your
 car
 uh
 you
 know
 street
 lights
 uh
 so


what's
 kind
 of
 happening
 with
 the
 whole


attack
 surface.
 Well
 it's
 a
 great
 great


comment
 Nikolai
 because
 uh
 you
 said
 it


right.
 We
 call
 this
 the
 attack
 surface


and
 the
 attack
 surface
 is
 expanding
 and


I
 think
 we're
 not
 done
 and
 as
 you
 said


you
 know
 if
 you
 drive
 around
 in
 San


Francisco
 in
 a
 Whimo
 that's
 your
 car
 but


the
 car
 is
 now
 fully
 connected
 to
 some


central
 nervous
 system
 and
 if
 a
 bad


actor
 could
 get
 their
 hands
 on
 that


control
 systems
 to
 your
 car
 they
 can


control
 your
 car.
 So
 as
 we
 create
 more


and
 more
 technology,
 more
 and
 more


interconnectivity,
 we
 are
 creating
 the


opportunity
 for
 bad
 actors
 to
 get


involved
 and
 start
 to
 interfere
 or
 start


to
 take
 over
 this
 attack
 surface.
 So


yes,
 the
 attack
 surface
 is
 fundamentally


exploding
 but
 continue
 to
 explode
 which


makes
 it
 more
 and
 more
 important
 for
 us


to
 make
 sure
 that
 we
 are
 able
 to
 protect


those
 situations
 faster
 and
 faster
 and


faster
 and
 more
 real
 time
 as
 we
 can.


What's
 the
 most
 difficult
 part
 of
 what


you
 do?
 The
 most
 difficult
 part
 is
 the


the
 the
 tables
 are
 unfairly
 stacked.
 The


bad
 actor
 has
 to
 be
 right
 once
 and
 we


have
 to
 be
 right
 100%
 of
 the
 time.


That's
 hard
 to
 do.
 How
 do
 you
 do
 it?
 Uh


more
 and
 more
 technology.
 You
 know,
 uh


we
 all
 talk
 about
 AI
 and
 I'm
 sure
 we'll


talk
 about
 it,
 but
 uh
 we
 have
 to
 be
 able


to
 identify
 things
 as
 they're
 happening.


We
 have
 to
 be
 able
 to
 look
 for
 the


needle
 in
 the
 haststack.
 And
 today
 with


the
 amount
 of
 data
 that's
 floating


around
 in
 the
 world,
 the
 amount
 of


connectivity
 as
 we
 talked
 about
 that
 is


going
 on,
 the
 only
 way
 to
 do
 it


efficiently,
 effectively,
 and
 in
 real


time
 is
 to
 use
 the
 same
 technology
 to


protect
 ourselves
 against
 cyber
 threats


that
 we
 are
 using
 to
 make
 our
 lives


convenient.


How
 has
 AI
 changed
 the
 way
 you
 work?
 Oh,


I
 think
 AI
 is
 going
 to
 change


everything.


uh
 it's
 almost
 as
 we
 you
 know
 we


beginning
 to
 see
 every
 week
 there's
 a


net
 new
 incarnation
 of
 AI
 and
 you
 can


see
 it
 keeps
 getting
 smarter
 and
 the
 way


I
 way
 I
 sort
 of
 correlate
 this
 is
 like


AI
 is
 like
 having
 a
 really
 smart
 person


that
 you
 can
 have
 work
 for
 you
 this


person
 doesn't
 forget
 anything
 this


person
 knows
 everything
 that's
 ever


happened
 in
 the
 world
 this
 person
 knows


how
 to
 recognize
 patterns
 and
 what's


happening
 is
 that
 that
 person
 is
 over


time
 going
 to
 become
 smarter
 than
 the


average
 employee
 and
 be
 able
 to
 either


assist
 the
 current
 employees
 in
 the
 task


and
 possibly
 take
 over
 their
 tasks.
 Now


that
 also
 applies
 to
 cyber
 security,


right?
 If
 you
 can
 have
 somebody
 has


infinite
 memory,
 infinite
 pattern


recognition,
 then
 the
 question
 is,
 can
 I


train
 it
 with
 my
 information
 to
 make
 be


more
 effective
 and
 helpful
 for
 me?
 I


think
 that's
 just
 phase
 one.
 I
 think


phase
 two,
 this
 thing's
 going to
 have
 a


brain
 of
 a
 PhD
 where
 it
 can
 think
 of


unintended
 scenarios,
 things
 that
 have


never
 been
 thought
 about.
 It
 can
 reason.


So,
 I
 think
 we're
 on
 to
 a
 very


interesting
 road
 with
 AI.
 We're
 in
 the


very
 early
 stages.
 uh
 it
 has
 benefits
 on


both
 sides.
 Once
 again,
 every
 piece
 of


technology
 can
 be
 used
 by
 bad
 actors
 and


good
 actors.
 Hopefully,
 the
 good
 actors


outweigh
 the
 bad
 actors
 and
 we're


working
 with
 AI
 to
 see
 if
 we
 can
 use


those
 brains
 to
 become
 better
 security


analysts,
 solve
 security
 problems


faster.
 How
 do
 you
 make
 sure
 that
 you


have
 more
 compute
 than
 they
 have
 and


better
 algorithms
 and
 so
 on.
 I
 mean,


honestly,
 uh
 you
 don't
 need
 more
 compute


than
 bad
 actors.
 the
 day
 the
 day
 bad


actors
 end
 up
 with
 more
 comput
 we'll


have
 a
 real
 problem
 because
 if
 they
 had


more
 compute
 then
 the
 world
 is
 a
 dark


place
 but
 I
 think
 even
 with
 the
 compute


that's
 out
 there
 uh
 it
 can
 be
 leveraged


effectively
 unfortunately
 from
 a
 bad


actor
 perspective
 the
 compute
 is
 really


being
 used
 for
 to
 create
 a
 faster
 and


faster
 brain
 a
 smarter
 and
 smarter
 brain


once
 the
 brain
 exists
 hopefully
 we'll


find
 technologies
 and
 techniques
 where


they
 can
 be
 deployed
 at
 the
 edge
 on
 your


phone
 in
 many
 different
 places
 to
 be


able
 to
 leverage
 it
 so
 I
 think
 the
 real


risk
 risk
 is
 that
 uh
 there
 is
 infinite


possibility
 for
 this
 technology
 to
 be


used
 in
 in
 sort
 of
 the
 dark
 side
 as
 much


as
 it
 can
 be
 on
 the
 right
 side.
 So
 we


have
 to
 make
 sure
 as
 we
 deploy
 it
 as
 we


enable
 it,
 as
 we
 make
 it
 more


omnipresent,
 we
 do
 that
 with
 the
 right


guard
 rails
 and
 the
 right
 control


systems
 in
 place.
 Otherwise,
 we're
 going


to
 have
 to
 go
 and
 it's
 very
 hard
 to
 put


the
 genie
 back
 in
 the
 bottle.
 Nash,
 who


are
 the
 bad
 guys?
 Where
 is
 the
 dark


side?
 You
 know,
 the
 dark
 side
 is


interesting.
 It's
 been
 an
 evolution.
 Uh


I
 think
 15
 years
 ago,
 it
 was
 people
 who


sat,
 you
 know,
 playing
 games
 in
 their


parents'
 basements
 and
 who
 were
 great
 at


technology
 and
 sort
 of
 uh
 hacking


somebody
 or
 proving
 a
 point
 was
 a
 was


kind
 of
 like
 getting
 a
 trophy.
 It's


like,
 you
 know,
 look,
 look
 at
 me.
 I'm
 so


smart.
 I
 can
 hack
 into
 the
 system
 X,
 the


system
 Y,
 and
 look,
 I
 showed
 that
 I
 can


do
 it.
 But
 very
 quickly
 as
 the
 world


became
 more
 and
 more
 interconnected
 it


started
 getting
 an
 sort
 of
 economic


legs.
 People
 said
 wait
 if
 I
 do
 that
 I


can
 actually
 find
 a
 way
 to
 monetize
 it


and
 find
 a
 way
 of
 getting
 money
 for
 it


whether
 from
 the
 companies
 or


individuals.
 And
 we're
 seeing
 a
 lot
 of


that.
 There's
 a
 lot
 of
 ransomware


activity
 a
 lot
 of
 activity
 where
 people


are
 are
 scared
 into
 sharing
 economics


with
 bad
 actors.
 I
 think
 we're
 at
 we're


past
 that
 too.
 I
 think
 nation
 states


have
 started
 building
 that
 capability
 in


a
 robust
 way
 because
 uh
 I
 think
 the


future
 wars
 will
 be
 fought
 both
 in
 the


digital
 war
 sort
 of
 battlefield
 as
 well


as
 a
 physical
 battlefield.
 digital


battlefield
 is
 a
 lot
 less
 expensive
 from


a
 from
 a
 you
 know
 situation
 where
 from
 a


casualty
 perspective
 if
 you
 were
 a
 bit


more
 specific
 about
 the
 countries
 look
 I


don't
 think
 it's
 a
 state
 secret
 that


there
 are
 countries
 which
 have


tremendous
 offensive
 capability
 even
 the


US
 has
 great
 offensive
 capability
 but


there
 are
 there
 are
 people
 out
 there
 who


spend
 more
 time
 building
 offensive


capability
 than
 defensive
 capability


because
 they
 feel
 that
 that
 capability


would
 be
 extremely
 well
 leveraged
 in
 a


adversarial
 situation
 and
 you
 know
 we


have
 bad
 actors
 we
 We've
 seen
 groups
 in


North
 Korea.
 We've
 seen
 groups
 in
 China.


You've
 seen
 groups
 in
 Russia,
 various


parts
 of
 Eastern
 Europe,
 some
 parts
 of


the
 Middle
 East.
 So
 you
 have
 you
 have


groups
 of
 people.
 Now
 that
 doesn't
 mean


the
 whole
 country
 is
 bad.
 There
 are


people
 who
 are
 resident
 there
 because


they
 have
 access
 to
 resources.
 They
 have


there's
 hard
 to
 create
 sort
 of
 you
 know


some
 consequence
 from
 a
 fiduciary


perspective
 against
 those.
 So
 that's


where
 they
 are.
 Could
 you
 recognize
 them


by
 the
 way
 they
 attack?
 Yes.
 Uh
 so
 tell


me
 what's
 the
 difference?
 So,
 hey,
 so


now
 I'm
 uh
 I'm
 uh
 sitting
 in
 uh
 in
 Polo


Alto
 Networks.
 Uh
 we
 get
 some
 uh
 red


lights
 flashing
 and
 uh
 how
 can
 I
 see


that
 it's
 some
 Russian
 guys
 rather
 than


some
 North
 Korean
 guys.
 What
 how
 do
 I


how
 can
 I
 see
 that?
 Well,
 there
 are


attack
 techniques
 which
 have
 been
 have


sort
 of
 signatures
 in
 there.
 People
 are


proud
 of
 their
 work.
 They
 embed


signatures
 in
 their
 work.
 So,
 you
 can


recognize
 signatures.
 You
 can
 recognize


that
 there
 are
 variants
 of
 things
 that


people
 have
 used
 in
 the
 past.
 you
 can


get
 some
 sense
 from
 the
 IP
 addresses


that
 are
 being
 used.
 You
 can
 see
 where


the
 traffic
 is
 coming
 from.
 So
 you
 get


some
 sense
 always
 not
 always
 accurate


because
 there's
 ways
 to
 circumvent
 that.


So
 it's
 a
 it's
 sort
 of
 a
 triangulation


exercise
 between
 the
 technique
 used,
 the


malware
 used,
 the
 where
 the
 traffic's


coming
 from,
 the
 scale
 of
 the
 traffic,


the
 scale
 of
 the
 attack.
 Sometimes
 you


see
 DOS
 attacks
 which
 only
 nation
 states


have
 the
 compute
 capability
 to
 go
 uh


exercise.
 uh
 you
 can
 always
 understand


from
 uh
 who
 the
 target
 is,
 who
 the


adversary
 might
 be.
 You
 know,
 it
 was
 non


it
 was
 pretty
 obvious
 when
 the
 Ukraine


war
 started
 that
 the
 systems
 in
 Ukraine


that
 were
 being
 attacked,
 they
 were


being
 attacked
 by
 a
 certain
 set
 of


people,
 right?
 That
 you
 understood
 there


was
 motive.
 So
 I
 think
 triangulating


motive,
 malware
 techniques
 and
 and


addresses
 and
 location
 gives
 you
 a


reasonably
 good
 idea.
 Is
 the
 type
 of


targets
 changing?
 Uh
 it
 has.
 Yes,
 that's


a
 great
 question.
 the
 type
 of
 targets


have
 migrated
 from
 individuals
 to


individual
 companies
 and
 now
 we're
 in


the
 world
 of
 supply
 chain
 and
 what
 I


mean
 by
 that
 is
 you
 know
 if
 you
 want
 to


go
 uh
 find
 out
 what
 an
 activist
 is
 doing


in
 their
 email
 you
 try
 and
 attack
 the


activist
 trying
 to
 get
 access
 to
 their


username
 password
 so
 you
 can
 see
 what


they're
 doing
 which
 would
 be
 a
 very


targeted
 attack
 to
 whether
 it's
 an


individual
 or
 a
 company
 but
 then
 he
 says


then
 said
 look
 I'm
 going
 to
 need
 this


capability
 for
 a
 very
 long
 time
 why


don't
 I
 go
 attack
 the
 backbone
 of
 the


email
 system.
 So
 once
 I
 have
 end
 there,


I
 can
 go
 look
 at
 anyone.
 Or
 why
 don't


attack
 a
 piece
 of
 hardware
 that
 is


deployed
 by
 10,000
 companies
 once
 I
 know


how
 to
 break
 into
 one,
 I
 can
 break
 into


the
 other
 9,999
 at
 will.
 So
 you're


beginning
 to
 see
 a
 lot
 more
 supply
 chain


attacks,
 which
 effectively
 allow
 bad


actors
 to
 go
 amplify
 their
 their
 sort


of,
 you
 know,
 targets
 over
 time
 where


they
 want
 to
 go.
 So
 it's
 kind
 of
 like
 we


we
 joke
 about
 this
 in
 the
 industry.
 Uh


it's
 kind
 of
 like
 you
 know
 there's


groups
 that
 do
 ransomware
 as
 a
 service.


They'll
 go
 become
 resident
 in
 tens
 of


thousands
 of
 pieces
 of
 equipment
 based


on
 known
 vulnerabilities
 and
 offer
 that


capability
 to
 people
 who
 want
 to
 go
 uh


exploit
 it
 uh
 for
 their
 own
 monetary


reasons.
 How
 much
 money
 in
 this


industry?
 I
 mean
 billions.
 Billions.


Look,
 it's
 it's
 unfortunately
 one
 of
 the


most


[Music]


um
 profitable
 industries
 out
 there


because
 I
 think
 by
 last
 count
 there
 was


close
 to
 $18
 billion
 uh
 between


ransomware
 and
 scams,
 online
 scams,


which
 are
 another
 form
 of
 cyber
 sort
 of


behavior.
 And
 the
 challenge,
 Nikolai,
 is


that
 in
 each
 of
 these
 cases,
 it's
 very


hard
 to
 prosecute
 people
 because


eventually
 your
 your
 lead
 ends
 up
 in


some
 third
 world
 country
 or
 in
 some


other
 country
 which
 is
 very
 far
 away
 and


you
 don't
 have
 the
 capability
 to
 go


investigate
 all
 the
 way
 across
 five


different
 nations
 or
 multiple


continents.
 It's
 very
 hard
 to
 go


prosecute
 them
 unless
 these
 are
 things


of
 significance
 in
 nature.
 Right?
 If


somebody
 made
 you
 transfer
 $10,000
 to
 a


bank
 account
 in
 in
 Africa,
 it's
 very


hard
 to
 prosecute
 that.
 and
 reverse


that.
 Now,
 if
 you
 are
 going
 to
 get


ransom
 attacked
 or
 you're
 going
 to
 bring


down
 critical
 infrastructure,
 you're


going
 to
 block
 a
 pipeline.
 Yes,
 there
 is


prosecution
 that
 can
 happen
 in
 that


situation
 because
 it's
 bigger
 than
 just


monetary
 impact.
 It's
 kind
 of
 oh
 my
 god,


somebody's
 trying
 to,
 you
 know,
 so
 chaos


in
 some
 infrastructure
 capability
 or


some
 utility
 capability.
 That's
 when


people
 do
 get
 engaged
 and
 get
 involved.


But
 I
 think
 there's
 a
 very
 long
 tale


where
 it's
 very
 hard
 to
 go
 prosecute


these
 situations.
 Why
 are
 um


infrastructure
 projects
 increasingly


under
 attacks?
 I
 mean
 we're
 seeing
 it
 in


water
 plants,
 telco
 networks,
 power


grids
 and
 so
 on.
 Why
 are
 the
 hackers


going
 after
 these
 things?
 Well,
 I
 think


it's
 uh
 first
 of
 all,
 it's
 easier


because
 typically
 those
 things
 are,
 you


know,
 they
 have
 relatively
 older


infrastructure
 for
 the
 most
 part
 because


their
 job
 is
 to
 provide
 electricity
 and


provide
 water
 and
 power
 etc.
 They're
 not


sometimes
 technologically
 as
 advanced
 as


you'd
 like
 them
 to
 be.
 But
 what
 we're


also
 discovering
 is
 despite
 their
 old


infrastructure
 for
 ease
 of
 use
 and


convenience,
 we're
 putting
 on
 sort
 of


band-aid
 systems
 which
 can
 connect
 to


those
 things.
 So
 you
 know
 it's
 a
 lot


easier
 to
 manage
 an
 electrical
 grid


remotely
 if
 you
 can
 have
 every
 part
 of


the
 electrical
 grid
 that
 is
 connected


through
 some
 internet
 of
 things
 or
 IoT


or
 operational
 technology.
 But
 the


challenge
 is
 because
 that's
 older


infrastructure
 all
 these
 tools
 and


capabilities
 are
 patched
 on
 and
 that


means
 when
 we
 patch
 something
 on
 there


is
 the
 possibility
 that
 bad
 actors
 can


get
 in
 through
 the
 same
 doors
 and
 you


just
 exposed
 some
 old
 infrastructure
 to


internet
 access.
 So
 from
 that


perspective,
 a
 they're
 easy.
 B,
 as
 I


said,
 when
 nation
 states
 get
 involved,


they're
 not
 looking
 for
 just
 monetary


outcomes.
 They're
 also
 looking
 to
 see


how
 do
 you
 destabilize
 uh
 a
 county,
 a


city,
 a
 state,
 or
 a
 nation.
 And
 it's


kind
 of
 their
 way
 of
 probing
 and
 getting


ready
 in
 case
 there
 is
 a
 scenario
 where


they
 have
 to
 leverage
 that.
 And
 so


you're
 seeing
 a
 lot
 of
 that.
 Um,
 for
 the


most
 part,
 as
 you
 can
 see,
 there
 hasn't


been
 a
 situation,
 except
 for
 what
 we
 saw


recently
 in
 the
 Middle
 East
 or
 in


Ukraine
 where
 these
 things
 were
 used
 uh


in
 the
 case
 of
 wars.
 In
 most
 other


cases,
 this
 is
 work
 that
 they're
 doing


to
 uh
 sort
 of
 flex
 their
 muscles,


understand
 their
 skills,
 understand


their
 capability,
 and
 be
 ready
 for
 a


rainy
 day.
 If
 you
 had
 my
 job,
 what
 would


you
 be
 the
 most
 worried
 about?


Uh
 look
 in
 your
 business
 there's
 event


risk
 right
 uh
 although
 if
 everything


goes
 down
 the
 path
 you
 have
 wonderful


models
 that
 try
 and
 tell
 you
 how
 things


going
 to
 happen
 from
 an
 event
 risk


perspective
 it's
 very
 hard
 to
 model
 it


it's
 very
 hard
 to
 be
 afraid
 of
 it


because
 event
 risk
 is
 event
 risk
 if


something's
 going
 to
 happen
 to
 one
 of


your
 portfolio
 companies
 is
 going to


happen
 if
 something's
 going
 to
 happen


that
 impacts
 a
 certain
 sector
 of
 your


portfolio
 is
 going
 to
 happen
 I
 think
 on


the
 flip
 side
 what
 you
 can
 look
 for
 is


uh
 I
 say
 basic
 hygiene
 You
 know


typically
 cyber
 security
 is
 like
 water


it
 follows
 the
 path
 of
 least
 resistance.


So
 the
 companies
 which
 are
 most


vulnerable
 will
 be
 the
 ones
 which
 will


have
 the
 most
 problems.


So
 demanding
 a
 certain
 level
 of
 quality


certain
 level
 of
 cyber
 security
 hygiene


becomes
 important
 and
 you
 see
 that
 you


know
 there
 are
 various
 executive
 orders


edicts
 from
 governments
 where
 they


demand
 that
 a
 certain
 level
 of
 hygiene


be
 maintained
 by
 critical
 infrastructure


because
 that
 can
 impact
 nation
 state


stability.
 There
 are
 uh
 financial


services
 requirements
 where
 the


regulators
 require
 tremendous
 amounts
 of


you
 know
 cyber
 security
 hygiene
 and


capability.
 The
 federal
 government


requires
 a
 certain
 amount
 of
 hygiene


from
 federal
 contractors.
 So
 there
 are


there
 are
 examples
 out
 there
 where


people
 do
 require
 that
 degree
 of
 you


know
 standard
 care
 or
 diligence.
 I
 think


I
 think
 you
 guys
 should
 be
 at
 least


looking
 at
 that
 or
 demanding
 the
 same.


Are
 you
 worried
 about
 the
 whole


financial
 system
 plumbing
 like
 stock


exchanges
 that
 kind
 of
 thing?
 Look,
 um
 I


can
 scare
 myself
 every
 day
 if
 I
 want
 to.


So
 I
 believe
 in
 the
 sort
 of
 you
 know
 the


goodness
 of
 humanity.
 If
 you
 look


around,
 we
 haven't
 seen
 those
 things.


And
 I
 think
 the
 flip
 side
 is
 the


resilience
 as
 well.
 Look
 at
 you
 know
 we


we
 powered
 through
 a
 pandemic
 which
 is


one
 of the
 biggest
 crisis
 that


civilization
 has
 seen
 in
 modern
 times.


So
 can
 we
 overcome
 some
 you
 know


plumbing
 breakdown?
 Sure
 we
 can.
 Will
 it


be
 choppy?
 Possibly.
 Uh
 it
 all
 depends


on
 the
 extent
 and
 uh
 the
 the
 extent
 of


the
 impact
 and
 the
 sort
 of
 the
 the
 the


scale
 of
 the
 impact.
 But
 I
 I
 I'm
 not


worried.
 There's
 enough
 segmentation,


there's
 enough
 circuit
 breakers
 in
 the


systems
 where
 I
 think
 today
 we
 say
 look


when
 you
 think
 about
 cyber
 security,


think
 about
 cyber
 resilience
 because
 the


possibility
 that
 you
 can
 get
 attacked,


hacked
 or
 brought
 down
 to
 your
 knees
 is


reasonably
 high.
 If
 if
 if
 somebody
 shows


up
 with
 tremendous
 amounts
 of
 force
 and


compute,
 they
 can
 find
 a
 way
 into


breaking
 into
 that
 one
 in
 your


armor
 and
 destabilize
 you.
 The
 question


is
 how
 resilient
 are
 you?
 If
 somebody


does
 destabilize
 you,
 how
 quickly
 can


you
 come
 back
 up?
 How
 quickly
 can
 you


bring
 your
 infrastructure
 back
 up
 and


you
 can
 resume
 operations?
 And
 that's


kind
 of
 where
 the
 focus
 has
 been
 the


last
 few
 years
 amongst
 large
 companies,


enterprises,
 critical
 systems.
 And


that's
 a
 good
 thing
 because
 I
 think


that's
 the
 right
 way
 to
 think
 about
 it.


The
 right
 way
 to
 think
 about
 is
 not
 that


I
 can
 I
 can
 protect
 myself
 infinitely


better
 and
 nobody's
 going
 to
 get
 into
 my


system.
 You
 have
 to
 assume
 it's
 going
 to


happen
 and
 when
 it
 happens,
 how
 quickly


can
 you
 stand
 up?
 So,
 I
 think
 that's
 all


goodness.


Well,
 I
 am
 I
 am
 slightly
 confident
 by


the
 fact
 that
 you
 still
 believe
 in
 the


goodness
 as
 humankind
 because
 I
 uh
 I


hadn't
 really
 expected
 that
 to
 be
 the


case.
 But,


as
 I
 say,
 hope
 for
 the
 best
 and
 prepare


for
 the
 worst.
 That's
 what
 we
 do
 every


day.
 Now
 um
 compared
 to
 other
 uh
 sectors


within
 technology
 the
 um
 cyber
 sub


sector
 is
 uh
 is
 quite
 fragmented.
 Why
 is


it
 not
 more
 consolidated?
 That's
 a
 great


question
 and
 I
 think
 uh
 if
 you
 look
 at


technology
 uh
 that
 was
 our
 thesis
 7


years
 ago
 uh
 when
 I
 came
 here
 our
 thesis


was
 it's
 about
 a
 $200
 billion
 revenue


industry
 annually
 and
 we
 were
 at
 one
 and


a
 half%
 market
 share.
 we
 were
 one
 of
 the


top
 three
 players
 in
 the
 market.
 So


that's
 that
 is
 like
 you
 said
 fragmented


in
 the
 small
 and
 I
 think
 you
 can
 go
 back


and
 trace
 it
 first
 of
 all
 remember
 cyber


security
 is
 one
 of the
 newest
 subsectors


of
 technology
 right
 in
 1989
 when
 I
 went


to
 university
 there's
 nothing
 called


internet


connectivity
 right
 so
 this
 thing
 is
 less


than
 30
 years
 old
 and
 true
 widespread


connectivity
 really
 came
 about
 for
 all


consumers
 and
 mobile
 phones
 were
 sort
 of


popular
 and
 people
 started
 using
 apps
 on


their
 phones
 because
 now
 every
 company


any
 enterprise
 had
 to
 open
 doors
 for


your
 bank
 account
 or
 you
 pick
 your


favorite
 activity
 with
 your
 company
 or


e-commerce.
 So
 really
 we
 have
 seen
 the


interconnectedness
 arrive
 in
 the
 last
 20


years.
 You
 make
 it
 sound
 like
 we
 are


old.
 We
 are.
 I
 thought
 we
 were
 super


young.
 We're
 not
 old.
 We're
 going
 to


live
 to
 150,
 right?
 With
 the
 longevity


things
 that
 are
 going
 on
 in
 the
 world.


So
 we're
 we're
 like
 an
 early
 part
 of
 our


lifetime.
 But
 my
 point
 is
 this
 this


industry
 subsector
 is
 20
 years
 old.


Yeah.
 That's
 when
 it
 started.
 So
 it


hasn't
 had
 time
 to
 actually
 consolidate


in
 some
 sort
 of
 platform.
 If
 you
 look
 at


you
 look
 at
 workflow
 management,
 you


look
 at
 CRM,
 you
 look
 at
 you
 know
 uh
 IT


management,
 these
 things
 have
 been


around
 30
 40
 years
 or
 50
 years
 and
 you


you've
 seen
 platformization
 or
 what
 I


like
 to
 call
 the
 consolidation
 of
 this


fragmentation
 into
 more
 meaningful
 sort


of
 technology
 providers
 and
 our
 thesis


and
 our
 bet
 is
 that
 over
 time
 cyber


security
 will
 go
 the
 same
 way.
 We're


blessed
 that
 we're
 now
 about
 four
 to
 5%


of
 the
 market
 and
 possibly
 8%
 of
 the


product
 market
 which
 is
 better
 than
 one


and
 a
 half
 percent
 but
 there's
 no
 reason


there's
 not
 a
 20%
 player
 in
 the
 segment


in
 the
 next
 5
 to
 10
 years.
 Now
 you


previously
 worked
 with
 um
 Google
 and


then
 SoftBank.
 What
 did
 you
 learn
 there


which
 you
 have
 brought
 with
 you
 uh
 to


the
 current
 company?
 Uh
 Nicola
 I
 was


very
 blessed
 to
 see
 the
 the
 sort
 of
 the


emergence
 of
 interconnectedness
 and
 the


internet
 from
 a
 vantage
 point
 like


Google.
 You
 know,
 I
 spent
 10
 years
 there


between
 Europe
 and
 the
 US
 and
 I
 got
 to


see
 how
 the
 world
 sort
 of
 grabbed


technology
 with
 both
 hands
 and
 sort
 of


the
 the
 thing
 which
 I
 think
 makes
 Google


great
 and
 continues
 to
 is
 their


obsession
 on
 product,
 right?
 You
 can
 see


at
 Google
 there
 were
 so
 many
 products


when
 I
 worked
 there
 which
 had
 a
 zero


zero
 monetization
 and
 possibly
 even


today
 things
 like
 Google
 Maps
 or
 the


Chrome
 browser
 but
 Google
 focused
 on


building
 products
 from
 a
 technology


perspective
 to
 make
 it
 convenient
 for


end
 customers
 and
 I'm
 sure
 there's
 some


sort
 of
 a
 virtual
 circle
 that
 allows


them
 to
 monetize
 that
 in
 their


advertising
 business
 or
 their
 YouTube


business.
 But
 uh
 the
 and
 then
 Larry
 told


me
 once
 and
 uh
 and
 I
 think
 he's
 right


Larry
 Asen
 as
 in
 one
 of
 the
 founders


Larry
 Page.
 Yes.
 Thank
 you.
 Yes.
 He
 said


to
 me
 once,
 look,
 if
 you
 look
 at


technology
 companies
 over
 time,


technology
 companies
 die
 when
 they
 stop


focusing
 on
 product
 and
 start
 focusing


on
 other
 things.
 And
 that's
 true.
 If
 you


look
 at
 the
 history
 of
 technology,
 there


is
 there
 is
 sort
 of
 the
 the
 battlefield


is
 littered
 with
 companies
 who
 whose
 eye


was
 off
 the
 product.
 And
 that's
 what
 he


was
 very
 obsessed
 about.
 I
 brought
 that


here.
 I
 said
 look
 for
 us
 to
 win
 in
 the


long
 term
 at
 Po
 Alto
 the
 only
 way
 we
 are


going
 to
 win
 is
 if
 our
 products
 are
 the


best
 in
 the
 market
 and
 the
 customers


rely
 on
 our
 products.
 So
 we
 brought
 a


lot
 of
 product
 discipline.
 We
 had
 to
 buy


20
 companies
 because
 we
 were
 we
 were


sort
 of
 on
 the
 back
 foot
 or
 late
 in
 our


innovation
 cycle
 and
 we
 couldn't
 wait


four
 years
 because
 you
 know
 corollery
 to


that
 I
 believe
 it
 takes
 four
 to
 seven


years
 to
 build
 a
 great
 technology


product.
 It
 doesn't
 matter
 what
 it
 did.


What
 about
 soft
 bank?
 Well
 Soft
 Bank
 you


know
 is
 uh
 yet
 another
 fascinating


founder
 Maso
 Shian.
 uh
 he
 as
 I've
 always


I've
 seen
 is
 like
 I
 think
 he
 has
 he's


one
 person
 whose
 risk
 appetite
 increases


as
 he
 gets
 older
 and
 you
 know


fascinatingly
 when
 we
 have
 we
 have


children
 I
 have
 two
 young
 kids
 and
 I


realize
 as
 we
 bring
 them
 up
 our
 instinct


is
 to
 help
 them
 risk
 minimize
 don't
 look


on
 both
 sides
 of
 the
 street
 when
 you


cross
 the
 street
 be
 careful
 don't
 do


this
 don't
 do
 that
 be
 careful
 we're


constantly
 grooming
 people
 to
 start


minimizing
 risk
 but
 you
 get
 married
 make


sure
 you
 don't
 overextend
 himself.
 Masa


at
 the
 age
 of
 60
 is
 like
 let's
 swing


let's
 swing
 harder
 and
 I
 think
 it's
 just


fascinating.
 So
 where
 did
 that
 come


from?
 Where
 where
 does
 that
 come
 from?
 I


think
 it
 comes
 innately
 from
 him.
 I


think
 this
 is
 who
 he
 is.
 And
 he's
 done


that
 so
 many
 times
 and
 you
 know
 first


time
 or
 second
 time
 it
 looks
 like
 a


coincidence
 when
 he
 does
 it
 four
 times


like
 holy
 he's
 got
 something
 going


here.
 Uh
 which
 should
 be
 bottled
 and
 and


he
 was
 the
 richest
 man
 in
 the
 world
 for


some


days
 possibly
 you
 know.
 But
 you
 are


swinging
 pretty
 hard
 too
 you
 know.
 Yes.


Well
 that's
 what
 I
 said.
 So
 you
 bring


that
 from
 there
 saying
 look
 you
 know


what
 don't
 worry
 about
 what
 you're
 going


to
 break
 worry
 about
 what
 you
 can
 build


from
 from
 there
 and
 I
 think
 that's
 the


two
 principles
 we
 operate
 paddle
 alto
 on


is
 one
 focus
 obsessively
 on
 the
 product


make
 sure
 our
 customers
 see
 value
 in
 our


product
 two
 is
 don't
 be
 scared
 of
 taking


managed
 risk
 so
 how
 did
 it
 work
 so
 when


you
 joined
 um
 Palo
 Alto
 Networks
 you
 had


little
 experience
 from
 cyber
 security


right
 so
 they
 called
 up
 and
 say
 well
 so


hey
 Nikash
 you
 want
 to
 come
 and
 join
 the


company
 yeah
 I
 know
 nothing
 about
 it


well
 great
 join
 anyway
 Okay.
 And
 then


you
 became
 the
 CEO.
 Yeah.
 I
 think
 you


have
 to
 hold
 the
 board
 accountable
 for


their
 bad
 decision,
 right?
 Because
 uh


they
 were
 looking
 for
 a
 CEO
 for
 a
 public


company.
 I'd
 never
 run
 a
 public
 company.


They're
 looking
 for
 an
 enterprise
 CEO


because
 this
 we
 sell
 to
 enterprises.
 And


they're
 looking
 for
 somebody
 who


understood
 cyber
 security.
 Other
 than


not
 having
 those
 three
 qualifications.
 I


was
 a
 great
 guy.
 I
 said,
 you
 know,
 like


you
 must
 have
 really
 run
 short
 on


potential
 supply
 of
 potential
 CEO


candidates
 that
 you
 hired
 me.
 And
 I


guess
 they
 knew
 more
 than
 I
 did.
 They


said
 to
 me,
 "We
 have
 5,000
 people
 who


understands
 cyber
 security
 really
 well.


So
 we
 don't
 need
 one
 more
 person
 who


understands
 cyber
 security.
 We
 need


somebody
 who
 can
 lead
 this
 company
 from


where
 we
 are
 into
 being
 one
 of
 the
 major


forces
 in
 the
 space."
 And
 you
 know
 it


was
 a
 very
 steep
 learning
 curve.
 Very


very
 steep.
 I
 won't
 deny
 that.
 Uh
 but
 I


had
 some
 great
 teachers.
 How
 what
 has


happened
 to
 the
 market
 capitalization
 of


the
 company
 during
 your
 tenure?
 Uh
 we


started
 seven
 and
 and
 you
 don't
 have
 to


you
 don't
 have
 to
 be
 modest.
 So
 you
 can


just
 give
 us
 the
 numbers.
 It's
 the


numbers.
 It's
 numerical.
 Right.
 7
 years


ago
 when
 I
 started,
 we're
 approximately


$18
 billion
 in
 market
 cap.
 And
 today


we're
 around
 120
 give
 or
 take.
 How
 do


you
 uh
 move
 up
 the
 learning
 curve?
 You


join
 a
 firm
 like
 that.
 Uh
 it's
 not
 your


expertise.
 Just
 how
 do
 you
 go
 about
 uh


learning
 a
 new
 field
 like
 that?
 You


know,
 it's
 great
 question
 and
 I
 said
 uh


I
 relied
 on
 every
 one
 of
 those
 people,


5,000
 plus
 people
 who
 understood
 cyber


security.
 I
 think
 they
 probably
 their


ears
 were
 red,
 their
 eyes
 were
 teary


eyed
 every
 time
 because
 I
 would
 pepper


them
 with
 questions
 every
 time.
 You


know,
 I
 I I
 would
 call
 our
 co-founder
 in


the
 morning
 coming
 into
 work
 for
 an
 hour


asking
 him
 all
 kinds
 of
 stupid
 questions


because
 things
 I
 had
 read
 in
 the
 night


and
 I
 call
 our
 chief
 product
 officer
 on


my
 drive
 home
 saying,
 "I'm
 so
 confused.


I
 learned
 so
 many
 different
 things
 today


and
 help
 me
 make
 sense
 of
 it."
 I


possibly
 did
 that
 for
 I
 want
 to
 say
 the


first
 18
 months.
 I
 also
 used
 that
 time


to
 meet
 300
 individual
 cyber
 security


companies
 because
 our
 industry
 is
 very


very
 prolific.
 There's
 2,000
 cyber


security
 companies
 formed
 every
 year.


So,
 you
 know,
 I
 could
 always
 find


somebody
 want
 to
 tell
 me
 what
 they
 were


doing.
 And
 slowly
 I
 started
 to
 build
 a


framework
 in
 my
 head
 as
 to
 you
 know
 what


would
 be
 interesting
 uh
 and
 I
 built
 a


few
 thesis
 about
 how
 the
 industry


operates
 and
 what
 needs
 to
 happen.
 And


my
 plastics
 moment
 was
 you
 know
 having


been
 at
 Google
 I
 said
 look
 the
 two
 most


important
 things
 from
 a
 technology


perspective
 would
 be
 cloud
 and
 AI
 this


is
 something
 we
 said
 seven
 years
 ago


when
 AI
 was
 not
 in
 fashion
 cloud
 was


beginning
 to
 get
 into
 fashion
 and
 so
 we


pivoted
 our
 company
 we
 burned
 down
 our


data
 centers
 we
 don't
 have
 data
 centers


we
 run
 everything
 in
 the
 public
 cloud
 uh


we
 built
 a
 whole
 practice
 around
 cloud


security
 uh
 we
 built
 our
 entire
 security


management
 stack
 using
 machine
 learning


which
 was
 the
 the the
 normal
 name
 for
 AI


at
 that
 point
 in
 time
 seven
 years
 ago


but
 it
 took
 us
 seven
 years
 to
 build
 a


great
 product
 and
 we're
 delighted


because
 some
 of
 those
 investments
 we


made
 seven
 years
 ago
 are
 is
 kind
 of
 what


is
 bearing
 fruit
 and
 allowing
 us
 to


succeed
 the
 way
 we
 are
 now
 the
 founder


of
 the
 company
 Neil
 he's
 still
 chief


technology
 officer
 right
 yes
 what
 um


what
 does
 that
 mean
 how
 does
 that
 work


well's
 a
 phenomenal
 brain
 when
 it
 comes


to
 security
 it
 comes
 innately
 to
 him
 you


know
 he
 worked
 in
 in
 unit
 8200
 in
 Israel


uh
 he
 saw
 opportunities
 he
 came
 He


worked
 in
 the
 security
 sector.
 He


decided
 to
 spin
 out
 and
 start
 bal


networks
 and
 some
 of
 the
 the
 early


product
 insights
 and
 decisions
 were


driven
 uh
 based
 on
 what
 he
 thought
 was


the
 right
 way
 to
 go.
 Now
 he
 acts
 as
 a


technology
 consiliary
 both
 for
 our


management
 team
 as
 well
 as
 our


customers.
 So
 he'll
 go
 out
 meet


customers
 talk
 about
 the
 security
 stack


work
 with
 them
 as
 to
 what
 should
 be
 the


greatest
 outcome
 for
 them.
 He'll
 sit


down
 with
 our
 teams
 and
 sit
 down
 look
 at


what
 they're
 trying
 to
 do
 and
 sort
 of


attack
 problems
 from
 a
 first
 principal


basis.
 was
 very
 helpful.
 You
 mentioned


some
 of
 the
 trends
 that
 you
 were
 early


to
 spot.
 What's
 the
 key
 to
 spot
 a
 trend


early?
 How
 do
 you
 do
 it?
 Uh
 look,
 uh
 I


read
 something
 the
 other
 day
 from
 a


distinguished
 person
 at
 Microsoft
 and
 uh


he
 was
 saying
 it
 in
 the
 context
 of
 I


think
 internet
 explorer.
 He
 said
 you
 can


see
 a
 tipping
 point
 typically
 three
 or


four
 years
 before
 it
 is
 going
 to
 become


widespread
 and
 fundamentally
 obvious


right
 and
 the
 key
 is
 when
 you
 look
 at


technological
 trends
 you
 have
 to
 say


what
 is
 it
 that
 I
 just
 saw
 and
 how's


that
 going
 to
 fundamentally
 change


things
 so
 take
 take
 AI
 for
 now
 right


there's
 a
 huge
 brew
 of
 haha
 around
 AI


and
 people
 actually
 sit
 there
 and
 say
 oh


my
 god
 this
 AI
 is
 going
 to
 be
 amazing


and
 you
 can
 see
 Nvidia
 you
 can
 see


infrastructure
 people
 want
 to
 spend
 $500


billion
 building
 large
 data
 clusters,


data
 centers.
 The
 question
 is,
 but


what's
 the
 insight?
 What
 is
 that
 going


to
 do?
 Now,
 you
 can
 see
 it.
 It's
 pretty


clear.
 Everybody's
 clear
 that


something's
 going
 to
 happen
 with
 AI
 and


something's
 going
 to
 be
 fundamentally


different
 four
 to
 five
 years
 from
 now.


The
 question
 is
 how
 radical
 is
 it
 going


to
 be
 5
 to
 10
 years
 from
 now?
 You
 have


to
 sit
 down
 and
 define
 your
 principles.


Like
 I
 fundamentally
 believe
 product


development
 will
 go
 flip
 on
 its
 head.


Today,
 you
 know,
 50%
 of
 technologies
 are


deployed
 in
 product
 development
 across


technology
 companies.
 you
 won't
 need
 to


do
 it
 as
 much
 because
 product


development
 in
 technology
 companies
 is


us
 designing
 a
 way
 to
 talk
 to
 data
 and


machines.
 That's
 what
 we
 do.
 Product


development
 people
 say
 let
 me
 take
 all


this
 make
 it
 simple.
 It's
 like
 you


booking
 your
 airline
 ticket
 on


booking.com.
 That
 UI
 is
 called
 product


development.
 Well,
 if
 I
 can
 just
 talk
 to


it
 and
 say
 book
 me
 a
 ticket
 and
 do
 this


stuff
 for
 me
 and
 this
 is
 a
 fundamentally


easy
 example.
 Whether
 it's
 say
 Door
 Dash


or
 Instacart,
 you
 don't
 need
 to
 build


all
 this
 amazing
 UI
 that
 sits
 in
 front


from
 a
 product
 development
 perspective.


You
 can
 start
 talking
 to
 data
 and


machines
 because
 they
 understand
 you
 as


another
 human
 would
 and
 that's
 how
 your


interaction
 becomes.
 If
 you
 believe


that's
 the
 future
 10
 years
 from
 now,


everything
 fundamentally


changes.
 Then
 the
 next
 question
 is
 how


do
 you
 position
 yourself
 in
 that
 future?


Uh
 should
 you
 be
 chasing
 things
 like
 you


know
 writing
 better
 legal
 briefs
 or
 you


know
 and
 investing
 in
 companies
 which


are
 making
 marginal
 incremental


improvements
 or
 should
 be
 fundamentally


rethinking
 how
 that's
 going
 to
 impact


technology.
 We
 have
 to
 think
 right
 like


we
 think
 their
 future
 of
 the
 future
 of


AI
 is
 going
 to
 be
 more
 agentic
 in


nature.
 We're
 sitting
 saying
 if
 that


world
 transpires
 how
 do
 we
 build


security
 protection
 where
 agents
 don't


don't
 run
 a
 mock.
 So
 we're
 trying
 to


build
 a
 whole
 fantasy
 world
 of
 agents
 in


our
 head
 and
 then
 we
 have
 to
 say
 how
 do


we
 protect
 that
 fancy
 world
 of
 agents.


So
 we
 have
 we
 have
 like
 a
 second


derivative
 problem
 not
 just
 first


derative
 problem.
 So
 if
 you
 apply
 this


thinking
 to
 the
 technology
 sector,
 where


should
 you
 place
 your
 bets
 now?
 Any


software
 business
 that
 relies
 on
 seats,


that
 relies
 on
 humans
 and
 humans
 using


more
 software
 has
 to
 fundamentally


rethink
 their
 strategy,
 right?
 Because


if
 you
 believe
 this
 wave
 of
 AI
 is
 going


to
 be
 true,
 we're
 going
 to
 be
 much
 more


efficient
 and
 we're
 going
 to
 be
 using


humans
 fundamentally
 differently
 in


the
 enterprise
 environment
 and
 the


entrepreneurial
 environment
 and
 you'll


get
 a
 lot
 more
 done
 with
 a
 lot
 less.
 If


that's
 true,
 then
 you
 have
 to
 focus
 on


what
 the
 lot
 more
 is
 going
 to
 be
 because


you're
 going
 to
 have
 a
 lot
 less
 from
 a


people
 perspective.
 So
 I
 think


rethinking
 that
 would
 be
 interesting.
 I


think
 there
 will
 be
 some
 market


dislocations.
 I
 was
 chatting
 with


somebody
 last
 night
 and
 we
 talked
 about


look
 typically
 the
 market
 first
 doesn't


realize


uh
 until
 it
 gets
 hit
 but
 when
 it
 gets


hit
 it
 swings
 too
 hard
 in
 the
 opposite


direction.
 So
 there'll
 be
 value


opportunities
 in
 the
 market
 in
 a
 few


years
 when
 market
 begins
 to
 see
 this
 uh


catastrophe
 coming
 in
 the
 short
 term
 the


market
 is
 not
 realizing
 that
 this
 thing


is
 going
 to
 start
 taking
 more
 momentum


over
 time
 as
 things
 get
 more
 and
 more


efficient.
 So
 I
 think
 there's
 going
 to


be
 a
 rethinking
 on
 the
 enterprise
 side


uh
 for
 seedbased
 based
 businesses
 and


you
 can
 see
 all
 of
 them
 are
 very
 focused


on
 AI
 and
 creating
 more
 value
 with
 AI


and
 figuring
 out
 how
 to
 deliver
 AI


agents
 instead
 of
 humans
 and
 that's
 kind


of
 an
 smart
 thing
 and
 interesting
 thing.


Some
 will
 make
 it
 some
 won't.
 I
 think
 on


the
 consumer
 side
 I've
 said
 this
 before


I'll
 say
 it
 here
 is
 I
 think
 the
 whole


idea
 of
 applications
 on
 your
 devices
 is


going
 to
 have
 to
 be
 rethought.
 That's


going
 to
 be
 sea
 change
 because
 do
 I


really
 want
 14
 AI
 agents
 talking
 to
 me


on
 my
 phone?
 I
 don't
 think
 so.
 So
 we


have
 to
 figure
 out
 a
 way
 of


disintermediating
 these
 agents.
 And
 the


question
 is
 who
 is
 in
 a
 pole
 position
 to


take
 that
 leading
 role
 in
 talking
 to


those
 14
 15
 200
 agents
 behind
 me
 and


then
 what
 does
 that
 do
 to
 economics
 to


customer
 ownership
 to
 where
 the
 the


financial
 transactional
 health
 be
 very


interesting
 world
 for
 the
 next
 5
 to
 10


years
 from
 how
 AI
 actually
 gets
 deployed


and
 how
 many
 sectors
 it
 impacts.
 So
 who


is
 going
 to
 be
 the
 winner?
 If
 I
 knew


that
 Nicole
 I'll
 be
 doing
 what
 you
 do.


Who's
 going
 to
 be
 hit?


Where
 are
 the
 where
 are
 the
 big
 hits


going
 to
 be?
 I
 think
 it's
 early
 to
 call


because
 you
 know
 these
 are
 not
 static


things.
 These
 are
 not
 static
 companies


who
 are
 sitting
 there
 waiting
 for


consequences
 to
 happen
 in
 them.
 I
 think


many
 of
 these
 people
 are
 well
 aware
 of


this
 problem.
 They
 probably
 are
 more


thoughtful
 about
 it
 than
 I've
 just
 told


you.
 So
 there
 are
 people
 who
 understand


these
 challenges.
 There
 are
 people
 who


are
 working
 on
 these.
 Like
 you
 can
 apply


that
 and
 say
 there's
 going
 to
 be


goodness.
 We're
 going
 to
 get
 this


solved.
 But
 on
 the
 flip
 side,
 you
 go


back
 25
 years
 ago,
 you
 know,
 we
 never


saw
 the
 emergence
 of
 Google
 or
 Facebook


or
 Amazon
 um
 and
 their
 likes.
 We
 never


saw
 the
 the
 the
 emergence
 of
 open
 AI
 at


the
 scale
 that
 has
 come
 to
 it.
 So,
 I'm


pretty
 sure
 there'll
 be
 10
 to
 20
 new


players
 who
 we
 haven't
 fully


comprehended
 are
 going
 to
 go
 run
 this


table
 from
 first
 principles
 from


scratch.
 And
 I'm
 sure
 some
 of
 us
 will


adapt.
 I
 mean,
 Walmart
 still
 exists
 and


they've
 done
 a
 phenomenal
 job
 from


e-commerce
 perspective,
 right?
 Even


though they
 were
 late
 to
 the
 party
 visa


v
 Amazon.
 There'll
 be,
 you
 know,
 early


sort
 of
 early
 entrepreneurs.
 There'll
 be


people
 who
 will
 be
 late
 adapters,
 but


they'll
 they'll
 have
 tremendous
 assets


they
 can
 bring
 to
 bear
 to
 make
 it
 work.


And
 there's
 some
 people
 who
 fall
 by
 the


wayside.
 Would
 you
 mind
 just
 enlighten


us
 a
 tiny
 bit?
 You
 mentioned
 first


principle
 uh
 twice.
 What
 does
 it
 mean?


Well,
 the
 first
 principle
 is,
 you
 know,


you
 go
 back
 and
 look
 at
 it
 and
 say


eliminate
 all
 constraints.
 Rethink
 if


this
 was
 from
 scratch.
 How
 would
 you
 do


it
 if
 you
 didn't
 have
 any
 of
 the
 baggage


you
 know
 of
 the
 present
 in
 the
 industry


in
 your
 category
 in
 your
 sector
 that


usually
 gives
 you
 a
 better
 outcome.
 It's


kind
 of
 like
 that's
 how
 true
 innovation


gets
 formed
 saying
 how
 what
 are
 the


tools
 I
 can
 bring
 to
 bear
 today
 which


never
 existed
 20
 years
 ago
 which
 makes


it
 a
 lot
 easier
 to
 build
 this
 from


scratch.
 You
 know
 I
 learned
 an


interesting
 lesson
 and
 I'll
 tell
 you


anecdote
 uh
 very
 dear
 colleague
 of
 mine


at
 Google.
 uh
 he
 was
 trying
 to
 think


about
 mobile
 apps
 in
 the
 future
 and
 I


used
 to
 work
 in
 the
 mobile
 industry


before
 and
 we
 were
 chatting
 about
 it
 and


he
 said
 look
 there's
 200
 operating


systems
 in
 the
 world
 on
 mobile
 phones


right
 now
 it's
 impossible
 to
 build
 an


application
 because
 we
 have
 to
 comply


with
 200
 different
 operating
 systems.
 I


said
 what
 are
 you
 going
 to
 do?
 He's
 like


I'm
 going
 to
 focus
 on
 Android
 and
 and


iOS.
 I
 said
 why?
 He
 said,
 "If
 I
 look
 at


the
 trajectory
 five
 years
 from
 now,
 I


think
 the
 world
 will
 be
 60
 to
 75%


Android
 and
 iOS,
 and
 I
 don't
 care
 about


the
 rest
 because
 they're
 going
 to
 be
 on


a
 downward
 trajectory."
 Now,
 he
 went


back,
 rethought
 it,
 did
 it,
 simplified


it.
 It
 worked
 really
 well.
 And
 today,


he's
 right.
 He
 was
 right.
 He
 was
 right


15
 years
 ago,
 but
 at
 that
 point
 in
 time,


it
 was
 not
 obvious.
 I
 remember
 the
 CEO


of
 a
 very
 large
 mobile
 phone
 company


calling
 me,
 handset
 company,
 calling
 me


and
 yelling
 at
 me
 and
 saying
 we
 were


being
 duplicitous.
 But
 my
 colleague
 had


called
 the
 demise
 of
 their
 operating


system
 before
 they
 seen
 it.
 Related


um
 and
 talking
 about
 uh
 a
 big
 change


that
 you
 did
 in
 your
 company
 uh
 middle


of
 last
 year
 you
 doubled
 down
 on


platformization
 on
 your
 platformization


strategy
 which
 was
 uh
 part
 of
 your


long-term
 strategy
 and
 um
 it
 led
 to
 some


short-term
 negative
 effects
 uh
 certainly


for
 your
 share
 price.
 Just
 that
 swinging


thing.
 Absolutely.
 take
 us
 through
 your


thinking
 behind
 it
 and
 and
 then
 now
 one


year
 later
 what's
 uh
 what
 has
 it
 led
 to?


Yeah,
 look
 um
 you
 know
 as
 I've
 uh
 heard


in
 another
 podcast
 somebody
 say
 somebody


asked
 one
 of
 my
 old
 bosses
 you
 know
 if


you
 go
 back
 what
 would
 you
 have
 diff


done
 differently
 and
 he
 said
 I'd
 have


made
 my
 smart
 decisions
 faster
 uh
 except


you
 don't
 find
 out
 until
 after
 the
 fact.


So
 you
 know
 if
 you
 ask
 what
 I've
 done


different
 I
 wish
 I'd
 done
 it
 sooner
 but


I
 think
 there
 was
 the
 right
 time
 and
 a


place
 and
 I'll
 give
 you
 why.
 When
 I


started
 seven
 years
 ago,
 we
 were
 great


in
 firewalls
 and
 that's
 all
 we
 did.
 But


there
 were
 four
 other
 swim
 lanes
 in
 our


industry,
 which
 our
 industry
 used
 to
 let


everybody
 else
 play.
 Say,
 hey,
 you
 do


that
 and
 I'll
 do
 this.
 And
 I
 realized


like,
 well,
 why
 are
 we
 doing
 this?
 Why


do
 we
 just
 give
 a
 free
 pass
 to
 every
 net


new
 startup
 that
 shows
 up
 and
 wants
 to


play
 in
 a
 different
 swim
 lane?
 Why


aren't
 we
 in
 it?
 And
 you
 discovered
 that


over
 time
 there's
 learned
 behavior
 in


the
 industry
 that
 people
 have
 tried
 that


and
 failed.
 They
 stuck
 to
 their


knitting.
 So,
 we
 set
 about
 to
 say,
 well,


let's
 see
 if
 he
 can
 go
 play
 theirs.
 And


we
 built
 a
 phenomenal
 M&A
 strategy
 where


you
 know
 we
 could
 talk
 about
 that
 as


well
 if
 you
 want
 but
 we
 were
 able
 to


start
 establishing
 a
 beach
 sort
 of
 a


foothold
 in
 each
 of
 these
 other
 swim


lanes
 and
 over
 time
 in
 the
 last
 five


years
 I'd
 say
 the
 first
 five
 years
 we


got
 to
 a
 point
 where
 in
 each
 of
 these


swim
 lanes
 our
 product
 was
 now
 rated


number
 one
 or
 two
 in
 its
 category
 right


which
 is
 the
 which
 is
 kind
 of
 the
 table


stakes
 in
 cyber
 security
 the
 the
 the


normal
 default
 is
 security
 professionals


say
 hey
 if
 you're
 number
 one
 or
 two
 I


won't
 get
 fired
 for
 buying
 you
 if
 If


you're
 number
 four
 or
 five,
 why
 would
 I


buy
 you?
 You're
 you're
 a
 new
 player.
 So,


we
 had
 to
 get
 the
 right
 to
 play
 and


right
 to
 be
 at
 the
 table.
 We
 did
 that,


but
 we
 realized
 we
 were
 still
 fighting


individually
 against
 people
 who
 were


great
 in
 that
 category.
 And
 we
 looked
 at


and
 say,
 well,
 we're
 the
 only
 people
 who


have
 24
 products
 in
 the
 magic
 port
 in


the
 top
 right.
 Let's
 start
 showing
 the


benefits
 of
 these
 things
 working


together.
 So
 we
 spend
 one
 year
 stitching


them
 together
 hard hated
 and
 say
 look


these
 things
 are
 best
 in
 that
 category


yet
 even
 better
 if
 three
 of
 them
 work


together
 you
 don't
 have
 to
 go
 do
 the


stitching
 yourself
 and
 we're
 in
 the


cyber
 security
 world
 the
 more
 disparit


products
 you
 buy
 the
 more
 you
 have
 to
 go


figure
 out
 how
 they
 work
 together
 in
 in


in
 sort
 of
 an
 adversarial
 scenario.
 So


we
 were
 able
 to
 do
 that
 which
 became
 the


sort
 of
 the
 germination
 of
 our


platformization
 strategies
 and
 say
 let's


go
 sell
 the
 benefit
 of
 all
 these


together.
 It's
 lower
 cost
 of
 ownership,


higher
 simplicity,
 better
 security,
 and


actually
 customers
 might
 have
 to


actually
 pay
 less
 instead
 of
 constantly


paying
 more
 for
 security.
 So
 that's


taken
 hold.
 We
 sold
 over
 a
 thousand
 of


these
 deals
 in
 the
 last
 12
 months,
 which


is
 great.
 And
 we
 believe
 that's
 the


future.
 And
 if
 you
 look
 at,
 and
 I
 said


this
 earlier,
 if
 you
 look
 at
 Salesforce


or
 Workday
 or
 Service
 Now,
 all
 these
 are


platforms.
 And
 nobody
 goes
 went
 back
 and


said,
 "Wait,
 I
 used
 to
 have
 this
 done


with
 seven
 systems.
 Let
 me
 go
 back
 to


those
 seven
 because
 it
 was
 easier


there."
 It
 never
 was
 easier.
 You
 just


have
 to
 work
 people
 through
 their


objections
 and
 through
 their
 capabil


through
 their
 challenges
 and
 say
 this
 is


a
 much
 better
 outcome
 for
 you.
 So
 we're


we're
 on
 the
 early
 part
 of
 our
 journey


but
 we
 believe
 that
 is
 the
 future
 of


this
 industry.
 And
 the
 good
 news
 is


since
 we
 announced
 that
 I
 think
 it's


fair
 to
 say
 whether
 they
 have
 it
 or
 not


many
 of
 the
 industry
 peers
 have
 chosen


to
 start
 saying
 we
 have
 a
 platform.
 So


clearly
 there's
 something
 here
 where


they
 believe
 they
 need
 to
 be
 a
 platform


to
 be
 able
 to
 succeed
 in
 cyber
 security.


Nikash
 let's
 move
 on
 to
 your
 personal
 uh


journey.
 So
 you
 grew
 up
 in
 India.
 Um
 and


how
 did
 you
 end
 up
 in
 the
 US?
 Oh
 uh
 I


grew
 up
 in
 India.
 I
 got
 an
 electrical


engineering
 degree
 and
 um
 I
 wanted
 to
 go


to
 business
 school
 and
 I
 applied
 to
 a


few
 in
 the
 United
 States.
 Uh
 at
 that


time
 it
 was
 very
 hard
 to
 get
 to
 the
 US


for
 business
 school
 because
 there
 was


foreign
 exchange
 regulations.
 You


couldn't
 really
 pay.
 So
 all
 that
 stuff


you
 know
 we
 we
 overcame
 those
 hurdles


and
 I
 was
 privileged
 to
 be
 offered
 a


place
 at
 Nor
 Eastern
 where
 they
 chose
 to


uh
 pay
 my
 tuition
 if
 I
 taught
 computer


science
 uh
 which
 is
 very
 emerging
 field


at
 that
 point
 in
 time
 it
 didn't
 so


literally
 1989
 was
 the
 I
 say
 8788
 was


when
 they
 started
 using
 that
 as
 a


specialization
 in
 India
 and
 I
 actually


was
 an
 electrical
 engineer
 I
 not
 was
 not


even
 a
 computer
 science
 engineer
 at
 that


time
 so
 I
 spent
 the
 summer
 brushing
 up


my
 computer
 science
 so
 I
 could
 come
 and


teach
 it
 that's
 how
 I
 came
 I
 went
 to


business


at
 Nor
 Eastern.
 Why
 are
 Indian
 CEOs
 so


successful
 in
 technology?


Well,
 I
 think
 there's
 a
 selection
 bias.


We're
 looking
 at,
 you
 know,
 we're
 16%
 of


the
 world's
 population.
 So,
 that's
 not
 a


bad
 start.
 uh
 but
 I
 think
 if
 you
 look
 30


years
 ago
 the
 only
 way
 for
 us
 to
 be
 here


in
 the
 US
 was
 we
 had
 to
 go
 through


significant
 let's
 say
 educational


hurdles
 to
 make
 it
 like
 you
 weren't


allowed
 a
 visa
 in
 the
 United
 States
 if


you
 weren't
 uh
 academically
 brilliant
 in


your
 in
 your
 field
 and
 uh
 given
 the


economic
 disparity
 between
 India
 and


here
 a
 lot
 of
 us
 chose
 to
 look
 for


greener
 pastures
 and
 we
 came
 here
 so
 you


had
 a
 lot
 of
 large
 pool
 you
 have
 a
 large


pool
 from
 a
 globally
 trained
 engineering


population
 to
 choose
 from
 and
 I
 think
 uh


from
 then
 on
 was
 Darin
 sort
 of
 Darinian


some
 of
 us
 kept
 making
 it
 through
 the


various
 hierarchies
 of
 uh
 of


organizations
 and
 ended
 up
 with
 uh
 you


know
 the
 Indian
 guy
 must
 know
 how
 to


code
 so
 a
 lot
 of
 us
 who
 are
 in


technology
 and
 uh
 I
 think
 uh
 I'd
 say


even
 the
 technology
 sector
 really
 has


grown
 tremendously
 in
 the
 last
 30
 years


is
 where
 all
 the
 opportunity
 was
 so
 I


think
 it's
 a
 it's
 a
 confluence
 of
 uh


circumstances
 that
 allowed
 us
 all
 of
 us


to
 be
 here
 and
 there's
 possibly


something
 in
 our
 resilience
 and
 our
 our


sort
 of
 um
 going
 down
 the
 engineering


and
 academic
 path.


I
 mean
 some
 of
 you
 don't
 really
 code


personally
 anymore
 but
 uh
 um
 no
 we
 don't


what's
 uh
 what's
 the
 Indian
 leadership


style
 like
 what
 are
 the
 commonalities


look
 um
 remember
 we
 all
 grew
 up
 with


scarcity
 I
 think
 uh
 so
 being
 resourceful


has
 to
 come
 naturally
 to
 us
 because
 uh


if
 I
 look
 at
 some
 of
 my
 friends
 and


peers
 in
 the
 industry
 I
 know
 the


backgrounds
 of
 many
 of
 them
 and
 we
 all


share
 similar
 backgrounds.
 We
 all
 went


to
 some
 sort
 of
 engineering
 school
 in


India.
 We
 all
 came
 from
 lower
 middle


class
 or
 middle-
 class
 families.
 If
 you


look
 across
 the
 board
 and
 I'm
 just


thinking
 of
 eight
 or
 10
 of
 the
 people
 I


know
 in
 our
 sector
 who
 are
 legendary


CEOs
 right
 now,
 they
 all
 have
 similar


backgrounds.
 So
 we
 all
 have
 some
 degree


of
 resourcefulness,
 some
 degree
 of
 uh


you
 know
 scrappiness
 perhaps
 that
 comes


with
 it.
 uh
 it
 is
 a
 comes
 with
 a
 very


strong
 work
 ethic
 because
 you
 can't


survive
 in
 a
 country
 with
 one
 plus


billion
 people
 at
 that
 point
 in
 time
 if


you
 don't
 have
 the
 ability
 to
 put
 your


head
 down
 and
 work
 hard.
 Uh
 when
 I
 went


to
 engineering
 school
 I
 think
 100,000


people
 took
 the
 exam
 and
 chose
 2,000


people
 to
 go
 to
 those
 five
 schools
 that


we
 wanted
 to
 go
 to.
 So
 there's
 a
 2%


chance
 that
 you
 get
 in.
 So
 to
 get
 there


it
 was
 not
 just
 going
 to
 be
 pure
 luck.


It
 was
 going
 to
 be
 a
 lot
 of
 hard
 work


and
 dedications.
 I
 think
 every
 one
 of
 us


went
 through
 that.
 So
 there's
 a
 work


ethic,
 there's
 a
 resourcefulness
 aspect.


I
 think
 there's
 a
 constant
 learning


aspect
 to
 it.
 You
 know,
 none
 of
 us
 grew


up
 with
 AI
 like
 you
 said.
 None
 of
 us


grew
 up
 with
 the
 cloud,
 but
 somehow


we've
 all
 managed
 to
 learn
 it.
 I
 didn't


grow
 up
 with
 cyber
 security.
 We
 all


managed
 to
 learn
 it.
 So
 there
 is
 some


degree
 of
 a
 constant
 learning
 um
 sort
 of


algorithm
 in
 there.
 Um
 hopefully
 there's


a
 dose
 of
 ample
 humility
 across
 the


board
 because
 we're
 all
 blessed
 and


privileged
 to
 be
 able
 to
 work
 in
 this


environment
 and
 be
 part
 of
 a
 larger
 sort


of
 you
 know
 uh
 um
 cosmos
 in
 the
 United


States
 to
 be
 able
 to
 sort
 of
 make
 our


dreams
 come
 true
 and
 then
 the
 rest
 is


chance.
 How
 do
 you
 stay
 humble


um
 with
 all
 that
 success?
 Oh
 uh
 go
 home


to
 the
 family.
 They'll
 they'll
 set
 you


right
 in
 a
 heartbeat.
 You
 know
 it


doesn't
 matter
 how
 successful
 you're
 at


work.
 you're
 still
 part
 of
 a
 family
 unit


and
 I
 think
 I
 think
 it's
 consistent
 and


I
 know
 some
 of
 these
 people
 I
 said
 and


their
 spouses
 and
 you
 know
 they
 keep
 us


grounded
 they
 keep
 us
 focused
 on
 the


right
 things
 and
 I
 was
 chatting
 with


somebody
 last
 night
 you
 know
 I
 still


hang
 out
 with
 my
 friends
 I
 knew
 in
 high


school
 you
 know
 it
 doesn't
 matter
 what
 I


do
 for
 a
 living
 and
 they
 don't
 really


care
 what
 I
 do
 for
 a
 living
 for
 the
 most


part
 so
 you
 just
 go
 back
 stay
 with
 your


family
 and
 your
 friends
 and
 they'll
 keep


you
 grounded
 and
 as
 you
 know
 it's
 it's


it's
 not
 not
 sort
 of
 you
 know
 um
 roses


and
 and
 and
 and
 tons
 of
 love
 every
 day.


There's
 a
 lot
 of
 grinding
 that
 is


required
 to
 be
 successful
 what
 you
 do.


There's
 a
 lot
 of,
 you
 know,
 going
 back


to
 the
 salt
 mine
 and
 and
 and
 sort
 of


figuring
 out
 things
 from
 first


principles.
 So,
 I
 think
 that
 keeps
 you


keeps
 you
 humble
 uh
 on
 a
 day-to-day


basis
 and
 especially
 with
 the
 enterprise


world,
 you're
 constantly
 selling
 to


people
 or
 telling
 you
 you're
 wrong.
 Do


you
 think
 people
 underestimate
 what
 it


takes
 to
 be
 successful
 in
 your
 business?


I
 think
 uh
 every
 role,
 every
 job,
 and
 I


always
 try
 and
 say
 that,
 you
 know,


there's
 no
 comparison.
 your
 challenges


and
 my
 challenges.
 It's
 not
 a


competition.
 It's
 our
 ability
 to
 cope


with
 challenges
 and
 our
 ability
 to
 enjoy


successes
 is
 different.
 And
 I'm
 sure
 a


doctor
 has
 his
 own
 set
 of
 challenges
 and


opportunities
 to
 succeed.
 And
 I'm
 sure
 a


CEO
 has
 them.
 So
 I
 think
 that's
 more


human
 than


than
 what
 you
 do.
 Perhaps
 the
 question


is
 how
 do
 you
 cope
 with
 it?
 How
 can
 you


handle
 it?
 And
 some
 people
 can
 cope
 with


it
 better
 than
 the
 others.
 And
 over


time,
 you'll
 see
 that
 people
 who
 succeed


and
 are
 gravitating
 to
 those
 things
 have


the
 personality
 that
 allows
 them
 to
 find


the
 right
 balance
 between
 doing
 a
 high


pressure
 job
 as
 a
 CEO
 versus,
 you
 know,


being
 able
 to
 be
 sane
 when
 they're
 not


doing
 it.
 If
 we
 look
 at
 the
 the
 culture


of
 uh
 Palo
 Alto
 Networks,
 do
 you


celebrate
 success
 all
 the
 time?
 Look,


you
 know,
 the
 pandemic
 was
 a
 very


pivotal
 moment
 in
 my
 sort
 of
 development


as
 a
 human
 being
 and
 the
 development
 of


our
 culture.
 I'd
 say
 pre-
 pandemic
 I
 was


very
 focused
 on
 learning
 the
 industry,


understanding
 the
 industry,
 building
 a


brilliant
 strategy
 for
 the
 company


because
 we
 had
 to
 find
 a
 way
 of
 not


becoming
 part
 of
 the
 normal
 decline
 of
 a


cyber
 security
 company.
 If
 you
 look
 at


cyber
 security
 companies,
 they
 decline


after
 10
 to
 12
 years
 and
 they
 sort
 of


take
 a
 sort
 of
 glide
 path
 which
 is
 sort


of
 flattish
 over
 time.
 And
 our
 job
 as
 a


leadership
 team
 was
 to
 go
 change
 that


and
 find
 a
 strategy
 that
 works.


you
 know
 the
 best
 laid
 plans
 of
 mice
 and


men.
 Uh
 the
 pandemic
 came
 and
 gave
 us
 a


wakeup
 call
 because
 the
 strategy
 became


almost
 incidental.
 What
 became
 important


is
 how
 do
 you
 survive
 a
 global
 crisis
 of


that
 proportion
 and
 I'd
 say
 I
 lucked


into
 it.
 I
 met
 this
 person
 um
 who
 we


brought
 in
 literally
 in
 the
 first
 month


to
 come
 speak
 to
 us
 and
 our
 team
 and
 he


said
 you
 know
 the
 fundamental
 thing
 you


have
 to
 think
 about
 is
 not
 your
 cyber


security
 strategy
 is
 but
 the
 mental


state
 of
 the
 people
 who
 work
 with
 you.
 I


said
 explain
 that
 and
 he
 says
 look
 right


now
 people
 are
 in


their
 heightened
 state
 of
 uncertainty


and
 when
 people
 are
 in
 their
 heightened


state
 of
 uncertainty
 masslo's
 hierarchy


gets
 disrupted
 at
 that
 point
 in
 time
 all


they
 care
 about
 is
 certainty
 and


predictability
 and
 your
 job
 as
 a
 leader


is
 to
 create
 that
 your
 job
 is
 not
 to


talk
 about
 how
 you're
 going
 to
 win
 your


job
 is
 to
 create
 that
 comfort
 and


certainty
 that
 I
 am
 taking
 care
 of
 and


that
 really
 started
 my
 journey
 at
 that


point
 in
 time
 because
 I


I
 think
 I
 think
 since
 then
 I've
 talked


to
 8,000
 employees
 in
 the
 company
 on
 one


sort
 of
 small
 group
 setting
 basis.
 I


still
 do
 it.
 I
 spent
 a
 lot
 of
 time
 with


people.
 I
 spent
 we
 we
 put
 in
 policies
 in


place
 saying
 we're
 not
 going
 to
 fire


anyone.
 We're
 going
 to
 make
 sure


everybody's
 economically
 taken
 care
 of


and
 we
 didn't
 throughout
 the
 pandemic


because
 our
 job
 was
 to
 create
 certainty


and
 that
 became
 such
 a
 fundamental
 basis


for
 our
 success
 that
 it's
 pivoted
 into


people
 matter.
 They're
 the
 backbone
 of


the
 company.
 That's
 how
 we
 go
 win.
 Uh


and
 when
 people
 see
 that
 leadership
 is


willing
 to
 step
 in
 and
 walk
 the
 talk,


amazing
 things
 happen.
 You
 mentioned


learning.
 Uh
 what
 are
 you
 curious
 about


for
 the
 moment?
 I'm
 constantly
 curious,


you
 know.
 Uh
 um
 and
 I
 think
 it
 goes
 the


paranoia
 because
 part
 of
 the
 paranoia
 of


being
 a
 leader
 is
 I
 have
 to
 find
 uh
 the


right
 direction
 for
 a
 company
 on
 a


constant
 basis.
 And
 the
 pace
 at
 which


technology
 is
 moving,
 it's
 almost
 like


deer
 in
 the
 headlight
 syndrome
 right


now,
 right?
 You
 wake
 up
 every
 week
 and


there's
 a
 new
 development
 in
 technology.


And
 I
 say
 that
 technology,
 but
 obviously


we're
 talking
 about
 AI
 right
 now.
 But


look,
 you
 you
 know,
 you
 find
 out
 that


somebody's
 building
 a
 $500
 million
 data


center.
 Then
 you
 find
 out
 about
 agentic


AI.
 Then
 you
 find
 out
 that
 there's
 a
 new


Chinese
 model
 which
 is
 much
 more


efficient
 and
 runs
 differently.
 Then
 you


say,
 what
 happens
 to
 $500
 million
 data


center?
 Is
 that
 going
 to
 have
 a
 thing
 to


do?
 Then
 you
 hear
 about,
 you
 know,


protein
 folding
 and
 alpha
 go.
 Then
 you


hear
 about
 image
 generators.
 and
 you


hear
 about
 you
 look
 on
 X
 and
 you'll
 see


all
 these
 people
 who
 are
 experimenting


17
 ways
 from
 Sunday
 and
 they're
 able
 to


recreate
 all
 these
 things.
 You're
 brain


boggles.
 It's
 like
 okay
 forget
 about


understanding
 it.
 The
 question
 is
 trying


to
 sort
 of
 put
 your
 arms
 around
 the


implications
 of
 this
 is
 hard
 and
 that's


just
 you
 know
 in
 a
 way
 in
 a
 positive
 way


is
 fascinating
 because
 I
 don't
 think


we've
 seen
 such
 technological
 turmoil
 in


our
 lives
 and
 uh
 it
 is
 scary
 you
 know


because
 you
 ask
 the
 questions
 who's


going
 to
 the
 winner
 where
 is
 this
 going


to
 land
 because
 our
 jobs
 are
 to
 find
 the


answers
 in
 this
 huge
 amount
 of
 sort
 of


you
 know
 excitement
 that's
 going
 on
 so


yeah
 so
 that's
 kind
 of
 fascinating
 is
 is


amazing
 right
 now
 I
 think
 it's
 just


unbelievable
 I
 And
 I
 just
 wake
 up
 every


day,
 spin
 out
 of
 bed
 and
 just
 run.
 What


happened
 yesterday?
 I
 mean,
 oh
 my.
 I


mean,
 you
 have
 the
 intersection
 of
 uh


geopolitical
 upside
 down.
 Yes.
 Uh


accelerating
 technology
 and
 uh
 Oh
 my.


What's
 the
 first
 thing
 you
 do
 in
 the


morning?
 Uh
 try
 not
 to
 grab
 my
 phone


because
 you
 think
 it's
 been
 hacked.
 No,


no,
 no.
 Because
 you're
 saying,
 "Wait,


I've
 not
 had
 any
 information
 for
 the


last
 seven
 or
 eight
 hours.
 I
 need
 to


know
 what's
 happened
 in
 the
 last
 eight


hours."
 And
 you
 know
 I
 to
 I'm
 pretty


sure
 the
 first
 half
 an
 hour
 of
 waking
 up


I
 get
 find
 my
 ways
 to
 my
 phone
 but
 uh


when
 do
 you
 when
 do
 you
 wake
 up?
 Around


5:30
 5
 5:30
 something
 like
 that.
 How


often
 do
 you
 work
 out?
 Not


enough
 possibly
 three
 times
 a
 week
 if
 I


can
 manage
 it
 but
 I'd
 like
 to
 do
 more


but
 you
 know
 that's
 that's
 always
 a


challenge.
 We
 never
 grew
 up
 working
 out


in
 India.
 So
 it's
 an
 acquired
 skill
 that


we
 have
 to
 go
 try
 and
 practice
 and
 yes


if
 I
 could
 do
 one
 thing.
 Did
 you
 have
 a


mentor
 in
 your
 life?
 You
 know,
 Nichol,


uh,
 my
 answer
 to
 that
 question
 is
 I've


had
 the
 privilege
 of
 interacting
 with


some
 amazing
 people
 and
 I've
 been
 able


to
 use
 them
 for
 different
 aspects
 of
 my


life.
 There
 are
 people
 I
 can
 talk
 to


about
 my
 personal
 life.
 There
 are
 people


I
 can
 talk
 to
 about
 my
 professional


life.
 uh
 there
 are
 people
 I
 could
 talk


to
 about
 financial
 issues,
 management,


but
 it's
 hard
 and
 I
 I
 sort
 of
 my


principle
 is
 it's
 very
 hard
 to
 hold
 one


person
 on
 a
 pedestal
 and
 and
 try
 and


replicate
 their
 principles
 across
 every


part
 of
 life
 because
 we're
 all
 human


beings
 and
 we
 do
 some
 things
 better
 than


the
 other
 thing.
 So
 I
 I
 try
 and
 find


somebody
 for
 a
 certain
 thing
 that
 I
 find


amazing
 and
 yes.
 So
 have
 I
 had
 people


who
 have
 been
 able
 to
 mentor
 me
 on


individual
 topics?
 Yes.
 Have
 I
 have
 a


sort
 of
 an
 over-encompassing
 uber


mentor?
 No.
 How
 do
 you
 relax?
 Play
 golf.


Um,
 hang
 out
 with
 my
 kids.
 They're
 nine


and
 eight.
 And
 goes
 back
 to
 that


humility
 comment
 and
 goes
 back
 to,
 you


know,
 bringing
 you
 back
 to
 basics.
 They


do
 that
 wonderfully
 well.
 We
 spent
 uh


yesterday
 afternoon
 watching
 my


9-year-old
 play
 football
 and
 he
 was
 very


excited
 and
 we
 spent
 half
 an
 hour


talking
 about
 his
 football.
 He
 and
 I


went
 to
 watch
 the
 basketball
 game
 on
 on


uh
 Friday
 night.
 That
 was
 amazing.
 So,


yeah.
 What
 do
 you
 read?
 Uh,
 I
 struggle


to
 read.
 Um
 I'm
 more
 of
 a
 summary
 person


than
 a
 read
 person
 because
 uh
 it
 comes


from
 the
 principle
 of
 flip
 side.
 People


ask
 me
 would
 you
 write
 a
 book
 and
 I'm


like
 why
 would
 I
 take
 500
 pages
 to


describe
 what
 I
 could
 in
 10?
 Uh
 and
 I


think
 the
 opposite
 applies
 you
 know
 why


would
 I
 read
 500
 pages
 to
 distill
 10.
 Um


so
 well
 you
 got
 some
 uh
 if
 you're
 a


summary
 kind
 of
 guy
 you
 got
 some
 pretty


good
 tools
 lately
 to
 help
 you.
 Right.


Exactly
 right.
 Exactly
 right.
 Look
 I
 I


you
 know
 for
 for
 not
 trying
 to
 engage
 my


brain
 a
 lot.
 I
 will
 watch
 a
 lot
 of


Netflix
 shows
 to
 see
 what
 the
 world
 is


doing
 and
 some
 of
 those
 are
 uh
 you
 know


non-fiction
 that
 allows
 me
 to
 learn
 but


I
 struggle
 to
 read
 500
 pages.
 I
 can't


keep
 my
 attention
 that
 long.
 Dash
 what


is
 the
 what
 is
 your
 advice
 you
 have
 to


your
 young
 children?
 Well
 actually
 not


only
 young
 but
 because
 you
 also
 got
 a


grown-up
 but
 the
 three
 of
 them.
 Look
 um


at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day
 they're
 all
 going


to
 have
 to
 find
 their
 own
 path.
 So
 my


job
 is
 to
 make
 sure
 I
 allow
 them
 to


experiment
 and
 encourage
 their
 natural


instincts
 because
 uh
 you
 know
 it's
 kind


of
 bizarre.
 This
 is
 such
 a
 complex


combination
 of
 personality
 traits
 and


and
 innate
 desires
 that
 come
 into
 a


human
 being.
 So
 it's
 very
 hard
 for
 me
 to


tell
 my
 kids
 there's
 most
 likely
 if
 I


tell
 them
 what
 to
 do
 they're
 probably


going
 to
 do
 something
 totally
 opposite


just
 to
 prove
 their
 point.
 So
 you
 know
 I


try
 and
 encourage
 their
 their


experimentation
 in
 life.
 I
 try
 and


encourage
 them
 in
 what
 are
 they
 trying


to
 do.
 My
 older
 daughter
 who's
 27
 has
 a


lighted
 on
 venture
 capital
 as
 a
 career


by
 watching
 people
 around
 me
 and
 having


lots
 of
 conversations
 but
 it
 was


important
 for
 it
 to
 be
 her
 decision
 and


she
 made
 that
 decision
 independently
 and


of
 course
 she
 comes
 and
 spends
 a
 lot
 of


time
 with
 me
 talking
 about
 companies
 or


talking
 about
 how
 should
 she
 think
 about


life
 and
 career
 and
 we
 talk
 about
 it
 but


I
 try
 and
 make
 sure
 the
 decision
 in
 the


end
 is
 in
 her
 hand.
 Now,
 of
 course,


being
 a
 father,
 we're
 all
 trying
 to


influence
 it,
 but
 she's
 smarter
 than
