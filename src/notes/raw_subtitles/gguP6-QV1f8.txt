[Music]


Good
 morning
 everybody.
 Welcome
 back
 to


another
 episode
 of
 the
 market
 open.
 We


are
 live.
 It
 is
 Wednesday,


October
 22nd.
 Uh,
 and
 well,
 we
 have
 a


pre-market
 where
 one
 stock
 is
 up
 about


70%.


Don't
 really
 know
 why,
 but
 nonetheless,


it
 is
 indeed
 up.
 A
 lot
 of
 you
 guys
 know


which
 one
 I'm
 talking
 about,
 and
 this


is,
 I
 think,
 kind
 of
 one
 of
 the
 main


stories
 of
 the
 day,
 and
 we're
 going
 to


see
 how
 it
 plays
 out.
 Sorry,
 it's
 not
 up


70%.
 It's
 up
 98%
 now.
 Talking
 about


Beyond
 Meat.
 I
 I
 I
 don't
 know
 why
 we


just
 can't
 have
 a
 normal
 market.
 I
 don't


know
 why
 we
 have
 to
 have
 these
 types
 of


stocks
 do
 what
 they
 do,
 but
 this
 is
 what


they're
 doing.
 Beyond
 Meat
 724,
 we
 left


the
 market
 closed
 yesterday
 and
 this


thing
 was
 $445.


It
 is
 now
 $729.
 If
 you
 look
 at
 the


options
 flow,
 and
 we're
 going
 to
 look
 at


some
 stats
 on
 Beyond
 Me,
 it's
 quite


incredible
 uh
 some
 of
 the
 amount
 of


trades
 that
 are
 coming
 in
 in
 terms
 of


the
 option
 flow,
 but
 also
 some
 of the


people
 that
 went
 long
 on
 this
 thing
 back


when
 it
 was
 like
 two
 bucks.
 Maybe
 they


knew
 something
 was
 coming,
 but
 there
 you


go.
 Beyond
 Meat
 has
 16xed


over
 the
 past
 week
 from
 50
 cents
 to


eight
 bucks
 basically.
 I
 think
 it
 was
 at


like
 850
 a
 little
 bit
 earlier
 before


right
 now.
 And
 that's
 what
 you
 got
 going


on.
 So
 look,
 I
 am
 watching
 on
 the


sidelines
 from
 this
 for
 those
 who
 are
 in


it.
 Um,
 do
 what
 you
 got
 to
 do.
 If
 you


got
 to
 trade
 it,
 you
 got
 to
 trade
 it.


The
 Walmart
 partnership
 was
 announced


yesterday
 and
 I
 guess
 that
 is
 somewhat


bullish.
 Well,
 it's
 obviously
 more
 than


somewhat
 bullish
 given
 the
 stock
 has
 run


as
 much
 as
 it's
 run.
 It
 was
 also
 short


at
 60%.
 So
 I
 think
 that's
 another
 reason


why
 Beyond
 Meat
 is
 moving
 the
 way
 it's


moving.
 But
 nonetheless,
 we're
 going
 to


see
 when
 the
 market
 opens
 when
 a
 lot


more
 capital
 comes
 into


uh
 not
 only
 this
 stock
 but
 a
 lot
 of


other
 stocks
 and
 algos
 get
 in
 place
 what


actually
 happens
 if
 retail
 gets
 in.


There's
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 story
 on


retail
 trying
 to
 squeeze
 the
 hedge
 funds


that
 are
 shorting
 it.
 So
 we'll
 talk
 more


about
 kind
 of
 what's
 going
 on
 here.
 But


nonetheless,
 Beyond
 Meat,
 one
 of
 the


biggest
 runners
 today,
 is
 up
 100%.
 In


the
 pre-markets.
 Um,
 outside
 of
 that,
 we


got
 a
 bunch
 of
 other
 headlines.
 So,
 we


had
 some
 Google,
 Amazon
 stuff
 that


happened
 yesterday.
 We'll
 talk
 about


that.
 Google
 right
 there, they're
 up


about
 2.25%
 in
 the
 pre-markets.
 You
 have


a
 bunch
 of
 quotes
 from
 Trump
 yesterday.


He
 was
 hosting
 a
 uh
 Dvali
 celebration


with
 a
 bunch
 of
 Indian
 leaders
 and
 he


said
 a
 bunch
 of
 things
 about
 India
 and


Russia.
 So,
 we'll
 talk
 about
 some
 of


those
 quotes
 and
 what
 those
 quotes


implicate.
 Uh,
 the
 broader
 S&P
 500
 is


relatively
 okay.
 Hey,
 it's
 less
 than
 1%


from
 alltime
 highs.
 Dow
 Jones
 was
 closed


just
 below
 47,000
 yesterday.
 Uh,
 and
 the


theme
 that
 we've
 been
 talking
 about
 for


this
 past
 week
 is
 some
 of
 these
 momentum


stocks
 like
 the
 Oakloss,
 the
 D-Waves
 of


the
 world,
 they've
 been
 losing
 a
 lot
 of


their
 momentum
 based
 on
 just
 looking
 at


their
 stock
 prices.
 And
 look,
 in
 the


pre-markets,
 it's
 not
 that
 much
 better.


Now,
 it's
 a
 red
 premarket,
 but
 it's
 not


a
 deep
 red
 pre-market.
 Some
 of
 those


names
 like
 in
 Oaklo
 continue
 to
 get
 hit


in
 the
 pre-market,
 down
 4%.
 You
 got
 a


D-Wave
 right
 there
 that's
 down
 about
 5%.


So
 I
 think
 one
 of
 the
 most
 important


things
 when
 the
 market
 opens
 is
 hey
 can


some
 of
 these
 stocks
 that
 have
 gotten


eviscerated
 really
 over
 the
 past
 week


and
 a
 lot
 of
 them
 are
 falling
 from


all-time
 highs
 and
 you
 know
 it
 doesn't


mean
 that
 they're
 going
 to
 zero
 but
 it


does
 mean
 that
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 momentum


that
 was
 carrying
 them
 to
 these
 massive


massive
 valuations
 structurally
 could
 be


dying
 out
 and
 I
 think
 today
 is
 going
 to


be
 a
 really
 important
 day
 because


yesterday
 all
 these
 names
 were
 down
 10%.


If
 that
 continues
 for
 a
 second
 day
 in
 a


row,
 we
 might
 have
 some
 issues
 in
 these


names.
 If
 the
 and
 if
 the
 S&P
 continues


to
 go
 higher
 or
 at least
 stay
 stable,


Nvidia
 stays
 at
 180,
 Nvidia
 doesn't
 tank


to
 160
 while
 Oaklo's
 tanking,
 you
 know,


30
 40%.
 That
 means
 the
 market's


deciding,
 oh,
 we
 are
 done
 playing
 with


these
 stocks
 and
 we
 are
 going
 back
 to


the
 important
 stocks
 that
 actually
 run


the
 market.
 And
 so,
 we're
 going to
 have


to
 see.
 So,
 I
 think
 today
 is
 going
 to
 be


a
 really
 important
 day
 to
 see
 if
 that


ends
 up
 continuing
 to
 happen
 or
 if
 it


kind
 of
 goes
 the
 other
 direction.
 So,
 we


got
 a
 lot
 to
 talk
 about.
 Thank
 you


everybody
 for
 being
 here.
 Good
 morning.


Good
 morning.
 Good
 morning.
 Beyond
 Meat


is
 uh
 doing
 its
 thing.
 And
 let
 me
 know


in
 the
 chat
 if
 you
 made
 any
 money
 off


this,
 if
 you
 traded
 it,
 if
 you
 got
 in
 a


while
 ago.
 I
 see
 I
 saw
 a
 bunch
 of


screenshots
 yesterday
 of
 people
 that


bought
 in
 at
 like
 freaking
 50
 cents
 um


on
 October
 17th,
 five
 days
 ago.
 So,
 you


do
 have
 a
 ton
 of
 people
 that
 actually


made
 some
 money.
 A
 lot
 of
 them
 sold
 at


like
 two,
 three
 bucks.
 They
 didn't
 think


it
 would
 go
 that
 much
 higher,
 but
 yeah,


there
 you
 go.
 We
 are
 now
 much
 higher.


And
 that's
 what
 we
 got.
 A
 couple
 of
 you


couple
 of
 you
 saying
 you
 made
 some
 money


on
 it.


Couple
 of
 you
 guys
 saying
 some
 money.


All
 the
 money
 going
 into
 Beyond
 Meat.


Yeah,
 maybe
 a
 lot
 of the
 money
 is


leaving
 those
 other
 momentum
 names
 and


it's
 just
 going
 into
 the
 new
 toy
 which


is
 Beyond
 Meat.
 H
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 if


that
 ends
 up
 continuing
 to
 play
 out.
 All


right,
 so
 let's
 get
 into
 it.
 Thank


everybody
 for
 being
 here.
 Good
 morning.


Good
 morning
 once
 again.
 Got
 a
 lot
 of


stories
 and
 let's
 get
 into
 it.
 Surj,


thank
 you
 for
 the
 $20
 super
 chat.


Appreciate
 it.
 Marathon
 government


summit
 today.
 You
 know,
 the
 government


had
 a
 big
 crypto
 panel
 yesterday
 and


we'll
 talk
 about
 the
 implications
 of


that
 crypto
 panel.
 There
 was
 a
 lot
 of


different
 things
 they
 discussed
 in


regards
 to
 new
 payment
 infrastructure.
 A


lot
 of
 stuff
 that
 seems
 relatively


bullish
 for
 the
 future
 of
 crypto
 in
 this


country.
 And
 uh
 so
 we'll
 talk
 about
 that


and
 we'll
 do
 a
 briefing
 on
 that.
 Also
 uh


let's
 not
 forget
 we
 had
 Netflix
 earnings


yesterday
 which
 I
 think
 we'll
 start
 off


with
 along
 with
 Tesla
 earnings
 later


today
 which
 we'll
 do
 a
 big
 preview
 on.
 I


think
 we'll
 be
 guest
 to
 kick
 off
 Tesla


earnings.
 Um,
 in
 terms
 of
 what
 we
 have


with
 Netflix,
 so
 let's
 just
 start
 off


with
 that,
 then
 we'll
 get
 to
 some
 of
 the


other
 earnings
 that
 we
 had
 today.


Netflix
 had
 a
 good
 quarter.
 The
 problem


is
 they
 had
 a
 Brazilian
 tax
 dispute
 with


some
 authorities,
 which
 caused
 a
 $690


million
 uh
 penalty
 that
 they
 had
 to
 pay.


And
 as
 a
 result,
 their
 operating
 margins


got
 hit
 by
 about
 3%
 and
 that
 means
 their


actual
 net
 income
 got
 hit
 by
 16%
 in


terms
 of
 EPS.
 So
 Netflix
 right
 there,


587
 versus
 697
 missed
 by
 16%.
 Revenue


came
 in
 line
 with
 expectations.
 Netflix


is
 down
 in
 the
 pre-market.
 I
 think
 this


is
 not
 a
 real
 big
 deal
 for
 Netflix.
 At


the
 end
 of
 the
 day,
 Netflix
 is
 a


phenomenal
 company
 and
 they
 will


continue
 to
 keep
 executing
 and
 continue


to
 grow
 over
 the
 long
 term.
 However,
 for


the
 people
 that
 thought
 they
 were
 going


to
 smash
 earnings,
 they
 didn't,
 right?


It
 was
 a
 good
 quarter.
 It
 was
 not
 a


phenomenal
 quarter.
 One
 could
 argue
 it's


not
 even
 a
 great
 quarter
 because
 when


you
 miss
 by
 16%
 on
 EPS,
 even
 if
 it's


something
 that's
 out
 of
 your
 control


like
 Brazilian
 tax
 authorities,
 that
 can


still
 cause
 some
 pain.
 And


unfortunately,
 that
 pain
 is
 why
 the


street
 did
 not
 get
 excited
 for
 Netflix.


I
 don't
 think
 this
 is
 a
 uh
 contagion


with
 all
 the
 Mac
 tech
 all
 the
 Mac
 7


companies.
 I
 think
 this
 is
 isolated


towards
 Netflix
 and
 you
 know


unfortunately
 it
 sucks
 that
 Netflix
 has


to
 kick
 off
 big
 tech
 earnings
 with
 this.


We
 do
 have
 Tesla
 today
 and
 you
 know
 I


hope
 Tesla
 has
 good
 earnings
 but
 I'm
 not


expecting
 anything
 massive
 and
 you
 know


if
 we
 don't
 get
 something
 massive
 from


Tesla,
 Netflix
 I
 don't
 think
 that's


emblematic
 of
 Meta,
 Microsoft,
 Google


etc.
 not
 having
 good
 earnings.
 Those
 are


the
 ones
 that
 really,
 really,
 really


matter.
 And
 so,
 as
 long
 as
 we
 see
 some


momentum
 around
 those
 names,
 then
 I


think
 we're
 going
 to
 be
 okay.
 But


regardless,
 that
 is
 what
 you
 had
 from


Netflix


uh
 yesterday.
 Yeah.
 And
 you
 know,
 one


can
 make
 the
 argument
 Netflix
 has


nothing
 to
 do with
 the
 rest
 of
 tech.
 At


the
 end of
 the
 day,
 Netflix
 is
 a
 media


company.
 It
 is
 a
 tech
 company,
 but
 they


buy
 media
 and
 they
 sell
 a
 subs


subscription
 against
 that
 media.
 They


are
 not
 the
 ones
 spending
 $450
 billion


on
 capex
 to
 try
 to,
 you
 know,
 compete


with
 the
 other
 hyperscalers.
 From
 that


perspective,
 I
 don't
 think
 it
 would
 be


that
 big
 of
 a
 deal.
 Transitioning
 to


Google,
 though,
 uh
 Google
 is
 up
 in
 the


pre-markets.
 Why
 is
 Google
 up
 in
 the


pre-markets?
 Well,
 uh
 yesterday
 after


hours,
 this
 bad
 boy
 got
 all
 the
 way
 up


to
 257,
 right
 now
 at
 255.
 So,
 Google


fell
 to
 244
 yesterday
 when
 there
 were


rumors
 of
 OpenAI
 launching
 a
 new


browser.
 OpenAI
 did
 launch
 that
 browser.


We'll
 talk
 about
 it
 in
 a
 second.
 But


then
 after
 hours
 you
 had
 anthropic


rumors
 around,
 hey,
 Anthropic,
 which
 has


largely
 used
 AWS,


might
 end
 up
 signing
 a
 multiple
 tens
 of


billions
 of
 dollar
 deal
 with
 Google
 for


cloud
 computing.


>> Google
 on
 a
 new
 cloud
 deal
 potentially


worth
 tens
 of
 billions
 of
 dollars
 in


compute.
 That's
 according
 to
 Bloomberg.


So
 far,
 Amazon
 has
 been
 its
 main


infrastructure
 provider
 and
 its
 largest


backer,
 investing
 around
 $8
 billion
 into


the
 company.
 Google
 has
 put
 in
 about
 $3


billion
 and
 has
 supported
 Anthropic's


multicloud
 strategy.
 I
 reached
 out
 to


both
 companies,
 haven't
 heard
 back
 yet.


I
 will
 say
 this,
 Google
 was
 down
 all
 day


because
 of
 that
 OpenAI
 web
 browser,
 but


those
 shares
 bouncing
 higher
 in
 the


after
 hours,
 up
 more
 than
 3%
 now,
 Mel.


>> All right,
 Mac.
 Thank
 you,
 Mackenzie


Sagalos.


So
 look,
 I
 thought
 that
 was
 actually


pretty
 bullish
 for
 Google
 because
 at
 the


end
 of
 the
 day,
 if
 Anthropic's
 thinking


of
 diversifying
 their
 cloud
 revenue


spend,
 then
 you
 know,
 Google
 being
 the


beneficiary
 of
 that
 and
 maybe
 not


Microsoft
 as
 much
 as
 their
 competitors.


That
 is
 bullish.
 Now,
 is
 it
 bearish?


Amazon,
 not
 really.
 Amazon
 already
 makes


a
 ton
 of
 money
 off
 anthropic.
 I
 mean,


there
 were
 rumors
 that
 they
 paid
 them


over
 $3
 billion
 in
 AWS
 just
 this
 year


alone.
 Amazon
 was
 up
 2%
 yesterday,
 even


after
 the
 outage.
 It
 was
 down
 1.2%,


still
 down
 1.2%
 off
 of
 this
 anthropic


news.
 bullish
 Google,
 not
 bearish


Amazon,
 but
 nonetheless,
 the
 street's


going
 to
 react
 and,
 you
 know,
 they're


going
 to
 take
 Google
 higher,
 take
 Amazon


lower
 based
 on
 that
 headline,
 but
 I


don't
 think
 it's
 a
 headline
 that
 would


necessarily
 cause
 that
 much
 pain
 for
 uh


for
 Amazon.
 Um,
 can
 we
 talk
 about
 how


many
 times
 Catch
 mentioned
 Google
 during


the
 live
 stream?
 You
 know,
 I
 didn't
 even


watch
 the
 live
 stream,
 so
 I
 I
 don't
 know


how
 many
 times
 OpenAI
 mentioned
 Google.


I
 would
 imagine
 they
 probably
 wanted
 to


mention
 Google
 a
 lot
 to
 be
 able
 to
 uh


show
 off
 their
 new
 browser.
 Look,
 in


terms
 of
 their
 new
 browser,
 again,
 I


really
 do
 think
 it's
 a
 nothing
 burger.


It
 it's
 it's
 not
 it's
 not
 the
 most


exciting
 thing
 to
 me
 when
 you
 take
 a


look
 at
 this
 browser.
 And
 and
 the
 the


thing
 is,
 number
 one,
 it
 looks
 like


Perplexity's
 comet.
 And
 number
 two,


there's
 the
 browser
 right
 there.
 Number


two,
 I
 don't
 know
 why
 Chrome's
 not
 going


to
 be
 able
 to
 do
 this
 either.


I
 I
 like
 all
 it
 is
 is
 a
 a
 web
 browser


with
 an
 AI
 assistant
 on
 the
 corner
 or
 on


the
 side.


And
 as
 a
 result,
 you
 know,
 when
 you


press
 ask
 Gemini
 or
 ask
 chatbt,
 that's


it.
 So,
 I
 think
 Chrome
 should
 like


quickly
 come
 out
 with
 something
 that
 uh


that
 rivals
 this
 and
 just
 shows
 you,


hey,
 you
 don't
 need
 to
 use
 something


like
 this,
 especially
 because
 they
 have


the
 distribution.
 I
 think
 there
 will


definitely
 be
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 that
 use


Atlas,
 which
 is
 the
 name
 of
 their
 their


browser.
 I
 just
 don't
 think
 it's
 I
 just


don't
 think
 it's
 a
 a
 a
 death
 argument


for
 for
 Chrome.


Chrome
 already
 has
 it,
 but
 Chrome
 Pro


has
 it,
 right?
 Not
 the
 regular
 Chrome.


I
 heard
 Google
 Pro
 has
 it,
 but
 not
 not


Chrome
 in
 general.
 Some
 of you
 guys


saying,
 "Okay,
 maybe
 I
 have
 to
 update
 to


see
 if
 Chrome
 already
 has
 I've
 never


seen
 it
 on
 Chrome."


But
 if
 that's
 the
 case,
 then
 yeah,


regular
 Chrome
 has
 it
 as
 well.


That's
 weird.
 Okay,
 I
 feel
 like
 I
 should


have
 known
 that
 or
 maybe
 they
 need
 to
 do


a
 better
 job
 of
 like
 telling
 people


that's
 there.
 But
 a
 more
 integrated


version
 of
 Gemini
 in
 the
 browser
 I
 think


is
 inevitable.
 And
 so
 like
 again
 OpenAI


is
 going to
 get
 users
 from
 this.
 It's


going to
 be
 good
 for
 them.
 I
 just
 don't


know
 if
 it's
 a
 bare
 case
 for
 I
 mean


Google
 lost
 a
 hundred
 billion
 dollars


when
 this
 announcement.
 And
 so
 it's
 just


like
 if
 you
 picked
 up
 that
 dip
 at
 244.


It
 was
 really
 a
 gift
 and
 you
 know
 you


got
 a
 nice
 little
 trade
 from
 256
 right


here
 is
 what
 we
 have
 on
 Google.


Salesforce
 that's
 flat
 in
 the
 premarket.


Meta
 that's
 down
 uh.3%.
 Amazon
 down
 1.2.


PayPal
 that's
 down
 half
 a
 percent.
 Apple


that's
 down
 half
 a
 percent.
 SMCI
 down


one.
 Ethereum
 and
 Bitcoin
 unfortunately


have
 not
 been
 able
 to
 get
 a
 lot
 of


momentum.
 The
 problem
 with
 Ethereum
 and


Bitcoin
 right
 here
 is
 uh
 Bitcoin
 went
 up


to
 114
 yesterday.
 It
 came
 all
 the
 way


down
 to
 108
 by
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day.
 Now


it's
 back
 at
 108.
 Uh
 and
 then
 Ethereum


got
 to
 4100
 right
 back
 down
 to
 3,800.
 So


a
 lot
 of
 the
 momentum
 that
 they
 saw
 for


a
 little
 bit
 potentially
 based
 on
 the


rally
 of
 gold
 dying
 out
 which
 we'll
 talk


about
 in
 a
 second.
 It's
 almost
 like
 that


money
 came
 to
 crypto
 and
 that
 money
 left


crypto.
 I
 mean,
 it
 is
 one
 of
 the


weirdest
 October
 I've
 seen
 for
 Bitcoin


in
 particular.
 And
 as
 a
 result,
 all
 the


crypto
 derivatives,
 whether
 it's
 a


Coinbase,
 a
 Micro
 Strategy,
 a
 Hood,
 a


BMR,
 BMR
 right
 there,
 50.98,


not
 getting
 as
 much
 love.
 And
 as
 a


result,
 those
 are
 getting
 hit.
 Now,


let's
 talk
 about
 gold.
 So,
 gold
 is
 uh


not
 doing
 the
 best.
 It's
 down
 another


1.5%
 as
 you
 can
 see
 right
 there.
 Silver


down
 another
 1%.
 The
 hard
 thing
 to


understand
 about
 gold
 is
 that
 although


it's
 had
 it
 massive
 rally,
 it
 has
 lost


2.5
 trillion
 of
 market
 cap


um
 over
 the
 past
 two
 days.
 Another
 8%


decline.
 This
 is
 the
 largest
 two-day


drop
 since
 2013.
 So
 just
 like
 the


momentum
 stocks
 like
 your
 quantum
 and


nuclear
 names
 that
 are
 not
 really


getting
 any
 love
 in
 the
 pre-market
 and


you
 got
 like
 some
 stocks
 that
 are
 down


half
 a
 percent,
 a
 lot
 of
 those
 stocks


are
 down
 5%
 right
 now
 in
 the


pre-markets.
 gold
 continuing
 to
 go
 down


as
 well.
 I
 think
 the
 biggest
 thing
 a
 lot


of
 people
 should
 be
 watching
 out
 for


just
 as
 a
 market
 participant
 is,
 hey,
 is


gold
 going
 to
 recover?
 Are
 momentum


stocks
 going
 to
 recover?
 And
 we're
 not


just
 talking
 about
 momentum
 as
 in,
 you


know,
 Amazon,
 Google
 that
 have
 momentum.


We're
 talking
 about
 massive
 high
 beta


names
 that
 don't
 really
 have
 tons
 and


tons
 of
 revenue
 earnings,
 but
 have
 a
 lot


of
 momentum
 carrying
 them
 on
 their


narratives.
 Are
 they
 going
 to
 recover?


Because
 if
 they
 don't
 recover
 and
 if


gold
 doesn't
 recover,
 maybe
 they
 even
 go


sideways
 even
 if
 they
 don't
 keep
 going


down,
 that
 means
 there's
 some
 structural


shifts
 happen
 happening
 in
 this
 market.


And
 I
 I
 I
 think
 it
 would
 become
 pretty


evident
 over
 the
 next
 coming
 days
 if
 you


don't
 see
 any
 level
 of
 movement
 a
 top
 on


those
 numbers.
 But
 it
 seems
 like
 that


could
 be
 playing
 out
 right
 now
 and


that's
 how
 we
 would
 ultimately
 have
 to


navigate
 it.
 Gold
 again
 right
 here
 down


at
 4,51.
 It
 loses
 51
 points.
 It's
 down


below
 4,000.
 And
 psychologically,
 that


could
 also
 be
 something
 that
 a
 lot
 of


traders
 don't
 necessarily
 love
 to
 see.


Uh,
 Applied
 Digital,
 looks
 like
 they
 got


a
 deal
 right
 here
 in
 the
 pre-markets.


APLD
 33.98
 that
 is
 up
 4%.


Um,


and
 so
 we'll
 see
 what
 deal
 they
 had.
 I


know
 they
 had
 a
 good
 earnings
 a
 couple


of
 weeks
 ago
 as
 well,
 which
 got
 this


stock
 to
 really
 get
 a
 move.
 Same
 thing


with
 Navitas.
 Apply
 Digital
 enters
 a
 5


billion
 15year
 lease
 agreement
 for
 an
 AI


factory
 in
 North
 Dakota.


Okay,
 North
 Dakota.
 There
 you
 go.
 Apply


Digital
 5
 billion
 15-year
 lease


agreement.
 We'll
 try
 to
 get
 some
 more


details
 on
 it.
 Looks
 like
 they're


working
 with
 two
 of
 the
 world's
 largest


hyperscalers.
 They
 didn't
 announce
 which


of
 the
 hyperscalers,
 600
 megawws
 is
 what


they're
 going
 to
 be
 looking
 for
 in
 this


North
 Dakota
 AI
 factory.
 again
 more
 of


these
 companies
 getting
 these
 deals
 from


the
 hyperscalers
 and
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of


them
 that
 have
 rallied
 over
 the
 past


couple
 of
 weeks
 I
 mean
 they
 really
 need


more
 deals
 to
 justify
 the
 rally
 and
 so


applied
 digital
 showing
 some
 of
 the


deals
 that
 you
 have
 right
 here


um
 Russia
 Ukraine
 all
 right
 we
 got
 some


headlines
 there
 so
 I
 think
 this
 is
 stuff


that
 was
 talked
 about
 um
 last
 night
 as


well
 when
 Trump
 was
 speaking
 the


Financial
 Times
 right
 here
 saying
 Russia


strikes
 Ukraine
 after
 Trump
 Putin


meeting
 cancelled


a
 lot
 of
 this
 was
 hinted
 did
 yesterday


based
 on
 what
 Trump
 said
 about
 Putin.
 He


was
 explicitly
 asked
 if
 you
 want
 to
 meet


with
 Putin
 and
 he
 said
 no.
 He
 doesn't


want
 to
 waste
 his
 time.
 And
 well,
 now
 it


looks
 like
 we're
 actually
 seeing
 the


ramifications
 of
 that.


>> I
 don't
 want
 to
 have
 a
 wasted
 meeting.
 I


don't
 want
 to
 have
 a
 waste
 of
 time.
 So,


I'll
 see
 what
 happens.
 But,
 uh,
 we
 did


all
 of
 these,
 uh,
 great
 deals,
 great


peace
 deals.
 They're
 all
 peace
 deals,


agreements,
 solid
 agreements,
 every
 one


of
 them,
 but
 this
 one.
 And
 I
 said,
 "Go


to
 the
 line.
 Go
 to
 the
 line
 of
 uh
 battle


on
 the
 battlefield
 lines
 and
 you
 pull


back
 and
 you
 go
 home
 and
 everybody
 take


some
 time
 off
 because
 you
 got
 two


countries
 that
 are
 killing
 each
 other.


Two
 countries
 are
 losing
 5
 to
 7,000


soldiers
 a
 week.
 So,
 we'll
 see
 what


happens.
 It's
 we
 haven't
 made
 a


determination."


>> Now,
 Russia
 has
 been
 striking
 Ukraine


for
 the
 past
 couple
 weeks
 now.
 So,
 it's


it's
 not
 like
 this
 is
 like
 the
 first


strike
 in
 a
 long
 time.
 I
 mean,
 this
 is


part
 of
 the
 reason
 why
 Trump
 is
 pissed


off,
 right?
 is
 because
 they
 haven't


stopped
 striking
 Ukraine
 and
 they


haven't
 agreed
 to
 any
 level
 of
 a


ceasefire.
 This
 is
 after
 the
 Putin
 phone


call
 he
 had
 last
 week
 which
 he
 said
 you


know
 was
 reasonable
 uh
 in
 terms
 of


getting
 to
 some
 level
 of
 negotiation
 and


this
 was
 after
 the
 Zalinsky
 meeting
 in


the
 Oval
 Office.
 So
 even
 after
 both


meetings
 and
 this
 is
 like
 multiple


meetings
 he's
 had
 this
 year
 with
 both
 of


these
 guys
 especially
 after
 the
 Alaska


conference
 they
 had
 back
 in
 in
 June


still
 no
 progress
 on
 this.
 I
 mean,
 it


goes
 to
 show
 how
 unbelievably
 deep
 this


conflict
 is
 and
 how
 hard
 it
 is
 to
 really


get
 to
 a
 negotiation
 here.
 If
 they
 were


to
 do
 it,
 Marcus
 probably
 would
 like
 it,


but
 right
 now
 it
 doesn't
 look
 as
 easy
 to


uh
 to
 get
 this
 job
 done.
 Speaking
 of


deals,
 government
 shutdown
 still
 in


place.
 You
 had
 a
 trade
 representative


Jameson
 Greer
 give
 some
 thoughts
 in
 the


morning
 and
 basically
 he
 said
 that
 the


Democrats
 continue
 to
 hold
 up
 the


negotiations


which
 again
 Mike
 Johnson
 and
 Trump
 and


all
 these
 it's
 the
 same
 story
 every


single
 day.
 One
 side
 blaming
 the
 other.


Uh
 Kevin
 Hassid
 yesterday
 said
 maybe
 by


the
 end
 of
 the
 uh
 by
 the
 end
 of
 the
 week


we're
 going
 to
 get
 some
 you
 know
 some


some
 level
 of
 resolution
 on
 this
 but
 I


don't
 know
 dude
 it
 looks
 grim.
 It
 looks


very
 grim.
 Kaui
 is
 still
 estimating


November
 16th
 there
 is
 a
 chance
 for
 the


shutdown
 to
 last.
 We
 are
 now
 21
 days


into
 the
 shutdown.
 The
 headline


yesterday
 as
 well
 was
 that
 Trump
 said
 he


is
 not
 going
 to
 speak
 to
 the
 Democrats


until
 the
 government
 is
 reopened.


So,


I
 mean,
 if
 the
 Democrats
 don't
 want
 to


talk
 until
 the
 government
 until
 the
 the


Democrats
 want
 to
 talk
 before
 the


government
 is
 open
 to
 get
 to
 a
 deal
 and


Trump's
 not
 willing
 to
 talk
 until
 after


it's
 open,
 you
 got
 two
 sides
 that
 are
 at


a
 standstill.
 And
 I
 don't
 know
 how
 it's


going
 to
 be
 resolved.
 Again,
 markets


don't
 care
 about
 it
 too
 much
 right
 now,


but
 I
 think
 if
 this
 lasts
 more
 than
 30


days,
 you
 know,
 and
 we're
 nine
 days
 away


from
 that
 happening,
 markets
 might
 start


to
 care.


But
 that
 is
 what
 you've
 got
 with
 Russia,


Ukraine,
 and
 some
 of
 this
 government


shutdown.
 The
 rare
 earth
 stocks,
 let's


take
 a
 look
 at
 them.
 Wow.
 Continue
 to
 go


down
 in
 the
 pre-market.
 MP
 down
 3.5.
 TMQ


down
 7.
 CRML
 down
 9.
 LAC
 down
 3.3.
 US
 AR


down
 5.5.
 The
 quantum
 stocks,
 D-Wave,


that's
 down
 6%,
 and NQ
 that
 is
 down
 2%.


Regetti,
 this
 one
 has
 gotten
 hit
 pretty


bad.
 That's
 down
 another
 3.5%.


Nanukular,
 that
 one
 is
 down
 2.4.
 Oaklo


is
 down
 5.3.
 Oaklo
 again
 was
 at
 147


yesterday.
 Now
 it's
 at
 132.
 Alltime
 high


was
 around
 193.
 Uh
 and
 then
 SMR,
 this


stock
 is
 slightly
 flat
 to
 green.
 So
 you


got
 all
 those
 names
 still
 continuing
 to


take
 a
 hit.
 The
 Bitcoin
 miners
 turn
 data


centers.
 Galaxy
 got
 some
 love
 yesterday


because
 of
 they
 had
 good
 earnings.


That's
 down
 4%.
 IN
 down
 4%.
 Cipher
 down


five.
 CleanSpark
 down
 three.
 Wolf
 down


one.
 Hive
 down
 six.
 Bit
 farms
 down


seven.
 Marathon
 down
 two.
 And
 Riot
 down


two.
 Again,
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 names,


whether
 they're
 Bitcoin
 miners,


regionals,
 or
 not
 regionals,
 rare


earths.
 Regionals
 is
 actually
 doing


pretty
 well
 after
 uh
 some
 good
 earnings


that
 we
 saw
 over
 the
 past
 couple
 days,


uh
 it's
 Bitcoin
 miners,


rare
 earth
 stocks,
 quantum,
 and
 nuclear.


Those
 are
 the
 ones
 right
 now
 as
 the
 S&P


500
 is
 $2
 away
 from
 alltime
 highs
 are


down
 30
 to
 40%
 over
 the
 past
 couple


weeks.
 And
 I
 think
 today
 is
 going
 to
 be


really
 important
 to
 see
 structurally


if
 that
 one
 can
 continue.
 Jess
 says,


"Weak
 hand
 speculative
 stocks
 and
 those


with
 zero
 earnings
 getting
 hit
 hard.


Let's
 go.
 Final
 push
 before
 the
 move


up."


Yeah,
 you
 know,
 I
 mean,
 again,
 the
 thing


is
 a
 lot
 of these
 names
 can
 change
 their


stock
 price
 action.
 The
 10-year,
 by
 the


way,
 slightly
 up,
 but
 still
 below
 four.


If
 they
 put
 up
 a
 good
 earnings,
 the
 the


hard
 part
 about
 understanding
 all
 this


is
 like
 if
 these
 companies
 don't
 have


any
 earnings
 to
 begin
 with,
 what


earnings
 are
 they
 going
 to
 put
 up?
 What


could
 they
 possibly
 say,
 right?
 Right?


Like
 if
 if
 Google's
 having
 a
 crappy


couple
 months,
 they
 can
 put
 up
 a
 massive


earnings
 and
 change
 the
 entire


narrative.
 But
 if
 one
 of
 these
 stocks


are
 having
 a
 crappy
 couple
 weeks
 and


they
 don't
 have
 any
 earnings,
 what
 could


they
 possibly
 say
 that
 get
 like
 what
 is


Big
 Bear
 AI
 going
 to
 say
 that
 there's
 no


growth?
 They
 already
 guided
 for
 no


growth.
 The
 stock
 was
 almost
 $10
 last


week.
 Now
 it's
 at
 691.
 All
 the
 people


that
 bought
 at
 950,
 like
 what
 can
 they


look
 forward
 to
 on
 earnings?
 And
 so
 I


think
 the
 I
 mean
 they
 didn't
 even
 take


questions
 last
 time
 on
 their
 call.
 Big


Bear
 AI
 did
 not
 take
 Q&A.
 They
 didn't


take
 any
 questions.


So,
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 really
 interesting


to
 see,
 is
 the
 money
 going
 to
 come
 back


to
 these
 names
 or
 is
 it
 just
 going
 to
 go


into
 an
 AMD
 and
 Amazon
 undervalued


opportunities
 that
 are
 out
 there
 that


have
 a
 bit
 more
 fundamentals,
 but
 then


you
 see
 Beyond
 Meat
 and
 you
 kind
 of


wonder,
 all
 right,
 like
 what
 exactly
 is


going
 on
 right
 here?
 And
 I
 think
 this


one
 is
 more
 so
 just
 a
 squeeze
 in
 in
 the


context
 of
 the
 hedge
 funds
 that
 are


getting
 excited
 about
 it
 with
 retail.


But
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 see,
 you


know,
 where
 exactly
 this
 ends
 up
 playing


out.
 Cityroup
 initiating
 coverage
 on


Michael
 Strategies
 or
 Michael
 Sailor


Strategy
 MSTR
 485
 price
 target.
 All


right,
 so
 you
 got
 Croup
 joining
 the
 bull


side
 of
 MSTR.
 Again,
 Bitcoin
 makes
 a


turn
 towards
 the
 end
 of
 the
 year.
 I


think
 you
 know
 strategy
 and
 MSTR
 does


very
 well,
 but
 Bitcoin's
 got
 to
 make


that
 move
 to
 actually
 get
 you
 that
 turn.


Now,
 here
 is
 the
 story
 on
 Beyond
 Me
 to


give
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 of
 analysis
 on


it.
 Um,
 I
 thought
 this
 was
 a
 very


interesting
 to
 see.
 Citadel
 is
 one
 of


the
 main
 companies
 that's
 shorting


um


uh
 uh
 Beyond
 Meat.
 And
 as
 a
 result,


you're
 getting
 a
 lot
 of
 retail
 investors


that
 are
 thinking,
 "Hey,
 maybe
 this
 is
 a


GameStop
 situation
 from
 2021."
 So
 Ethan


is
 the
 CEO
 and
 founder
 of
 Beyond
 Meat.


He's
 from
 Missouri
 and
 his
 whole
 idea


was,
 "Hey,
 let's
 revolutionize
 the
 way


people
 eat
 food."
 Beyond
 Me
 crashed
 99%


from
 2019
 to
 239
 to
 60
 and
 Citadel
 seems


to
 be
 the
 largest
 short
 of
 Beyond
 Me.


The
 reason
 I
 think
 this
 is
 important
 to


take
 a
 look
 on
 is
 that
 if
 this
 is


another
 GameStop
 situation,
 I'm
 not


saying
 anyone
 should
 jump
 in
 here


because
 I
 think
 it's
 just
 too
 risky
 and


you
 know
 I
 I
 wouldn't
 jump
 in
 here


either.
 But
 if
 it
 feels
 like
 GameStop
 in


2021
 and
 people
 are
 bored
 and
 the


Oaklows
 of
 the
 world
 are
 not
 exciting


anymore
 to
 a
 lot
 of
 people,
 they
 might


just
 pile
 into
 Beyond
 Meat
 and
 that
 is


something
 that
 could
 potentially
 squeeze


the
 hedge
 funds.
 Now
 again,
 does
 it
 have


any
 real
 momentum
 to
 be
 able
 to
 sustain


the
 test
 of
 time
 and
 like
 actually
 turn


into
 a
 stock
 that
 deserves
 this


valuation?
 I
 don't
 know,
 but
 that
 could


be
 something
 that
 we
 see
 if
 this


continues
 to
 play
 out.
 There's
 a
 debt


cancellation
 story
 on
 Beyond
 Meat
 as


well.
 Yes,
 that
 is
 true
 in
 terms
 of
 them


exercising
 and
 getting
 rid
 of
 some
 of


the
 warrants,
 which
 is
 a
 fair
 point.
 I


don't
 know if
 that's
 enough
 for
 a
 1600%


rally
 in
 the
 past
 5
 days,
 but
 I
 guess
 if


people
 think
 it
 is,
 then
 that's
 why


Beyond
 Meat
 is
 getting
 some
 of
 this


excitement
 right
 here.
 Um,
 okay,
 let's


get
 into
 some
 of
 the
 other
 headlines


that
 we
 have.
 So,
 we'll
 keep
 an
 eye
 on


Beyond
 Meat
 and
 see
 what
 happens
 when


the
 market
 opens.
 In
 terms
 of
 some
 of


the
 macro
 news
 that
 we've
 got
 going
 on,


so
 first,
 let's
 look
 at
 what
 Meta
 has


said
 today.
 Axios
 is
 reporting
 that
 Meta


has
 cut
 several
 hundred
 units
 from
 its


AI
 division.
 Meta
 reportedly
 concluded


that
 its
 long-standing
 AI
 efforts
 have


become
 overly
 bureaucratic
 in
 hopes
 that


reorganization
 will
 create
 a
 more


fragile
 or
 agile
 operation.
 Uh,
 this
 was


really
 interesting
 to
 me
 because
 Meta


has
 been
 the
 one
 that's
 been
 hiring
 all


these
 workers
 and
 spending
 billions
 and


billions
 of
 dollars
 on
 AI
 research.
 And


the
 fact
 that
 they
 actually
 cut
 workers


today,
 I
 was
 like,
 "Oh,
 I
 guess
 Meta
 is


just
 realizing
 they
 don't
 need
 as
 many


of
 the
 people
 they
 hire
 now.
 They're


probably
 not
 getting
 rid
 of
 the
 people


that
 paid
 a
 couple
 hundred
 million


dollars
 to,
 but
 they
 are
 probably


getting
 rid
 of
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 middle


management."
 And
 it
 does
 make
 me
 a


little
 worried
 for
 Meta
 going
 into


earnings.
 I
 mean,
 look,
 at
 the
 end
 of


the
 day,
 if
 you
 own
 Meta,
 even
 if
 they


have
 a
 10%
 decline,
 who
 cares?
 Like
 Meta


is
 going
 to
 be,
 you
 know,
 multi
 multi


multi-
 trillion
 dollar
 company
 one
 day


as
 they
 just
 continue
 to
 grow.
 But
 I


feel
 like
 Zuck's
 been
 spending
 like


crazy.
 I
 feel
 like
 Meta
 doesn't
 really


have
 an
 AI
 plan
 outside
 of
 incorporating


AI
 into
 the
 advertising.
 Llama
 has
 not


really
 taken
 off.
 The
 Vibes
 app,
 the


Sora
 sort
 of
 copycat
 is
 not
 really


something
 that
 I
 think
 people
 care


about.
 uh
 and
 he's
 spending
 money
 like


crazy
 getting
 all
 this
 AI
 talent
 and
 we


don't
 exactly
 know
 what
 they're
 going
 to


do
 with
 the
 AI
 talent.
 So
 I
 think it's


one
 of those
 stories
 where
 you
 have
 to


really
 trust
 that
 ZUX
 is
 going
 to
 figure


it
 out.
 You
 don't
 have
 a
 product
 like


Gemini
 that's
 growing
 massively
 and


integrating
 in
 terms
 of
 the
 entire


ecosystem
 of
 Google
 where
 you
 can
 see


the
 implications
 of
 what
 Google's
 doing


with
 their
 AI.
 It's
 just
 their
 ads
 are


getting
 better,
 which
 is
 fine.
 They
 make


a
 lot
 of
 money
 off
 ads,
 but
 uh
 you
 know


it
 it
 might
 not
 be
 the
 most


revolutionary
 form
 of
 AI
 that
 is


justifying
 all
 the
 capex
 that
 they're


spending
 on.
 So,
 I
 think
 Meta
 is
 one
 of


the
 most
 cautious
 earnings
 that
 I'm


going
 into
 for
 big
 tech
 and
 I
 think


they're
 still
 going
 to
 crush
 it.
 But
 I


am
 just
 curious
 like
 what
 is
 the


strategy
 for
 Meta
 to
 actually
 make
 this


happen
 and
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 see


how
 this
 ends
 up
 playing
 out.
 Uh,
 one


final
 thing
 on
 Beyond
 Me,
 I
 just
 forgot


to
 share
 this
 real
 quick.
 Uh,
 they
 are


also
 going
 to
 be
 increasing
 the
 shares


outstanding
 from
 500
 million
 to
 three


billion.
 If
 you
 actually
 look
 on
 the
 8K


and
 the
 proposal
 that
 shareholders
 have


to
 vote
 on,
 they
 are
 trying
 to
 increase


the
 share
 count
 massively
 in
 order
 to
 be


able
 to
 withstand
 additional
 share


issuances
 of
 common
 stock.
 So
 this
 was


uh
 this
 is
 going
 to
 be
 voted
 on
 November


19th,
 2025.
 If
 you
 are
 a
 shareholder
 and


you
 buy
 shares,
 you're
 going
 to
 have
 to


be
 voting
 on
 these
 proposals.
 That
 would


be
 something
 to
 watch
 out
 for
 beyond
 as


well
 because
 if
 they
 increase
 the


outstanding
 shares
 by
 6x
 500
 million
 to


three
 billion,
 I
 mean
 obviously
 that


would
 be
 a
 lot
 of
 shares
 that
 would
 be


out
 there
 as
 well.
 which
 is
 important
 to


look
 like.
 Navas
 did
 announce
 their


earnings.
 They
 will
 have
 earnings
 on


November
 uh
 3rd,
 I
 believe,
 or
 November


11th,
 if
 I'm
 if
 I'm
 not
 wrong,
 in
 the


pre-market
 10453.
 Nabi
 is
 another
 one
 of


these
 names
 that
 actually
 has,
 you
 know,


great
 great
 earnings,
 great
 revenues,


but
 they
 also
 got
 hit
 from
 140
 to
 104,


probably
 just
 the
 fivey
 because,
 you


know,
 they
 maybe
 they
 didn't
 deserve
 to


get
 up
 uh
 to
 those
 levels.
 Now,
 look,
 I


was
 I
 was
 speaking
 to
 some
 people


yesterday.
 I
 don't
 think
 Nebulas
 gets
 to


$80,
 but
 if
 it
 gets
 to
 $80,
 I
 think


that's
 where
 I
 get
 really
 excited.
 80


would
 basically
 be
 a
 20
 billion
 market


cap,
 the
 entire
 Microsoft
 deal
 is
 worth


20
 billion.
 So,
 if
 the
 street
 actually


took
 it
 down
 to
 those
 levels,
 which
 I


don't
 think
 they
 will.
 I,
 you
 know,
 I


think
 maybe
 you'd
 see
 like
 90
 95


potentially
 if
 things
 got
 really
 ugly.


Uh,
 but
 I
 think
 the
 macro
 would
 have
 to


get
 ugly
 because
 you're
 not
 seeing


Nebius
 independently
 like
 a
 lot
 of
 those


other
 momentum
 names
 lose
 everything.


um
 you're
 seeing
 it,
 you
 know,
 have
 a


have have
 a
 floor
 because
 there's
 actual


real
 revenue
 and
 earnings
 right
 there.


If
 it
 gets
 those
 levels,
 I'd
 get
 very


interested.
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 it
 would


actually
 get
 to
 those
 levels,
 but
 that's


something
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 see
 if


it
 ends
 up
 playing
 out.
 I
 do
 have
 some


sold
 puts
 at
 98,
 so
 if
 that
 ends
 up


getting
 assigned,
 then
 that
 would
 get


assigned.
 Um,


imagine
 not
 having
 your
 full
 port
 on


leverage
 on
 Beyond
 Meat.
 Yeah,
 you
 could


have
 retired
 your
 entire
 generation,


bro.
 could
 have
 retired
 your
 entire


bloodline
 being
 on
 leverage
 beyond
 meat


from
 five
 days
 ago.


Speaking
 of
 people
 that
 want
 to
 retire


their
 bloodline,
 I
 saw
 this
 video
 this


morning.
 This
 is
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 fun


video
 that
 hopefully
 encapsulates
 what


investing
 in
 2025
 has
 been
 like.


>> I
 have
 a
 great
 plan
 for
 our
 economy.


>> I
 just
 invested
 my
 life
 savings
 in
 the


stock
 market.


>> That's
 not
 good.


>> The
 market
 always
 goes
 up
 into
 the
 rise.


>> I'm
 putting
 tariffs
 on
 all
 foreign
 ine


countries.


>> The
 market
 just
 tanked.
 I
 got
 to
 pull


out.


>> Pull
 out.
 You
 just
 went
 in.
 Too
 late.
 I


lost
 like
 $9,000,
 but
 that
 could
 have


been
 way
 worse.


>> Actually,
 I'm
 removing
 all
 tariffs.


>> The
 market's
 skyrocketing.
 I
 got
 to
 get


back
 in.


>> Go
 buy
 when
 it's
 on.


>> Too
 late.
 I'm
 going
 to
 be
 a
 millionaire.


>> Actually,
 I'm
 going
 to
 do
 a
 100%
 tariff


on
 China.


>> It's
 tanking.
 I
 got
 to
 pull
 out.


>> No.
 Last
 time
 you
 did
 it,
 you
 lost


$9,000.
 You're
 right.


>> Oh,
 thank
 God.


>> I'm
 going
 to
 take
 out
 a
 loan
 and
 buy
 the


gift.


>> No,
 don't
 do
 that.


>> Too
 late.
 I'm
 going
 to
 be
 a
 millionaire.


>> Actually,
 we're
 going
 to
 put
 a,000%


tariff
 on
 China.
 Just
 kidding.
 I'm
 not


doing
 tariffs.
 We're
 doing
 tariffs.


We're
 not
 doing
 tariffs.
 We're
 doing


tariffs.
 under
 the
 tariff.


>> Tariff,
 no
 tariff.
 Tariff,
 no
 tariff.


Tariff,
 no
 tariff.
 Tariff,
 no
 tariff.


Tariff.


>> I
 guess
 I
 just
 have
 to
 actually
 work
 for


my
 money.


>> Yeah,


>> just
 kidding.
 We're
 doing
 tariffs.
 I


have
 a
 great


>> I
 mean,
 it
 does
 not
 does
 that
 not


encapsulate
 2025,
 bro.


>> That's
 literally
 2025.


And
 you
 were
 either
 on
 the
 right
 side
 of


when
 he
 said
 he
 was
 putting
 in
 the


tariffs
 or
 when
 he
 was
 uh,
 you
 know,
 not


putting
 on
 the
 tariffs,
 aka
 you
 either


buying
 the
 dip
 or
 selling
 the
 top.
 And


most
 of
 us
 were
 not
 selling
 the
 top,
 at


least
 the
 short-term
 top,
 because
 that's


hard
 to
 do.
 But
 a
 lot
 of
 us
 were
 buying


the
 dip,
 which
 is
 why
 it
 worked
 out.


Speaking
 of
 buying
 the
 dip,
 take
 a
 look


at
 this
 chart
 right
 here.
 Tech
 funds


record
 inflow
 last
 week,
 10.4


billion.
 The
 four-week
 moving
 average


now
 is
 5.2
 billion,
 surpassing
 the


previous
 all-time
 high
 of
 4.8
 billion.


So,
 you
 know,
 in
 terms
 of
 people
 buying


the
 dip,
 I
 mean,
 we
 continue
 to
 see
 tech


funds
 continue
 to
 get
 flows
 of
 people


buying
 the
 dip.
 And
 whether
 it's
 tariff


or
 no
 tariff
 and
 the
 emotional
 toll
 that


tariff
 or
 no
 tariff
 takes
 on
 everyone,


people
 continue
 to
 buy.


PTSD,
 I'm
 shaking
 and
 my
 eye
 is


twitching.
 Dude,
 April
 was
 a
 time.


April


was
 a
 freaking
 time.
 You
 just
 made
 us


watch
 a
 real.


Okay.
 Technically,
 that's
 a
 Twitter


video.
 It's
 not
 a
 real.
 Okay.
 So,
 it's


different,
 but
 I
 feel
 like
 if
 I
 show
 a


real,
 it's
 actually
 hopefully
 worth


people's
 time
 and
 it's
 a
 little
 funny.


But
 these
 are
 the
 reals
 that
 I
 get
 every


day.
 Dude,
 by
 the
 way,
 all
 the
 people


that
 followed
 me
 on
 Instagram,
 all
 the


amount
 of
 reels
 that
 you
 guys
 are


sending
 in
 my
 DMs,
 and
 I'm
 like,
 I'm
 not


clicking
 on
 them.
 I'm
 sorry.
 I'm
 just


not
 I
 know
 you're
 sending
 it
 for
 fun,


but
 I'm
 not
 clicking
 on
 them.
 I
 get
 to


show
 one
 reel
 every
 90
 days.
 That's
 my


rule.
 So,
 that
 was
 my
 re
 that
 I
 showed


you
 guys.
 I
 really
 don't
 show
 videos


like
 that
 on
 this
 channel.
 Like,
 I
 I


really
 never
 show
 funny
 stuff
 like
 that,


but
 I
 saw
 it
 in
 the
 morning.
 I
 was
 like,


"Oh,
 we
 could
 all
 relate
 to
 it."
 But
 you


guys
 on
 Instagram


just
 sending
 massive
 massive
 amounts
 of


reels.
 I'm
 like,
 "Guys,
 I'm
 not
 clicking


on
 this.
 I
 don't
 click
 on
 my
 best


friends
 that
 send
 reels.
 I
 can't
 click


on
 this
 stuff.
 There's
 no
 way.


Just
 no
 freaking
 way."
 Someone
 said,


"Star
 Buccaneers
 sent
 me
 a
 twominut
 19


second
 reel
 yesterday."
 And
 this
 was
 my


exact
 response.
 Let
 me
 show
 you
 guys
 my


response.
 I'm
 not
 messing
 around,
 bro.


I'm
 putting
 my
 foot
 down.
 I'm
 putting
 my


foot
 down.
 This
 was
 my
 response.


2
 minutes
 and
 19
 seconds.
 You
 may
 have


lost
 your
 mind.


You
 may
 have
 lost
 your
 mind.
 Did
 I
 click


on
 it?
 No,
 of
 course
 not.
 Two
 minutes


and
 19
 seconds.
 Are
 we
 Are
 we
 crazy,


bro?
 You
 think
 I'm
 gonna
 sit
 there
 and


watch
 something
 for
 two
 minutes
 and
 19


seconds?
 It's
 no
 way.
 It's
 a
 principle


now.
 It
 is
 a
 principle
 to
 not
 click
 on


these
 memes.


That
 is
 my
 principle.
 If
 you
 want
 to


follow
 my
 IG,
 there
 it
 is
 right
 there
 in


the
 chat.
 I've
 not
 really
 posted
 on
 it.


I
 don't
 know
 if
 I'm
 ever
 going
 to
 post


on
 it,
 but
 yeah,
 you
 can
 follow
 if
 you


want.
 I
 don't
 know.
 I
 don't
 love
 IG.


Thought
 I
 should
 make
 one,
 but
 we'll


see.
 Maybe
 next
 year
 we'll
 keep
 posting


more.
 But
 I'm
 not
 clicking
 on
 these


reels.
 I'm
 not
 clicking
 on
 these
 reels.


All
 right,
 let's
 get
 into
 earnings.
 So,


we
 had
 a
 bunch
 of
 earnings
 today
 outside


of
 Netflix.
 We'll
 do
 a
 little
 bit
 more


of
 a
 Tesla
 conversation
 later
 into
 the


show
 and
 we're
 going
 to
 get
 more
 stuff


with
 Tesla,
 but
 we
 did
 have
 a
 bunch
 of


earnings
 throughout
 the
 day
 and
 uh
 these


earnings
 were
 pretty
 good.
 So,
 first
 of


all,
 Verdive
 crushed
 it.
 Verive
 is
 an


important
 company
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 data


centers.
 Take
 a
 look
 at
 their
 EPS.
 They


beat
 by
 25%


on
 EPS.
 125
 versus
 99
 cents.
 Massive


beat.
 And
 then
 267
 versus
 259
 on


revenue.
 That's
 about
 a
 $400
 million


beat
 on
 Rev.
 Verdive
 is
 up
 5.5%.
 Verdive


and
 VST.
 VRT
 and
 VST.
 These
 names
 have


been
 ultra
 long
 names
 to
 go
 if
 you


believe
 in
 data
 centers
 starting
 in
 the


end
 of
 2023.
 I
 think
 Nancy
 owns
 VST,


Nancy
 Pelosi.
 So
 they've
 done
 incredibly


well
 and
 uh
 they're
 putting
 up
 more
 and


more
 earnings.
 I
 mean
 EPS
 is
 up
 60%


year-over-year.
 revenue
 is
 up
 30%


year-over-year
 which
 is
 quite
 incredible


to
 see
 for
 a
 company
 like
 Verda.
 Then


you
 had
 Thermal
 Fisher
 beat
 by
 5%
 on
 EPS


579
 11.12
 billion
 versus
 10.9
 on


revenue.
 They
 beat
 by
 2%.
 Revenue
 is
 up


5%
 year-over-year
 and
 EPS
 is
 also
 up
 10%


year-over-year.
 Again,
 we're
 seeing
 a


lot
 more
 companies
 continue
 to
 beat
 and


raise.
 Thermoffisher
 that's
 up
 2.5%.


So
 earnings
 continuing
 to
 not
 really


disappoint.
 Then
 you
 have
 Hilton
 Hotels.


This
 is
 the
 consumer.
 Are
 people


actually
 traveling?
 Yeah.
 211
 versus


205,
 they
 beat
 by
 3%.
 3.12
 versus
 3.01,


they
 beat
 by
 4%
 on
 revenue.
 EPS
 is
 up


10%
 year-over-year.
 Revenue
 is
 up
 9%


year-over-year.
 Hilton,
 that
 stock
 up


2.3%.
 You're
 just
 seeing
 tons
 and
 tons


of
 diversity,
 whether
 it's
 consumer


companies,
 semiconductor
 companies,
 GPU


cooling
 companies,
 all
 these
 different


names
 that
 are
 beating
 earnings.
 Boston


Scientific
 75
 cents
 versus
 71
 cents.


That's
 a
 beat
 by
 6%.
 5
 billion
 versus


4.9
 billion
 revenue
 beat
 by
 2%.
 EPS
 up


19%
 year-over-year
 revenue
 is
 up
 20%


yearover-year.
 Boston
 Scientific,
 that


stock
 up
 3.35%.


It
 really,
 really
 is
 nice
 to
 see
 a
 lot


of these
 companies
 beating.
 By
 the
 way,


here's
 another
 stat
 that
 we
 have
 from


yesterday.
 It'll
 be
 updated
 probably
 by


the
 end
 of
 the
 week.
 Uh
 60
 companies
 out


of
 the
 S&P
 500
 have
 reported
 earnings
 so


far.
 85%
 of
 them
 have
 beat
 earnings
 by


at least
 8%.


So
 very
 similar
 to
 Q2
 results.
 You
 are


getting
 earnings
 beats
 and
 you
 are


getting
 pretty
 strong
 earnings
 beats


across
 the
 board
 which
 is
 really
 helping


out
 to
 make
 the
 bull
 case
 that
 the


market
 deserves
 its
 premium.
 Now
 AT&T


unfortunately
 down
 2.34%
 right
 there.


They
 missed
 by
 1%
 on
 revenue.
 Very
 small


miss
 on
 revenue.
 EPS
 came
 in
 line
 with


expectations.
 AT&T
 are
 not
 expecting


something
 super
 volatile.
 Most
 people


are
 buying
 this
 for
 the
 dividend.
 But


even
 that,
 you
 know,
 a
 small
 1%
 miss
 on


EPS
 or
 on
 revenue
 is
 not
 enough
 to
 be


bearish
 on
 the
 consumer
 when
 it
 comes
 to


AT&T.
 And
 that's
 why
 that
 stock
 is
 down


about
 2.3%.
 Uh
 DraftKings,
 they
 so
 those


were
 most
 of
 the
 earnings
 today.


DraftKings
 did
 buy
 a
 company
 yesterday.


It's
 up
 3.72%.
 They
 bought
 Railbird.


Railbird
 is
 a
 company
 that
 does


prediction
 markets.
 DraftKings
 got


initiated
 with
 a
 buy
 at
 Stifle
 for
 $51.


I
 think
 the
 Railbird
 acquisition
 is
 uh


is
 bullish
 because
 they're
 entering
 into


the
 prediction
 market
 space.
 I
 do
 think


it's
 DraftKings
 acknowledging,
 hey,
 Poly


Market
 and
 Khi
 are
 really
 crushing
 it


and
 like
 if
 we
 don't
 get
 into
 the
 space,


sports
 betting
 might
 end
 up
 leaving
 our


platform
 even
 though
 it
 has
 a
 lot
 more


sophisticated
 ways
 that
 you
 can
 bet
 on


individual
 players
 and
 spreads
 and
 all


this
 stuff.
 Kkin
 Poly
 Market
 might
 end


up
 incorporating
 all
 of
 that,
 including


Robin
 Hood,
 into
 their
 into
 their


platforms.
 And
 so,
 I
 think
 DraftKings


needed
 a
 way
 to
 be
 like,
 well,
 yeah,
 you


can
 bet
 on
 how
 many
 times
 JPA
 is
 going


to
 cough
 during
 the
 Fed
 meeting
 on
 our


platform
 as
 well.
 I
 just
 don't
 know
 if


the
 users
 of
 DraftKings
 care
 that
 much


about,
 you
 know,
 JPAL
 and
 economics.


It's
 funny
 because
 the
 users
 on
 a
 Kalshi


or
 Poly
 Market
 or
 Robin
 Hood
 care
 about


JPAL
 and
 they
 also
 probably
 care
 about


the
 Lakers
 game,
 but
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 the


users
 of
 DraftKings
 care
 about
 JPAL.
 And


so
 that
 incremental
 volume
 that
 you're


not
 getting
 that
 you're
 getting
 from
 um


uh
 non-sports
 events,
 I
 don't
 know
 how


much
 that
 adds
 to
 the
 bottom
 line.
 So,
 I


think
 it's
 a
 bullish
 acquisition,
 but
 I


wonder
 how
 much
 it's
 really
 going
 to


change
 the
 overall
 structure
 of
 their


business.
 But
 you
 do
 have
 DraftKings


right
 there
 that
 is
 up
 3.4%.
 The
 Google


deal
 yesterday
 was
 that
 Anthropic
 is


looking
 to
 sign
 a
 multi-10
 billion
 deal


with
 Google
 and
 that's
 why
 Google
 right


there
 is
 up
 2.23%.
 Again,
 that
 is
 not


confirmed.
 That
 is
 just
 a
 rumor
 that


Anthropic
 put
 out
 uh
 or
 that
 that


Bloomberg
 put
 out
 yesterday.
 And
 so


we're
 gonna
 have
 to
 see
 if
 that
 ends
 up


happening,
 but
 that's
 why
 Google
 is
 uh


is
 getting
 some
 love
 right
 here.


Speaking
 of
 AI,
 here's
 what
 Elon
 said


yesterday.
 Uh
 quite
 fascinating.
 So


Jason
 Calcanis
 said,
 "Amazon
 is


definitely
 going
 to
 replace
 older


employees."
 The
 New
 York
 Times
 put
 out
 a


report
 yesterday
 that
 we
 talked
 about


that
 Amazon
 is
 looking
 to
 replace


600,000
 employees
 over
 the
 next
 couple


years
 uh
 with
 physical
 robots.
 Elon
 said


AI
 and
 robots
 will
 replace
 old
 jobs.


working
 will
 be
 optional
 like
 growing


your
 own
 vegetables
 instead
 of
 buying


them
 from
 the
 store.


So
 here's
 my
 question
 to
 everybody.
 Uh


is
 Elon
 being
 hyper
 optimistic
 right
 now


by
 taking
 this
 approach
 that
 working


will
 be
 optional
 implying
 that
 you
 know


jobs
 will
 be
 a
 thing
 of
 the
 past
 and


there
 will
 be
 so
 much
 abundance
 that


people
 will
 be
 able
 to
 make
 money


outside
 of
 needing
 to
 work
 or
 is
 he
 you


know
 does
 does
 he
 have
 no
 idea
 what
 he's


talking
 about
 here
 and
 he's
 is
 he
 just


saying
 this
 to
 say
 this
 and
 the
 reason
 I


think
 it's
 also
 interesting
 is
 because


we're
 getting
 into
 Tesla
 earnings
 right


and
 so
 the
 way
 Tesla
 really
 moves
 on


earnings
 is
 usually
 during
 the
 call
 not


during
 ing
 the
 results
 when
 Elon
 talks


about
 the
 future
 of
 Tesla
 and
 the
 future


of
 what
 they're
 going to
 be
 doing
 with


AI.
 And
 I
 think
 there's
 a
 world
 where


again
 maybe
 Optimus
 is
 what
 he
 paints
 as


the
 thing
 that
 people
 really
 need
 to


care
 about.
 And
 if
 you
 can
 paint
 Optimus


as
 that
 kind
 of
 core
 argument
 that
 more


and
 more
 people
 should
 be
 looking
 at
 in


the
 context
 of
 Tesla,
 especially
 because


of
 how
 much
 it's
 going to
 replace
 jobs,


that's
 what
 gets
 the
 street
 excited.


There's
 a
 6%
 implied
 move
 on
 Tesla.
 So,


you're
 either
 looking
 at
 the
 low
 400s
 or


the
 480s


based
 on
 if
 we
 go
 green
 or
 red.


We
 need
 Elon
 to
 talk
 about
 Beyond
 Meat


for
 the
 real
 boost.
 Yeah,
 he
 mentions


Beyond
 Meat
 for
 going
 much
 higher.
 I


don't
 know
 if
 we're
 going
 to
 replace
 all


jobs
 with
 AI.
 Now,
 granted
 Elon
 knows


more
 about
 AI
 than
 myself,
 but
 like
 if


we
 do
 replace
 old
 jobs
 with
 AI,


especially
 blue
 collar
 jobs,
 like


physical
 labor,
 I
 think
 there's
 a
 lot


more
 questions
 than
 answers
 in
 terms
 of


what
 happens
 for
 society.


That
 could
 be
 something
 that
 ends
 up


playing
 out.
 Did
 you
 see
 Optimus
 talking


via
 Grock?
 Yes,
 they
 are
 implementing


Grock
 not
 only
 into
 Teslas
 but
 into


Optimus
 as
 well.
 I
 think
 it
 makes
 sense.


I
 mean
 they're
 training
 this
 large


language
 model
 should
 have
 more
 use
 in


the
 world.
 It's
 just
 it
 feels
 like


Optimus
 is
 far
 away
 just
 like
 every


robot
 is
 far
 away
 from
 actually
 being


operational


which
 is
 the
 the
 broader
 issue.
 Uh


Falling
 Knife,
 thank
 you
 for
 the
 $200


super
 chat.
 Thank
 you
 for
 being
 here.


appreciate
 you
 being
 part
 of
 the
 channel


and
 thank
 you
 again
 for
 the
 super
 chat


and
 thank
 you
 for
 being
 part
 of
 the


show.
 Do
 you
 see
 UBI
 in
 the
 next
 decade?


I
 mean,
 I
 feel
 like
 to
 some
 extent
 the


government's
 going
 to
 have
 to
 either


subsidize
 the
 lack
 of
 jobs
 in
 uh
 a
 form


of
 UBI
 or
 they're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 tax


the
 crap
 out
 of
 these
 robot
 companies


because
 they're
 going
 to
 have
 margins


that
 are
 just
 so
 juicy
 that
 like
 they're


going
 to
 need
 a
 way
 to
 pay
 for
 a
 lot
 of


this
 uh
 lack
 of
 work
 that's
 going
 to
 be


taking
 place.
 But
 I
 don't know.
 It's
 a


very
 complicated
 situation
 and
 I
 think


one
 of
 the
 things
 that
 we're
 going
 to
 be


living
 through
 over
 the
 next
 10
 years
 is


figuring
 out
 how
 work
 ultimately
 takes


place.
 Here's
 Jameson
 Greer,
 our
 China


trade
 representative,
 and
 here's
 what
 he


had
 to
 say
 this
 morning
 about
 some


updates
 on
 what's
 happening
 with
 China.


>> Really
 difficult
 issues
 that
 have
 come


up
 due
 to
 some
 new
 Chinese
 measures
 on


rare
 earths.


>> Can
 you
 be
 um
 with
 the
 an
 aggressive


country
 to
 another?
 Right.
 Even
 if
 China


is
 not
 uh
 you
 know
 one
 of
 the
 parties
 uh


in
 the
 agreement.
 So
 in
 Geneva,
 we
 had


an
 agreement
 where
 they
 would
 limit


their
 rare
 earth
 export
 controls.
 They'd


keep
 their
 retaliatory
 tariffs
 down
 and


we
 would
 suspend
 uh
 a
 good
 portion
 of


our
 our
 tariffs
 uh
 on
 the
 reciprocal


tariff.
 And
 so
 we
 we
 kept
 our
 part.
 We


kept
 that
 tariff
 low
 and
 we
 had
 very


cordial
 and
 constructive
 discussions


over
 the
 summer.
 And
 then
 again
 a
 couple


of
 weeks
 ago,
 the
 Chinese
 decided
 they


were
 just
 going
 to
 go
 ahead
 and
 expand


those
 controls
 on
 rare
 earths
 again,
 not


not
 on
 just
 us,
 but
 on
 on
 the
 whole


world.
 And
 now
 you
 hear
 a
 lot
 of


narratives
 uh
 from
 the
 Chinese
 side
 of


their
 surrogates
 saying
 well
 you
 know


the
 the
 Americans
 have
 put
 a
 lot
 of


controls
 on
 us
 over
 the
 past
 few
 years


or
 they
 put
 out
 a
 new
 rule
 that
 would


you
 know
 to
 to
 avoid
 evasion
 of
 US


export
 controls
 that
 they
 didn't
 like
 or


their
 fees
 on
 ships.
 So
 they're
 trying


out
 a
 lot
 of
 different
 u
 narratives
 when


the
 reality
 is
 they
 just
 want
 to
 exert


economic
 control
 on
 the
 world.
 They


started
 in
 April
 with
 the
 rare
 earth


magnets.
 They're
 using
 every
 anything


else
 that
 has
 happened
 as
 a
 pretext.
 The


reality
 is
 we
 made
 a
 promise
 in
 May
 to


keep
 our
 reciprocal
 tariff
 on
 them
 at


10%.
 We
 kept
 that
 promise
 and
 they
 have


not
 kept
 theirs.


>> The
 president
 also
 over
 the
 weekend


allayed
 some
 fears
 that
 this
 is,
 you


know,
 going
 back
 in
 time
 and
 things
 have


happened
 since
 then,
 but
 he
 said
 in
 in


non-sensitive
 goods
 uh and
 where
 we
 have


a
 constructive
 relationship
 and
 we


probably
 have
 to
 actively
 manage
 that


trading
 relationship.
 uh
 the
 trading


relationship
 over
 the
 past
 20
 years
 with


them
 has
 very
 has
 very
 much
 been
 China


has
 broad
 and
 wide
 access
 to
 the
 US


market.
 Uh
 and
 the
 US
 has
 had
 quite


limited
 access
 to
 the
 Chinese
 market.
 Of


course,
 they
 like
 that
 deal.
 They
 like


that
 setup.
 We
 can't
 live
 that
 way


anymore.
 So,
 we
 need
 an
 alternative


path.
 The
 question
 is,
 do
 the
 Chinese


accept
 this?
 Do
 the
 Chinese
 want
 to
 do


it.
 The
 US
 has
 always
 been
 quite
 open
 to


the
 Chinese
 and
 it's
 really
 been
 driven


by
 Chinese
 policies
 that
 exclude
 US


companies
 and
 drive
 over
 capacity
 and


over
 production
 in
 China.
 None
 of
 none


of
 that
 works
 for
 the
 United
 States.


>> So,
 look,
 this
 South
 Korea
 meeting


that's
 going
 to
 be
 happening
 around


November
 1st,
 I
 mean,
 it's
 either
 going


to
 result
 in
 some
 level
 of
 negotiations


or
 not.
 If
 we
 don't
 get
 a
 deal
 or
 any


resemblance
 of
 a
 deal
 by
 then,


I
 mean,
 look,
 I
 think
 earnings
 is
 the


only
 bull
 argument
 along
 with
 rate
 cuts.


The
 market
 was
 really
 looking
 for
 some


level
 of
 a
 trade
 deal
 between
 the
 US
 and


China.
 If
 we
 don't
 get
 it
 after
 this


Korea
 meetup,
 then
 I
 don't
 know.
 I
 don't


know
 how
 this
 is
 going
 to
 play
 out.
 Now,


Bloomberg
 is
 reporting
 that
 India
 is


getting
 close
 to
 a
 deal
 with
 the
 United


States.
 The
 US
 India
 are
 close
 to


finalizing
 a
 long-stal
 trade
 agreement


that
 would
 cut
 US
 tariffs
 on
 Indian


exports
 to
 15%.
 From
 50%.
 As
 a
 part
 of


the
 deal,
 India
 may
 reduce
 Russian
 oil


imports,
 which
 is
 kind
 of
 what
 Trump
 was


talking
 about
 last
 week
 that
 Modi
 said


he
 would
 stop
 buying
 Russian
 oil
 and


open
 access
 for
 US
 corn
 and
 soy
 meal,


potentially
 India
 buying
 our
 soybeans


instead
 of
 China.
 The
 announcement
 could


come
 whether
 when
 Trump,
 President
 Trump


and
 PM
 Modi
 meet
 at
 the
 summit
 in


Malaysia
 on
 October
 26th.
 So
 if
 we
 get


an
 India
 deal
 that
 is
 meaningful
 enough


to
 reduce
 our
 tariffs
 on
 them
 and
 also


get
 them
 to
 buy
 more
 of
 our
 stuff,
 which


is
 basically
 what
 Trump
 has
 been
 asking


for
 for
 the
 past
 couple
 of
 months
 now,


that
 would
 be
 bullish.
 If
 we
 can
 follow


that
 up
 with
 a
 China
 deal,
 that
 would
 be


bullish.
 And
 if
 Google,
 Microsoft,


Amazon,
 Meta
 crush
 earnings,
 that
 would


be
 bullish.
 And
 then
 obviously
 if
 the


Fed
 cuts,
 that
 would
 be
 bullish.
 I
 think


those
 are
 the
 four
 and
 then
 if
 all
 these


momentum
 stocks
 kind
 of
 don't
 go
 back
 to


all-time
 highs
 and
 you
 know
 some
 of
 the


momentum
 dies
 out
 and
 that
 money
 that


liquidity
 ends
 up
 coming
 into
 the
 names


that
 have
 earnings
 that
 would
 be


bullish.
 I
 think
 you've
 got
 five


different
 catalysts
 that
 could
 be


happening
 over
 the
 next
 two
 weeks
 that


could
 really
 set
 up
 for
 that
 7,000
 that


we're
 looking
 for
 on
 the
 S&P.
 I
 think


the
 way
 to
 get
 there
 is
 you
 need
 the


China
 deal,
 you
 need
 the
 India
 deal,
 you


need
 momentum
 to
 go
 to
 the
 direction
 of


the
 AMDs
 and
 Apples
 and
 Nvidas
 of
 the


world
 versus
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 the
 more


speculative
 names.
 um
 you
 need
 good


earnings
 growth
 and
 then
 you
 need
 a


little
 bit
 more
 geopolitical
 stability


along
 with
 rate
 cuts.
 If
 we
 get
 those


catalysts,
 we're
 probably
 going
 to
 see
 a


higher
 S&P
 500
 close
 to
 7,000.


But
 we
 need
 to
 get
 there
 and
 I
 think


that's
 what
 we
 got
 to
 look
 out
 for
 over


the
 next
 coming
 weeks.


Robin
 Hood
 getting
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 green


candle
 right
 here.
 We
 got
 about
 a
 minute


until
 the
 markets
 open.
 Look
 at
 that.
 A


lot
 of
 stuff
 going
 green.
 Palanteer


going
 green.
 Tesla
 going
 green.
 Google,


tons
 of
 different
 names.
 Got
 about
 30


seconds
 until
 this
 market
 opens.
 So,


looks
 like
 you
 got
 some
 traders
 coming


in.
 I
 guess
 Beyond
 Meat
 is
 one
 of
 the


things
 that
 we'll
 be
 looking
 at
 today.


It
 was
 at
 750.
 It's
 at
 619.
 It's
 getting


sold
 off
 a
 bit
 before
 the
 open.
 We
 are


going
 to
 see
 how
 this
 one
 opens
 up


and
 what
 we
 are
 going
 to
 get
 today.
 VRT


also
 great
 earnings
 today
 as
 well.


That's
 why
 that
 stock
 is
 up
 7%.


All right.
 Thank
 you
 everybody
 for
 being


here.
 It
 is
 Wednesday,
 October
 22nd.
 We


are
 going
 to
 see
 how
 this
 market
 turns


out
 for
 the
 day.
 9:30
 a.m.
 The
 stock


market


is
 once
 again
 open.


All
 right,
 wake
 your
 ass
 up.
 Let's
 get


into
 it
 and
 see
 what
 we've
 got
 going
 on.


Beyond
 Meat
 still
 up
 70%
 down
 a
 decent


chunk
 from
 the
 pre-market
 as
 you
 can
 see


on
 those
 red
 candles,
 but
 it
 is
 still


green
 from
 where
 it
 closed
 yesterday.


That
 went
 up
 now
 68%
 of
 the
 day.
 SoFi


that's
 down
 half
 a
 percent.
 SoFi's
 got


earnings
 next
 week.
 AMD
 that's
 down.3.


S&P
 500
 671.
 Nvidia
 that
 goes
 red
 on
 the


day.
 Tesla
 443
 that's
 down
 27%.
 They've


got
 earnings
 coming
 up.
 Robin
 Hood


basically
 flat
 13160.
 Pound
 share
 18164


also
 flat.
 Amazon
 down
 1.3.
 Meta
 down1.


Salesforce
 down
 1%.
 PayPal
 down
 1%.
 ELF


down
 21.
 Apple
 down48
 on
 the
 day.
 How


about
 Nebus?
 Nebius
 106.
 Look
 at
 that


nice
 little
 green
 move
 from
 103
 to
 106.


Yesterday
 it
 touched
 102
 at
 one
 point.


So
 Nebius
 getting
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 move
 right


there.
 How
 about
 Coreweave?
 That
 stock


124.
 Also
 getting
 a
 green
 candle,
 but


still
 red
 on
 the
 day.
 Dell's
 just
 flat


right
 now.
 Rocket
 Lab
 6349.
 Rocket
 Lab's


companion
 A
 definitely
 taking
 it
 on
 the


chin.
 That
 one's
 down
 8%.
 It
 was
 down


another
 9%
 yesterday.
 Okay,
 so
 we're


talking
 about
 a
 20%
 downturn
 in
 two
 days


for
 AS,
 but
 that
 one
 getting
 hit.


Duolingo,
 that's
 up
 1%.
 TFC
 is
 up
 half
 a


percent.
 IN
 holding
 on
 to
 the
 50s.
 If
 it


loses
 50,
 could
 get
 ugly,
 but
 it's
 not


really
 losing
 50
 yet.
 It
 did
 get
 to
 52,


that's
 down
 1.17%


right
 now
 in
 the
 uh
 in
 the
 market
 open.


Cisco
 right
 there,
 that's
 up
 a
 little


bit.
 Walmart,
 that's
 up
 just
 a
 bit.


Pounder
 16%.
 Google
 1.3.
 So
 Google
 was


at
 257
 off
 that
 anthropic
 deal.
 didn't


really
 hold
 on
 to
 its
 momentum.
 That
 one


continues
 now
 to
 hold
 the
 250s,
 but


still
 green
 on
 the
 day.
 Oaklow
 getting
 a


little
 bit
 of
 a
 bounce
 from
 132
 to
 135.


So,
 you've
 got
 some
 dip
 buyers
 coming
 in


showing
 some
 of
 that
 momentum


potentially
 is
 coming
 back.
 How
 about


the
 quantum
 stocks?
 D-Wave.


Yeah,
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 bounce.
 30
 to


30.9
 about
 a
 dollar
 bounce.
 Nothing


massive,
 but
 somewhat
 of
 a
 move
 right


there
 to
 the
 upside.
 BMR
 50.87.
 That


one's
 flat
 as
 Ethereum
 continues
 to
 be


flat.
 Applovin
 did
 get
 initiated
 with
 a


price
 target
 today
 of
 705
 from


Oppenheimer.
 So
 Apploven
 right
 there
 564


that's
 up
 2.19%.
 Microsoft
 that's
 up


half
 or
 half
 a
 percent.
 Micro
 strategy


down
 another
 3%.
 That
 one
 continuing
 to


get
 hit.
 VRT
 goes
 red.
 That's
 weird.
 BRT


had
 a
 great
 earnings.
 They
 beat
 by
 25%.


Not
 sure
 why
 that's
 going
 red.
 That
 one


losing
 all
 of
 its
 steam
 as
 soon
 as
 the


market
 opens.
 So
 I
 guess
 people
 end
 up


taking
 some
 profits
 right
 there.
 Beyond


Meat
 goes
 below
 six
 again.
 And
 it
 was
 at


$8
 at
 one
 point
 in
 the
 pre-market.
 Now


it's
 at
 580.
 Still
 up
 60%.
 But
 some
 of


that
 momentum
 for
 the
 pre-market


is
 also
 going
 down.
 Poet
 that's
 up
 6%
 on


the
 day.
 Looks
 like
 they
 had
 some


announcement
 here
 that's
 going
 to
 get


some
 love.
 Poet
 right
 there
 up
 7.71%.


Grabby
 Grab
 what
 do
 we
 got
 below
 550.


I
 mean
 again
 I
 really
 can't
 explain


fundamentally
 why
 that's
 happening.
 I


put
 out
 a
 post
 on
 Twitter
 yesterday.
 I


put
 out
 a
 bunch
 of
 different
 thoughts
 on


it.
 I
 mean
 my
 argument
 is
 that
 the


shorts
 at
 this
 point
 are
 in
 control
 and


they're
 manipulating
 it.
 But
 that's,
 you


know,
 that's
 the
 most
 I
 can
 chalk
 it
 up


to.
 And
 I
 know
 people
 don't
 love
 that


reason,
 but
 I
 don't
 really
 have
 another


fundamental
 reason
 to
 make
 that


argument.
 So,
 I
 think
 Q3
 earnings
 is


when
 you
 get
 the
 rerating.
 You
 know,


these
 are
 kind
 of
 the
 dog
 days
 of


investing
 in
 a
 stock.
 You
 either
 believe


or
 you
 don't.
 And
 you
 got
 to
 go
 through


some
 of
 these
 headwinds.
 Now,
 we
 got
 to


see
 if
 it
 closes
 below
 550
 because
 550


is
 good
 support.
 So,
 if
 it
 actually
 gets


a
 close
 below
 550
 today,
 that
 wouldn't


be
 the
 best
 in
 terms
 of
 its
 price


action.
 But,
 I
 think
 Q3,
 they
 have


pretty
 damn
 good
 quarter.
 And
 so,


ultimately
 Q3
 is
 going
 to
 decide
 the


trajectory
 of
 this
 name.
 SoFi
 right


here,
 2839.
 SoFi
 got
 to
 2950
 yesterday.


It's
 I
 I
 actually
 agree
 with
 Jason
 right


here.
 SoFi
 staying
 below
 29
 going
 into


earnings
 is
 really
 bullish
 because
 you


probably
 have
 an
 upside
 move
 to
 35
 if


they
 crush
 it.
 If
 it
 gets
 to
 34
 35


before
 earnings,
 which
 is
 possible
 given


SoFi
 has
 moved
 before
 earnings
 many


times.
 It
 it
 it
 would
 potentially
 set
 up


a
 disappointment
 where
 there's
 just
 not


more
 room
 to
 move
 higher.
 So
 I
 do
 think


if
 it
 kind
 of
 just
 chills
 in
 this
 range,


that
 could
 kind
 of
 be
 the
 way
 the


situation
 plays
 out.
 Well,
 we've
 got
 to


see
 how
 this
 ends
 up
 happening.
 Um,


Galaxy's
 down
 8%
 right
 there.
 Okay,


Galaxy
 is
 down.


Pull
 Quantum
 Oak
 or
 Beyond
 Meat.


That's
 a
 good
 poll.
 That's
 definitely
 a


good
 poll
 for
 what
 we
 see.
 Beyond
 Meat,


is
 that
 halted?
 Beyond
 Meat?
 Yeah,
 it's


halted.


Okay,
 Beyond
 is
 not
 Okay,
 Legend's
 being


weird.
 Beyond's
 not
 opening
 on
 Legend.


Let
 me
 go
 to
 Weeble.
 Did
 Beyond
 break


legend,
 bro?
 Goodness
 gracious.
 Yeah,


it's
 halted.
 I
 think
 it's
 halted.


Did
 Beyond
 really
 break
 Legend,
 bro?


It's
 not
 even
 loading
 on
 the
 freaking
 I


think
 it's
 halted.
 539.
 Still
 up
 50%.


Still
 up
 50%.


But
 it
 is
 now
 halted.
 Amazon
 21892.


Mattel
 also
 had
 earnings
 yesterday.


Mattel
 right
 there,
 that's
 down
 7.9%.


They
 had
 a
 little
 bit
 less
 uh
 of
 a
 good


picture
 on
 guidance.
 Mattel
 right
 there


that's
 down
 about
 7.8%
 of
 the
 day.
 Hims


losing
 4850
 or
 losing
 uh
 losing
 50
 and


now
 it's
 back
 at
 4850
 down
 about
 1.85%.


Wow.
 Bitcoin
 losing
 108.
 All
 right.
 So


we're
 seeing
 some
 actual
 red
 across
 the


board.
 Intuitive
 surgical
 they
 had
 a


great
 earnings.
 They
 deserve
 it.
 They're


up
 17%.


I
 don't
 know
 if
 they
 had
 an
 earnings


that
 was
 enough
 to
 go
 up
 17%
 but
 they


definitely
 had
 a
 good
 earnings.
 Streets


really
 giving
 them
 a
 premium
 right
 here.


That
 one's
 getting
 some
 love.
 Onage


drone
 company
 that's
 down
 4%.
 Wow.
 Oaklo


loses
 130.
 Guys,
 everything's
 sliding


right
 here.
 Everything
 sliding.
 S&P
 goes


red.
 Uh,
 Mattel
 down.
 Google
 still


holding
 on
 to
 a
 little
 bit.
 Nvidia
 goes


red.
 Gold
 still
 red
 on
 the
 day.
 Uh,


Nebas
 just
 Nebius
 was
 just
 at
 108.
 Back


down
 to
 103.
 Oracle
 down
 02.
 Is
 there
 a


headline?
 Is
 there
 a
 headline?
 I
 don't


know if
 there's
 a
 headline
 or
 it's
 just


ALOS.


Tesla
 going
 red.
 Let
 me
 see
 if
 there's


any
 headline.


That
 was
 quick,
 right?
 That
 was
 s
 that


that
 kind
 of
 paused
 legend
 as
 well.
 So,


you
 had
 a
 lot
 of
 volume
 potentially
 just


come
 in.
 United
 is
 kind
 of
 green.
 United


Airlines,
 AMD,
 that's
 flat.
 Morgan


Stanley
 goes
 red.
 Bank
 of
 America's
 red.


All
 the
 banks
 are
 red.
 What
 about
 Meta?


Meta
 is


back
 down.
 Grab
 still
 holding
 550.


Trying
 to
 552.
 Did
 Trump
 tweet?
 I
 don't


Let
 me
 see.
 I
 don't
 think
 he
 did.


No,
 he
 didn't
 tweet.


This
 might
 This
 might
 be
 more
 ALOS.
 This


might
 be
 way
 more
 ALOS.
 I
 don't
 see


anything
 fundamental
 here,
 but


everything
 kind
 of
 just
 got
 hit,


including
 those
 high
 momentum
 names.
 On


down
 four,
 ES
 down
 eight.
 Nabi
 down
 one.


Zion's
 down
 a
 little
 bit.
 Na'vi,
 this


thing
 was
 at
 20
 bucks
 at
 one
 point,
 now


down
 6%.
 It's
 like
 a
 10%
 beating


yesterday.
 Uber,
 that's
 down
 1%.
 Then


SoFi
 2821.
 the
 more
 high
 momentum
 names,


even
 like
 a
 Rocket
 Lab,
 very
 high
 beta,


those
 are
 getting
 hit
 the
 worst.
 Down


4%.
 Bit
 mine
 right
 there
 below
 50.
 Bit


mine
 below
 50


is
 what
 we've
 got.
 VIX
 is
 up
 a
 bit.


That's
 correct.
 The
 VIX
 is
 moving
 just
 a


little
 bit
 right
 here.
 Uh
 where's
 the


price
 of
 gold?
 Gold
 is


I
 mean


50
 bucks
 away
 still
 of
 losing
 4,000.
 VIX


is
 up
 2%.
 So,
 VIX
 doesn't
 have
 a
 massive


spike,
 but
 it
 does
 have
 a
 spike.
 Bitcoin


losing
 108
 was
 weird
 given
 it
 already


lost
 114
 intraday
 yesterday.
 Bitcoin


just
 back
 above
 108
 barely.


BMR
 still
 getting
 hit.


Beyond
 Meat
 is
 still
 halted.
 That
 is


correct.
 539
 is
 the
 halt
 and
 that's
 why


it's
 stuck
 there.
 Google
 is
 still
 green.


Microsoft
 is
 still
 green.


Would
 you
 buy
 Figma
 here?
 Uh
 Figma
 54.


So,
 Figma
 lost
 its
 pump
 that
 it
 got
 from


OpenAI
 two
 weeks
 ago
 when
 they
 partnered


with
 Chhatt.


I
 don't
 know
 enough
 about
 Figma's


valuation
 to
 be
 super
 excited
 for
 it


here.
 I
 would
 want
 to
 wait
 for
 another


quarter.
 I
 mean,
 there
 have
 only
 been
 a


public
 company
 for
 less
 than
 90
 days.


So,
 I
 would
 really
 like
 to
 see
 like,
 you


know,
 multiple
 quarters
 in
 a
 row
 of


growth.
 The
 Figma
 story
 itself
 is
 just


not
 the
 most
 exciting.
 Now,
 Canva,


that's
 a
 very
 exciting
 story
 for
 me.
 I


think
 they're
 way
 more
 broad-based


consumer
 than
 Figma.
 You
 know,
 Figma
 has


like
 13
 million
 businesses.
 Canva
 has


220
 million
 monthly
 active
 users.
 So,
 if


I'm
 betting
 on
 like
 AI
 design,
 Figma
 is


a
 phenomenal
 company.
 It's
 just
 it's
 not


the
 most
 exciting
 TAM
 versus
 some
 of
 the


other
 consumer
 names
 that
 are
 out
 there.


But,
 I
 would
 also
 just
 want
 to
 see


another
 quarter
 of
 growth.
 You
 know,


they've
 only
 had
 one
 quarter.
 I
 want
 to


see
 two
 quarters
 of
 execution.
 Hims


right
 there.
 48.
 Wow.
 4790


losing
 48.


This
 one's
 been
 tough.
 Oaklo
 9%
 down.


9%


down.
 I
 don't
 see
 the
 headline
 yet.
 I


don't
 see
 it.
 I
 don't.
 Now
 granted,
 the


S&P
 is
 not
 really
 I
 mean
 the
 S&P
 is


barely
 down.
 So
 it's
 not
 a
 headline
 that


should
 be
 affecting
 the
 broader
 market.


You
 did
 have
 that
 little
 move
 when
 S&P


touched
 670
 where
 everything
 took
 a
 draw


down.
 You're
 getting
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 Vshape


across
 the
 board.
 Even
 on
 Amazon,
 you're


getting
 that
 Vshape.
 Same
 thing
 with


Google,
 but
 those
 other
 momentum
 names


are
 not
 getting
 that
 Vshape.
 Oaklo
 down


10.
 How
 about
 Quantum?
 QBTS
 D-Wave.
 Wow.


Loses
 30.
 Down
 8%.


down
 8%.


How
 about
 IQ?


Uh,
 that's
 down
 another
 3%.
 INQ
 was


almost
 $70
 last
 week.
 And
 Regetti
 down


another
 5%.
 Regetti,
 if
 I'm
 not
 wrong,


was
 $58.
 58
 to
 37.


Beyond
 Meat
 is
 back.
 Okay,
 Beyond
 Meat


goes
 up
 from
 539.
 There's
 the
 green


candle.
 Touched
 511
 at
 one
 point.
 You


got
 dip
 buyers
 coming
 in.
 Netflix
 still


down
 8%.
 Again,
 Netflix
 didn't
 have
 bad


earnings,
 but
 they
 missed
 on
 EPS,
 so
 the


street's
 going
 to
 take
 it
 down.
 That's


just
 what
 happens
 when
 you're
 that
 big


of
 a
 company,
 but
 not
 necessarily


emblematic
 of
 the
 whole
 market
 having


some
 issues.
 Beyond
 Me
 trying
 to
 get


back
 to
 $6,
 560
 right
 there
 fell
 all
 the


way
 to
 530.
 Oaklo
 and
 Hood
 probably
 are


getting
 hit
 based
 on
 Bitcoin.
 Oaklo
 or


sorry,
 not
 Oaklo,
 Coinbase
 and
 Hood.


Coinbase
 327,
 that's
 down
 3%.
 And
 then


Hoodie
 12870,
 that's
 down
 2.3.
 So,


Bitcoin
 definitely
 affecting
 Coinbase


and
 Hood
 right
 here.
 Probably
 affecting


Micro
 Strategy
 at
 280.
 Microsoft
 at
 2
 or


Micro
 Strategy
 at
 295.
 Micro
 actually


getting
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 bounce
 from


292.


Tesla
 goes
 green.
 Meta
 goes
 green.
 Some


of
 the
 MAX
 7
 are
 going
 green,
 but
 a
 lot


of these
 other
 names
 are
 still
 taking
 a


hit.


Gold,
 are
 we
 moving
 higher?
 Okay,
 gold


got
 a
 little
 bounce.
 Gold
 got
 a
 little


bounce.
 It
 It
 bottomed
 so
 far
 at
 4,50.


Now
 it's
 at
 480.
 So,
 you're
 seeing
 a


little
 bounce
 on
 gold.
 $34
 billion.


There's
 your
 green
 candle
 on
 gold
 from


372
 to
 375
 on
 the
 GLD
 ETF.
 Uh,
 $34


billion
 have
 entered
 into
 gold
 ETFs
 over


the
 past
 10
 weeks.
 So,
 $3.4
 billion


every
 week
 for
 the
 past
 10
 weeks
 have


entered
 into
 these
 ETFs.
 There's
 a
 lot


of
 money
 that
 continues
 to
 bet
 on
 gold,


even
 if
 it
 had
 a
 two
 trillion
 dollar


downfall
 over
 the
 past
 couple
 of
 days.


Amit,
 are
 you
 buying
 hood
 at
 128?
 No.


But
 if
 you
 have
 no
 position,
 I
 don't


think
 it's
 a
 horrible
 entry.
 Again,
 for


me,
 it's
 just
 it's
 it's
 already
 a
 big


position.
 So,
 it's
 really
 got
 to
 give
 me


a
 juicy
 price
 to
 get
 excited.
 And


again,
 if
 Bitcoin
 doesn't
 get
 any


momentum,
 Hood's
 probably
 going
 a
 bit


lower,
 right?
 It's
 just
 the
 honest


truth,
 especially
 if
 Bitcoin
 falls
 below


100.
 Now,
 I
 don't
 think
 that
 could


happen,
 but
 then
 again,
 who
 would
 have


thought
 Bitcoin
 would
 be
 barely


above
 105
 in
 October
 when
 it's
 supposed


to
 be
 the
 best
 month
 of
 the
 year
 for


Bitcoin.
 So
 I
 do
 if
 you
 have
 no
 exposure


I
 mean
 128
 is
 a
 way
 a
 way
 better
 price


than
 150
 but
 if
 you
 have
 exposure
 I
 feel


like
 you
 got
 to
 wait
 till
 the
 market


gives
 you
 something
 juicier.
 Nvidia


right
 there
 going
 green
 18130
 that's


green
 as
 well
 as
 Beyond
 Meat
 halted


again.
 Beyond
 Meat
 is
 halted
 again
 at


611.
 Halted
 again


at
 611.


This
 time
 to
 the
 upside.
 Halted
 this


time
 to
 the
 upside.
 I
 ran
 also
 getting
 a


bit
 of a
 rebound
 which
 is
 nice
 to
 see.
 I


ran
 right
 there
 5560.


So
 that's
 up
 as
 well.


Um,
 and
 I
 ran
 actually
 going
 green.


I
 ran
 actually
 going
 green.
 Jet,
 thank


you
 for
 becoming
 a
 channel
 member.


Appreciate
 it.
 Jet
 Jones,
 thank
 you
 for


being
 here.
 Thank
 you
 for
 becoming
 a


channel
 member.
 How
 about
 Lemonade
 and


Oscar?
 Oscar
 had
 a
 great
 day
 yesterday.


Lemonade
 down
 2%.
 Oscar
 with
 their
 new


AI
 assistant
 down
 3%.
 It
 was
 up
 7%


yesterday.
 A
 lot
 of
 these
 names
 not


really
 holding
 on
 to
 their
 juice.
 Oaklo


still
 down.
 124.86
 86
 is
 the
 intraday


low
 for
 Oakllo.
 If
 it
 breaks
 that,
 then


it
 potentially
 could
 lose
 those
 levels.


125
 again.
 Oaklo
 was
 190
 last
 week.


D-Wave
 29.95.
 This
 was
 at
 42.
 S&P
 still


basically
 flat.
 So,
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 red


that
 we're
 seeing
 not
 affecting
 the
 S&P


and
 Nvidia
 still
 holding
 on
 to
 be
 green.


How
 about
 Plug
 Power?
 That
 stock
 right


there
 293.
 That's
 down
 6%.
 That
 had
 a


pretty
 big
 move
 as
 well.
 Nebius.


Wow.
 101.


That
 was
 weird,
 right?
 Nebus
 was
 at
 107


like
 five
 minutes
 ago.
 That
 one
 I
 think


it's
 it's
 getting
 bucketed
 into
 the
 data


center
 companies.
 And
 when
 the
 data


center
 stocks
 go
 down,
 even
 though


Nvidia
 is
 not
 down,
 your
 Nebus,
 your


core
 go
 red.
 Coreweave
 121,
 down
 2.5.


Cipher,
 how
 about
 the
 other
 Bitcoin


miners?
 Uh,
 Cleanspark
 did
 get
 hit
 a


while
 ago.
 Cipher
 is
 down
 three.
 Clean


Sparks
 down
 three.


Terra
 Wolf
 is
 flat.


So
 those
 aren't
 getting
 hit
 as
 bad
 as


they
 were
 before.
 BMR
 down
 6%.
 No,
 down


three.
 It
 was
 down
 six.
 So
 got
 a
 little


recovery.
 50.32.


Still
 down


3%.


Yeah,
 Nabius
 and
 Uber
 did
 announce


something
 today
 with
 uh
 AVID,
 which
 is
 a


company
 in
 the
 autonomous
 driving
 space.


So,
 that
 was
 a,
 you
 know,
 positive


headline
 for
 Nebius
 today.
 Not
 enough
 to


get
 the
 stock
 to
 really
 go
 higher.
 Uber


and
 Nebius
 are
 committing
 as
 much
 as
 375


million
 to
 develop
 their
 self-driving


vehicle
 subsidiary
 subsidiary,
 AV
 ride.


Bloomberg
 says
 the
 new
 funding
 will
 help


accelerate
 the
 growth
 of
 AIDS
 driverless


fleet
 and
 support
 AV
 rides
 product


development
 and
 expansion
 to
 new


geographies.
 So,
 Uber
 and
 Nebi
 is
 both


investing
 into
 a


autonomous
 self-driving
 startup.


Street
 doesn't
 care
 too
 much
 about
 it.


based
 on
 what
 we're
 seeing.


Um,


yeah,
 big
 deal
 for
 APLD
 as
 well.
 Five


billion,
 not
 enough
 to
 get
 the
 stock
 to


really
 make
 a
 move.
 Now,
 granted,
 APLD


has
 had
 a
 big
 move
 over
 the
 past
 couple


of
 months,
 but
 still
 that
 one's
 flat.


Robin
 trying
 to
 get
 back
 to
 130.
 Um,


Ethereum
 still
 stuck
 at
 3,800.


Anis
 right
 here,
 we
 talked
 about
 that


last
 week
 on
 the
 Equity
 Edge
 podcast.


We're
 going
 to
 be
 talking
 about
 a
 new


stock
 today,
 GXO.
 They're
 a
 logistics


company.
 So
 that'll
 be
 at
 12:30
 on


Twitter
 for
 those
 that
 are
 interested
 in


the
 audio
 version
 of
 that.
 We'll
 be


talking
 about
 that.
 AMD
 right
 there
 at


238.
 AMD
 goes
 green.
 How
 about
 Amcore?


AMC
 holding
 on
 to
 31.87.
 AMC
 not
 giving


up
 the
 30s,
 which
 is
 good
 to
 see.
 MP


down
 another
 3%.
 These
 rare
 earth
 stocks


continue


to
 get
 rid
 of
 some
 of
 their
 momentum.


Beyond
 Meat
 still
 halted
 at
 611.


Still
 halted
 at
 611.


Uh
 Matt,
 thanks
 for
 the
 super
 chat.
 He


said, "I
 bought
 D-Wave
 at
 386
 in


January.
 I
 was
 trying
 to
 make
 it
 to


long-term
 gains.
 Should
 I
 just
 dump
 it?"


It's
 a
 good
 question
 because
 you
 have
 uh


a
 couple
 months
 left,
 right,
 for
 it
 to


be
 long-term
 gains.


I
 don't
 know,
 dude.
 That's
 It's
 hard,


right?
 Because
 what
 if
 by
 the
 time
 you


get
 to
 your
 long-term
 gains,
 January
 in


2026,


what
 if
 this
 thing
 doesn't
 really
 give


you
 any
 more
 gains
 because
 it
 just
 gets


obliterated?


Or
 what
 if
 this
 thing
 goes
 back
 to
 50,


you
 know,
 and
 it's
 this
 is
 just
 the


moment
 of
 some
 weakness,
 but
 it's
 not
 a


structural
 problem.


I
 don't
 know.
 It
 it
 really
 depends
 on


how
 how
 convicted
 you
 are.
 It's
 just


that
 simple.
 Depends
 on
 how
 convicted


you
 are
 on
 this
 name.
 And
 they
 do
 they


have
 they
 do
 have
 an
 earnings
 coming
 up.


So
 maybe
 if
 there's
 anything
 positive
 in


their
 earnings
 that
 keeps
 the
 stock
 at


least
 at
 this
 level,
 even
 if
 it
 doesn't


tank.
 Um,
 but
 I
 think
 it
 depends
 on
 how


much
 you
 really
 believe
 that
 they
 can


actually
 hold
 on
 to
 these
 levels.
 Again,


a
 lot
 of
 these
 momentum
 names
 that
 have


taken
 a
 beating,
 the
 the
 bright
 side
 of


them
 taking
 a
 beating
 is
 that
 they've


already
 taken
 the
 beating.
 If
 they
 take


another
 beating,
 then
 it's
 just
 a
 blood


bath.
 But
 does
 that
 have
 to
 happen
 after


they're
 already
 down
 30
 to
 40%.
 Not


really,
 right?
 They
 they
 already
 got


beat
 up
 pretty
 badly.
 Maybe
 this
 is


where
 they
 bottom
 out,
 but
 I
 think


you're
 going to
 need
 to
 see
 a
 little
 bit


more
 data
 to
 see
 if
 that's
 the
 case.
 S&P


goes
 green.


S&P
 goes
 green.
 All
 right,
 Beyond
 Meat


unhalted
 goes
 down
 from
 611
 down
 to
 605.


You
 got
 your
 red
 candle.
 Did
 get
 to
 639


for
 a
 second.
 Now
 back
 at
 615.


Now
 back
 at
 6:15.


Is
 anyone
 trading
 this?
 Now
 back
 at
 590.


Put
 in
 the
 chat,
 are
 you
 trading
 this
 at


all?
 Beyond
 Meat,
 is
 anyone
 Is
 anyone


like
 buying?
 Have
 you
 been
 in
 Beyond


Meat
 already?


I
 mean,
 it's
 obviously
 getting
 a
 ton
 of


retail
 momentum.
 Volume
 is
 630
 million


shares,
 bro.
 This
 thing
 is
 going
 to


trade
 a
 billion
 shares
 before
 lunchtime.


It's
 going
 to
 trade
 a
 billion
 before


lunchtime.


FUBU
 also
 getting
 hit
 right
 here.
 FUBU


down
 4%.
 Uh,
 Nebius,
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a


bounce
 to
 103
 and
 then
 Bit
 Mine
 at


50.20.


I'm
 beyond
 scared.


I
 mean,
 I'm
 not
 scared
 of
 it.
 I
 just


think
 it's
 I
 just
 think
 it's
 like
 people


are
 bored,
 bro.
 People
 are
 bored.
 Unless


this
 becomes
 GameStop
 2.0
 and
 they


really
 want
 to,
 you
 know,
 tell
 Ken


Griffin
 how
 horrible
 he
 is.
 Like
 either


people
 get
 tired
 of
 it.
 I
 mean,
 these


names
 really
 need
 momentum.
 You
 need


like
 an
 Eric
 Jackson
 to
 get
 a
 lot
 of


people
 excited
 constantly,
 you
 know.


Does
 it
 have
 that
 sort
 of
 open
 door
 type


of
 army?
 I
 don't
 know.


And
 if
 it
 doesn't,
 then
 maybe
 the
 hype


dies
 out.
 Open
 door,
 by
 the
 way,
 loses


seven
 644.
 This
 is
 the
 lowest
 Open
 Door


has
 been
 in
 about
 a
 month
 and
 a
 half.


So,
 this
 one
 uh
 you
 know,
 if
 you
 bought


in
 at
 $10,
 $9,
 $8,
 it
 has
 been
 taking
 a


hit.
 Open
 door
 down
 7%
 on
 the
 day.


Beyond
 Meat
 now
 back
 to
 6:30.


Back
 to
 630


on
 this
 one.


Did
 you
 talk
 about
 fun?
 There's
 a
 ticker


symbol
 fun.
 Oh,
 Six
 Flags.
 Yeah,


this
 one
 got
 this
 one
 made
 a
 move


yesterday
 if
 I'm
 not
 wrong.


Uh
 um
 yeah,
 it's
 up
 25%
 of
 the
 past


days.
 What
 was
 the
 headline
 on
 Six


Flags?


Does
 anyone
 know
 the
 headlines
 on
 this


one?
 I
 uh
 I
 saw
 it
 for
 a
 little
 bit,
 but


I
 didn't
 see
 the
 big
 move.
 It's
 still


down
 40%
 for
 the
 year.


Texas
 Capital
 raised
 their
 price
 to
 33.


Janna
 Partners
 took
 a
 9%
 stake
 as
 a


potential
 catalyst.
 Okay,
 looks
 like


maybe
 there's
 Oh,
 the
 Travis
 Kelce


Travis
 Kelce
 teams
 up
 with
 investor
 for


activist
 campaign
 at
 Six
 Flags.
 That
 was


the
 headline.


Again,
 I
 don't
 even
 know
 how
 to
 I
 don't


even
 know
 how
 to
 make
 sense
 of
 some
 of


those
 beyond
 me
 right
 there.
 626.


But
 Travis
 Kelce
 is
 investing
 in
 Six


Flags.


Okay,
 I
 guess
 that's
 what
 we
 got
 going


on.
 I
 mean,
 dude,
 if
 Taylor
 Swift
 does


anything
 for
 Six
 Flags,
 that,
 you
 know,


that
 stock
 could
 actually
 really
 get
 a


move.
 Cory
 right
 there
 down
 1.7.


Lemonade
 down
 1.3.
 IBKR
 actually
 green


and
 that
 one
 holding
 on
 some
 of
 its


momentum.
 Iran
 as
 well
 going
 back
 to


green.
 Let
 me
 see
 if
 we
 have
 any
 macro


data
 today.
 It
 is
 Wednesday.
 We


Well,
 I
 think
 we
 got
 something.
 Do
 we


have
 mortgage
 rates
 today?


We
 might
 have
 mortgage
 rates.


Uh
 mortgage
 rates.
 Yeah,
 we
 got
 them


6.37.
 Wow.
 Lowest
 lowest
 in
 a
 couple
 of


months.
 6.37
 versus
 6.42.


6.37
 versus
 6.42.


So,
 you've
 got
 you've
 got
 interest
 rates


or
 at least
 mortgage
 rates
 that
 have


come
 down,
 which
 is
 nice
 to
 see.
 Uh,


Hive,
 that's
 down
 about
 3.4%.
 Dwave


still
 down
 4%.
 Open
 Door
 now
 down
 8%
 on


the
 day.
 A
 lot
 of
 wind
 coming
 out
 of


that
 stock.
 Bit
 mine
 at
 50.18.
 And
 then


Hoodie
 at
 129.
 Crispy
 Cream
 is
 being
 cre


uh
 uh
 squeezed.


Holy
 crap.
 Crispy
 Cream


is
 being
 squeezed,


dude.
 When
 did
 this
 happen?
 When
 did


Crispy
 Cream
 go
 up
 32%.


We
 were
 so
 busy
 with
 Beyond
 Meat,
 we


didn't
 even
 see
 this
 was
 remember
 this


was
 happening
 back
 in
 like
 in
 July.


This
 was
 happening
 back
 in
 July.
 31.5%


on
 Crispy
 Cream.


Um


the
 short
 float
 on
 this
 one
 is


30%
 still
 as
 of
 September
 30th.
 It's


still
 30%.
 So
 why
 are
 people
 I
 think


they're
 just
 putting
 it
 in
 the
 bucket


with
 Beyond
 Meat.


Beyond
 Meat
 now
 they're
 65%
 but
 Beyond


Meat
 actually
 had
 a
 catalyst.
 Crispy


Cream
 doesn't
 I
 don't
 think
 they
 have
 a


catalyst.


Retail
 Gang
 is
 getting
 way
 bored.
 Yeah.


I
 feel
 like
 that's
 that's
 it.


Dude,
 this
 is
 like
 I
 don't
 know.
 I
 think


this
 is
 kind
 of
 dumb.
 Crispy
 Cream
 and


Beyond
 Meat
 up
 40
 50%
 on
 the
 day.
 Like


that's
 Now
 granted,
 I
 do
 think
 like
 if


you're
 seeing
 the
 wind
 get
 knocked
 out


of
 a
 lot
 of these
 other
 momentum
 names


and
 people
 want
 to
 play
 around
 with


these
 two
 stocks,
 that's
 fine.
 It
 would


be
 a
 different
 story
 if
 like
 all
 of


these
 names
 were
 just
 running
 10
 20%
 on


the
 day.
 That's
 just
 not
 happening.


You're
 seeing
 a
 lot
 more
 weakness
 in


these
 names.
 And
 I
 guess
 maybe
 it's


isolated
 to
 two
 names
 that
 have
 very


high
 short
 floats
 that,
 you
 know,
 people


potentially
 want
 to
 gamble
 on.


>> But
 that
 is
 what
 you're
 seeing.


Um


uh
 668
 million
 traded
 on
 Beyond
 Meat.


Crispy
 Cream
 as
 well.
 70
 million
 shares.


The
 average
 volume
 is
 7
 million.
 So


that's
 a
 10x
 increase.
 And
 then
 on


Beyond
 Meat,
 it's
 going to
 head
 to
 a


billion
 pretty
 soon
 in
 terms
 of
 volume.


606.
 It's
 kind
 of
 stuck
 at
 that
 $6


level.
 You're
 not
 really
 getting
 the


bullside
 or
 the
 bare
 side
 to
 play
 in.


So
 I
 guess
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 if
 that


one
 continues
 or
 not.
 Galaxy
 again
 they


had
 a
 great
 earnings
 last
 wow
 down
 9%.


All
 the
 Bitcoin
 miners
 even
 if
 you
 put


up
 good
 result
 that
 see
 this
 is
 not


encouraging
 for
 the
 for
 the
 for
 the


entire
 sector
 because
 Galaxy
 put
 up
 in
 I


mean
 they
 beat
 earnings
 by
 200%
 and
 the


stock
 is
 still
 down
 9%.


which
 which
 begs
 the
 question,
 you
 know,


if
 I
 puts
 up
 really
 good
 earnings,
 is
 is


there
 just
 too
 much
 baked
 into
 the
 stock


where
 the
 market's
 not
 going
 to
 care.


And
 Galaxy,
 even
 with
 this
 draw
 down,
 is


up
 120%
 year
 to
 date.
 So
 again,
 you


can't
 say
 fundamentally
 that
 they're
 not


getting
 a
 premium
 because
 they're


definitely
 getting
 a
 premium.


So
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 Bitcoin


miners/data
 center
 companies,
 they're


going
 to
 have
 to
 put
 up
 good
 earnings,


but
 they're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 justify


increased
 growth
 trajectories
 because


they're
 already
 up
 so
 much
 that
 a
 lot
 of


it
 potentially
 could
 be
 baked
 in.
 Same


thing
 for
 Hood,
 by
 the
 way.
 Hood's
 up
 a


lot.
 So,
 they're
 gonna
 have
 to
 put
 up
 a


really
 good
 earnings
 to
 say
 they
 deserve


even
 more
 of
 a
 premium
 because
 a
 lot
 of


that
 growth,
 you
 could
 argue,
 is
 baked


in.
 Same
 thing
 for
 Palenteer.
 Again,


they're
 gonna
 have
 to
 put
 up
 just


earnings
 that
 are
 so
 undeniable
 that
 the


street
 has
 no
 option
 but
 to
 go
 higher.


And
 Netflix
 did
 not
 do
 that
 yesterday.
 A


lot
 was
 baked
 into
 Netflix
 and
 they


missed
 on
 EPS
 and
 that's
 why
 they're


lower.


Google,
 I
 think, is
 in
 the
 same


situation.
 I
 mean,
 Google
 from
 150
 to


250,
 one
 could
 argue
 that
 the
 street
 has


decided
 to
 give
 it
 a
 premium.
 They're


going to
 have
 to
 put
 up
 a
 great
 quarter


to
 see
 that
 continue
 to
 grow.


GoPros's
 up
 18%.
 Dude,
 what
 is
 going
 on?


GoPro,
 Crispy
 Cream,
 and
 Beyond
 Meat.


It
 feels
 like
 May
 of
 2024


when
 GameStop,
 how
 is
 GameStop
 not
 doing


anything,


which
 GameStop
 actually
 had
 a
 good


quarter.
 They
 actually
 had
 a
 pretty
 good


quarter
 three
 months
 ago.
 I
 They
 put
 up


some
 decent
 results,
 especially
 in
 the


new
 trading
 card
 business
 that
 they're


getting
 into.
 like
 they're
 not
 back
 to
 a


growth
 stock,
 but
 they
 are
 growing.
 Um,


but
 the
 OG
 meme
 stock
 is
 just
 like
 not


getting
 any
 love.


Not
 getting
 Check
 Flowers.
 F
 LWR.


Um,


is
 that
 the
 ticker
 symbol?
 Flowers
 1800


Flowers.
 Is
 that
 the
 one?
 Oh
 my


goodness.
 That's
 up
 17%.
 All right.
 It


is
 a
 meme
 rally.
 It
 is
 a
 meme
 rally


across
 the
 board.


the
 highest
 quality
 com
 highest
 quality


companies
 in
 the
 market.
 1800
 Flowers,


GoPro,
 Crispy
 Cream,
 and
 Beyond
 Meat.


Incredible.
 At
 the
 same
 time,
 Nvidia


getting
 some
 love.
 Okay,
 183.
 There's
 a


big
 green
 candle
 right
 there.
 We'll
 see


if
 it's
 backed
 up
 by
 anything
 important,


but
 Nvidia
 going
 green.
 the
 meme
 stock


ETF
 that
 is
 up
 2%
 on
 the
 day.


Nvidia
 holding
 on
 to
 some


of
 that
 love.


The
 Wall
 Street
 Bet
 Army
 is
 back.
 Yeah,


I
 mean


I
 would
 I
 would
 guess
 they
 are
 back.


It's
 weird,
 bro.
 It's
 the
 end
 of
 the


year
 though.
 Like
 the
 fact
 that
 people


are
 gambling
 this
 much
 towards
 the
 end


of
 the
 year.
 Like
 it's
 almost
 like
 it's


almost
 like
 people
 that
 want
 to
 catch
 up


to
 performance
 instead
 of
 you
 know


taking
 a
 shot
 on
 Google
 or
 Amazon


they're
 like
 nope
 we
 are
 going
 to


guarantee
 that
 we
 have
 a
 great
 year
 by


squeezing
 the
 crap
 out
 of
 these


companies.
 GoPro,
 Beyond
 Meat,
 and


Crispy
 Cream.


I
 don't
 know.
 I
 guess
 that's
 what
 you


got
 going
 on.
 Nvidia
 though
 getting
 some


love
 right
 there.
 183.
 Amazon
 was
 down


yesterday.
 Amazon
 still
 down
 about
 1.3.


Amazon's
 still
 getting
 hit.
 Hoodie


trying
 to
 get
 back
 to
 130.
 Where
 is
 AS


71?
 AS
 down
 9%.
 Is
 this
 a
 buy
 the
 dip


for
 those
 that
 love
 AS?
 I
 mean,
 it
 went


from
 36
 to
 102,
 back
 down
 to
 71.


It's
 almost
 like
 that
 run
 to
 100
 was


nonsense.
 That
 that's
 what
 the
 the
 chart


is
 saying.
 The
 chart
 is
 saying
 that
 had


they
 had
 no
 business
 getting
 up
 there


for
 it
 to
 go
 down
 that
 quickly
 from
 for


it
 to
 touch
 100
 and
 then
 lose
 25%
 that


quick.


But
 then
 the
 question
 becomes,
 does
 it


even
 deserve
 to
 be
 at
 70?
 Like
 if
 it


touched
 100
 and
 didn't
 deserve
 to
 be


there
 as
 per
 how
 the
 market's
 reacting


to
 it,
 like
 does
 it
 deserve
 to
 be
 at
 70?


And
 I
 feel
 like
 it
 gets
 harder
 sometimes


to
 to
 jump
 in
 easily
 and
 buy
 that
 dip.


Cory
 right
 there
 down
 2%.


As
 well,


Chris
 holds
 as
 I
 mean,
 last
 time
 I


talked
 to
 him,
 he
 still
 holds
 his
 AS.
 I


think
 he
 has
 options
 on
 it,
 but
 his


options
 are
 still
 deep
 in
 the
 money.
 I


think
 he
 had
 like
 a
 $50
 strike.
 So
 even


with
 the
 draw
 down,
 he's
 still


pretty
 deep
 in
 the
 money.
 Big
 Bear
 AI,


how
 about
 this
 one?
 Wrecked
 again.
 695


bounced
 a
 little
 bit
 off
 67
 671,


but
 this
 stock
 from
 910
 bucks
 continues


to
 get
 hit.


Blackberry
 is
 not
 a
 meme
 stock.
 I
 agree.


Blackberry
 getting
 a
 7%
 move
 right


there.
 Blackberry
 actually
 has
 a
 really


good
 fundamental
 thesis.
 Uh
 the
 cash


relative
 to
 their
 market
 cap
 very


attractive.
 I
 I've
 not
 done
 a
 super
 big


deep
 dive
 into
 BlackBerry,
 but
 couple


smart
 people
 I
 know
 uh
 do
 have
 some
 some


bags
 of
 this
 one
 and
 they
 they
 do


believe
 in
 the
 long-term
 thesis
 on
 it.


Um
 not
 the
 best
 growth
 stock,
 but


definitely
 a
 more
 compelling
 argument.


For
 those
 that
 don't
 know
 BlackBerry,


it's
 not
 just
 a
 phone
 company
 anymore.
 I


mean,
 they
 transitioned
 into
 cyber


security
 and
 software
 for
 cars,
 all
 this


stuff
 a
 while
 ago,
 but
 that
 stock


getting
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 move
 up
 7%.
 Now,
 that


might
 be
 moving
 if
 it's
 in
 the
 bucket
 of


the
 meme
 stock
 category
 because
 it
 was


at
 one
 point
 seen
 as
 a
 meme
 stock
 and


maybe
 that's
 why
 it's
 getting
 a
 7%
 move


and
 the
 algos
 are
 just
 taking
 it
 higher.


But
 there
 is
 something
 more
 fundamental


there.
 Beyond
 Meat
 58%
 571,
 Crispy
 Cream


23%.


Are
 we
 moving
 on
 GameStop?
 GameStop.


There
 you
 go.
 Look
 at
 that.
 The
 OGs
 are


back.
 Little
 1%
 candle
 right
 there


on
 GameStop.


Oh,
 I
 think
 we
 have
 the
 Nvidia
 headline.


I
 think
 we
 have
 it.


Um,


let
 me
 make
 sure
 to
 confirm
 right
 here.


Yeah,
 Dominican
 Republic
 signed


agreement
 with
 Nvidia.
 Wow.
 These
 guys


got
 a
 whole


That's
 That's
 not
 just
 a
 regular


company,
 bro.
 That's
 not
 a
 company
 at


all.


That
 is
 a
 freaking
 country


in
 the
 Caribbean
 to
 work
 with
 Nvidia.


A
 whole
 freaking
 country.
 All right.
 So,


this
 is
 probably
 a
 data
 center
 deal
 that


Nvidia
 got
 with
 the
 Dominican
 Republic.


We
 don't
 have
 full
 details
 on
 it
 yet,


but
 that
 is
 why
 you
 got
 the
 spike.
 Uh,


and
 you
 know,
 Nvidia's
 done
 this
 with
 a


lot
 of
 other
 countries,
 so
 it
 makes


sense
 for
 them
 to
 partner
 with
 other


countries.


Sovereign
 AI.
 Yeah,
 sovereign
 AI.
 Let
 me


check.
 population
 of
 Dominican
 Republic.


Population
 of
 Dominican


11
 million
 relatively
 small
 country


and
 it
 looks
 like
 some
 data
 centers
 are


going
 to
 be
 coming
 to
 the
 Dominican


Republic.


NBS
 NBIS
 uh
 let's
 see
 if
 that's
 moving


back
 higher.
 102
 right
 back
 down
 107


down
 to
 102.
 Nvidia
 supplying
 chips
 for


meme
 stocks.
 Exactly.
 That's
 it.
 That's


all
 Nvidia
 has
 to
 say
 today.
 We
 are


supplying
 chips
 for
 Beyond
 Meat
 and


Crispy
 Cream


and
 that'll
 take
 it
 higher.
 Open
 Door


still
 down
 7%,
 D-Wave
 still
 down
 five,


Applied
 Digital
 barely
 up
 two
 and
 then


Bitmine
 still
 down
 2%.


Can
 we
 talk
 about
 the
 BMR
 short


position?
 So,
 we
 talked
 about
 it
 a


couple
 weeks
 ago.
 If
 you're
 talking


about
 Caris
 Capital,
 that's
 short.
 Bit


mine.
 Um,
 I
 don't
 think
 their
 thesis
 is


that
 good.
 Their
 argument
 is
 just


Bitmine
 will
 lose
 its
 premium
 to
 NAV.


And
 you
 know
 like
 if
 if
 you
 believe
 that


they
 will
 lose
 their
 premium
 to
 NAV
 then


yes
 you
 should
 go
 short
 Bitmine
 because


then
 this
 thing
 is
 going
 to
 collapse.
 If


you
 believe
 Ethereum
 will
 continue
 to


stay
 strong
 and
 Bitmine
 will
 trade
 at
 a


premium
 to
 NAV
 then
 you
 have
 the


opposite
 opinion.
 I'm
 in
 the
 latter


camp.
 I
 think
 there's
 too
 much
 baked


into
 how
 we
 understand
 the
 overall


Bitmine
 thesis.
 Again,
 I
 did
 a
 really


big
 deep
 dive
 on
 this
 on
 Substack
 wrote


a
 long
 article
 about
 it,
 but
 there's
 a


lot
 of
 components
 to
 why
 they're
 getting


a
 premium
 to
 NAV
 and
 why
 the
 other
 uh


ETH
 treasuries
 and
 Bitcoin
 treasuries,


any
 crypto
 treasury
 is
 not
 getting
 that


premium.
 And
 so,
 Carisdale
 has
 been


right
 on
 their
 show
 short
 so
 far
 from


like
 55
 to
 50
 because
 ETH
 has
 been


stuck.
 If
 ETH
 were,
 you
 know,
 to
 get


closer
 to
 4500,
 5,000,
 I
 mean,
 the
 short


just
 wouldn't
 make
 that
 much
 sense.
 I


think
 that
 mine
 would
 be
 well
 above


these
 levels.
 So
 it's
 a
 question
 of
 if


you
 believe
 in
 Ethereum
 more
 than


anything
 versus
 like
 the
 MNAV
 but
 you


know
 that
 is
 always
 the
 risk


with
 any
 digital
 asset
 treasury.
 NAV
 is


net
 asset
 value.
 NAV
 is
 how
 much
 money


the
 company
 actually
 is
 is
 worth
 on


their
 balance
 sheet.
 How
 much
 you
 know


uh
 assets
 they
 own
 relative
 to
 their


debt.
 And
 then
 the
 premium
 is


essentially
 think
 of
 it
 like
 a
 PE
 right


like
 Microsoft
 XYZ
 earnings.
 You're


paying
 27
 times
 for
 those
 earnings


because
 you
 believe
 that
 it's
 worth
 27


times.
 Bitmine
 ME
 strategy
 they
 trade
 it


like
 1.4
 1.5
 times
 because
 you
 believe


they
 deserve
 to
 be
 trading
 at
 a
 premium


and
 the
 reason
 for
 that
 premium
 is
 what


carisel
 disagrees
 with.
 But
 nonetheless


it's
 what
 the
 longs
 agree
 with.
 If
 you


are
 long

 of
 those
 names

here's
 the
 thing
 again
 does
 it

 easily

 if

 to
 50
 is
 this
 a
 one-time
 you


know
 little
 breather


Is
 this
 like,
 you
 know,
 Amazon
 was
 at


223
 yesterday.
 Amazon's
 at
 219.
 Does


Amazon
 get
 back
 to
 223?
 Yeah,
 I
 think


so.
 Amazon
 was
 at
 240
 in
 January.
 Does


it
 get
 back
 to
 240
 one
 day?
 Yeah,
 I


think
 over
 time
 it
 does.
 Do
 some
 of


these
 stocks
 ever
 revisit
 their
 all-time


highs?
 And
 if
 they
 don't,
 and
 people


know
 that
 they
 won't,
 are
 they
 just


going
 to
 sell
 and
 and
 carry
 on
 the


onslaught
 because
 they
 want
 to
 just
 get


out
 of
 it
 and
 take
 their
 loss?


I
 think
 that
 is
 the
 structural
 question


that
 could
 be
 scary
 for
 a
 lot
 of
 these


names.
 Iran
 continuing
 to
 get
 a
 little


bit
 of
 move.
 That's
 up
 2.3%.


Beyond
 Meats,
 is
 that
 going
 to
 create


bag
 holders
 as
 we
 speak
 at
 5.82?
 I
 mean,


if
 you
 bought
 it
 at
 8.85
 in
 the


pre-markets,


does
 it
 ever
 even
 get
 back
 to
 8.85,


right?
 Like,
 is
 there
 enough
 juice
 to


get
 it
 like


these
 are
 these
 are
 hard
 decisions,


dude?
 Because
 once
 a
 stock
 loses
 that


momentum
 and
 it's
 it's
 gone,
 it
 might
 I


mean,
 GameStop
 has
 never
 got
 back
 up


into
 the
 hundreds
 after
 it
 fell
 in
 2021.


And
 I
 think
 that
 could
 be
 the
 scary
 part


about
 some
 of
 the
 stuff.
 Were
 people


actually
 buying
 Oak
 at
 190?
 Yeah.
 I


mean,
 whether
 it
 was
 an
 institution
 or


retail,
 Oaklo
 now
 loses
 123.
 My


goodness.
 122.
 If
 you
 just
 look
 at
 the


chart
 right
 here,
 someone
 was
 buying
 it


at
 $193.84,


which
 means
 someone
 was
 buying
 it
 at


170,
 at
 180,
 at
 192,
 at
 191,
 at
 157,
 at


164,
 at
 175.
 like
 someone
 was
 buying
 it


at
 those
 levels


and
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 it
 was,


you
 know,
 the
 most
 important


institutional
 investors
 on
 the
 planet.


That's
 the
 hard
 part
 here.


Eli
 Lily,
 that's
 up
 1%.


All right,
 that's
 getting
 some
 love.


Hims,
 I
 I
 don't
 understand
 why
 Hims
 is


getting
 hit
 like
 this.
 I
 really
 don't.


40%
 short.
 Even
 Jason
 yesterday,
 he
 had


no
 idea.
 Like,
 why
 like
 why
 is
 What
 do


you
 guys
 think?
 Why
 are
 people
 shorting?


Why
 do
 they
 hate
 him?
 so
 much.
 I
 don't


get
 it.


I
 don't
 get
 it.
 Like
 this
 is
 a
 qual


there's
 so
 many
 names
 to
 short
 over
 him,


but
 the
 shorts
 hate
 it.
 Down
 3%.
 Got
 65


last
 week
 and


now
 it's
 losing
 the
 50s
 at
 these
 levels.


Uh,
 okay.
 We
 have
 some
 update
 on
 the


Dominican
 Republic
 stuff.
 So,
 the


Dominican
 Republic
 signed
 a
 strategic
 AI


alliance
 with
 Nvidia
 to
 establish
 the


region's
 first
 center
 of
 excellence
 in


artificial
 intelligence,
 part
 of
 its


national
 AI
 strategy.
 The
 initiative


signed
 by
 President
 Abnner
 will
 train


1,000
 professionals
 by
 2026
 through


NVIDIA's
 deep
 learning
 institute,
 to


develop
 a
 national
 AI
 factory
 to
 ensure


data
 sovereignty
 and
 drive
 AI
 adoption


across
 healthcare,
 education,
 mobility,


public
 safety,
 tourism,
 and
 finance.
 Uh


the
 Ministry


of


AI
 said
 the
 partnership
 supports
 the


country's
 national
 semiconductor


strategy
 and
 broader
 digital


transformation
 goals.


Okay,
 cool.
 So,
 Nvidia
 having
 a
 full


sovereign
 AI
 partnership
 up
 1%
 of
 the


day
 with
 the
 Dominican
 Republic.


There
 you
 go.


That's
 not
 how
 you
 pronounce
 his
 name.


You
 you
 guys
 know
 by
 now
 that
 there
 was


no
 way
 in
 hell.
 I
 was
 going
 to
 pronounce


his
 name
 correctly.
 There
 is
 no
 way
 in


hell.


Amid,
 how
 much
 are
 you
 down
 today?
 Let's


check.
 Let's
 pull
 it
 up.
 How
 much
 are
 we


down?


50,347.


Okay,
 that's
 not
 too
 bad.


I
 was
 up
 like
 120
 yesterday.
 So,
 had
 a


bit
 of
 recovery
 yesterday
 from
 Friday.


Down
 50
 today.


But
 not
 too
 bad
 overall.
 S&P
 basically


flat
 right
 here
 at
 671.
 Not
 moving
 up
 or


down.


Um,


Beyond
 Meat,
 are
 we
 still
 moving
 here?


Beyond
 Meat
 578,
 trying
 to
 get
 back
 to


six.
 Oaklo
 just
 lost
 122.
 Dude,
 I
 I


think
 I
 think
 the
 bottom
 could
 be


falling
 out.


I
 think
 the
 bottom
 could
 be
 falling
 out,


dude.


121.
 This
 was
 150
 yesterday
 and
 190
 last


week.
 I
 mean,


I
 don't
 know,
 dude.
 The
 bottom
 might
 be


falling
 out.
 AS
 right
 there
 down
 9%.
 Big


bear
 down
 2.6.


Pound
 here
 basically
 flat.


And
 then
 D-Wave
 below
 30.


DWave
 below
 30.
 Yes,
 Oak
 was
 $5
 in


September.
 Last
 year
 it
 was
 $5
 in


September.


So,


I
 mean,
 it's
 still
 up
 a
 lot.
 It's
 just


again
 five
 to
 130.
 Does
 it
 deserve
 130?


5
 to
 190.
 Like,
 the
 these
 are
 the


questions,
 right?
 Can
 it
 can
 it
 hold


these
 levels
 even
 after
 it's
 made
 this


big
 of
 a
 move?
 S&P
 just
 goes
 green
 671


41.
 Oh,
 we
 got
 an
 update
 on
 Robin
 Hood


Strategies.
 Robin
 Hood
 Strategies
 is


serving
 over
 1
 billion
 of
 client
 assets.


Wow,


not
 bad.
 I
 think
 Vlad
 just
 tweeted
 that


or
 Robin
 Hood
 just
 tweeting
 that
 Robin


Hood
 1
 billion.
 This
 was
 500
 million


um


last
 month.


Dude,
 see
 this
 is
 why
 when
 people
 say,


"Well,
 isn't
 Robin
 like
 a
 meme
 stock?"


It's
 like,
 "No,
 Oaklo
 doesn't
 have
 1


billion
 of
 client
 assets
 across
 180,000


funded
 accounts.
 Neither
 do
 any
 of
 these


quantum
 names.
 They
 don't
 have
 anything.


So,
 you
 can
 disagree
 with
 the
 multiple


on
 a
 hood.
 That's
 totally
 fine.
 You
 can


disagree
 with
 the
 multiple
 on
 a
 pounder.


You
 cannot
 disagree
 with
 the
 actual


growth
 that
 they're
 showing
 in
 terms
 of


the
 real
 company
 fundamentals.


Some
 of
 these
 other
 names,
 they
 just


don't
 have
 anything.
 They
 don't
 have
 any


growth.
 And
 that's
 why
 the
 streets


probably
 selling
 them
 off
 right
 here


along
 with
 potentially
 retail
 selling


them
 off.
 Beyond
 me.
 Back
 to
 623.


Back
 to
 623.


Oh,
 Steph.
 Stephanie
 tweeted
 it.
 Okay,


cool.
 Steph
 is
 one
 of
 the
 Robin
 Hood.


She's
 she's
 running.
 I
 have
 like
 a


thousand
 dollars
 inside
 of
 the


strategies.
 Um
 I
 haven't
 really
 put
 a


ton
 of
 money
 into
 it,
 but
 I
 mean
 it's


done
 really
 well
 and
 it's
 been
 able
 to,


you
 know,
 manage
 the
 money
 correctly.


One
 billion
 right
 there.
 So
 he's


basically
 managing
 a
 $1
 billion
 fund


across
 retail
 investors
 and,
 you
 know,


they're
 allocating
 it
 in
 a
 bunch
 of


different
 things.


But
 this
 was
 like
 uh
 this
 was
 uh
 $250


million
 back
 in
 April.
 So
 you're
 talking


about
 a
 4x
 increase
 in
 less
 than
 five


months
 or
 less
 than
 eight
 months
 which


is
 pretty
 incredible.
 Lily
 804
 hims


47.85
 that
 one
 continuing
 to
 get
 hit.
 A


might
 lose
 70
 right
 here
 90
 cents
 away.


Low
 of
 days
 9.8%
 pounders
 flat.
 Uh
 amor


down
 1.3.
 Galaxy
 down
 10.5.


Galaxy
 down
 10.5.


Nick
 says,
 "I
 love
 Hood,
 but
 I
 have


considered
 utilizing
 two
 brokerages


after
 all
 the
 issues
 they
 have
 had."


Yeah,
 and
 that's
 fair,
 dude.
 I
 mean,


look,
 at
 the
 end
 of the
 day,
 if
 they


can't
 stay
 on
 when
 things
 happen
 uh
 in


terms
 of
 market
 volatility,
 I
 I
 think


it's
 worth
 people
 exploring
 another


brokerage.
 I
 think
 that's
 fair.
 If
 you


can't
 trade
 in
 the
 moments
 where
 you


need
 to
 trade,
 maybe
 it's
 worth
 having
 a


backup.
 So,
 I
 kind
 of
 personally
 just


like
 having
 all
 my
 assets
 in
 one
 place.


That's
 why,
 you
 know,
 I
 wouldn't
 be


leaving.
 I
 also
 don't
 even
 think
 I
 would


know
 how
 to
 operate
 Schwab.
 Like
 I
 was


actually
 talking
 to
 someone
 yesterday


who
 was
 like,
 "I
 got
 pissed
 off
 at
 Hood


during
 GameStop.
 I
 went
 to
 Schwab


because
 I
 was
 so
 mad
 about
 what
 they
 did


and
 then
 six
 months
 later
 I
 got
 so


pissed
 off
 at
 Schwab
 because
 it
 sucked


that
 I
 went
 back
 to
 Hood
 even
 though
 I


was
 still
 pissed
 off
 at
 Hood."
 So
 I
 just


know
 that
 I
 wouldn't
 be
 able
 to
 function


a
 different
 app
 in
 an
 effective
 way.
 But


it's
 not
 crazy
 for,
 you
 know,
 people
 to


have
 two
 apps.
 Netflix
 though,
 8%
 on
 the


day,
 losing
 a
 hundred
 bucks.
 Netflix


wiping
 up
 basically
 about
 $80
 billion
 of


market
 cap
 right
 here
 on
 the
 day.
 So,


this
 one
 definitely
 getting
 hit
 after


those
 earnings
 grab
 at
 557.
 That's
 flat.


And
 then
 Bitcoin
 right
 here
 at
 108.


SoFi
 is
 the
 solution.
 Maybe,
 dude.


Maybe.


Again,
 I
 just
 I've
 used
 SoFi's
 invest


product.
 I
 really
 don't
 like
 it.
 I
 just


like


I
 don't
 know,
 dude.
 I
 I
 don't
 like
 the


user
 experience
 on
 it.
 Some
 people
 do.


That's
 fine.
 But
 it's
 very
 hard
 for
 me


to
 like
 take
 it
 seriously
 whenever
 I


actually
 open
 it
 and
 use
 it.


But
 they
 are
 introducing
 level
 one


options
 and
 crypto
 which
 will
 be


bullish.
 So
 right
 here
 though
 I
 did
 want


to
 take
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 an
 earnings


gamble.
 I
 wanted
 a
 2650.
 Maybe
 it
 loses


28
 right
 here.
 2
 cents
 away.
 There
 you


go.
 It
 just
 lost
 28.
 Let's
 see
 if
 we
 can


get
 low
 27s.


And
 if
 that
 one
 ends
 up
 playing
 out
 as


70.37
 that's
 down
 10.3%.


Beyond
 Meat
 still
 moving
 673
 got
 halted.


Wow.


Dude,
 they
 halt
 it
 every
 time
 and
 makes


a
 big
 move.


They're
 not
 letting
 retail
 win.


They're
 not
 letting
 retail
 win.
 Let's


see
 if
 it
 opens
 higher
 to
 the
 upside
 or


if
 it
 gets
 halted
 to
 the
 downside.


But
 you
 do
 have
 some
 green
 right
 there.


Mike
 Johnson
 is
 live
 again.
 Dude,
 this


guy
 goes
 live
 every
 day
 to
 talk
 about


the
 government
 shutdown,
 and
 he
 says
 the


same
 thing
 every
 day.


Why
 doesn't
 he
 go
 try
 to
 talk
 with
 the


Democrats
 versus
 like


he's
 live
 on
 CNN
 and
 Fox
 every
 morning


complaining?
 It's
 like,
 bro,
 get
 a
 deal


done.
 It's
 not
 even
 worth
 listening
 to


it.
 They're
 going to
 say
 he's
 going
 to


say
 the
 same
 thing
 that
 he
 says
 every


single
 morning.


They
 got
 to
 get
 a
 freaking
 deal
 done.


Beyond
 me
 right
 there.
 673.
 That
 one's


still
 getting
 hit.
 Tesla
 below
 440.
 439.


All right,
 so
 that
 lost
 a
 lot
 of
 its


momentum.
 Next
 decade.
 How
 about
 that


one?
 Next
 decade.
 at
 596
 loses
 six


loes
 six
 bucks
 here.


Delta
 Air
 said
 to
 plan
 beta
 test
 for
 AI


uh
 power
 travel
 assistant
 later
 this


month.
 Okay,
 so
 Delta
 Incorporating


potentially
 a
 lot
 more
 of
 an
 AI


initiative.
 I
 think
 United
 said


something
 similar
 to
 this
 on
 their


earnings.
 United
 stock
 basically
 flat
 at


100.
 I
 thought
 United
 had
 a
 great


earnings,
 but
 stock
 was
 relatively
 flat.


Nvidia
 still
 up
 on
 the
 day
 18250.


Look
 at
 the
 Pelaton
 option
 flow.
 Is


Pelaton
 next?
 Is
 Pelaton
 the
 next
 stock


to
 to
 make
 a
 move
 here?


This
 if
 Pelaton
 makes
 a
 move,
 it


actually
 does
 feel
 like
 2021.


And
 again,
 I
 I
 I'm
 on
 the
 side
 that
 this


market
 is
 fundamentally
 differentiated


from
 2021,
 but
 just
 some
 of
 these
 names,


I
 think
 Beyond
 Meat
 in
 2021,
 that
 was
 a


big
 one,
 too,
 right?


Yeah.
 Yeah,
 you
 do
 have
 some
 option
 flow


on
 Pelaton
 for
 the


for
 the
 November


uh
 what
 contract
 is
 this?


November


8
 bucks
 and
 then
 you
 have
 October
 this


week
 Friday
 850.


This
 week
 850
 expiring
 in
 a
 couple
 days.


You
 got
 a
 ton
 of
 flow
 coming
 out
 on
 that


one
 too.


850
 call
 for
 this
 week.
 Yeah,
 that's
 the


one
 that's
 getting
 a
 ton
 of
 momentum.


Um,


oh
 wow,
 Doug,
 are
 you
 are
 you
 actually


out?
 Doug
 says,
 you
 know,
 I
 love
 D-Wave,


but
 I'm
 out.
 It
 should
 be
 three
 to
 four


speculatively.
 I
 was
 able
 to
 buy
 below


one
 a
 year
 ago
 at
 2
 to
 3x
 in
 a
 year


based
 on
 their
 advances.
 Great,
 but


multi,000%
 gains.


Doug,
 are
 you
 actually
 selling?
 For


those
 that
 don't
 know,
 Douggee
 got
 into


D-Wave
 under
 a
 dollar.


Doug,
 interesting.


Looks
 like
 the
 draw
 down's
 making


someone
 a
 little
 scared,
 man.
 Like,


I
 mean,
 look,
 it's
 inevitable.
 Everyone


gets
 scared.
 I'd
 be
 scared,
 too.


But
 if
 you're
 actually
 selling,
 see,


this
 is
 what
 I
 mean.
 This
 is,
 and
 this


is
 not
 to
 pick
 on
 Doug.
 I
 love
 Doug.


He's
 he's
 a
 good
 friend
 of
 mine.
 But


this
 is
 the
 point.
 When
 stocks
 lose


momentum
 and
 someone
 who's
 up
 what
 30x,


if
 you
 bought
 it
 at
 a
 dollar,
 it's
 at
 30


29,
 you're
 up
 29x,
 someone
 starts
 to


think,
 wait
 a
 second,
 I'm
 up
 2900%.


Maybe
 I
 should
 take
 some
 profits.


Maybe
 I
 should
 take
 some
 mother
 effing


profits
 if
 I'm
 up
 2900%.


And
 maybe
 if
 I
 don't,
 and
 this
 stock


loses
 momentum
 and
 other
 people
 have


that
 moment
 where
 they're
 like,
 "Oh


yeah,
 I
 should
 probably
 take
 some


profits."
 and
 it
 goes
 down
 further,


maybe
 I
 won't
 be
 up
 29x
 anymore.


Maybe
 those
 gains
 are
 going
 to


disappear.
 Right?
 This
 is
 what
 happens.


This
 is
 the
 psychology
 of
 retail.
 Now,


Doug
 might
 be
 wrong
 because
 D-Wave
 might


be
 having
 a
 little bit
 of
 a
 moment
 and


then
 it
 spikes
 back
 up
 to
 40.
 But
 if


he's
 right
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 other
 people
 are


thinking
 the
 same
 thing
 he's
 thinking,


you're
 going to
 get
 stocks
 that
 just


have
 the
 bottom
 fall
 out
 as
 a
 lot
 of


people
 say,
 "I
 don't
 want
 to
 be
 along


for
 the
 ride
 anymore."
 And
 they're


passing
 their
 bags
 to
 someone
 else.


And
 the
 question
 then
 about
 the
 person


who's
 buying
 Doug's
 shares
 from
 a
 dollar


at
 29
 is
 do
 they
 know
 more
 about
 the


future
 of
 quantum
 computing
 than
 Doug?


And
 I
 don't
 think
 Doug's
 an
 expert
 on


it,
 but
 he's
 he's
 done
 a
 pretty
 good


amount
 of
 research
 just
 based
 on
 the


private
 conversations
 I've
 had
 with
 him


over
 the
 past
 year.
 I
 don't
 know.
 We


have
 to
 really
 see
 is
 there
 enough


momentum
 for
 people
 to
 get
 excited
 about


the
 future
 of
 it
 going
 longterm.


670
 on
 the
 S&P.
 That
 one
 goes
 red
 on
 the


day
 as
 well.


Doug
 says,
 "Quantum
 has
 just
 as
 much
 as


Andre
 does
 going
 for
 it."


Doug's
 also
 a
 a
 a
 private
 Andre
 investor


as
 well.
 So,
 I
 mean,
 look,
 that's
 a
 fair


point.
 It's
 a
 fair
 point.


You
 might
 just
 not
 have
 that
 much


excitement
 to
 the
 upside
 if
 you
 know,
 a


lot
 of
 that
 momentum
 could
 be


potentially
 baked
 in.
 Crispy
 Cream
 still


up
 30%
 on
 Danut.
 That
 one's
 still


moving.
 And
 then
 Beyond
 Meat,
 is
 it


unhalted?
 Is
 it
 unhalted?
 659.
 It
 got


unhalted.
 Lost
 about
 20
 cents
 from
 673,


but
 still
 there.


But
 still
 there.


Um,


dude,
 this
 67
 stuff.
 Do
 you
 guys
 were


you
 guys?
 Okay,
 some
 of
 you
 guys
 uh
 saw


it
 yesterday
 with
 me
 on
 the
 market


close,
 but
 freaking
 freaking
 they
 were


talking
 to
 a
 Netflix
 analyst
 and
 they


asked
 the
 analyst
 about
 his
 thoughts
 on


Netflix
 and
 the
 dude
 mentioned,
 "Yeah,


it's
 probably
 down
 six,
 seven%."


Uh
 because,
 you
 know,
 they
 they
 their


operating
 margin
 is
 not
 the
 best.
 And


the
 freaking
 host,
 bro,
 the
 freaking


host,
 it
 was
 incredible.


I
 couldn't
 believe
 it
 was
 happening.


I
 couldn't
 believe
 it
 was
 happening
 what


he
 said,


but
 you
 know,
 he
 called
 him
 out
 on
 the


uh
 on
 the
 67.
 You
 guys
 saw
 it
 right
 in


the
 morning.
 Let
 me
 uh
 let
 me
 play
 that


clip
 right
 here.


It
 was
 absolutely
 hilarious.


Couldn't
 believe
 it
 was
 thing,
 but
 it


was
 a
 thing.


>> They
 actually
 would
 have
 beat
 uh


earnings
 handly
 if
 you'd
 adjusted
 for


that.


>> Okay.
 Okay.
 So,
 uh,
 six,
 seven%
 you
 say.


Uh,
 I
 I
 I
 can't
 let
 that
 go.
 But


>> I
 cannot
 believe
 this
 is
 real
 life.
 I


cannot
 believe
 the
 meme
 has
 made
 it
 to


such
 an
 extent,
 but
 it
 did.
 Beyond
 Meat


650,
 Netflix
 still
 getting
 hammered.


Wow.
 Down
 9%.
 This
 is
 one
 of the
 worst


days
 Netflix
 has
 had
 in
 about
 a
 year.


When's
 the
 last
 time
 Netflix
 took
 a
 9%


hit?


When's
 the
 last
 time?
 Yeah,
 South
 Park


covered
 it
 as
 well.
 When's
 the
 last
 time


it's
 like
 a
 9%
 hit?


Um,


we
 got
 some
 flow
 on
 energy
 fuels.


Uh,
 30
 covered
 or
 30
 call
 1121
 2
 million


came
 in
 on
 that.
 How's
 that
 one
 doing?


That's
 another
 energy
 name
 that's


actually
 been
 a
 bit
 more
 legit.
 Yeah,


flat.
 That
 one
 hasn't
 got
 hit
 as
 hard.


Beyond
 Meat
 going
 for
 seven.
 She's
 going


for
 seven.


$6.99.
 She
 touched
 it.
 Let's
 see.
 Do
 the


bulls
 have
 the
 momentum
 to
 keep
 it


going?


Do
 they
 have
 the
 momentum
 to
 keep
 it


going?
 685
 got
 rejected
 right
 there
 at


699.


Trying
 to
 get
 there.


Austin
 said
 I
 sent
 that
 clip
 to
 my
 girl.


Yeah,
 dude.
 Like
 if
 if
 you're
 on
 part
 of


Tik
 Tok
 culture
 to
 see
 that
 come
 to
 like


mainstream
 business
 news
 is
 hilarious.


Absolutely
 hilarious.


Doug
 said,
 "I'm
 making
 six
 figures
 on
 my


quantum."
 I
 mean,
 bro,
 you
 deserve
 it.


You
 bought
 it
 at
 a
 dollar
 when
 no
 one


believed
 in
 it.


Now
 it's
 at
 2970.
 I
 mean,
 to
 make
 a
 six


figure
 profit,
 almost
 3,000%
 return
 in


what,
 less
 than
 a
 year.
 Doug,
 I
 think


you
 bought
 it
 in
 like
 September,
 right?


It's
 not
 even
 been
 Yeah,
 it's
 been
 it's


been
 a
 little
 bit
 over
 a
 year.


I
 mean,
 you
 deserve
 it.
 You
 deserve


those
 profits.


29.68
 right
 there
 on
 D-Wave.
 Tesla
 right


there
 at
 439
 as
 well.
 There,
 you
 know,


there
 were
 there
 was
 someone
 who's
 in


the
 quantum
 space
 and
 he
 uh
 he
 posted
 a


tweet
 yesterday
 about
 his
 like
 3,000


4,000%
 gain
 on
 a
 bunch
 of
 these
 quantum


stocks.
 And
 uh
 he
 basically
 asked
 the


question,
 he
 was
 like,
 "What?"
 Like,


"Why
 am
 I
 getting
 so
 much
 [ __ ]
 for


posting
 my
 gains?"
 Because
 Finwit,
 as


toxic
 as
 it
 is,
 people
 actually
 really


appreciate
 when
 someone
 makes
 gains


because
 I
 think
 there's
 a
 level
 of
 like


community
 where
 people
 want
 to
 see
 and


learn
 from
 other
 people,
 right?
 So,
 if


you
 post
 that
 you're
 up
 $200,000
 on


SoFi,
 you're
 not
 going
 to
 get
 a
 ton
 of


hate.
 You're
 going
 to
 get
 a
 lot
 you're


going
 to
 get
 some
 jealousy
 here
 and


you're
 gonna
 get
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 that


are
 supportive
 because,
 you
 know,
 they


want
 to
 see
 other
 people
 win.
 But
 this


quantum
 guy,
 he's
 getting
 all
 this
 [ __ ]


in
 the
 comments.
 And
 he
 just
 started


asking
 like,
 "Why
 are
 people
 giving
 me


[ __ ]
 I
 thought
 the
 whole
 point
 of
 finit


was
 to
 share
 your
 gains
 and
 share
 your


wins
 and
 stuff."
 And
 you
 know,
 my


response
 to
 him,
 Beyond
 Meat,
 by
 the


way,
 there
 you
 go.
 Touch
 719.


then
 got
 hit
 in
 the
 687
 but
 touched
 719.


My
 response
 to
 him
 was,
 uh,
 first
 of


all,
 congrats
 on
 the
 win.
 You
 deserve


it.
 But
 how
 you
 make
 your
 money
 is
 a
 lot


more
 important
 than
 how
 much
 money
 you


make,
 especially
 if
 you're
 trying
 to


build
 a
 brand,
 you
 know,
 and
 you're


trying
 to
 become
 a
 fund
 manager.
 You're


trying
 to,
 you
 know,
 build
 a
 social


media
 brand
 around
 finance,
 all
 that


stuff.
 And
 the
 sad
 thing
 about
 this


quantum
 stuff
 is
 people
 are
 up
 thousands


of
 percent
 and
 no
 one
 respects
 it.


No
 one
 respects
 it.
 And
 when
 I
 mean
 no


one,
 I'm
 being
 hyperbolic.
 Obviously,


there's
 a
 section
 of
 the
 quantum


community
 that
 obviously
 respects
 it,


but
 no
 one
 believes
 it's
 real.
 Everyone


thinks
 it's
 pure
 BS.
 And
 so,
 you
 know,


my
 argument
 to
 him
 was
 like,
 it's


amazing
 that
 you
 have
 these
 gains,
 but


if
 you're
 going
 to
 post
 it
 on
 a
 public


platform
 and
 everyone
 thinks
 Quantum
 is


a
 joke
 and
 these
 stocks
 are
 up
 4,000%


for
 no
 reason,
 then
 you're
 going
 to
 get


a
 lot
 of
 push
 back
 because
 like
 the
 way


you
 make
 your
 money
 is
 also
 something


that
 needs
 to
 be
 respectable.
 People


respect
 if
 you're
 up
 on
 Nvidia
 or
 you're


up
 on
 Rocket
 Lab.
 They
 don't
 really


respect
 if
 you're
 up
 on
 a
 lot
 of these


other
 names
 because
 they
 think
 it's
 just


pure
 luck.
 it's
 not
 real.


And
 so
 I
 think
 that
 is
 kind
 of
 the
 push


back
 that
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 are
 getting


publicly.
 Now
 again,
 it
 doesn't
 take


away
 from
 the
 gains.
 Like
 if
 you
 buy


low,
 sell
 high,
 that's
 the
 name
 of
 the


game.
 But
 if
 you're
 trying
 to
 use
 that


as
 credibility
 to
 say
 you're
 like
 this


important
 investor
 that
 can
 find
 the


diamond
 in
 the
 rough,
 it's
 like,
 well,
 a


lot
 of
 people
 just
 think
 it's
 not
 real


in
 the
 first
 place,
 so
 they
 don't
 give


you
 the
 credit.
 And
 I
 think
 that's,
 you


know,
 that's
 one
 of the
 issues
 that
 a


lot
 of
 the
 quantum
 bulls
 might
 be


struggling
 with
 to
 an
 extent
 as
 well.


Granted,
 you're
 up
 3,000%,
 who
 cares,


right?
 Especially
 if
 you
 don't
 care


about
 building
 a
 public
 brand.
 Nvidia


right
 there.
 18168.


That
 one
 continues
 to
 hold
 on
 to
 the


green.
 Apply
 digital
 that
 goes
 red.


Apply
 digital.
 That
 one
 goes
 red.


Um


BMR.
 Is
 that
 one
 still
 down?
 BMR.
 Yeah.


49.
 Wow.
 Loses
 50.


That
 one's
 still
 down
 as
 well.


Um,


Beyond
 is
 giving
 me
 FOMO.
 Is
 anyone


actually
 getting
 FOMO
 on
 this?
 I'm
 not


getting
 a
 single
 ounce
 of
 FOMO,
 dude.


I'm
 not
 getting
 a
 single
 ounce
 of
 FOMO.


Like,
 this
 to
 me
 is
 just
 whatever.
 Is


anyone
 actually
 getting
 FOMO?
 Like,
 are


people
 seeing
 this
 and
 like


legit
 thinking
 they
 need
 to
 get
 in?


Like,
 I
 am
 not
 even
 for
 a
 millisecond.


There's
 not
 an
 ounce
 of
 me
 that
 feels


FOMO
 on
 this.
 Like


I
 mean
 I
 I
 don't
 care
 if
 this
 goes
 to


$10.
 Like
 who
 car?
 Like
 this
 is
 this
 is


not
 worth
 the
 risk
 in
 my
 opinion.
 Not
 at


all.


Maybe
 if
 you
 have
 some
 gambling
 money,


whatever.
 But
 like


okay,
 good.
 The
 majority
 of
 you
 saying


no.


Joy
 says,
 "I
 got
 in
 sub
 $1,
 so
 yes."


Well,
 did
 you
 sell
 after
 you
 got
 in
 or


are
 you
 still
 holding?
 If
 you're
 still


holding,
 I
 mean,
 you
 know
 you're
 up.


It's
 not
 the
 worst
 thing
 in
 the
 world.


Dude,
 I
 just
 think
 we
 have
 two
 months


left
 of
 the
 year.
 I
 said
 this
 yesterday,


but
 Pelaton,
 Crispy
 Cream,
 Pelon
 now
 up


3%.


Like,
 Beyond
 Meat,
 none
 of
 this
 stuff
 is


worth
 the
 risk,
 dude.
 In
 my
 opinion,


it's
 just
 not
 worth
 the
 risk.
 Like,
 I


just
 I
 don't
 I
 don't
 care
 about
 it


enough
 to


really
 get
 that
 excited
 about
 it,


especially
 when
 we've
 seen
 all
 these


momentum
 names
 take
 30
 to
 40%
 drops
 in


the
 past
 week.
 What
 if
 next
 week
 Beyond


Meeting
 is
 down
 30
 40%
 and
 so
 is
 Crispy


Cream
 and
 all
 these
 other
 names.
 Like


what
 if
 this
 is
 their
 15
 minutes
 of
 fame


and
 then
 they
 get
 hit?
 Like


yeah,
 I
 mean
 obviously
 if
 you
 have a


stop
 loss
 and
 you're
 trading
 it,
 that's


fine.
 Like
 that's
 that's
 a
 different


question,
 but
 like
 for
 the
 people
 that


want
 to
 buy
 it
 and
 just
 ride
 it
 to
 the


moon
 like
 and
 that
 kind
 of
 FOMO
 is
 how


they're
 playing
 with
 it.


I
 don't
 know.
 I
 don't
 know if
 I


necessarily
 feel
 that
 already.


And
 you
 don't
 have
 FOMO
 because
 you're


rich
 already.
 Okay,
 first
 of
 all,
 I'm


not
 rich.
 But
 second
 of
 all,
 I
 feel
 like


even
 if
 you
 were
 rich,
 like
 you
 still


have
 to
 protect
 your
 money,
 right?


Whatever
 amount
 of
 capital
 you
 have,


you're
 trying
 to
 protect
 it.
 It's
 not


about
 wanting
 to
 get
 rich
 or
 not
 getting


rich.
 It's
 about
 not
 wanting
 to
 lose
 any


money,
 no matter
 what
 the
 portfolio
 size


is.


And
 if
 you
 want
 to
 get
 rich,
 I
 mean,


like
 Beyond
 Meat,
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 that's


the
 way
 to
 get
 there.
 maybe
 at
 a
 dollar,


you
 know,
 but
 most
 people
 don't
 buy
 it


at
 the
 lows
 before
 it
 explodes.
 Most


people
 buy
 it
 at
 the
 top
 thinking


they're
 going
 to
 get
 rich
 and
 then
 it


doesn't
 end
 up
 playing
 out,
 right?


So,


I
 don't
 know
 if
 that's
 exactly
 the
 the


way
 you
 would
 think
 about
 it.


Nonetheless,
 still
 moving
 right
 here.


631
 on
 the
 day.
 What
 other
 macro
 news
 do


we
 have?
 Don't
 think
 we
 had
 the
 mortgage


rate
 stuff
 come
 in.
 Nabi
 is
 below
 100.


Are
 we
 actually
 below?
 I
 might
 get


assigned,
 guys.
 Nabi.
 Wow.
 They
 took
 it


down
 to
 99.


They
 really
 took
 Oh,
 we
 got
 the
 SEC


chair.
 He's
 talking
 about
 Beyond
 Meat.


He's
 talking
 about
 Beyond
 Meat.
 Let's


see.
 Let's
 see.
 Let's
 see


what
 he
 has
 to
 say.
 He's
 talking
 about
 a


bunch
 of
 things.
 And
 I
 think
 he's
 also


talking
 about
 Beyond
 Meat.
 Let's
 get


some
 of
 his
 thoughts.
 Damn,
 they
 really


took
 it
 below
 100


>> all
 the
 way
 till
 1955.
 Do
 is
 put
 out
 a


proposal
 and
 see
 comments
 on
 this
 and
 so


uh
 you
 know
 we
 look
 forward
 to
 doing


that.
 But
 there
 has
 been
 a
 lot
 of
 uh


academic
 study
 and
 and
 other
 sorts
 of


discussion
 over
 the
 last
 few
 decades
 as


to
 whether
 or
 not
 quarterly
 earnings
 uh


encourages
 a
 short-term
 uh
 mode
 of


thinking.
 So
 let's
 go
 see
 and
 and
 see


what
 the
 the
 commentary
 is.
 But
 I
 think


the
 market
 is
 the
 one
 to
 really
 decide


this
 ultimately
 and
 what
 investors
 want


and
 it
 may
 depend
 on
 the
 company
 and
 and


certainly
 smaller
 companies.
 We
 were


looking
 at
 this
 and


>> they're
 really
 going
 to
 get
 rid
 of


quarterly
 reports,
 dude.
 They're
 really


going
 to
 get
 rid
 of
 quarterly
 reports.


Let
 me
 get
 to
 the
 part
 about
 Beyond
 Meat


and
 then
 we'll
 get
 to
 the
 other
 stuff.


Okay.
 Right
 here.
 Let's
 see
 what
 he
 has


to
 say
 here.


>> Roundh
 ETF
 now.
 um
 what
 what
 what
 what


goes
 on
 in
 your
 mind
 or
 at
 the
 SEC
 when


you
 see
 crazy
 moves
 like
 this?


>> Well,
 you
 know,
 the
 market's
 going
 to
 do


what
 it's
 going
 to
 do
 and
 uh
 so
 people


can
 focus
 on
 things
 that
 they
 want
 to


invest
 in.
 What
 we're
 concerned
 about
 is


man
 manipulative
 behavior.
 And
 so
 here


even
 during
 the
 shutdown
 as
 we
 uh


conduct
 our
 surveillance
 of
 the


marketplace
 we
 have
 uh
 stopped
 trading


on
 eight
 uh
 foreign
 companies
 on
 NASDAQ


that
 showed
 uh
 indicia
 of
 uh


manipulative
 behavior
 ramp
 and
 dump
 we


call
 it.
 Um
 and
 so
 those
 have
 been
 shut


down.
 Uh
 so
 we
 are
 monitoring
 the
 market


for
 um
 uh
 the
 behavior
 that
 indicates
 uh


you
 know
 hanky
 panky
 going
 on
 in
 the


marketplace.
 So,
 you're
 you're
 high
 are


you
 high
 alert,
 heightened
 alert
 right


now
 that
 meme
 trading
 is
 is
 back
 on.


>> Well,
 I
 think
 we're
 we're
 doing
 our


normal
 surveillance
 and
 so
 we
 have
 uh


people
 who
 are
 devoted
 to
 that.
 That's


part
 of
 our
 law
 enforcement
 effort.


>> Dude,
 this
 guy
 does
 not
 care.
 Yeah,


there's
 some
 hanky
 panky
 going
 on
 in
 the


market.
 Dude,
 Paul
 Atkins
 doesn't
 give
 a


[ __ ]
 He
 This
 is
 Trump's
 SEC,
 folks.


This
 is
 Trump's
 SEC.
 He
 you
 can
 look
 at


him.
 He's
 like
 he's
 like,
 "Oh,
 cool.


There's
 some
 like
 he
 doesn't
 care.
 The


market's
 going
 to
 do
 what
 it's
 going
 to


do."
 That
 is
 his
 quote.
 Now,
 if
 this
 was


Gary
 Gendler,
 there
 would
 be
 a
 different


vibe.
 But
 Paul
 Atkins
 is
 like,
 "Well,


let
 people
 trade.
 If
 they
 want
 to
 trade,


they
 want
 to
 trade."
 Now,
 we'll
 get
 back


to
 him
 in
 a
 second.
 We
 do
 have
 the


entire
 market
 that's
 taking
 a
 pretty


ugly
 red
 candle
 right
 here.
 So,
 I'm


definitely
 getting
 assigned
 on
 this


Nebius
 98.
 I
 will
 be
 a
 shareholder
 on


Friday
 if
 this
 doesn't
 bounce.
 98.97


D-Wave
 10%
 down.
 Netflix
 9.4%.
 Tesla


down
 2%.
 S&P
 loses
 670.
 Hoodie


124
 low
 120s
 might
 be
 coming
 up.
 Nvidia


that's
 down
 half
 a
 percent.
 Oaklo
 down


13%


potentially
 losing
 120.
 AS
 just
 lost
 70.


Oh
 my.
 AS
 just
 lost
 70.
 SoFi


2750
 that's
 down
 4%.


Uh,
 Na'vi,
 that's
 down
 7%.
 Oracle,


that's
 down
 1%.
 Uber
 is
 down
 1%.
 Rocket


Lab's
 about
 to
 lose
 $60.
 Holy
 crap.


Rocket
 Lab
 down
 7%.


Is
 there
 a
 headline?


I
 don't
 see
 a
 headline.


Uh,


no.
 I
 don't
 see
 a
 headline,
 guys.
 I


don't
 see
 a
 Trump
 tweet
 either.
 I
 don't


see
 a
 Trump
 tweet.
 I
 don't
 see
 a


headline.
 Where?
 Wait,
 where's
 Beyond


Meat?
 If
 everything's
 tanking,
 where's


Beyond
 Meat?
 Is
 that
 still
 going
 up?


Oh
 my
 goodness.
 Beyond
 Meat
 is
 hitting


highs
 of
 days
 and
 the
 market's
 crashing.


Oh
 my
 goodness.


This
 is
 crazy,
 bro.
 This
 is
 stupid.
 This


is
 actually
 Beyond
 Meat
 733.


Everything
 else
 is
 dumping


Palanteer
 176.


Beyond
 is
 the
 safe
 haven.
 That's
 So


everyone's
 dumping
 their
 Hood,
 their


SoFi,
 their
 Rocket
 Lab,
 their
 Palunteer,


their
 Nvidia,
 their
 Amazon,
 Amazon
 217,


and
 they're
 buying
 Beyond
 Me
 750.
 Why


not?
 Why
 not
 750?


What
 about
 gold?
 Is
 gold
 still
 down
 on


the
 day?
 Gold.


Yeah,
 gold's
 low
 of
 the
 day,
 folks.


Well,
 not
 low
 of
 the
 day.
 It's
 just


above
 the
 low
 of
 the
 day.
 It's
 at
 4,50.


Low
 of
 the
 day
 was
 like
 420.
 But
 still


down.
 Silver
 as
 well.
 48.


That's
 still
 down
 as
 well.


This
 is
 kind
 of
 stupid,
 dude.
 This
 also


it's
 it's
 hard
 to
 rationalize
 because


all
 the
 momentum
 stocks
 like
 the


Oakloss,
 Quantum
 names,
 they're
 all


getting
 hit.
 But
 then
 you
 would
 think


Beyond
 Meat
 and
 Pelaton
 would
 get
 hit.


Those
 are
 green.
 But
 then
 you
 have
 the


important
 companies
 like
 Nvidia,
 Amazon


getting
 hit,
 but
 Beyond
 Meat's
 going


green.
 So,
 like
 if
 everything's
 getting


hit,
 you
 would
 think
 the
 momentum
 stocks


get
 hit
 pretty
 bad,
 which
 they
 are.
 But


then
 Beyond
 Meat
 and
 Pelaton
 are
 not.


Crispy
 Cream
 is
 still
 up
 26%.
 It's


almost
 like
 a
 select
 few
 meme
 stocks
 got


chosen
 to
 be
 the
 safe
 havens
 today.
 And


then
 everything
 else
 just
 gets
 hit.


Where
 is
 Bitcoin?
 Are
 we
 below
 107?


Bitcoin
 just
 below
 108,
 107.9.


Grab
 at
 548.
 Yeah,
 Grab's
 going
 to
 get


pulled
 down
 with
 the
 alos
 as
 well.


on
 a
 day
 like
 this.
 And
 then
 hood


getting
 hit
 124.


All right.
 Well,
 those
 who
 wanted
 low


120s,
 maybe
 we
 get
 it.
 Maybe
 we
 get
 it.


122
 would
 be
 that
 last
 level
 that
 we
 uh


that
 we
 hit
 on
 Friday
 last
 week
 in
 the


pre-markets.
 So,
 if
 we
 break
 that


could
 get
 a
 bit
 more
 dicey.
 Open
 down


10%.
 Amcor
 holding
 relatively
 strong
 on


a
 day
 like
 this
 above
 31,
 but
 that's


still
 red.
 Coreweave
 down
 5%
 as
 well.


BMR
 is
 probably
 getting
 wrecked
 right


now.
 BMR,
 there
 you
 go.
 4877.
 That's


down
 six.


That
 is
 down
 six.


Average
 on
 BMR
 is
 46.


46.


Well,
 look,
 I
 mean,
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the


day,


one
 could
 argue
 that
 it's
 healthy
 going


into
 Q3
 earnings.
 Now
 again,
 we
 did
 have


that
 draw
 down
 two
 weeks
 ago
 on
 Friday.


We
 recovered
 a
 decent
 chunk
 of
 that,
 but


some
 of
 those
 levels
 starting
 to
 get


tampered
 with
 again.
 And
 I
 I
 I
 think
 one


thing
 that
 the
 market
 has
 been
 very


transparent
 on
 is
 that
 they
 want
 to
 see


good
 earnings
 before
 they
 give
 you
 a


premium.
 And
 so
 a
 lot
 of
 these


companies,
 you
 know,
 they
 can
 regain


their
 premium,
 but
 they
 got
 to
 put
 up


good
 earnings.
 And
 I
 think
 that's
 okay,


especially
 if
 those
 companies
 have
 had


massive
 moves.
 Robinet
 is
 still
 up
 over


200%
 year
 to
 date.
 Nebas
 is
 still
 up


over
 200%
 year
 to
 date.
 like
 yeah
 it's


not
 up
 250%
 but
 that
 you
 just
 can't


complain
 about
 the
 price
 action
 given


how
 much
 it
 has
 continue
 to
 move
 beyond


meat
 still
 moving
 717


up
 97%


right
 now
 user
 reports
 indicate
 problems


with
 open
 AI
 okay
 so
 chatbt
 seems
 like


it's
 down


I
 don't
 know
 if
 that
 would
 be
 causing
 a


market
 crash
 but


that
 could
 be
 potentially
 So


momentum
 people
 getting
 margin
 called


and
 creating
 a
 cascading
 crash.
 Yeah,
 I


mean
 look,
 a
 lot
 of
 momentum
 stocks
 are


getting
 hit.
 So
 if
 you
 bought
 Oaklow
 at


190
 on
 margin,
 you
 know,
 121,
 it's
 it's


not
 the
 easiest
 to
 be
 able
 to
 navigate


that.


Now,
 having
 said
 that,
 I
 I
 the
 the
 the


only
 part
 of
 confusion
 here
 is
 I'm
 not


sure
 why
 this
 is
 happening,
 right?
 So


again,
 S&P
 down.3%
 of
 the
 day.
 Is
 that
 a


big
 deal?
 Not
 really,
 especially
 given


the
 recovery
 it's
 had
 from
 last
 week.


However,
 why?
 There's
 no
 reason
 why.


Nothing
 I
 can
 point
 to
 that.
 Which
 kind


of
 is
 bullish
 because
 if
 there's
 no


reason
 then
 it's
 just
 alos
 having
 fun
 on


a
 Wednesday
 doing
 whatever
 they
 do.


But
 if
 there
 was
 a
 reason
 we
 would
 have


a
 little bit
 more
 clarity.
 10:30
 slam.


This
 is
 a
 bit
 more
 of
 an
 aggressive


10:30
 slam
 than
 usual.


Usually
 it's
 like
 1%
 down
 on
 the
 S&P.


This
 one's
 getting
 an
 actual
 draw
 down


right
 there.
 Losing
 670.


But
 I
 don't
 see
 too
 much.
 So,
 let's
 go


back
 to
 the
 SEC
 chair
 and
 get
 his


thoughts
 on
 this
 meme
 stock
 stuff.


>> But
 we
 will
 continue
 to
 monitor
 and
 and


take
 the
 information
 that
 we
 collect


from
 the
 marketplace,
 analyze
 it,
 and


then
 make
 decisions
 based
 on
 that.


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 I
 guess
 what
 what
 do
 you


typically
 look
 for
 there?
 Is
 it
 is
 it


pump
 and
 dump?
 Is
 it
 is
 it
 not


disclosing
 information
 from
 people
 about


their
 positions?


Well,
 I
 mean
 the
 main
 thing
 is
 when


you're
 looking
 at
 trading,
 uh,
 you
 know,


if
 if
 there
 is
 like
 no
 news
 about
 a


company
 and
 then
 suddenly
 there's
 a
 ramp


up
 or
 a
 real
 pump
 up
 in
 the
 price
 that's


inexplicable,
 then
 we
 start
 looking
 at


that.
 That's
 one
 example.
 And
 then


others,
 you
 know,
 around
 announcements


of
 companies
 where
 there's
 anomalous


trading
 and
 and
 that
 sort
 of
 thing
 where


there's
 indications
 of
 leakage
 or


trading
 on
 inside
 information.
 And


that's
 another
 type
 of
 thing.
 So
 we
 have


a
 lot
 of
 different
 tools
 that
 we
 can
 use


to
 analyze
 this
 and
 we
 work
 closely
 with


the
 self-regulatory
 organizations,
 the


exchanges
 and
 so
 forth
 because
 they
 are


the
 immediate
 ones
 looking
 at
 their


markets
 and
 and
 uh
 doing
 surveillance


over
 that.


>> Whenever
 um
 whenever
 we
 we
 say
 that


we're
 going
 to
 interview
 you,
 always


hear
 from
 the
 crypto
 community.
 They're


very
 eager
 to
 get
 an
 update.
 I
 mean
 you


project
 crypto
 something
 you
 announced


and
 and
 you
 talked
 about
 on
 the
 show


where
 are
 you
 on
 that?
 Is
 there
 any
 is


there
 any
 hold
 up
 because
 of
 the


shutdown
 on
 some
 of
 the
 clarity
 and
 the


guidelines
 that
 you're
 going
 to
 be


giving
 and
 and
 how
 far
 can
 you
 go
 in


terms
 of
 bringing
 regulatory
 action
 and


clarity
 here
 without
 the
 passing
 of
 the


market
 structure
 bill
 which
 is
 stuck
 in


the
 Senate?


>> Well,
 first
 of
 all,
 I
 mean
 obviously
 the


shutdown
 does
 affect
 uh
 our
 work.
 uh
 you


know
 our
 our
 um
 our
 staff
 can't
 be


working
 um
 on
 developing
 uh
 proposals


and
 and
 some
 of
 the
 things
 that
 we
 want


to
 roll
 out
 hopefully
 by
 the
 year
 end
 of


the
 year
 and
 but
 you
 know
 if
 if
 uh
 if
 we


can
 if
 Congress
 can
 let
 us
 get
 back
 to


work
 uh
 that's
 uh
 you
 know
 what
 we're


looking
 for
 but
 uh
 so
 but
 but
 as
 far
 as


what
 our
 goals
 are
 we
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 uh


exemptive
 authority
 and
 other
 sorts
 of


authority
 that
 Congress
 has
 given
 us


over
 the
 years
 in
 the
 various
 securities


acts
 and
 we
 can
 use
 that
 to
 uh
 focus
 on


our
 rules
 and
 to
 try
 to
 make
 our
 rules


fit
 for
 purpose
 for
 this
 new
 technology


that
 has
 come
 about
 over
 the
 last
 uh
 uh


decade
 or
 so.


>> All
 right,
 so
 Paul
 Atkins
 doesn't
 really


care
 that
 much
 about
 the
 meme
 stocks.
 I


mean,
 you
 can
 even
 tell
 the
 way
 he's


talking
 about
 it.
 It's
 just
 he's
 saying


the
 market
 will
 do
 whatever
 the
 market


wants
 to
 do.
 Um
 but
 nonetheless,
 you
 are


seeing
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 get
 hit.
 Now,


you're
 getting
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 tiny


Vshape
 on
 some
 of
 these
 names.
 Very,


very,
 very
 tiny
 V.
 Uh,
 potentially


there's
 probably
 need
 at least
 another


10,
 20
 minutes
 to
 see
 if
 that
 is


actually
 the
 intraday
 bottom.
 But
 some


of
 these
 names
 relaxing
 a
 little
 bit
 and


we're
 going
 to
 see
 if
 they
 can
 move


higher.
 S&P
 uh
 6


668
 was
 the
 low
 back
 to
 669.40.


And
 yeah,
 I
 mean,
 and
 some
 of
 these
 draw


downs,
 not
 even
 that
 many
 pounds.
 You're


holding
 175.
 That's
 pretty
 damn
 good.


Down
 3%
 ugly,
 but
 175
 not.
 I
 mean,
 it


was
 at
 171
 last
 week
 when
 we
 had
 a


downturn.
 So,
 some
 of these
 levels
 still


have
 to
 be
 broken.
 Again,
 hood
 122.


That's
 the
 level
 you
 want
 to
 watch
 out


for.
 Nabius
 is
 Nabius
 did
 not
 see
 below


100
 last
 week.
 So,
 this
 is
 a
 new
 low
 for


Nebius
 over
 the
 past
 couple
 weeks.
 I


think
 the
 lowest
 it
 got
 to
 was
 like
 112,


right?
 So,
 Nebius
 is
 taking
 a
 hit
 right


there.


Um,


but


a
 lot
 of
 these
 other
 names
 holding
 on.


Bit
 mine
 right
 there
 4850.
 Bitcoin
 back


above
 108.
 That's
 good
 to
 see.
 Bitcoin


back
 above
 108
 and
 Ethereum


at
 3,800.


Bit
 make
 it
 stop.
 Unfortunately,
 I
 can't


make
 it
 stop,
 but


we
 can
 sit
 back
 and
 watch
 it
 happened


and
 hopefully
 it
 does
 stop.
 Beyond
 Meat


loses
 750,
 back
 down
 to
 680.


Dude,
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 see
 if


Beyond
 Meat
 actually


can
 take
 a
 tumble
 all
 the
 way
 back
 down,


but
 right
 now
 it's
 still
 holding
 it.


GSIT
 is
 up
 17%.
 This
 was
 the
 company


that
 put
 up
 that
 white
 paper
 about
 GPUs.


Like
 the
 fact
 that
 this
 is
 up,
 Beyond


Meat
 is
 up,
 Crispy
 Cream
 is
 up,


Pelaton's
 up,


is
 very
 weird,
 bro.
 Because
 the
 other


names
 like
 Oaklo,
 which
 just
 lost
 119,


15%
 down.
 It
 was
 down
 10%
 yesterday.
 So


that's
 a
 25%
 draw
 down.
 Like
 if
 Beyond


Meat
 is
 pumping,
 you
 would
 think
 Oak's


pumping,
 right?
 Theoretically,
 they're


in
 the
 same
 bucket.
 But
 like
 it's
 like


certain
 meme
 stocks
 get
 the
 move,


everything
 else
 gets
 hit,


which
 is
 just
 a
 weird
 way
 for
 a
 meme


stock
 rally
 to
 be
 commencing.


It's
 the
 last
 seasonal
 shakeout.
 Yeah,
 I


mean
 that
 that
 is
 also
 very
 possible.
 It


might
 end
 up
 just
 being
 one
 of
 those
 f


but
 but
 this
 seasonal
 shakeout
 could
 be


healthier
 because
 the
 shakeout
 is


in
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 momentum
 names
 that
 you


know
 don't
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 fundamentals


and
 so
 when
 things
 recover


you
 know
 the
 right
 names
 might
 end
 up


getting
 the
 recovery
 versus


some
 of these
 other
 names.
 Tesla
 right


here
 435
 and
 we
 got
 Tesla
 earnings


today.
 Dude,
 if
 this
 doesn't
 get
 fixed


by
 the
 market
 close,
 aka
 the
 markets


continue
 to
 be
 red,
 I
 mean
 Tesla's
 going


to
 have
 to
 put
 up
 some
 really
 good


earnings
 to
 avoid


more
 pain.


Where's
 the
 heat
 map?
 Let
 me
 pull
 up
 the


heat
 map.
 Um,


there
 is
 some
 green
 on
 this.
 There
 is


some
 green.


Defensives
 obviously
 green.
 Value
 stocks


are
 green.
 Healthcare
 is
 green.


Microsoft
 holding
 green
 and
 everything


else
 kind
 of
 getting
 hit.
 McDonald's
 is


green


because
 you
 know
 when
 things
 get
 bad,


people
 jump
 into
 a
 lot
 of
 those


defensive
 names.
 Healthcare
 probably.
 Is


UNH
 green?
 Are
 we
 getting
 UNH
 going


green?
 UNH?
 No.
 UNH
 is
 red,
 but
 it's
 not


as
 red
 as
 some
 of
 the
 other
 names.


Look,
 here's
 my
 take
 on
 this
 right
 now.


I
 don't
 think
 this
 is
 a
 uh
 this
 is
 a


short.
 I
 don't
 think
 this
 market
 is
 a


short.
 I
 especially
 because
 we
 don't


have
 a
 reason
 for
 why
 we're
 seeing
 this


red.
 I
 think
 this
 is
 just
 I
 I
 hate


saying
 this
 because
 people
 don't
 like


you
 know
 chalking
 it
 up
 to
 this
 excuse


but
 like
 I
 don't
 think
 there's
 another


reason.
 I
 think
 this
 is
 algos.
 Like


someone
 tell
 me
 why
 everything's
 going


down.
 Please
 give
 me
 a
 good
 reason
 that


actually
 makes
 sense.
 It's
 not
 China


stuff.
 It's
 not
 India's
 stuff.


I
 mean
 what
 is
 it
 like?
 It's
 it's
 it's


either
 deleveraging
 algos.


It's
 not
 Nvidia
 saying
 that
 we're
 going


to,
 you
 know,
 only
 grow
 10%
 next
 year.


Like,
 it's
 there's
 no
 headline
 that


could
 make
 you
 think,
 all
 right,
 this
 is


a
 short.


The
 government
 shutdown
 stuff.
 I
 don't


think
 the
 street
 cares
 that
 much
 about


that.
 Like,


it's
 a
 random
 Wednesday
 in
 October
 and


alos
 want
 to
 have
 some
 fun.
 October


tends
 to
 be
 volatile.
 You
 had
 a
 big
 move


yesterday.
 You
 had
 you
 almost
 had


freaking
 674
 on
 the
 S&P
 yesterday.


So,
 the
 market's
 taking
 that
 away.


That's
 669.
 I
 wonder
 how
 low
 it
 gets.
 Do


we
 actually
 get
 back
 to
 665,
 which
 we


were
 at
 last
 Friday,


but
 if
 we
 don't,
 then
 it's
 maybe
 staying


at
 these
 levels.


Vultures
 on
 Wall
 Street
 seeing
 us
 all


panic
 and
 picking
 up
 the
 bones


potentially.
 People
 getting
 margin
 call.


This
 could
 definitely
 be
 happening
 as


well


because
 of
 the
 NBA
 pre-market.
 Dude,
 who


won?
 Did
 the
 Lakers
 win?
 I
 didn't
 even


see
 the
 game.
 Oh,
 they
 lost.
 I
 should


have
 bet
 on
 the
 Warriors.
 I
 should
 have


bet.
 All right,
 there
 you
 go.
 Lakers


lost.
 Um,


uh,
 credit
 issues.
 I
 don't
 think
 the


private
 credit
 issue
 is
 that
 serious.


I
 really
 don't
 based
 on
 looking
 at
 a
 lot


of
 the
 regional
 bank
 earnings.


I
 mean,
 could
 it
 become
 serious?
 Maybe.


But
 so
 far
 it's
 Zions
 and
 Western


Alliance
 that
 announced
 a
 hundred


million
 dollar
 credit
 issue.
 Like
 that's


just
 not
 enough
 to
 cause
 a
 structural


problem
 with
 credit.


Again,
 it
 could
 turn
 into
 something,
 but


it
 it
 doesn't
 seem
 like
 we
 have
 enough


data
 to
 conclude
 that
 yet.
 S&P
 is


getting
 a
 new
 low
 of
 the
 day.
 668.95.


Hoodie


12375.
 So
 that
 one
 also
 a
 pretty


aggressive
 draw
 down
 6%.
 Grab
 down
 2%.


Beyond
 Meat
 still
 up
 91%.


And
 then
 Palanteer
 right
 here


down
 about
 3.65.


Fear
 and
 greed
 index.
 Where
 are
 we
 at
 on


that?


We
 are
 very
 close
 to
 extreme
 fear.


It's
 Nadella's
 Nadella's
 comments
 are


old
 though.


Like
 I
 I
 it's
 unless
 I'm
 looking
 at
 the


wrong
 comments,
 but
 that
 was
 from


yesterday.


like
 a
 lot
 of
 stuff
 that's
 just
 causing


people
 to
 sell
 right
 now
 or
 causing
 what


I
 think
 is
 alos
 to
 sell
 right
 now
 does


not
 feel
 like
 it's
 anything
 that's
 new


information.


Maybe
 it's
 Tesla
 earnings.
 The
 market's


scared
 about
 Tesla.


Granted,
 I
 don't know
 why
 the
 market


cares
 that
 much
 about
 Tesla.


I
 mean
 Tesla's
 important,
 but
 it's
 not


enough
 to
 cause
 a
 entire
 struggle.
 Like


Nvidia
 earnings
 matters
 way
 more
 than


Tesla
 obviously,
 right?
 So
 I
 don't
 know


why
 the
 market
 would
 be
 that
 scared


about
 that.
 Pounder
 174
 S&P
 66887.
 There


you
 go.
 3%
 draw
 down.
 Let's
 see
 if
 we


get
 if
 we
 can
 get
 to
 a
 half
 a
 percent


draw
 down.


That
 would
 be
 around
 665.


I
 don't
 think
 it's
 Netflix
 causing
 this.


Like
 Netflix,
 they
 they
 were
 isolated
 to


a
 Brazilian
 tax
 authority
 that
 created
 a


$700
 million
 fine
 which
 messed
 up
 their


operating
 margins.
 Like
 that's
 just
 not


emblematic
 of
 every
 big
 tech
 company


that's
 going
 to
 struggle
 in
 earnings.


I
 wish
 that
 didn't
 happen
 for
 Netflix


because
 it
 would
 have
 been
 nice
 to
 see


big
 tech
 kick
 up
 kick
 kickoff
 earnings


with
 a
 beat
 on
 EPS,
 but


I
 don't
 know if
 Netflix
 is
 enough
 to


hurt
 the
 broader
 market.
 The
 VIX
 call


expiration
 is
 a
 good
 point.
 Lots
 of


calls
 were
 bought
 in
 September
 and


they've
 got
 to
 push
 it
 back
 up
 to
 get


some
 money
 back.
 That
 is
 fair.
 You
 do


have
 a
 lot
 of


VIX
 option
 trading.
 VIX
 right
 there
 up


7%
 that
 probably
 need
 to
 get
 in
 the


money
 which
 means
 you
 probably
 need
 the


market
 to
 take
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 hit.


Um,


US
 East
 Coast
 refinery
 increased
 last


week
 to
 its
 highest
 level
 since
 January


2023,
 says
 Energy
 Information


Administration.


Okay,
 that's
 bullish.
 Also,
 uh,
 Trump


announced
 yesterday
 they're
 going
 to
 be


buying


uh
 a
 million
 barrels
 for
 the
 strategic


oil
 reserves,
 which
 is
 also
 super


bullish.
 And
 they
 should
 be,
 by
 the
 way,


the
 average
 price
 of
 oil
 or
 gas
 in
 this


country,
 uh
 $2.98.


$2.98.
 So
 gas
 prices
 are
 coming
 down


dramatically.
 Now,
 if
 you
 live
 in
 like


California
 or
 something,
 it's
 probably


not
 coming
 down
 quick
 enough,
 but
 you


are
 getting
 oil
 prices
 to
 start
 coming


down.
 That
 makes
 sense
 given
 WTI
 crude's


below
 uh
 60.


But
 the
 question
 is,
 you
 know,
 is
 that


sustainable
 to
 the
 downturn?
 Trump
 said


he
 wants
 to
 get
 them
 below
 $2
 a
 gallon.


I
 don't
 know if
 we
 get
 that
 cheap,


but
 he
 does
 want
 to
 get
 there.
 S&P


continuing
 to
 just
 have
 a
 red
 candle.
 No


signs
 of
 stopping
 yet.
 And
 as
 a
 result,


everything
 likely
 will
 follow.
 S&P


668.881.


You're
 really
 not
 seeing
 any
 level
 of


intraday
 reversal
 yet.


So
 now
 it's
 a
 game
 of
 how
 low
 does
 she


go?


How
 low
 does
 she
 go?


Um


Nabi
 is
 below
 98.
 All right,
 folks.


Congratulations
 to
 me.
 If
 this
 doesn't


change
 by
 Friday,


I
 will
 be.
 Dude,
 I
 wrote
 my
 puts
 when
 he


was
 at
 110.
 I
 was
 like
 98
 in
 four
 days.


I
 was
 like,
 really?
 Well,
 here
 you
 go.


Here
 it
 is.
 Nate
 will
 finally
 be
 happy.


Nate
 will
 finally
 be
 happy.
 There
 you


go.


9705
 right
 there
 on
 Nebus.


That's
 lost
 a
 decent
 chunk
 of
 the
 move.


I
 really
 didn't
 think
 it
 would
 go
 below


100.
 I
 mean,
 I
 didn't
 think
 it
 deserved


140,
 but
 I
 didn't
 think
 it
 was
 going
 to


go
 below
 100.
 But
 there
 you
 go.
 That's


where
 we're
 at.
 S&P
 continues
 to
 get


hit.
 All right.
 So,
 now
 it's
 just
 a


waterfall,
 whether
 it's
 filling
 a
 gap,


whether
 it's
 doing
 something
 technical.


I
 mean,
 I'm
 just
 reacting
 to
 seeing
 the


red
 candles
 themselves.
 66835
 continues


to
 just
 go
 down,
 which
 means
 everything


is
 going
 to
 follow
 with
 it.
 Hoodie


122.95.
 Got
 99
 cents
 away,
 95
 cents
 away


from
 potentially
 breaking
 122.
 D-Wave


12%.


That
 one's
 getting
 wrecked.
 ESTs
 down


12%.
 That's
 getting
 wrecked.
 SoFi,
 SoFi


should
 not
 be
 down
 5%,
 but
 SoFi
 is


getting
 hit.
 Nvidia
 loses
 180.
 I
 mean,


tell
 me
 this
 is
 not
 ALOS,
 bro.
 182
 20


minutes
 ago
 with
 a
 deal
 with
 the


Dominican
 Republic
 and
 now
 179
 for
 what?


Like
 for
 nothing
 other
 than
 well,
 the


S&P
 is
 down.
 Nvidia
 is
 a
 big
 chart
 of


the
 S&P
 and
 as
 a
 result
 everything's


going
 to
 fall
 with
 the
 S&P.
 But
 then
 the


question
 is,
 why
 is
 the
 S&P
 down?
 It's


like,
 well,
 I
 can't
 give
 you
 a
 reason


for
 that
 because
 I
 I
 don't
 see
 a
 reason.


So,
 I
 think
 your
 best
 reason
 is
 alos,


which
 is
 an
 annoying
 reason,
 but


nonetheless,
 I
 think
 that
 is
 the
 reason.


Amazon
 217,
 AMD
 down
 3%.


All
 right,
 AMD
 falling
 with
 everything


else.
 Palunteer
 down
 four
 17360.


Meta
 is
 actually
 doing
 pretty
 good


today,
 holding
 730.
 Last
 time
 we
 had


this
 type
 of
 move,
 Meta
 was
 closer
 to


705.
 So,
 Meta
 is
 holding
 up.
 Rock
 Lab


looks
 like
 it
 wants
 to
 lose
 60
 60.75


and
 at
 the
 same
 time
 Beyond
 Meat
 is


holding
 an
 83%
 move
 today.


>> Do
 you
 think
 Grab
 can
 short
 squeeze?
 No.


I
 I
 think
 like
 there
 the
 short
 float
 is


not
 high
 enough
 for
 it
 to
 be
 a
 squeeze.


I
 think
 the
 shorts
 can
 cover
 if
 they
 put


up
 a
 really
 good
 earnings,
 but
 I
 don't


think
 there
 could
 be
 a
 squeeze
 because


there's
 just
 not
 that
 much
 of
 a
 short


flow.
 Like
 it's
 there's
 no
 way
 a
 Beyond


Meat
 could
 happen
 on
 a
 company
 like
 RAP.


Um,
 but
 I
 do
 think
 we
 can
 have
 good


earnings
 and
 you
 know
 that
 can
 change


the
 perception
 that
 the
 shorts
 have.


But
 some
 of
 these
 names
 that
 are
 30
 40%


shorted.
 That's
 why
 they're
 getting
 a


bigger
 squeeze.
 S&P
 continues
 to
 go


lower.


66840.
 It
 touched
 66809.


It
 looks
 like
 it
 wants
 to
 lose
 668
 and


then
 we're
 into
 the
 levels
 we
 saw
 last


week.


Um,


yeah,
 I
 do
 agree.
 It
 at
 least
 gets
 you
 a


good
 setup
 for
 next
 week
 earnings.
 And


again,
 it's
 easier
 for
 SoFi
 to
 run
 if


it's
 at
 26
 or
 27
 than
 if
 it's
 at
 30.
 And


then
 to
 hold
 that
 run
 after
 a
 good


earnings
 is
 easier
 if
 it's
 not
 running


from
 such
 a
 high
 level.
 I
 mean,
 that
 is


the
 bright
 side
 to
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 names


that
 get
 hit
 before


before
 they
 get
 into
 earnings.


It's
 tax
 laws
 harvesting
 today.
 Yeah.
 I


mean,
 there
 are
 some
 people
 that
 um
 that


just
 paid
 their
 their
 quarterly
 taxes
 as


well.
 And
 and
 actually
 October
 is
 when
 a


lot
 of
 people
 that
 push
 out
 their


quarterly
 taxes


end
 up
 paying
 it
 towards
 the
 end
 of


usually
 it's
 in
 September,
 but
 you
 know,


a
 lot
 of
 people
 that
 just
 need
 that


extra
 month
 to
 to
 file
 it.
 You
 could


have
 some
 people
 just
 selling
 to
 to


freaking
 pay
 their
 tax.
 I
 mean,
 dude,


the
 IRS
 like
 two
 weeks
 ago,
 they
 sent
 me


a
 letter.
 They're
 like,
 "Yo,
 it's


4,000."


And
 I'm
 like,
 "No,
 I
 don't
 like
 I
 don't


know."
 So,
 I
 call
 them
 up
 and
 no
 one


answers.
 You
 go
 through
 all
 these
 AI


automated
 assistants.
 I'm
 like,
 "Dude."


And
 then
 I
 get
 another
 message
 from
 them


a
 week
 later.
 They're
 like, "We
 will


leave
 Levi
 or
 levy
 we
 will
 levy
 your


assets
 if
 you
 don't
 pay
 us
 this
 4,000."


And
 I'm
 like,


"Okay,
 I
 guess
 I'm
 going
 to
 pay
 you
 this


4,000.
 So,
 there
 you
 go.
 Take
 the


4,000."
 I
 was
 just
 like, "All
 right,


bro.
 Whatever."
 I
 like
 whatever,
 dude.


Take
 the
 four.
 I
 don't
 know
 why
 I'm


paying
 an
 extra
 4,000.
 I
 have
 no
 none
 of


you
 guys
 can
 explain
 why,
 but
 here
 you


go.
 Like,
 don't
 don't
 send
 me
 to
 jail.


How
 do
 you
 say
 it?
 It's
 Levy
 or
 Levi?


How
 do
 you
 say
 this
 [ __ ]
 It's
 Levi,


right?


No,
 it's
 Levy.


We
 will
 gan
 your
 assets.


We
 will
 gene
 your
 No,
 it's
 not
 fake,


dude.
 It's
 No,
 no,
 no,
 no,
 no.
 It's
 from


like
 when
 you
 sign
 in
 to
 the
 IRS


website,
 id.mme,
 like
 that
 type
 of


notification
 from
 the
 actual
 IRS.
 This


is
 not
 some
 text
 message
 from
 some


scammer.
 Like
 no,
 I
 went
 to
 the
 actual


IRS.gov,


paid
 my
 freaking
 taxes,


but
 like
 like
 I
 look,
 I
 have a
 pretty


good
 accountant.
 I
 don't
 think
 I
 needed


to
 pay
 that
 4,000.
 But
 then
 you
 try
 to


call
 and
 by
 the
 way,
 this
 happened
 a


year
 this
 happened
 in
 2023.
 They
 said
 I


owed
 10,000
 and
 I
 called
 them
 up
 and


they
 they
 redid
 it
 and
 they're
 like,
 "Oh


yeah,
 you're
 good.
 you
 don't
 know


10,000.
 So
 I'm
 like,
 okay,
 let
 me
 call


them
 up.
 And
 then
 I'm
 on
 the
 phone
 for


three
 hours.
 I'm
 like,
 dude,
 I
 don't


have
 the
 time
 for
 this.
 Like,
 I
 cannot


like
 you
 just
 try
 to
 get
 through
 an


assistant
 and
 AI
 bot.
 And
 I'm
 like,


dude,
 forget
 it.
 Just
 take
 the
 freaking


money.
 Like,
 at
 this
 point,
 whatever.


I
 don't
 want
 you
 guys
 to
 leave
 my
 assets


at
 this
 point.


It's
 the
 worst.
 like
 for
 a
 company
 for
 a


country
 that
 has
 the
 most
 you
 know


technological
 uh
 ecosystem
 and


infrastructure
 the
 fact
 that
 the
 IRS
 we


can't
 call
 representatives


is
 insane.


What
 cash
 put
 can
 I
 sell
 to
 make
 4,000?


That
 was
 exactly
 it.
 That
 was
 exactly


it.
 No,
 I
 I
 think
 I
 I
 think
 I
 did
 owe
 it


though.
 I
 just
 wanted
 some
 more
 clarity.


The
 thing
 is
 like
 sometime
 this
 happened


back
 in
 2022
 as
 well.
 Robin
 had
 uh
 like


delayed
 some
 of
 their
 crypto
 reports
 to


the
 IRS
 back
 in
 22
 and
 I
 actually
 I


actually
 traded
 Ethereum
 pretty
 well.
 I


made
 like
 five
 six
 grand
 on
 Ethereum


back
 in
 2021.
 So
 in
 22
 they
 delayed
 the


reports.
 So
 then
 in
 23
 they
 called
 me
 up


and
 I
 was
 like
 oh
 yeah
 I
 did
 I
 do
 have


some
 capital
 gains
 that
 I
 didn't
 pay


taxes
 on.


But
 like
 the
 point
 is
 like
 the
 whole


reason
 I
 got
 into
 this
 because
 there


might
 be
 some
 people
 that
 have
 to
 pay


more
 taxes
 especially
 their
 quarterly


taxes
 and
 as
 a
 result
 you
 know
 they


might
 have
 to
 sell
 some
 stocks.
 We
 are


getting
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 Vshape
 right


here.
 So
 you
 have
 pounder
 173
 to
 174.


S&P
 668
 to
 669.


You're
 getting
 a
 little
 something
 right


there.
 Those
 are
 those
 four
 green


candles.
 Hoodie
 122
 to
 124.


Little
 green
 right
 there
 as
 well.
 Uh


SoFi
 we
 were
 at
 27.
 We're
 at
 2723.


Little
 bit
 of
 green


that's
 coming
 in.


That's
 coming
 in.


Um,


Beyond
 Meat
 is
 that
 one.
 Well,
 this
 one


was
 already
 up.
 That
 one's
 just
 going


higher
 because
 why
 not?
 That's
 just


going
 back
 to
 where
 it
 was.
 Nvidia
 also


180.


There
 you
 go.
 180.
 17920.
 Yeah.
 Guys,


come
 on.
 Tell
 me
 this
 was
 not
 ALOS.
 And


tell
 me
 this
 is
 not
 ALOS
 on
 the
 recovery


if
 this
 ends
 up
 being
 an
 actual


recovery.
 Right
 now
 it's
 a
 very
 tiny


Vshape.


Like
 tell
 me
 this
 was
 absolutely
 not


ALOS.


And
 when
 that
 happens
 you
 just
 got
 to


live
 through
 it.
 Like
 sure
 you
 can
 buy


the
 dip
 or
 you
 can
 also
 just
 look
 at
 it


and
 be
 like
 all
 right
 whatever.
 Like
 it


is
 what
 it
 is.


Nebius
 right
 back
 up
 to
 98
 from
 9689.


Poly
 market
 to
 act
 as
 draft
 kings


clearing
 house
 as
 they
 enter
 prediction


market
 space.
 Wow.
 I
 think
 this
 is
 why


poly
 market
 got
 that
 $10
 billion


valuation.
 Dude,
 it
 feels
 like
 uh
 they


are
 going
 to
 be
 a
 very
 important
 piece


of
 infrastructure
 for
 a
 lot
 of
 these


prediction
 markets.


I
 don't
 know
 their
 revenues.
 I
 don't


think
 poly
 market
 or
 cost
 should
 make
 a


lot
 of
 revenue.
 I
 mean
 they
 make
 a
 lot


of
 they
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 trading
 volume
 but


like
 does
 that
 result
 in
 actual
 profits?


I
 mean
 it's
 very
 very
 you
 know
 they
 have


like
 a
 penny
 of
 revenue
 that
 they
 make


on
 every
 trade.
 Now
 granted
 they


shouldn't
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 costs
 so
 they


should
 be
 more
 profitable
 than
 not


but
 I
 would
 argue
 you
 know510
 billion


dollar
 valuations
 are
 probably


aggressive
 but
 if
 they
 start
 acting
 as


infrastructure
 for
 a
 lot
 of
 other


companies
 in
 the
 prediction
 market
 space


I
 mean
 I
 think
 the
 easiest
 way
 that
 poly


market
 and
 call
 she
 can
 monetize
 is
 they


go
 to
 hedge
 funds
 and
 they
 sell
 them
 an


API
 and
 those
 hedge
 funds
 pay
 you
 know


whatever
 20
 $40,000
 a
 year
 for
 a
 license


uh
 to
 access
 like
 real-time
 prediction


markets
 data
 around
 stocks.
 That's


probably
 another
 useful
 tool
 that
 a
 lot


of
 hedge
 funds
 can
 use
 for
 data.


So
 feel
 like
 that's
 another
 way
 they
 can


expand
 their
 business
 as
 well.


Okay.
 It's
 levy.
 It's
 not
 Levi.


It's
 levy.


We
 will
 levy
 your
 assets
 if
 you
 don't


pay
 us
 this
 money.
 I
 was
 like,
 "All


right,
 bro.
 Whatever.


Whatever."
 It's
 the
 awesome
 thing
 about


the
 government.
 They
 can
 just
 throw
 you


in
 jail
 if
 you
 don't
 pay
 your
 taxes.


Dude,
 the
 SEC
 chair
 literally
 said,
 "We


don't
 care
 about
 Hanky
 Panky,
 bro."


Doesn't
 hanky
 panky
 mean
 something
 else?


like


yeah
 hanky
 panky
 if
 I'm
 not
 wrong
 and


based
 on
 what
 I'm
 looking
 at
 on
 Gemini


right
 here
 hanky
 panky
 does
 not


necessarily
 mean
 uh
 uh
 miscellaneous


activity
 in
 in
 the
 broader
 markets


means
 something
 a
 little
 different


means
 something
 a
 little
 different
 uh


let's
 get
 some
 coverage
 on
 Netflix
 and


then
 we'll
 keep
 going
 from
 there


>> here
 to
 break
 things
 down
 is
 loop


capital
 markets
 Managing
 director
 Alan


Gould
 has
 a
 buy
 rating
 a
 target
 of
 1325.


We
 were
 just
 chatting
 about
 it
 during


the
 break.
 You
 want
 to
 explain
 the


Brazilian
 thing
 first?
 Sure.
 So
 there


was
 a
 Brazilian
 tax
 issue.
 It
 had
 been


disclosed
 in
 previous
 10
 case
 and
 10


cues.
 It
 didn't
 seem
 like
 a
 big
 deal.


There
 was
 a
 Supreme
 Court
 Brazilian


Supreme
 Court
 case
 in
 August
 with


another
 company
 uh
 where
 the
 ruling


where
 the
 company
 lost
 and
 Netflix


decided
 they
 now
 had
 to
 take
 a
 reserve


for
 this.
 I
 think
 it's
 really
 a


non-issue.
 I
 think
 the
 reason
 that
 the


stock
 is
 down
 is
 because
 they
 just
 hit


revenue,
 didn't
 beat
 revenue.
 Netflix


typically
 beats
 revenue.
 Content
 was


great
 this
 quarter.
 They
 knew
 they
 had


great
 content.
 Then
 throw
 on
 top
 of
 that


K-pop
 Demon
 Hunters,
 but
 remember
 their


their
 halfyear
 engagement
 report,
 they


put
 out
 16,000
 titles
 every
 six
 months.


So,
 no
 one
 title
 is
 really
 going
 to
 make


a
 huge
 difference
 here.
 But
 historically


they've
 beaten
 revenue
 by
 almost
 half
 a


percent.
 Over
 guidance.
 This
 quarter
 was


a
 great
 quarter.
 The
 Neielson
 data
 on


the
 gauge
 was
 strong
 showing
 their


market
 share.
 The
 barb
 data
 in
 the
 UK


their
 market
 share
 was
 strong
 and
 they


just
 hit
 the
 number.
 So,
 I
 think
 the


street
 was
 a
 a
 little
 bit
 frustrated


that
 they
 didn't
 beat
 the
 whisper
 number


was
 higher
 and
 b
 I
 think
 that
 the


commentary
 on
 the
 potential
 Warner


Brothers
 discovery.
 Um
 Ted
 was
 a
 lot


more
 nuanced
 Ted
 Ted
 Sarandos
 than
 Greg


Peters
 was
 a
 week
 ago
 at
 the
 uh


Bloomberg
 conference.
 So,
 I
 think
 those


are
 the
 two
 issues
 driving
 the
 stock.


>> Yeah,
 we
 used
 Sarin
 Sarandos's
 comments


earlier.
 Um
 Allan,
 you
 know,
 from
 your


perspective,
 I
 mean,
 again,
 I
 can
 give


you
 my
 reporting,
 which
 is
 well,
 they


the
 studio
 and
 the
 library
 certainly


would
 be
 of
 value
 to
 Netflix.
 Not
 clear


what
 they
 would
 actually
 do
 with
 the


HBO.


>> Gold's
 down
 2%,
 folks.
 Look
 at
 that.


This
 is
 the
 low
 of
 day.
 Gold
 is
 13
 bucks


away
 from
 losing
 4,000.


That
 is
 actually
 a
 pretty
 aggressive


move
 on
 gold
 as
 the
 S&P
 tries
 to
 recover


here,
 but
 gold
 continuing


to
 uh
 to
 get
 hit.
 So,
 that
 one's
 still


down.
 Let's
 get
 some
 coverage
 on
 Applied


Digital.
 I
 know
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 are
 in


this
 one.
 And
 let's
 see
 if
 we
 can
 get


some
 updates
 on
 how
 this
 one
 is
 doing.


Rest
 of
 the
 market


still
 red,
 but
 just
 not
 as
 red.
 S&P


almost
 back
 to
 670,
 6694.


Still
 down.
 2%
 but
 you're
 getting


getting
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 V
 right
 there.

 of
 the


companies
 that
 we
 target.
 There's
 really


only
 five
 in
 the
 US
 and
 no
 particular


order
 is
 Microsoft
 Meta,
 Oracle,
 Amazon


and
 Google.
 And
 so
 that's
 really
 who


we're
 targeting,
 but
 in
 this
 instance,


uh,
 we
 weren't
 able
 to
 say
 who
 it
 was.


>> Understood.
 Uh,
 and
 right.
 So
 we
 can


pick
 and
 ch,
 we
 can
 guess
 from
 those


five,
 of
 course.
 Right.
 Either
 way,


they're
 good
 for
 the
 money,
 which
 is


obviously
 what's
 important
 or
 at least


the
 lease
 payments,
 I
 would
 assume.


Polaris
 one
 is
 up
 and
 running.
 This
 is


Polaris
 2,
 correct?
 Uh,
 so
 900
 acres


initially,
 what,
 200
 megawws
 phase
 with


two
 buildings.
 I
 mean,
 what
 gives
 you


the
 confidence
 you
 can
 build
 it
 so


quickly?
 So
 we
 we
 started
 down
 this
 path


a
 couple
 of
 years
 ago
 and
 we
 you
 know
 we


stubbed
 our
 toe
 a
 few
 times
 but
 I
 think


we've
 really
 dialed
 in
 the
 process
 of


the
 ability
 to
 build
 at
 scale.
 We
 have


700
 megawatts
 of
 critical
 IT
 load


currently
 under
 construction.
 Uh
 part
 of


that
 is
 to
 go
 into
 operation
 actually


later
 this
 week
 and
 then
 over
 the
 next


18
 months.
 And
 the
 goal
 is
 to
 just


continue
 to
 grow
 that
 number
 of


megawatts
 under
 construction
 and
 then
 we


deliver
 we
 have a
 4
 gawatt
 active


pipeline
 uh
 other
 campuses
 negotiating


with
 other
 of
 these
 similar
 hyperscalers


on
 those
 campuses.
 So
 we
 think
 we
 have
 a


lot
 of
 momentum
 in
 the
 business.
 We've


dialed
 in
 the
 construction
 process
 which


is
 very
 difficult
 to
 do.
 We've
 secured


the
 supply
 chain.
 We
 have
 the
 power.
 We


have
 a
 new
 capital
 partnership
 with


Mcquaryi.
 And
 so
 we
 we've
 put
 all
 the


pillars
 in
 place
 to
 actually
 go
 and


execute
 this
 at
 at
 large
 scale
 really


rapidly.


>> And
 the
 capital
 partnership,


>> this
 guy
 has
 a
 tan.


This
 guy
 has
 a
 freaking
 tan.
 So
 nice
 to


see
 on
 Applied
 Digital.
 I've
 never
 heard


the
 CEO
 talk
 before,
 but
 again,
 they
 did


get
 a
 pretty
 big
 deal
 this
 morning.
 5


billion
 bucks.
 They
 have
 not
 disclosed


with
 what
 hyperscalers
 they
 work
 with.


They
 do
 have
 that
 core
 reweave
 deal
 from


June
 which
 was
 also
 pretty
 big
 for
 them.


Up
 three
 or
 down
 3%
 still
 on
 the
 day.
 Uh


again
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 hyperscaler
 uh


subleasasing
 contracts
 continue
 to
 be


strong.
 Meta
 $27
 billion
 deal
 in
 um
 I


believe
 it's
 in
 Louisiana
 if
 I'm
 not


wrong.
 and
 Black
 Rockck
 ETFs
 are
 owning


about
 20%
 of
 the
 bonds
 that
 are
 being


used
 to
 finance
 the
 meta
 infrastructure


buildup
 for
 for
 27
 billion.
 I
 think
 it's


about
 20%
 is
 being
 funded
 by
 Black


Rockck.
 So,
 you're
 starting
 to
 see
 more


and
 more
 of
 these
 financial
 institutions


come
 in
 and
 say,
 "We
 want
 to
 finance


this
 because
 we
 think
 there
 is
 going
 to


be
 a
 meaningful
 ROI
 across
 board."
 S&P


back
 to
 670.


Back
 to
 670.
 There
 you
 go.


Hoodie
 back
 to
 125.
 Grab
 back
 to
 550.


Oaklow
 back
 to
 123
 from
 118.
 So
 even
 the


momentum
 stocks
 getting
 a
 little
 bit
 of


a
 V,
 which
 is
 inevitable.
 Again,
 this
 is


what
 ALOS
 do,
 right?
 Everything
 goes
 up,


everything
 goes
 down.
 Some
 things
 go
 up


or
 down
 at
 a
 higher
 delta,
 but


nonetheless,
 when
 when
 the
 ALOS
 take


over,
 everything
 moves
 usually
 in
 one


direction.
 Bitcoin
 109,
 that
 was
 at


107.9
 10
 minutes
 ago.
 D-Wave
 even
 got
 a


bounce
 up
 to
 29.
 ESTs
 right
 there.
 Uh
 it


was
 at
 67
 now
 at
 69.
 Oracle
 was
 at
 270


now
 at
 272.
 SoFi
 was
 at
 27
 now
 at
 27.40.


And
 then
 Nvidia
 179
 to
 180.


We
 talked
 about
 the
 India
 US
 trade
 deal


in
 the
 morning.
 I
 mean
 that's
 not


confirmed
 but
 uh
 yes
 that
 is
 nice
 to
 see


if
 we
 could
 actually
 get
 a
 deal
 with


them
 and
 the
 tariffs
 could
 go
 down
 from


50%
 to
 uh
 15%
 as
 was
 rumored.
 But


hopefully
 in
 the
 coming
 weeks
 we
 get
 a


deal
 on
 that.
 Meta
 goes
 green
 734.93


as
 well
 for
 Meta.


Uh
 Douggee,
 thank
 you
 for
 the
 five


gifted.
 I'm
 just
 seeing
 this.
 Thank
 you


Douggee
 for
 the
 five
 gifted
 memberships


and
 again
 congrats
 on
 the
 gains
 on


D-Wave.
 Azure,
 thanks
 for
 the
 super


chat.
 Why
 is
 retail
 not
 trying
 to


squeeze
 him
 with
 40%
 short
 interest?


Your
 bet
 is
 as
 good
 as
 mine.
 I
 don't


know
 why
 retail
 is
 squeezing
 Beyond


Meat,
 which
 doesn't
 really
 have
 as
 many


fundamentals
 as
 HIMS,
 but
 it's
 it's
 what


people
 want
 to
 choose.
 I
 mean,
 HIMS


might
 not
 be
 as
 fun
 as
 a
 Beyond
 Meat.


Beyond
 Meat,
 right,
 they're
 up
 83%.


I
 don't know.
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 people


that
 have
 been
 waiting
 for
 a
 HIMYM


squeeze.
 It's
 like
 sometimes
 these


squeezes
 have
 to
 be
 organic,
 right?
 They


have
 to
 happen
 based
 on
 the
 spur
 of
 the


moment.
 And
 maybe
 that
 happens
 to
 HIMS


one
 day,
 but
 you
 know,
 HIMS
 is
 still


also
 up
 a
 lot
 this
 year.


I
 don't know,
 maybe
 they
 have
 to
 put
 up


a
 really
 good
 quarter.
 Maybe
 they
 have


to
 figure
 out
 the
 lawsuit
 with
 Novo.


They
 have
 to
 do
 something
 that
 creates


that
 catalyst.
 Until
 then,
 it's
 tough.


Also,
 you
 know,
 a
 lot
 of these
 squeezes


that
 happen
 on
 these
 meme
 stocks,
 they


happen
 for
 no
 reason.
 So,
 a
 HIMYM


squeeze
 would
 be
 logical
 because
 it


shouldn't
 be
 40%
 short.
 A
 Beyond
 Meat


squeeze
 is
 not
 logical,
 but
 that's
 the


the
 fun
 of
 it,
 I
 guess,
 that
 it's
 not


logical.
 It
 makes
 no
 sense,
 and
 that's


why
 people
 kind
 of
 pile
 into
 the
 trade


at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day.


Google,
 we
 have
 some
 Google
 news.
 Oh,


Google
 unveils
 quantum
 computing


breakthrough
 with
 Willow
 Chip.


Google
 getting
 some
 love
 right
 there.
 Uh


let's
 see
 if
 we
 can
 get
 any
 coverage
 on


this.
 We
 I
 played
 the
 qu
 uh
 the
 clip
 of


Sundar
 talking
 about
 quantum


the
 other
 day.


Google's
 breakthrough
 quantum
 echoes


algorithm
 pushes
 us
 closer
 to
 useful


quantum
 computing
 running
 13,000
 times


faster
 than
 on
 a
 supercomput.
 The
 new


quantum
 computing
 algorithm
 called


quantum
 echoes
 is
 the
 first
 that
 can
 be


independently
 verified
 by
 running
 it
 on


another
 quantum
 computer.


Okay,
 so
 Google
 getting
 some
 love
 right


there.
 Uh
 the
 quantum
 stocks
 not
 really


moving
 that
 heavily.
 I
 don't
 know
 if


it's
 bearish
 for
 the
 quantum
 stocks


because
 it
 means
 Google's
 going
 to
 win


or
 if
 it's
 bullish
 because
 it's


validating
 their
 industry.
 It's
 kind
 of


one
 or
 the
 other
 and
 the
 market
 will


kind
 of
 tell
 us
 right
 here.
 But
 they're


still
 down
 7
 to
 10%
 on
 the
 day.
 Maybe


this
 Google
 News
 is
 not
 fully
 hitting


the
 newswire
 yet,
 but
 Google
 is
 green
 at


255.


So
 that's
 what
 you
 got
 on
 the
 Googs.


No,
 I
 did
 not
 buy.
 So
 guy,
 why
 does


everyone
 want
 me
 to
 buy
 SoFi
 so
 badly,


bro?
 Why
 is
 like
 I
 did
 not
 buy
 SoFi.


Told
 you
 guys
 2650.
 That's
 what
 I'm


looking
 for.
 If
 we
 don't
 get
 it,
 then


who
 cares?
 I'll
 sell
 some
 puts.


Or
 is
 everyone
 convinced
 SoFi
 is
 going


to
 35?
 Is
 everyone
 convinced
 it's


happening?


And
 that's
 why
 they
 think
 you
 got
 to
 get


in


so
 we
 can
 be
 friends.


[Music]


I
 don't
 know.
 We'll
 see,
 bro.
 We'll
 see.


We
 still
 got
 a
 couple
 days.
 We'll
 see.


Going
 into
 earnings
 how
 this
 plays
 out.


Uh
 Nvidia
 180,
 SoFi
 2735.


AMD
 still
 down
 2%.
 Then
 Nebius


recovering
 up
 from
 98.
 Maybe
 I
 don't
 get


a
 sign
 on
 that.
 Put
 9953.


Sell
 all
 of
 Grab
 and
 move
 it
 into
 SoFi


just
 for
 this
 earnings.


You
 know,
 SoFi
 earnings
 is
 before
 grabb


earnings.
 Theoretically,
 I
 could
 do


that.
 And
 if
 SoFi
 goes
 to
 the
 moon,
 we


could
 take
 some
 profits
 and
 buy
 more


Grab.
 That
 could
 happen.


It's
 kind
 of
 worrying
 me
 though
 that


everyone's
 so
 excited,
 bro.
 If
 everyone


thinks
 it's
 going
 to
 go
 up,
 I
 don't


know.
 Like,
 it
 seems
 like
 no
 one's


worried
 that
 this
 thing
 could
 tank
 back


to
 like
 23
 24,
 which
 I
 don't
 think
 that


could
 happen
 either,
 but
 I
 wonder
 how


many
 people
 think
 it's
 going
 up
 to
 35.


Beyond
 me
 right
 there.
 592.


that
 loses
 $6
 and
 still
 halt
 it.


I
 think
 regardless
 of
 what
 happens
 to


the
 stock,
 the
 the
 the
 the
 earnings
 will


be
 really
 good.
 Like
 the
 quarter
 will
 be


really
 good.
 I
 don't
 know
 what
 happens


to
 the
 stock,
 but
 even
 based
 on
 Tanner's


analysis,
 I'm
 pretty
 sure
 this
 quarter


is
 going
 to
 be
 one
 of
 the
 best
 quarters


they've
 ever
 had.
 It
 just
 depends
 now
 if


the
 stock


actually
 follows
 it
 up.


All right.
 So,
 I
 mean,


you're
 getting
 not
 that
 much
 momentum
 on


the
 other
 quantum
 names.
 Even
 after
 this


Google
 announcement,


all
 of
 them
 are
 still
 down
 about
 5%.
 So,


we
 got
 to
 see
 if
 that's
 enough
 to
 boost


these
 up.
 Again,
 like
 I
 don't
 know if


it's
 bullish
 or
 bearish.
 You
 could
 say


it's
 bullish
 because
 it
 validates
 the


space,
 but
 then
 again,
 if
 Google
 solves


these
 issues
 and
 what
 are
 the
 other


quantum
 stocks
 doing,
 right?
 Why
 are


they
 valued
 at
 1,800
 time
 sales
 if
 big


tech
 is
 already
 solving
 a
 lot
 of
 those


problems?


I
 think
 that's
 the
 the
 you
 know
 the
 core


question.
 But
 then
 again
 from
 a


narrative
 perspective
 the
 idea
 of


quantum
 being
 legitimized
 from
 a
 Google


and
 IBM
 which
 you
 know
 Sundar
 has
 been


pretty
 bullish
 on
 Google
 for
 a
 while.


Dell
 has
 been
 bullish.
 I
 mean
 they've


not
 been
 actively
 bearish
 on
 it.
 They


just
 have
 said
 it's
 going
 to
 take
 some


time
 for
 it
 to
 play
 out.
 That
 narrative


could
 be
 enough
 to
 also
 validate
 some
 of


the
 industry
 as
 well
 including
 those


names.
 Palantry
 right
 here
 174
 back
 up


from
 172


87.
 It's
 only
 bullish
 for
 Google.


Yeah,
 it
 really
 depends
 because
 look,
 if


some
 of
 the
 smaller
 quantum
 players
 can


play
 a
 role
 like
 for
 example
 like
 Nvidia


is
 the
 AI
 king,
 but
 then
 you
 have
 a


Micron
 and
 a
 Broadcom
 and
 an
 SMCI
 and


all
 these
 companies
 that
 are
 needed
 in


this
 ecosystem.
 So,
 it
 lifts
 up
 the


entire
 industry.
 If
 Google
 thinks


they've
 solved
 quantum,
 do
 you
 need
 a


D-Wave?
 Do
 you
 need
 a
 Regetti?
 Do
 you


need
 an
 IO?
 Like,
 are
 they
 part
 of
 an


ecosystem
 or
 are
 they
 just
 competitors


that
 have
 no
 chance
 against
 big
 tech?
 I


don't
 know.


And
 so
 I
 guess
 the
 market's
 going
 to


have
 to
 ultimately
 decide


kind
 of
 how
 they
 think
 this
 plays
 out.


Uh
 fear
 and
 greed
 back
 down
 to
 27.


Right.
 So
 you're
 still
 seeing
 a
 little


bit
 of
 red
 there.
 Gold.
 Yeah,
 gold.
 I
 I


mean
 this
 is
 pretty
 incredible
 how
 gold


continues
 to
 still
 down
 on
 the
 day.


Barely
 above
 4,000.


That
 one
 not
 easily


getting
 the
 levels
 that
 we
 saw
 a
 while


ago.


Um,


okay.
 Let's
 get
 some
 updates
 here
 on


some
 of
 the
 other
 earnings
 that
 we
 saw


yesterday.
 We'll
 keep
 going
 from
 there.


>> 4
 and
 a.5%
 today
 after
 missing


specifically
 on
 margins
 and
 guidance.


Gross
 margins
 came
 in
 below
 estimates


and
 Deutsche
 Bank
 says
 the
 muted
 pace
 of


the
 cyclical
 recovery
 is
 really
 creating


significant
 margin
 pressures
 for
 Texas


Instruments.
 Management
 also
 guided


fourth
 quarter
 revenue
 and
 earnings


below
 street
 estimates
 with
 what
 was


stood
 out
 was
 an
 unusually
 wide
 range


which
 could
 signal
 they
 may
 not
 have


visibility
 into
 when
 demand
 actually


picks
 up
 for
 the
 quarter.
 Goldman
 Sachs


says
 while
 they
 do
 see
 a
 recovery
 across


the
 analog
 sector,
 the
 problem
 is
 peers


have
 really
 just
 managed
 their
 inventory


levels
 far
 more
 proactively
 than
 Texas


Instrument.
 That
 means
 gross
 margins
 are


likely
 to
 recover
 much
 faster
 for


competitors
 like
 microchip
 NXP
 as
 well


as
 analog
 devices
 that
 you're
 seeing
 on


your
 screen
 right
 now.
 But
 not
 everyone


is
 bearish
 here.
 Evercore
 ISI
 added


Texas
 Instruments
 to
 their
 outperform


list,
 pointing
 to
 multiple
 catalysts


such
 as
 gross
 margins
 they're
 saying


bottoming
 in
 the
 first
 quarter
 and
 then


expanding
 as
 well
 as
 a
 free
 cash
 flow


growth
 story
 as
 the
 company
 really
 exits


its
 heavy
 capex
 cycle.
 But
 adding
 to


today's
 pressure,
 China's
 Ministry
 of


Commerce
 released
 questionnaires


requiring
 some
 US
 semiconductor
 firms
 to


provide
 information
 on
 their
 sales
 in


China
 as
 part
 of
 this
 anti-dumping


investigation
 they
 started
 back
 in


September.
 The
 probe
 targets
 analog
 chip


suppliers
 like
 Texas
 Instruments
 and


analog
 devices.
 So
 that's
 adding
 to
 the


selloff
 Texas
 Instruments
 selling
 and


it's
 dragging
 down
 other
 analog
 chip.


>> This
 is
 also
 similar
 to
 Qualcomm
 and
 the


investigation
 they
 had
 with
 them
 for


antitrust
 stuff.
 So
 you
 see
 China


cracking
 down
 on
 some
 of these


semiconductor
 names.
 Here's
 uh
 what
 UBS


has
 to
 say
 about
 the
 state
 of
 the


markets
 that
 we're
 in
 right
 now.


>> 100
 isn't
 a
 coincidence.
 I
 think
 you


have
 an
 alignment
 of
 um
 productivity,
 an


alignment
 of
 policy,
 and
 I
 think
 that
 we


see
 that
 continuing
 to
 go
 forward.
 I


think
 that
 you
 also
 have
 some
 tailwinds


that
 could
 help
 us
 out
 with
 interest


rates
 coming
 down.
 And
 what
 you've
 seen


from
 the
 Fed
 and
 you've
 seen
 this
 this


pivot
 by
 the
 Fed,
 the
 pal
 pus
 pivot.
 Um


you've
 seen
 a
 pivot
 to
 an
 understanding


that
 interest
 rates
 are
 going
 to
 come


down
 and
 I
 think
 that
 that
 could
 be
 and


and
 we
 at
 UBS
 feel
 that
 that
 could
 be


something
 that
 will
 help
 the
 market


going
 forward.


>> And
 not
 just
 Fed
 interest
 rates.
 I
 I


also
 want
 to
 highlight
 just
 market
 rates


coming
 down.
 And
 it's
 something
 that


Treasury
 Secretary
 Besson
 actually


posted
 about
 today
 when
 he
 said,
 you


know,
 10-year
 yields
 are
 going
 lower
 on


deficit
 improvement.
 I
 mean,
 the


Treasury
 is
 putting
 out
 new
 data.
 I


think
 we
 have
 a
 great
 chart
 of
 it.


Quinta
 actual
 movement
 here.
 If
 you
 look


at
 the
 last
 two
 quarters,
 you
 can
 see


smaller
 increases
 of
 government


spending,
 actually
 decreased
 government


spending.
 So,
 they
 have
 that
 happening


at
 the
 same
 time
 that
 the
 tariff
 revenue


is
 coming
 in.
 and
 we're
 starting
 to
 see


some
 progress.
 I
 mean,
 obviously,
 this


is
 a
 huge
 one
 to
 turn,
 but
 do
 you
 think


that
 that's
 having
 an
 impact
 in
 the


market?


>> Yeah,
 I
 mean,
 you
 could
 call
 it
 the
 Doge


dividend.
 It's
 it's
 been
 a
 reframe
 of


how
 people
 think
 about
 spending
 in


Washington.
 In
 addition
 to
 that,
 you


have
 a
 president,
 an
 administration,
 a


secretary
 of
 the
 Treasury
 that
 doesn't


think
 out
 of
 the
 box,
 but
 has
 no
 box.


And
 you
 hear
 the
 the
 the
 Treasury


Secretary
 talk
 about
 stable
 coins
 being


a
 two
 trillion
 dollar
 uh
 industry.
 You


see
 treasuries
 being
 used
 as
 under
 the


Genius
 Act
 as
 something
 that
 would
 would


be
 backing
 stable
 coins.
 So
 there
 is
 an


effort
 to
 address
 the
 fiscal
 realities


of
 what's
 going
 on.
 A
 $
 38
 trillion


deficit
 is
 not
 something
 that
 this


administration
 is
 going
 to
 tolerate
 and


that
 certainly
 is
 having
 a
 positive


impact
 on
 the
 uh
 on
 the
 animal
 spirits


and
 on
 the
 economy.


>> Well,
 a
 large
 part
 of
 our
 debt
 was


assembled
 under
 the
 first
 Trump


administration.
 We
 know
 that


>> co


>> well
 we
 had
 a
 we
 had
 a
 co
 situation
 then


we
 had
 a
 a
 huge
 increase
 under
 the
 the


Biden
 administration
 but
 this
 is


something
 that
 is
 not
 uh
 uh
 something


that
 Trump
 doesn't
 own
 or
 or
 that
 Biden


owned.
 This
 is
 something
 that
 has
 been


happening
 in
 America
 for
 decades
 now
 and


it's
 something
 that
 this
 president
 and


this
 administration
 with
 Secretary


Besson
 has
 decided
 to
 address
 headon
 and


we
 haven't
 seen
 that
 before
 and
 that's


something
 new
 that
 combined
 with
 the


productivity
 that
 comes
 from
 artificial


intelligence
 with
 lower
 interest
 rates


in
 general
 from
 the
 Federal
 Reserve.


This
 culmination
 of
 things
 can
 can


result
 in
 a
 very
 positive
 outlook
 next


year.


>> Right.
 Do
 you
 think
 the
 rates
 coming


down
 are
 a
 function
 of
 the
 labor
 market


beginning
 to
 crack?
 Well,


>> S&P
 loses
 670
 again.


I
 mean,
 it's
 choppy,
 folks.
 It
 is
 pretty


choppy.
 That
 little
 V
 that
 we
 had,
 it's


going
 right
 back
 down.
 It
 is
 pretty
 damn


choppy
 today.
 And
 I
 don't
 have
 a
 real


reason
 for
 why.
 Beyond
 meat
 from
 7
 to


630,
 still
 up
 74%.


But
 it
 is
 taking
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 nose
 dive


from
 that
 $7
 level.
 I
 think
 the
 the


labor
 market
 beginning
 to
 crack
 has


given
 the
 Fed
 confidence
 to
 lower


interest
 rates.
 Perhaps
 not
 as
 fast
 as


uh
 Steven
 Marin
 would
 like
 to
 see
 them


uh
 lowered,
 but
 it's
 clear
 that
 the


economy
 has
 slowed
 down.
 We
 see
 that
 in


the
 inflationary
 numbers.
 We
 don't
 have


so
 many
 inflationary
 numbers
 now
 because


we
 have a
 20-day
 government
 shutdown.


>> 22,


>> but
 we
 have
 CPI
 coming
 out
 in
 in
 a


couple
 days
 because
 that
 that's
 used
 for


social
 security
 benefits.
 But
 the
 fact


of the
 matter
 is
 we
 have
 seven
 trillion


dollars
 in
 money
 market
 funds
 on
 the


sidelines.
 This
 is
 a
 result
 of
 an


inverted
 yield
 curve
 that
 we've
 had
 for


a
 long
 time.
 That's
 changing.
 That
 money


is
 going
 to
 be
 looking
 for
 a
 home.
 And


there
 is
 a
 lot
 of
 positivity
 that
 can


come
 into
 the
 market
 even
 from
 a
 peace


dividend
 depending
 on
 what
 happens
 with


Putin
 and
 what
 happens
 in
 the
 Middle


East.


>> No,
 I
 mean
 my
 one
 thing
 Alan
 and


everything
 you're
 saying
 makes
 sense
 and


and
 is
 why
 we're
 seeing
 record
 levels
 in


the
 stock
 market
 I
 think.
 But
 are
 the


risks
 appreciated
 and
 are
 they
 are
 they


factored
 in?
 Because
 there
 are


definitely
 still
 some
 risk
 there.
 And
 so


when
 you
 get
 to
 these
 levels,
 you
 start


to
 wonder
 just
 are
 we
 priced
 for


perfection.


>> Yeah.
 And
 I
 think
 you
 see
 that
 risk
 in


what's
 happening
 in
 the
 credit
 markets.


You
 see
 it
 in
 the
 smaller
 uh
 the
 smaller


credit
 obligations.
 But
 I
 think
 that
 on


balance
 taking
 a
 risk
 in
 the
 equity


markets
 and
 on
 any
 pullback
 gain
 greater


exposure
 to
 those
 equity
 markets
 could


be
 something
 that
 would
 benefit.
 at
 UBS,


you
 know,
 we
 believe
 that
 the
 market


could
 be
 somewhere
 between
 67
 and
 6,900


by
 the
 end
 of
 this
 year.
 Um,
 by
 June
 of


next
 year,
 we
 could
 see
 7,300.
 And
 we
 we


have
 a
 bullc
 case
 scenario
 that
 says


8,000.
 And
 I
 think
 there's
 a
 lot
 of


factors
 that
 are
 coming
 into
 play.
 It's


a
 perfect
 storm
 of
 goodness
 that
 could


happen,
 but
 we
 have
 to
 be
 cognizant
 of


the
 risk.
 You
 see
 gold
 prices
 going
 up.


I
 mean,
 notwithstanding
 the
 movement


today,
 notwithstanding
 the
 movement


today,
 um,
 you
 see
 gold
 prices
 going
 up.


Now,
 is
 that
 a
 question
 of
 people
 buying


a
 risk
 insurance
 or
 is
 that
 a
 matter
 of


people
 understanding
 that
 there's
 fiscal


issues
 that
 are
 going
 on
 around
 the


world?
 The
 fiscal
 premiums
 around
 the


world
 for
 sovereign
 debt
 are
 something


that
 we
 have
 to
 take
 note
 of.
 But
 all
 in


all,
 between
 the
 productivity
 that
 comes


from
 artificial
 intelligence,
 between


with
 lower
 interest
 rates
 and
 the
 $7


trillion
 on
 the
 sideline,
 this
 is
 a
 very


positive
 time
 to
 be
 in
 the
 markets


>> and
 and
 does
 it
 matter?
 Do
 you
 like


small
 caps
 over
 large
 caps?
 Do
 you
 stick


with
 technology?
 I
 mean,
 how
 do
 you


allocate
 that?
 So
 if
 you
 look
 at
 uh


monumental
 changes
 that
 are
 going
 on
 the


economy,
 having
 exposure
 to
 technology,


having
 exposure
 to
 artificial


intelligence,
 longevity
 is
 an
 issue
 that


that
 is
 on
 everybody's
 mind.
 I
 have
 a


birthday
 coming
 up
 so
 it's
 on
 my
 mind,


but
 uh
 but
 this
 is
 something
 that
 that


we
 all
 are
 looking
 at
 and
 technology
 as


applied
 throughout
 industries
 is
 going


to
 change
 many
 many
 things.
 So
 it
 it
 it


goes
 beyond
 just
 uh
 just
 what
 we're
 used


to
 in
 normal
 practice
 because
 we
 have


things
 happening
 now
 that
 have
 never


happened
 before.


>> All right,
 Alan,
 thank
 you
 for
 joining


us.
 It's
 always
 good
 to
 be here,
 sir.


Thank
 you.
 Good
 to
 see
 you
 from
 UBS.


Alan.


>> All right,
 so
 UBS
 is
 pretty
 bullish
 in


the
 midst
 of
 all
 the
 different
 arguments


to
 be
 bearish
 or
 bullish
 on
 the
 market.


UBS
 chooses
 to
 think
 this
 is
 one
 of the


better
 times
 to
 be
 in
 the
 market.
 Nvidia


right
 there
 at
 180.
 SoFi
 got
 up
 to
 2750


and
 now
 it's
 losing
 2750.


Nebius
 broke
 above
 98
 now
 right
 back


below
 it.
 AMD
 231,
 the
 VIX
 still
 up
 4%.


Netflix
 basically
 10%
 down
 9.97%.


UNH
 down
 1.3.
 Regetti,
 the
 quantum
 name


still
 getting
 hit.
 They
 got
 a
 little
 bit


of
 a
 jolt
 when
 that
 Google
 news
 came


out.
 Google's
 still
 holding


its
 boost.
 the
 rest
 of
 those
 names


getting
 hit.
 Where
 is
 Oakllo?


Oaklo
 12
 up
 from
 118,


but
 still
 at
 uh
 120.


It's
 choppy
 day,
 folks.
 So,
 choppy
 day


across
 the
 entire
 board.
 I
 still
 don't


have
 a
 full-on
 headline


to
 uh
 to
 justify
 a
 lot
 of
 this
 stuff.
 I


mean,
 I
 don't
 think
 it's
 Russia
 Ukraine


stuff
 either.


I
 really
 do
 feels
 like
 it's
 ALOS,
 but


it's
 very
 very
 choppy


choppy
 Algos.


Uh
 Google
 and
 GM


announced
 a
 plan
 to
 bring
 eyes
 off


driving
 to
 market
 in
 2028,
 debuting
 the


new
 Cadillac
 Escalade
 with
 Google
 Gemini


conversational
 AI.
 All right,
 so
 you
 got


a
 Google
 GM
 headline.
 GM,
 by
 the
 way,


had
 their
 best
 day
 in
 15
 years.
 It
 was


up
 15%
 yesterday,
 so
 they
 had
 a
 great


earnings.
 GM
 right
 there
 up
 another
 1%.


But
 not
 that
 many
 other
 headlines
 to


explain
 some
 of
 this
 stuff.
 Sofi
 2706


and
 Nvidia


180.18.


180.18.


Who
 bought
 the
 dip?
 Put
 in
 the
 chat
 if


you
 bought
 anything
 yet.
 Put
 in
 the
 chat


if
 you
 bought
 anything
 so
 far
 today.


Let's
 see.
 Let's
 see.
 Let's
 see.
 Let's


see
 if
 anyone
 bought
 anything.


Bought
 Applied
 Digital


SMCI.
 SMCI
 must
 be
 getting
 wrecked


today.
 SMCI
 is


what?
 Down
 seven.
 Down
 6.7.
 There
 you


go.


Weeble.
 Where's
 Weeble?
 Is
 Weeble


finally
 below
 11?
 Like
 a
 lot
 of
 people


waiting
 for
 that.
 Wow,
 it's
 below
 11.


1082.


Damn,
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 retail
 investors


that
 think
 this
 thing
 is
 going
 to
 20
 by


the
 end
 of
 the
 year.
 We
 got
 some
 pretty


big
 TA
 accounts
 that
 are
 calling
 for
 20


by
 the
 end
 of
 the
 year.


This
 one
 would
 have
 to
 double,
 which
 is


not
 the
 easiest.


Joby,
 Sofi,
 Banar,
 Bit
 Farms
 under
 four.


Is
 it
 actually
 under
 four?
 Bit
 farms.
 Oh


my
 goodness.
 This
 thing
 was
 650
 on


Wednesday
 last
 week.


I
 remember
 waking
 up
 in
 the
 pre-markets


and
 this
 one
 exploding
 and
 then
 after


hours
 this
 one
 exploding
 again
 to
 the


upside.


I
 mean
 I
 traded
 Bit
 Farms
 at
 Ford
 like
 a


year
 and
 a
 half
 ago
 when
 it
 was
 like
 a


dollar
 but
 then
 they
 did
 the
 whole
 data


center
 pivot
 and
 they
 got
 a
 they
 got
 a


200%
 move
 in
 two
 weeks


390.


All right.
 So
 everything's
 taking
 a
 hit.


Some
 names
 worse
 than
 others
 but


everything's
 taking
 a
 hit.
 Gold
 still


down
 as
 well.
 There's
 no
 uh
 I
 I
 don't
 I


didn't
 see
 a
 major
 forecast
 for
 CPI
 on


Friday.
 I
 mean,
 some
 people
 have
 it


coming
 in
 at
 2.7.
 Goldman
 Sachs,
 I


think,
 has
 it
 at
 3.1
 for
 core.
 Uh
 CPI
 is


going
 to
 be
 weird,
 though,
 because
 I


wonder
 how
 much
 data
 they're
 going
 to


have.
 I
 wonder
 how
 much
 how
 many


arguments
 are
 going
 to
 really
 be
 out


there.
 Uh
 and
 you
 know
 what
 data
 they're


exactly
 collecting.


Here's
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 coverage
 on
 that,


but
 CPI,
 I
 wonder
 how
 market
 moving
 it's


going
 to
 be


>> than
 what
 it
 could
 have
 been
 given
 the


extent
 of
 the
 tariffs.
 We
 should
 have


goods
 prices
 be
 a
 little bit
 firmer.


We're
 expecting
 rent
 and
 OAR
 to


disinflate
 a
 little
 bit
 further
 from


where
 we
 were.
 So
 net
 net,
 it's
 kind
 of


a
 boring
 print.
 That
 puts
 core
 PCE
 at


that.


>> I
 know.
 I
 know
 the
 labor
 market
 data


we're
 excited
 to
 get.
 We're
 just
 don't


know
 when
 we're
 getting
 it.
 I
 mean,
 it's


so
 interesting.


>> So
 they're
 expecting
 it
 at
 2.8.
 Again,


it's
 not
 going
 to
 be
 something
 too


crazy.
 May,
 yeah,
 maybe
 the
 this


market's
 going
 down
 because
 they're


afraid
 we're
 going to
 get a
 bad
 CPI,
 but


we
 would
 have
 to
 get
 an
 aggressive
 move


on
 inflation
 to
 have
 a
 really
 bad
 CPI.


And
 I
 don't
 know if
 we
 see
 that.


So,
 we
 got
 to
 see


my
 Nebul
 is
 98
 for
 this
 Friday.
 98
 for


this
 Friday


if
 it
 gets
 assigned
 or
 not.


All
 right,
 folks.
 Do
 we
 buy
 SoFi
 here
 or


do
 I
 do
 I
 get
 greedy
 and
 wait
 for
 2650?


Can
 I
 Can
 I
 get
 greedy
 and
 wait
 for
 2650


or
 do
 we
 have
 to
 buy
 it
 here?
 Match


group
 owned
 Tinder
 will
 soon
 require
 all


new
 users
 in
 the
 United
 States
 to
 verify


their
 identity
 through
 a
 biometric
 video


face
 scan.


Oh,
 that's
 not
 bullish
 for
 match
 group.


MTCH


stocks
 up.


I
 mean,
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 a
 ton
 of
 people


are
 going
 to
 want
 to
 use
 the
 app
 if
 they


have
 to


do
 a
 biometric
 video
 face
 scan.


I
 feel
 like
 that's
 a
 bit
 aggressive,


but
 maybe.
 Where's
 Orbs?
 Orbs
 must
 be


getting
 hit
 today
 as
 well.
 Orbs.
 Yeah,


Orbs
 down
 9%.


Again,
 look,
 I
 love
 Dan
 Ives,
 but
 I


don't
 really
 understand
 Worldcoin.
 I


understand
 Ethereum.
 That's
 why
 I
 like


BMR.


I
 don't
 know
 if
 the
 entire
 world
 is


going
 to
 be
 hooked
 onto
 worldcoin
 one


day.
 Maybe,
 but
 it's
 hard
 to
 see
 the


vision
 for
 that
 right
 now.
 Bit
 mine


48.27%


down
 in
 the
 day.
 Oaklow
 again
 loses
 120.


Look
 beyond
 me.
 It's
 losing
 a
 lot
 of
 I


mean
 770
 to
 512.
 I
 think
 it
 got
 halted


at
 512.
 Yep.
 Halted.
 There
 you
 go.


Fourth
 halt
 of
 the
 day
 on
 Beyond
 Meat.


All
 right.
 So
 far
 is
 getting
 close
 to


where
 I
 wanted
 it.
 Look
 at
 that.
 26.85.


2650
 is
 what
 I
 was
 looking
 for.
 That's


kind
 of
 wild,
 bro.
 I
 really
 didn't
 think


it
 would
 get
 back
 here.
 I
 thought
 it


like
 I
 thought
 after
 the
 8%
 move
 on


Friday
 or
 Monday,
 I
 was
 like, "All


right,
 I
 missed
 it."
 It
 is
 what
 it
 is.


Pounder
 171.
 All right,
 we're
 making


some
 new
 lows,
 folks.
 We're
 making
 some


new
 lows.
 Look
 at
 that.
 Pounder.
 Last


time
 I
 bought
 pounder
 was
 at
 171
 like


four
 weeks
 ago.
 That
 means
 Hood
 should


be
 at
 122ish.
 12250
 on
 Hood.


Grabs
 what?
 545.


No,
 Grabs
 550.
 Rock
 Lab.
 Are
 we
 below


60?
 We
 are
 7
 cents
 away.
 Below
 60
 on


Rockab.
 And
 then
 as67


loses
 90.


Going
 down.


We're
 going
 down.
 Wait,
 where's
 the
 S&P


then?
 Where
 is
 the
 S&P?
 Oh,
 wow.
 S&P
 low


of
 the
 day.
 Yep,
 we're
 going
 down.
 667.


Damn,
 bro.
 They
 really
 played
 with
 us


right
 there.
 They
 took
 it
 all
 the
 way
 to


670,
 let
 it
 chill
 out
 for
 a
 bit,
 and


then
 they
 took
 it
 right
 back
 down.
 And
 I


don't
 have
 a
 headline
 to
 give
 you
 guys


to
 explain
 this.


It
 really
 just
 feels
 like
 a
 choppy
 day


in
 October,
 which
 theoretically
 should


create
 some
 pretty
 good
 dips
 if
 there's


not
 a
 real
 reason
 for
 this.


There
 you
 go.
 They're
 taking
 her
 down.


They're
 taking
 her
 down.
 What's
 the


volume
 on
 Beyond
 Meat?
 Uh
 1.14
 billion


as
 it's
 halted.


Yeah,
 this
 is
 weird.
 I
 mean,
 I
 really
 am


trying
 to
 see


to
 get
 some
 more
 logic
 on
 this,
 but


you're
 not
 getting
 much.
 I
 mean,
 you
 had


some
 Wells
 Fargo
 CEO
 quotes.
 You
 had


some
 Jamie
 Diamond
 quotes.


Nothing
 too
 crazy.
 Luke
 Capital
 says


Netflix
 is
 not
 going
 to
 buy
 Warner


Brothers.


Oh,
 the
 Democrats
 are
 going
 live.
 House


Democrats
 going
 live
 to
 discuss
 the


shutdown.


All right.
 So,
 I
 guess
 he
 got
 Mike


Johnson
 was
 live
 an
 hour
 ago
 and
 now
 you


got
 the
 Democrats
 going
 live.


Um


Mike
 Novagrat's
 quote,
 "Bitcoin
 will


likely
 stay
 between
 120
 and
 125
 by
 end


of
 year."


Okay,
 so
 that
 that's
 taking
 a
 opposite


approach
 to
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 other
 bulls


that
 are
 saying
 Bitcoin's
 going
 to


200,000.
 Novagrats


is
 saying,
 "Nope,
 expect
 125
 by
 end
 of


year."


Hood
 little
 recovery
 to
 123
 and
 then
 S&P


little
 recovery
 from
 66750
 to
 66825.


Little
 bounce


but
 still
 red.


Uh
 Upstart,
 how
 about
 that
 one?
 Upstart,


that's
 down
 7%.
 Chris
 showed
 a
 good


chart
 today


that
 is
 uh
 important
 to
 understand
 when


we
 think
 of
 Upstart
 or
 SoFi.
 Take
 a
 look


at
 this
 auto
 loan
 data
 showing
 that
 the


uh
 bottom
 end
 of
 the
 consumer
 pretty


damn
 weak.
 So
 prime
 borrowers
 are
 mostly


staying
 current
 on
 their
 car
 payments,


but
 the
 percentage
 of
 subprime
 borrowers


at
 least
 60
 days
 late
 has
 doubled
 since


2021.


And
 as
 you
 can
 see
 right
 there,
 the
 the


the
 the
 uh
 the
 dark
 purple
 chart
 or
 the


line
 is
 the
 percentage
 of
 borrowers
 who


are
 60
 plus
 days
 late
 on
 car
 loan


payments.
 It's
 now
 above
 6%.


2021
 it
 was
 less
 than
 3%.


So
 I
 mean
 this
 is
 something
 that
 I
 don't


think
 we
 can
 ignore.
 It's
 not,
 I
 think,


the,
 you
 know,
 structural
 bare
 case,
 but


it
 is
 definitely
 something
 that


you
 just
 can't
 ignore
 because
 again,
 a


lot
 of
 the
 market
 is
 being
 propped
 up
 by


people
 that
 have
 assets,
 those
 assets


are
 going
 up,
 that's
 why
 people
 are
 able


to
 keep
 spending.


If
 the
 stock
 market
 crashes
 and
 people


are
 able
 to
 not
 keep
 spending
 and
 the


bottom
 half
 of
 the
 consumer
 already
 is


two
 months
 late
 on
 a
 car
 payment,
 well,


yeah,
 you
 start
 to
 get
 issues.
 But
 then


the
 broader
 question
 becomes,
 well,
 why


would
 the
 market
 crash
 and
 is
 it
 like
 is


it
 a
 chicken?
 Is
 it
 the
 chicken
 or
 the


egg,
 right?
 Is
 it
 the
 the
 lower
 consumer


defaults
 so
 badly
 that
 the
 market


crashes?
 Or
 is
 it
 that
 the
 market


crashes
 and
 therefore
 the
 people
 that


were
 holding
 up
 or
 subsidizing
 the
 lower


end
 of
 the
 consumer
 can't
 subsidize
 them


anymore,
 therefore
 things
 just
 continue


to
 get
 way
 worse.


And
 again,
 the
 question
 goes
 down
 to


well,
 if
 Nvidia,
 if
 Amazon,
 if


Microsoft,
 all
 these
 companies
 are


putting
 up
 phenomenal
 earnings,
 the


market
 shouldn't
 necessarily
 have
 to


crash,
 which
 means
 maybe
 the
 upper
 half


of
 the
 consumer
 can
 subsidize
 the
 lower


half.
 But
 that
 is
 a
 real
 dynamic.


That's
 that's
 playing
 out
 in
 this


country
 there.
 Exactly.
 There
 are
 two


economies.


There
 are
 two
 economies.


Costco's
 green.


Okay.
 Costco.
 Uh,


what's
 green
 today?
 Costco's
 green.


Beyond
 Meat's
 green.
 Is
 Verizon
 green?


Verizon
 is
 red.
 What
 is
 actually
 green?


GoPro's
 green.


Birkshshire,
 are
 we
 green?


on
 BRK.
 Birkshshire
 is
 a
 little
 green.


American
 Express
 is
 a
 little
 green.
 How


about
 Walmart?
 Walmart's
 green.
 Home


Depot's
 green.


Nike,
 the
 VIX
 is
 green.
 Yes,
 the
 VIX
 is


green.
 Nike
 is
 green.
 And
 then


McDonald's
 is
 green.
 This
 is
 why
 the
 Dow


Jones
 basically
 got
 to
 alltime
 highs


yesterday
 because
 you
 had
 a
 bunch
 of


these
 value
 names
 that
 were
 catching
 a


bid.
 And
 then
 obviously
 Apple,
 one
 of


the
 biggest
 components
 of
 the
 Dow
 Jones.


People
 are
 scared,
 bro.
 Buying


McDonald's
 and
 Nike,
 people
 are
 scared.


Um,


Microsoft's
 a
 little
 green
 as
 well.


Microsoft
 actually
 didn't
 get
 hit
 that


bad
 today
 like
 the
 other
 big
 tech


stocks.


All
 right,
 I'll
 put
 the
 first
 order
 for


SoFi.
 We'll
 do
 it.
 We
 wanted
 to
 do
 500


shares
 before
 earnings.


We'll
 do
 250
 right
 now.
 We'll
 do
 two.


We'll
 do
 half
 of
 it.
 I
 wanted
 2650.
 It's


at
 26.84.


We
 might
 as
 well


do
 it
 in
 there.
 It
 is


250
 for
 SoFi.
 26.85.


All
 right.
 So
 now
 the
 next
 buy
 is
 at


2650
 if
 we
 get
 there.


And
 that's
 going
 to
 be
 our
 earnings


play.


That's
 going
 to
 be
 our
 earnings
 play.


Tanner
 better
 be
 right
 about
 this
 [ __ ]


bro.
 Tanner
 better.
 Of
 course
 it
 goes
 to


2677
 as
 soon
 as
 Of
 course.
 Why
 not?
 Why


not?
 Someone
 just
 sold
 me
 their
 250


shares
 at
 26.85.


Of
 course,


Tanner
 better
 be
 right,
 bro.
 I
 better


see
 a
 million
 freaking
 members
 as
 per


Tanner.
 You
 know,
 you
 know,
 Tanner's


video
 got
 banned
 yesterday
 on
 YouTube


and
 someone
 flagged
 the
 video
 as
 like
 uh


Tanner's
 guaranteeing
 stock
 performance


results
 and
 Tanner
 was
 like,
 I
 never


guarantee.
 Tanner
 is
 so
 like
 cautious
 on


saying
 like
 this
 stock's
 going
 to
 go
 to


the
 moon
 yet.
 Like
 he's
 he's
 like
 he


hedges
 himself
 every
 time.
 And
 so
 he


just
 messaged
 YouTube.
 He's
 like,
 "Bro,


like
 what
 are
 you
 guys
 like
 what
 like


what
 is
 and
 then
 they
 unbanned
 it
 after


like
 10
 minutes."
 But
 it
 was
 hilarious.


It
 was
 like
 Tanner
 out
 of
 all
 people
 to


promise
 that
 a
 stock
 is
 going
 to
 go


higher.
 I've
 never
 heard
 Tanner
 say
 that


in
 my
 life.


But
 they
 got
 his
 video
 yesterday.
 I'm


still
 holding
 him
 accountable
 though.
 I


want
 35
 after
 earnings.
 Tanner


want
 35
 after
 earnings.


Um


Nebius
 is
 still
 getting
 hit.
 S&P
 low
 of


days.


Low
 of
 days
 66750.
 Nebius
 9630.


9630.


Mit
 flagged
 his
 video.


I
 don't
 even
 know
 how
 to
 flag
 a
 video,


bro.


just
 I
 feel
 like
 it
 was
 some
 troll
 that


did
 it
 to
 Tanner,
 but
 it's
 like
 you
 got


to
 be
 really
 bored
 to
 flag
 a
 video
 when


someone
 is
 so
 cautious
 for
 even
 saying


that
 type
 of
 stuff
 in
 the
 first
 place.


Pounder
 below
 170.
 Wow.
 16980.
 All


right.
 So,
 we're
 getting
 a
 real
 retest


on
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 names.


Covered
 calls
 today.
 Those
 are
 the
 only


things
 that
 are
 printing.
 If
 you've
 got


some
 of
 your
 positions
 covered,
 this


today
 is
 probably
 a
 great
 day
 to
 close


it
 out
 and
 write
 new
 ones
 or
 roll
 it
 at


a
 lower
 price.
 Nvidia
 down
 2%
 178
 low
 of


days.


AMD
 loses
 230.


All right.
 That's
 what
 we
 got.


That's
 what
 we
 got.
 Choppy
 choppy
 action


across
 the
 day,
 but
 we
 don't
 have
 a


reason.
 If
 anyone
 has
 a
 reason,
 please


let
 me
 know
 in
 the
 chat
 what
 or
 at least


what
 you
 think
 is
 the
 reason.
 Google,


one
 of
 the
 only
 names
 that's
 holding


somewhat
 of
 the
 green,
 but
 still
 losing


256.


I
 don't
 know.
 I'm
 just
 not
 seeing
 a


single
 real
 headline
 to
 to
 quantify


a
 lot
 of
 this
 stuff.


I
 mean,
 Trump,
 okay,
 so
 Trump
 did
 say


that
 China
 would
 get
 155%
 tariffs


yesterday.
 And
 I
 know
 that
 sounds
 super


crazy,
 but
 like
 the
 market
 did
 not
 care,


bro.
 The
 market
 did
 not
 care.
 The
 market


was
 like,
 "Okay,
 cool.
 Like
 we
 were


doing
 technical
 Tuesday
 when
 that


announcement
 came
 out.
 Nothing
 happened.


Like
 just
 no
 one
 cared.


So
 I
 don't
 think
 it's
 that.
 Also,
 I


think
 Trump's
 just
 saying
 stuff
 to
 say


stuff
 before
 the
 meeting
 at
 this
 point.


The
 bubble
 is
 popping.
 That's
 the


reason.
 Maybe,
 dude,
 maybe
 the
 bubble
 is


popping.
 Maybe
 that's
 it.
 Maybe
 it's
 all


a
 bubble.


Maybe
 Nvidia
 27
 times
 earnings
 is
 all
 a


bubble


and
 it's
 all
 ready
 to
 pop.
 Beyond
 Meat.


Wow.
 Beyond
 Meat.
 Speaking
 of
 bubbles,


467.


Look
 at
 that.
 Shout
 out
 to
 the
 schmuck


who
 bought
 it
 at
 780
 this
 morning.


And
 it's
 halted
 again.


All right,
 for
 those
 who
 are
 looking
 for


the
 dip
 for
 Beyond
 Meat,
 there
 you
 go.


467.
 That's
 your
 dip.


I
 mean,
 again,
 a
 lot
 of
 this
 momentum,


it
 goes
 up,
 it
 goes
 down.


It
 goes
 down
 pretty
 violently
 as
 much
 as


it
 goes
 up.


Um,


Michael,
 thanks
 for
 the
 $5
 super
 chat.


What
 do
 you
 think
 is
 the
 best
 ad
 for
 the


day?
 I
 I'll
 let
 the
 chat
 answer
 that


one.
 Uh,
 if
 you
 have
 to
 pick
 one.
 Okay,


so
 you
 give
 us
 a
 choice.
 Pounder
 Rock


Lab,
 Nebius,
 Iran,
 Hood.
 Pick
 one.


All right.
 What
 do
 you
 guys
 think?
 Best


ad
 for
 the
 day.


I'll
 do
 a
 YouTube
 poll
 on
 this,
 but


dude,
 YouTube
 needs
 to
 allow
 more
 than


four
 options
 because
 you
 gave
 us
 five


stocks,
 but
 I
 have
 to


one
 of
 them
 because
 YouTube
 doesn't


allow
 freaking
 four
 options.
 Palunteer,


Nebius,


Rockab.
 All
 right,
 Michael,
 you're
 gonna


have
 to
 tell
 me
 which
 one
 to
 take
 out.


Uh,
 best
 one,
 best
 buy
 for
 the
 day.


Michael,
 which
 one
 do
 I
 take
 out?
 I
 got


to
 limit
 it
 to
 four.
 I
 don't
 want
 to


pick
 between
 the
 five


because
 then
 everyone's
 good.
 Dude,


sometimes
 people
 get
 so
 emotional
 when
 I


like,
 "Oh,
 we'll
 take
 out
 Nebas
 from
 the


list."
 And
 everyone's
 like, "Oh,
 Amit


hates
 Nebius.
 He
 has
 this
 vendetta


against
 Nebius."
 And
 I
 was
 like, "Oh,


I'll
 take
 off
 Hood
 from
 the
 list."
 And


they're
 like, "Oh,
 Amit's
 not
 loyal
 to


Hood
 anymore."
 It's
 like,
 it's
 so


emotional
 with
 how
 this
 happens


sometimes.


And
 I
 get
 it.
 It's
 like
 It's
 like
 sports


teams,
 right?
 We're
 just
 so
 emotional


about
 it.
 So,
 I
 can't
 if
 I
 take
 off
 Ian.


Oh,
 Amit's
 jealous.
 He
 missed
 the
 Iran


ran
 run.
 That's
 why
 Iran's
 not
 in
 the


poll.
 It's
 like,
 no,
 I
 just
 need
 to
 I


need
 to
 get
 rid
 of
 one
 of
 these.
 I
 need


to
 get
 rid
 of
 one
 of
 these.


See,
 I'm
 not
 even
 going
 to
 do
 the
 poll


because
 then
 it's
 going
 to
 create
 a


narrative
 until
 Michael
 tells
 me
 which


one
 to
 take
 out
 Iran.
 Okay,
 there
 it
 is.


He
 said
 it,
 not
 me.
 He
 said
 it,
 not
 me.


All
 right,
 best
 buy
 for
 the
 day.
 What
 do


we
 think?


Best
 Buy.


Davis
 says,
 "No,
 you
 actually
 hate
 my


picks."
 No,
 Davis,
 I
 just
 don't


understand
 why
 you're
 obsessed
 with


Zeta.
 That's
 all.
 I
 think
 it's
 a


phenomenal
 company.
 I
 think
 their
 eBay


multiple
 is
 definitely
 cheaper
 than


other
 people
 in
 their
 space.
 I
 just


don't
 understand.


And
 I
 I
 I
 I
 need
 to
 do
 more
 research
 on


Zet
 I
 Zeta
 has
 a
 retail
 following,
 and
 I


don't
 understand
 why.
 I
 really
 don't
 get


why
 people
 love
 this
 thing.
 It's
 not
 a


horrible
 company.
 It's
 not
 a
 meme
 stock.


It's
 not
 a
 shitco.
 It's
 just
 advertising


data
 analytics.
 And
 I'm
 like,
 why
 is


this
 so
 exciting
 to
 people?
 I
 don't
 get


it.


Zeta
 is
 basically
 flat
 for
 the
 year.


But
 there
 are
 people
 that
 like
 it.
 And


so
 it's
 just
 Davis
 hasn't
 been
 able
 to


give
 me
 a
 good
 enough
 reason
 to
 to
 get


excited
 about
 it.


But
 people
 love
 it.
 Okay.
 What
 did
 you


guys
 pick?
 Nebius.
 Wow.


30%
 for
 Hood,
 35%
 for
 Nebius.
 Nebius
 in


the
 lead
 here.


Damn,
 bro.
 Remind
 me
 to
 never
 talk
 [ __ ]


about
 Nebius.
 I
 need
 to
 I
 need
 to
 make


sure
 I
 don't
 piss
 off
 a
 ton
 of
 people.


Look
 at
 that.
 I
 think
 Nebius
 has
 made
 a


lot
 of
 people
 a
 lot
 of
 money
 this
 year.


Nebus
 has
 made
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 a
 lot
 of


money.
 And
 I
 think
 the
 thing
 about


Nebius
 too
 is
 it
 was
 one
 of
 those
 data


center
 plays
 that
 everyone
 knew
 had


potential,
 but
 like
 to
 actually
 see
 that


$20
 billion
 Microsoft
 contract
 changed


everything.
 And
 that's
 what
 really
 made


people
 a
 lot
 of
 money
 this
 year
 in
 the


data
 center
 space.
 And
 there
 you
 go.


That's
 why
 you're
 getting
 some
 love.


Cororeweave,


wow,
 loses
 120.
 Forget
 120.
 It
 was
 at


140
 last
 week,
 right?
 Yeah,
 we
 saw
 it
 at


142.


Corave
 down
 to
 160.
 So
 Cor
 Nebby
 is


basically
 trading
 down
 together.
 Beyond


Meat
 suspended
 again
 at
 418.
 Now
 Beyond


Meat
 went
 from
 being
 up
 100%
 this


morning
 to
 15%.


That
 means
 Danut
 should
 be
 down
 as
 well.


Crispy
 Cream.
 Yeah,
 it
 was
 up
 40%.
 Now


it's
 up
 8%.
 GoPro
 was
 up
 20%.
 GoPro
 is


now
 up
 still
 17.
 So
 GoPro
 holding
 on.


Where's
 Oaklo?


Oaklo
 holding
 120.
 Up
 a
 little
 bit.
 I


don't
 understand
 why
 Galaxy
 is
 down
 4%.


I
 don't
 get
 it.
 They
 had
 a
 great


earnings.
 I
 again
 I
 can
 chalk
 it
 up
 to


what
 I
 said
 in
 the
 morning,
 which
 is


that
 too
 much
 was
 baked
 into
 the
 price


is
 still
 up
 over
 100%
 year
 to
 date,
 but


I'm
 not
 sure
 why
 today.
 I
 mean,
 I
 know


there's
 a
 draw
 down
 today,
 but
 they
 had


a
 really
 good
 earnings
 yesterday.
 So,


you
 would
 think
 that
 would
 protect
 a


little
 bit
 of
 the
 draw
 down,
 which
 begs


the
 question,
 if
 a
 Cipher
 and
 Iran,
 a


Terolf,
 what
 if
 they
 don't
 have
 as
 good


of
 an
 earnings
 as
 Galaxy?
 Galaxy
 beat


EPS
 by
 200%.
 What
 if
 they
 don't
 have
 the


best
 earnings?
 Because
 if
 Galaxy
 can't


get
 any
 green
 off
 of
 really
 good


earnings
 and
 those
 stocks
 like
 an
 IN
 is


up
 way
 more
 than
 a
 Galaxy
 year
 to
 date.


So
 So
 they're
 just
 have
 to
 put
 up
 really


good
 numbers
 for
 the
 street
 to
 not
 get


too
 too
 worried
 about
 it.


This
 is
 weird
 on
 no
 news.
 Yeah,
 I
 think


it's
 just


it's
 one
 of
 those
 days.


One
 of
 those
 days
 in
 October.


Nick
 says,
 "Himms
 feels
 like
 an
 old


fling
 that
 I'm
 thinking
 about
 calling


again."
 Nick,
 weren't
 you
 one
 of
 the


main
 people
 in
 my
 chat
 back
 in
 February


talking
 about
 HIMS?


Don't
 tell
 me
 you
 ditched
 Hims.


Did
 you
 ditch
 him?
 Because
 you
 were
 in


love
 with
 this
 freaking
 stock
 in


February.


The
 amount
 of
 comments
 I
 remember
 from


Nick
 Moss
 saying,
 "Mate,
 you
 got to
 look


at
 him.
 You
 got to
 look
 at
 him."
 And
 you


were
 right,
 by
 the
 way.
 I
 think
 it
 was


trading
 at
 25
 at
 that.
 You
 were
 right.


But
 if
 it's
 an
 old
 fling
 at
 this
 point,


you
 kind
 of
 you
 kind
 of
 moved
 on.


The
 government
 is
 still
 closed.
 Yes,
 the


government
 is
 still
 closed.


Microsoft
 523,
 McDonald's
 at
 312.
 When
 I


sold
 half
 my
 hymns
 at
 62
 last
 week,
 I


texted
 Nate.
 I
 was
 like,
 I'm
 out.


Was
 like,
 [ __ ]
 you.
 It's
 just
 like


and
 I
 was
 like,
 Nate,
 I
 don't
 know,
 bro.


It's
 at
 65
 for
 no
 reason.
 I
 think
 it's


kind
 of
 like
 I'm
 I'm
 taking
 I'm
 taking


some
 profits
 here.


And
 I
 don't
 know,
 dude.
 I
 mean,
 again,
 I


don't
 think
 it
 deserves
 to
 be
 a
 47,
 but


I
 don't
 understand
 why
 it
 was
 at
 65


either
 the
 other.
 Wow.
 46.
 All
 right.


So,
 it's
 losing
 47
 here.


Losing
 47.
 BMR.
 Are
 we
 tanking
 there?


BMR
 4850.
 Still
 down
 6.5.


And
 that
 one
 is
 down.


I
 was
 full
 ported
 into
 leaps
 when
 it
 was


25.
 I
 made
 5x
 and
 saw
 a
 better


opportunity.
 Well,
 there
 you
 go.
 Look,


makes
 sense.
 500%
 returns
 on
 him.
 Not


bad
 at
 all.


Look
 at
 Broadcom.


Broadcom.


Broadcom's
 not
 taking
 it
 that
 big
 of
 a


hit.
 Look,
 I
 like
 Broadcom
 and
 I
 think


uh
 Mizuo
 said
 yesterday
 that
 Anthropic


is
 their
 mystery10
 billion
 client.
 they


already
 have
 a
 really
 good
 relationship


with
 OpenAI.


I
 think
 Broadcom
 will
 be
 fine.
 I
 just
 I


don't
 understand
 enough
 of
 the
 ASIC


market
 to
 get
 as
 excited
 versus
 just
 to


buy
 more
 Nvidia.


And
 again,
 I
 think
 this
 market
 is
 one
 of


those
 like
 if
 you
 buy
 Broadcom,
 you
 have


to
 be
 bullish
 invidia
 and
 vice
 versa.


Like
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 really
 hard
 to
 buy


one
 of
 the
 big
 ones
 and
 not
 think
 all
 of


them
 go
 up
 at
 the
 same
 time
 or
 at least


overtime
 they
 all
 go
 up.


So,
 I
 feel
 like
 there's
 a
 world
 where


you
 could
 be


relatively
 bullish
 on
 both
 names,
 even


if
 you
 only
 buy
 one
 of
 them.


Um,


see
 some
 of these
 other
 headlines.
 I


don't
 see
 anything
 too
 crazy.


SoFi
 back
 to
 27.
 Okay,
 cool.


Well,
 we're
 in.
 We
 got
 our
 250
 shares.


27


on
 SoFi.


Is
 the
 second
 V
 happening?


Maybe.
 Where
 is
 the
 S&P?


Palinger
 back
 to
 170.
 Oh,
 maybe
 we're


getting
 a
 little
 second
 V.
 We
 need
 the


third
 one
 and
 then
 maybe
 triple
 V
 will


be
 here.
 Maybe.


All right.
 Little
 bit
 of
 another
 V.


How
 much
 are
 you
 down
 now,
 dude?
 I
 don't


even
 want
 to
 check
 how
 much.


Oh
 [ __ ]
 that's


that's
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 than
 before.


129.


I
 was
 up
 120
 yesterday,
 though.
 So,
 it's


like
 it's
 just
 it's
 just
 giving
 back


everything
 from
 yesterday.
 So,
 there
 you


go.


129.


Dude,
 some
 of
 this
 stuff
 is
 just
 like


it's
 just
 numbers
 at
 some
 point,
 dude.


It's
 like
 whatever.


Goes
 up,
 it
 goes
 down.
 It
 goes
 up,
 it


goes
 down.
 It's
 a
 freaking,
 you
 know,


being
 an
 investor
 is
 like,
 it's
 like


you're
 on
 a
 you're
 on
 a
 freaking
 swing


set
 all
 day.
 You
 just
 go
 back
 and
 forth


constantly.


Costco
 right
 there.
 950.


Costco's
 still
 green.


All right.
 What
 else
 do
 we
 have?
 What


else?
 What
 else?
 What
 else?
 What
 else?


What
 else
 do
 we
 have?
 Yeah,
 Julian
 right


there.
 Yo,
 Jul.
 So,
 shout
 out
 to
 Julian,


bro.
 Julian
 is
 uh
 Julian
 I
 just


discovered
 his
 Twitter
 account
 the
 other


day.
 Uh
 Julian's
 been
 on
 the
 hood
 and


Palenteer
 journey
 with
 us
 for
 a
 while.


And
 I
 think
 I
 showed
 you
 guys
 the


screenshot
 the
 other
 day,
 but
 our
 boy


Julian


when
 uh
 when
 Donnie
 T
 tweeted
 whatever


he
 had
 to
 tweet
 about
 China,
 this
 was


his
 P&L.


Not
 pretty.


Not
 pretty
 at
 all.


Nice
 little
 4.9
 millie
 day.
 But
 then


when
 things
 recovered,


the
 market
 taketh,
 the
 market
 giveth.
 It


was
 back
 up
 4.1
 mill.


So,
 you
 know,
 it
 goes
 up,
 it
 goes
 down,


it
 just
 it
 is
 what
 it
 is.
 It's
 the


nature
 of
 these
 markets.
 Let
 me
 show
 you


guys
 these
 videos,
 too.
 He
 made
 these


edited
 videos
 on
 pounder
 and
 hood.
 These


were
 such
 epic
 videos.
 So,
 let
 me
 show


you
 the
 Palanteer
 video
 and
 then
 I'll


show
 you
 guys
 the
 uh
 the
 Robin
 Hood


video.


>> I
 bought
 7.5


million
 worth
 of
 Palanteer
 stock.


Palanteer
 hitting
 a
 record
 high
 this


morning.


>> I
 have
 been
 going
 on
 about
 Palanteer


since
 it
 was
 $7.
 Price
 16.56.


>> Palanteer
 having
 its
 best
 day
 in
 a


month.


>> It's
 a
 historic
 run.


>> So,
 how
 much
 of
 that
 did
 you
 buy


>> in
 this
 week?
 10
 or
 20,000


>> million
 today.
 It
 hit
 $100.
 It
 was
 a


crazy
 moment.


>> Hit
 a
 new
 record
 high
 today.
 Palanteer


at
 $125.


>> Valuation
 is
 up
 550%
 in
 one
 year.


>> This
 is
 by
 far
 the
 most
 insane
 thing


that
 I've
 personally
 seen
 in
 all
 my


years
 in
 the
 market.
 I
 bought
 7.5


million.


>> That's
 wild,
 right?
 He's
 been
 on
 the


journey
 on
 poundhood
 for
 so
 long.
 And


this
 was
 the
 the
 Robin
 Hood
 video.


>> I'm
 going
 to
 buy
 a
 million
 dollars
 worth


of
 Robin
 Hood.


>> For
 2
 years,
 I've
 been
 telling
 people


how
 undervalued
 Robin
 Hood
 is.
 1,184


bought.


>> Here's
 a
 Robin
 Hood
 are
 moving
 higher.


You
 can
 see
 up
 15%
 right
 now.
 I
 think


this
 is
 just
 the
 beginning
 of
 Robin


Hood.
 I
 think
 that
 they
 could
 double


over
 the
 next
 year.


>> People
 have
 to
 take
 a
 hard
 look
 at
 Robin


Hood
 because
 this
 stock
 will
 be
 up
 more


than
 it
 currently
 is.


>> Robin
 Hood's
 running
 today,
 up
 9%.


Nobody
 knew
 that
 I
 got
 almost
 $5
 million


in
 Robin
 Hood.


>> If
 they
 can
 keep
 that
 going
 though,


Robin
 Hood
 shares
 of
 Robin
 Hood
 are


meantime
 hitting
 a
 new
 all-time
 high.


>> I
 added
 close
 to
 another
 3
 million
 to


Robin
 Hood.
 Bought
 on
 the
 dips
 and
 I'm


still
 very
 very
 bullish
 Robin
 Hood
 for


the
 future.


>> This
 is
 just
 wild.
 It's
 the
 greatest


innovation
 I
 have
 seen.


>> I
 was
 shocked.
 I
 couldn't
 believe
 it.


One
 of
 the
 most
 insane
 Riley's
 that
 I've


ever
 seen
 in
 my
 life.
 I'm
 gonna
 buy
 a


million
 dollars.


>> That's
 so
 epic,
 right?
 That's
 so


freaking
 epic.
 If
 you
 guys
 want
 to


follow
 him,
 I'll
 put
 his
 Twitter
 in
 the


chat.
 You
 guys
 can
 check
 him
 out.


But
 the
 market
 giveth
 the
 market
 take
 it


away.
 Yes,
 those
 were
 two
 reels.


Now,
 I
 I
 guess
 me
 complaining
 about


reels
 is
 me
 leading
 to
 showing
 you
 guys


more
 reels
 on
 the
 channel,
 but
 those


were
 worthwhile
 reels.
 Those
 were
 like


meaningful
 reels.


But
 uh
 it's
 just
 cool,
 right?
 Because
 it


also
 puts
 into
 perspective,
 right?


Obviously,
 he's
 working
 with
 a
 with
 a


much
 higher
 portfolio
 value
 there.
 But


like,
 you
 know,
 a
 draw
 down
 like
 this


will
 take
 a
 lot
 of
 money
 off
 the
 table.


And
 the
 the
 dollar
 size
 is
 a
 lot,
 but


then
 relative
 to
 the
 portfolio,
 it's


just
 like
 it's
 part
 of
 the
 swings
 that


you
 have
 to
 deal
 with.
 Even
 on
 names


that
 have
 made
 such
 massive
 moves,


obviously
 like
 a
 pounder
 and
 like
 a


hood.
 Pounder

 up
 to
 almost

 to

 SoFi.
 All


right,
 maybe
 we
 got
 the
 bottom
 on
 SoFi.


Maybe
 we
 did.
 2716


and
 the
 S&P
 trying
 to
 get
 back
 to
 670.


That's
 three
 reels
 for
 the
 day,
 bro.


That's
 That's
 more
 reels
 than
 I've
 ever


showed
 you
 guys
 in
 like
 a
 year.
 That's


more
 reels
 than
 I've
 showed
 in
 a
 year
 on


this
 channel,


which
 is
 wild,


bro.
 767
 of
 you
 guys
 followed
 me
 on


Instagram,
 and
 now
 I'm
 afraid
 to
 post
 on


Instagram.


Now
 all
 of
 you
 guys
 are
 gonna
 be
 judging


me
 on
 every
 post
 I
 make.
 Like
 I'm


actually
 kind
 of
 nervous,
 bro.
 Like
 I


don't
 even
 know
 what
 to
 post
 on


Instagram
 now.


I
 feel
 like
 everyone's
 gonna
 be
 judging


me.


There's
 only
 one
 account
 I
 follow
 on


Instagram
 and
 it's
 Nvidia.


It's
 hilarious.
 They're
 like
 they
 were


like,
 "You
 have
 to
 follow
 an
 account
 to


sign
 up."
 And
 I
 was
 like,
 "Okay,
 I
 guess


I'll
 follow
 Nvidia."
 Like
 I
 was
 like,


"That's
 the
 one
 account
 that
 I
 follow.


Uh,
 okay.
 So,
 the
 results
 of
 the
 poll


officially
 are
 Nebius
 at
 33%,
 Hood's
 at


32%
 though
 with
 the
 best
 buy
 of
 the
 day


as
 per
 Michael's
 question


and
 uh,
 Palenter's
 at
 25.
 Rocket
 Lab


didn't
 get
 that
 much
 love.
 Rocket
 Lab
 at


10%.


I
 mean,
 look,
 I
 probably
 agree
 it's


probably
 Nebus
 or
 Hood.
 Uh,
 I
 do
 think


Pal
 is
 gonna
 have
 a
 really
 good
 earnings


and
 I
 kind
 of
 dude
 I
 kind
 of
 think


Palantry
 can
 make
 a
 run
 to
 200.
 Now,
 I


know
 valuation
 wise
 that
 would
 be
 tough


to
 understand
 and
 I
 get
 it,
 but
 so
 is


180.
 It's
 not
 like
 180
 is
 the
 most
 uh


easy
 valuation
 to
 digest.
 I
 just
 think


they're
 going
 to
 have
 one
 of
 those


quarters
 that
 the
 street's
 going
 to
 have


no
 choice
 but
 to
 say
 this
 growth
 story


is
 not
 slowing
 down.
 Having
 said
 that,


if
 it
 stays
 flat
 or
 goes
 down
 even
 after


really
 good
 results,
 no
 one
 can
 complain


because
 Palinger
 is
 up
 140%
 this
 year.


Um,


I
 do
 think
 Hood's
 going to
 have
 a
 good


quarter
 as
 well.
 I
 think
 Nebis
 is
 going


to
 have
 a
 really
 good
 quarter.
 And
 the


thing
 about
 Nebis
 is
 they
 could
 also


announce
 another
 deal.
 Maybe
 not
 this


quarter,
 but
 they
 could
 signal
 that


they're
 getting
 closer
 to
 another
 deal


and
 that
 could
 be
 pretty
 strong
 for
 them


as
 well.
 In
 terms
 of
 which
 one
 is
 the


most
 undervalued,


I
 mean,
 relative
 to
 growth
 rate
 versus


market
 cap,
 it
 has
 to
 be
 Nebus,
 right?


Like
 Hood
 and
 Palanteer
 are
 hundred


billion
 dollar
 companies.
 Nebus
 is
 at
 24


billion.
 They've
 quintipple
 quintupled


their
 revenue
 and
 again
 they're
 not
 at


140
 anymore.
 So
 they're
 they're
 only
 up


if
 we
 do
 the
 math
 after
 that
 Microsoft


deal.


They
 are
 now
 up
 uh


I
 shouldn't
 say
 only.
 They're
 only
 up


50%
 but
 they
 were
 up
 like
 150%.
 So
 like


it's
 still
 a
 pretty
 big
 move
 they
 made


since
 the
 Microsoft
 deal


but
 that
 Microsoft
 deal
 really
 did


change
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 earnings
 trajectory


for
 them
 as
 well.


Um,


so
 that's
 what
 you
 got
 there.
 How
 about


Tesla?
 Can
 we
 talk
 about
 Tesla
 because


we
 haven't
 even
 cover
 so
 let's
 talk


about
 Tesla
 and
 then
 I'll
 be
 out.
 Tesla


435
 and
 let's
 do
 a
 pump
 or
 dump
 poll.


I'll
 be
 live
 at
 3:45.
 I
 think
 I'll
 have


Jose
 with
 me.
 If
 not,
 we
 might
 have
 some


other
 people,
 but
 you
 know
 Tesla
 will
 be


the
 big
 story
 of
 the
 day.
 There's
 a


couple
 other
 companies
 that
 are


reporting
 as
 well,
 but
 Tesla
 will
 be
 the


important
 one.
 So
 Tesla
 pump
 or
 dump?


What
 do
 we
 think?
 Um,


and
 what
 perspectives
 do
 we
 have


on
 Tessie?
 Here's
 the
 thing
 that
 I'm


thinking
 for
 Tesla,
 and
 I
 said
 this


yesterday,
 but
 I
 don't
 know
 what
 the


company
 will
 be
 able
 to
 say
 on


electricity,


energy,
 power,
 uh,
 deliveries,


or
 FSD
 to
 to
 get
 this
 thing
 to
 really
 go


higher.
 Given
 it's
 up
 so
 much
 from
 335,


I
 think
 Elon
 will
 be
 able
 to
 paint
 a


story
 after
 the
 earnings
 that
 are
 out


that
 basically
 says
 Tesla
 is
 the


greatest
 physical
 AI
 company
 that's
 out


there
 in
 the
 market
 and
 that


theoretically
 could
 help
 the
 stock.
 Now


granted,
 if
 the
 stock
 was
 at
 330,
 this


would
 be
 a
 different
 question,
 but
 the


stock
 is
 up
 way
 above
 330
 and
 most


people
 did
 probably
 didn't
 think
 it


would
 even
 touch
 the
 400s
 given
 how
 much


it
 was
 stuck
 in
 the
 low
 300s.
 And


there's
 no
 earnings
 growth
 for
 it
 to
 go


up.
 So,
 it's
 just
 pure
 excitement
 on
 the


trillion
 dollar
 pay
 package
 and
 the
 XAI


equity
 stake
 and
 El
 Elon
 buying
 a


billion
 dollars
 of
 stock.
 I
 just
 think


they
 need
 to
 have
 a
 quarter
 that
 doesn't


mess
 up
 any
 of
 their
 momentum.
 And
 as


long
 as
 that
 happens,
 I
 think
 Tesla


stays
 strong
 and
 at least
 it
 holds
 the


420s,
 you
 could
 say.
 But
 I
 really
 don't


know
 what
 gets
 Tesla
 to
 move
 to
 like


450,
 460.
 I
 see
 the
 problem
 with
 robo


taxi
 news
 all
 these
 headlines
 that
 they


could
 put
 out
 whether
 it's
 optimist
 robo


taxi
 any
 of
 this
 stuff
 none
 of
 this
 I


think
 is
 going
 to
 change
 the
 dynamics
 of


the
 earnings
 picture
 so
 it
 would
 be
 old


narrative
 so
 then
 the
 question
 becomes


is
 the
 narrative
 good
 enough
 and
 it's


like
 yeah
 sometimes
 the
 narrative
 is


good
 enough
 but
 the
 narrative
 is
 good


enough
 when
 the
 stock's
 in
 the
 gutter


Tesla's
 not
 in
 the
 gutter
 it
 was
 in
 the


gutter
 but
 then
 after
 Elon
 bought
 shares


and
 that
 pay
 package
 came
 out


stock's
 up
 a
 lot
 from
 the
 lows
 I
 mean


the
 stock
 was
 at
 240
 on
 the
 lows
 it's
 at


435
 year
 to
 date
 it's
 up
 15%.


So,
 my
 gut
 tells
 me
 it's
 not
 going
 to
 be


a
 a
 fun
 quarter
 for
 the
 stock.
 Uh,
 and
 I


definitely
 wouldn't
 bet
 on
 it
 like
 or


like
 take
 an
 earnings
 gamble,
 but
 maybe


they
 announce
 something.
 I
 mean,
 they're


not
 buying
 back
 their
 stock.
 You
 know,


they
 have
 38
 billion
 in
 cash,
 but
 like


the
 street
 already
 knows
 a
 lot
 of
 the


numbers.
 It's
 like
 the
 numbers
 can't
 be


the
 surprise.
 The
 surprise
 is
 going
 to


have
 to
 be
 Elon
 announcing
 something


that
 we
 don't
 know
 about
 FSD
 or
 robotics


or
 energy
 or
 like
 energy
 demand
 is
 going


insane.
 We
 just
 signed
 a
 contract
 with


Nvidia
 to
 power
 a
 bunch
 of
 data
 centers


in
 the
 Dominican
 Republic
 and
 Tesla's


going to
 be
 the
 battery
 pack
 that
 like


you
 know
 something
 like
 that
 maybe.


But
 outside
 of
 that
 announcement,
 I
 I


just
 don't
 know
 what
 to
 expect
 for


Tesla.
 Camila
 said
 they
 will
 show
 off


the
 Optimus
 3
 in
 the
 shareholder


meeting.
 I
 wouldn't
 doubt
 that.
 That


would
 be
 pretty
 cool
 in
 uh
 November,


what
 is
 that?
 November
 6th.


But
 I
 wonder
 if
 that
 is
 enough
 for
 the


stock
 to
 get
 some
 momentum
 here.


Most
 of
 you
 guys
 say
 dump.
 Wow.
 60%
 of


you
 saying
 dump.


60%
 of
 people


saying
 dump
 on
 this.
 I
 don't
 think
 it


has
 to
 dump.
 That's
 the
 thing.
 By
 the


way,
 for
 those
 asking
 for
 Tanner's


video,
 I
 just
 put
 his
 link
 in
 the
 chat


so
 you
 can
 go
 to
 his
 channel
 to
 uh
 to


see
 a
 SoFi
 video.
 I
 don't
 think
 it
 has


to
 dump.
 I
 just
 don't
 think
 it
 has
 to
 go


to
 the
 moon.


And
 maybe
 that's,
 you
 know,
 taking
 the


easy
 answer
 out
 saying
 it'll
 be
 flat,


but
 like


I
 think
 there's
 enough
 momentum
 to
 not


have
 this
 one
 tank.
 Also,
 they
 did
 have,


you
 know,
 way
 better
 deliveries
 than


expected.
 So,
 the
 numbers
 shouldn't
 be


so
 abhorent
 like
 they
 were
 two
 quarters


ago
 where
 you
 would
 expect
 like
 a


massive
 10%
 draw
 down
 as
 soon
 as
 the


numbers
 come
 out.
 Beyond
 Meat
 still
 up


19%.


It
 lost
 750
 back
 to
 430.
 Look
 at
 that


red
 candle
 all
 the
 way
 down
 back
 into


the
 430s,


but
 still
 up
 20%
 on
 the
 day.


All right,
 I
 think
 that's
 it
 for
 me,


folks.
 That's
 what
 we
 got.
 Uh
 I'll
 be


back
 on
 the
 market
 close.


Very,
 very
 choppy
 choppy
 day.
 Uh
 I
 will


be
 live
 at
 uh
 12:30
 actually
 on
 Twitter.


So,
 we're
 going
 to
 be
 talking
 about
 a


stock
 called
 GXO.
 This
 is
 a
 logistics


company.
 I
 do
 not
 have
 a
 position
 in


this.
 Uh,
 but
 this
 is
 another
 one
 that


should
 be
 important
 in
 this
 broader


onshoring,
 re-industrialization,


semiconductor
 theme
 that
 we've
 been


talking
 about.
 So,
 I'll
 put
 my
 Twitter


in
 the
 chat.
 I
 will
 be
 live
 on
 Twitter


spaces.
 It'll
 be
 30
 minutes
 12:30
 to
 1


p.m.


and
 then
 we'll
 be
 back
 for
 the
 close
 and


we'll
 see
 what
 we
 got
 on
 Tesla
 earnings.


Summary
 of
 the
 day
 is
 it's
 choppy.
 There


is
 no
 real
 headline
 that
 I
 can
 give


anyone
 for
 why
 the
 S&P
 is
 down
 .026,
 but


then
 again,
 the
 S&P
 is
 only
 down
 0.26.


A
 lot
 of
 momentum
 stocks
 still
 getting


hit
 pretty
 bad.
 Probably
 not
 the
 worst


thing
 in
 the
 world
 for
 some
 of
 the
 names


that
 don't
 have
 a
 ton
 of
 fundamentals.


The
 other
 momentum
 stocks
 that
 are


getting
 hit
 that
 do
 have
 fundamentals


like
 a
 Nebus,
 like
 a
 Hood,
 those


probably
 come
 back
 over
 time.
 And
 now
 we


just
 got
 to
 see
 how
 Tesla
 earnings


kicks
 off
 the
 MAG
 7.


and
 we'll
 get
 those
 results
 later
 at
 the


end
 of
 the
 day.


All
 right,
 cool.
 Yes,
 I
 did
 buy
 SoFi.


2750.
 No,
 2680
 is
 what
 I
 bought
 so
 far.


2680.


Summary,
 we
 watched
 three
 reels.


Exactly.


Those
 are
 good
 reels
 though,
 dude.
 Those


are
 fun
 reels.


There's
 other
 reels
 that
 people
 send
 me


just
 like,
 dude,
 what's
 what
 is
 the


point
 of
 this?
 All right,
 word
 of
 the


day.
 What
 do
 we
 got?
 Word
 of
 the
 day
 is


Lanni.


>> Lai
 or
 Lai.


>> Dude,
 I
 had
 I
 had
 so
 much
 hope
 when
 she


said
 or.
 I
 was
 like,
 I'm
 going
 to
 be


right.
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 be
 that
 wrong.


I'm
 going
 to
 be
 right.
 She
 said
 or.
 I


have
 a
 shot
 on
 that.
 Or.


And
 no.
 Dude,
 tell
 me
 this
 doesn't
 look


like
 a
 Lanny.


This
 looks
 like
 a
 freaking
 Lanny.


Lai
 or
 Lai.


>> I
 really
 thought
 when
 she
 said
 or
 I
 was


going
 to
 be
 like
 or
 Lanni.
 I
 was
 like,


see,
 I'm
 okay.
 A
 veranda,
 especially
 a


fully
 furnished
 one,
 uses
 a
 living
 room.


What
 the
 heck
 is
 a
 veranda?


A

Dude,
 these
 word
 of
 the
 days
 have
 been


trashed
 for
 the
 past
 couple
 weeks.


We
 need
 some
 better
 word
 of
 the
 days.


We
 need
 some
 much
 better
 words
 of
 the


days.
 But
 there
 you
 go.
 That's
 what
 you


got.


Lai


is
 your
 word
 of
 the

 you


never
 heard
 of
 a

 How
 have
 you
 heard


of
 a
 lai?
 This
 is
 not
 This
 cannot
 be
 a


common
 word,
 bro.
 People
 use
 this
 word


often
 to
 talk
 about
 their
 roof.
 Like


what?


I've
 never
 heard
 of
 this
 word,
 bro.
 I've


Yeah,
 I've
 heard
 of
 deck.
 I've
 heard
 of


deck.
 That's
 a
 normal
 word.
 Deck.


I
 thought
 it
 was
 Lanny.
 Every

 I
 use


this
 word.
 All

 those

Aid,
 I
 highly
 recommend
 taking
 American


English
 course
 on
 how
 to
 talk
 an


American
 accent.
 Speaking
 of
 American


English,

 me
 of


Duallingingo,
 which
 reminds
 me
 of
 the


stock
 draft.
 Let's
 look
 at
 that
 real


quick.
 Uh,

 six.
 Tanner's

 Chris
 is

 8.7.


All
 right.
 So,
 Matt
 still
 in
 the
 lead.


All
 right.
 That's
 it
 for
 me.
 Thank

 the
 Twitter
