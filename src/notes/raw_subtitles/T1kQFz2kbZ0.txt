[Applause]


thank
 you
 very
 much
 for
 that
 very
 kind


too
 kind
 introduction
 Tron
 it's
 very


nice
 to
 be
 with
 you
 uh
 today
 and
 uh
 I'm


going
 to
 share
 with
 you
 a
 framework
 that


I
 often
 use
 at
 at
 Stanford
 University


when
 I
 think
 about
 managing
 the
 Stanford


endowment
 and
 it
 really
 focuses
 on
 three


things
 that
 we
 have
 to
 do
 right
 we
 have


to
 do
 well
 if
 we
 want
 to
 be
 successful


in
 the
 long
 in
 the
 long
 run
 for
 Stanford


I
 call
 them
 the
 three
 pillars
 of


investment
 success
 they
 are
 strategy


execution
 and
 governance
 so
 I'm
 going
 to


talk
 about
 each
 one
 of
 those
 briefly
 and


then
 I'll
 finish
 with
 uh
 sharing
 some
 of


our
 long-term
 uh
 investment
 results
 with


you
 but
 before
 I
 start
 just
 to
 orient


ourselves
 maybe
 I'll
 I'll
 mention
 a


couple
 high
 level
 facts
 about
 Stanford


so
 Stanford
 University
 is
 a
 research


University
 located
 in
 Palo
 Alto


California
 about
 1
 hour
 south
 of
 San


Francisco
 in
 the
 middle
 of
 what's


sometimes
 referred
 to
 as
 silicon
 Valley


in
 fact
 the
 technology
 ecosystem
 that
 is


Silicon
 Valley
 really
 built
 itself


around
 Stanford
 over
 the
 last
 50
 or
 60


years
 and
 important
 companies
 like


Google
 were
 actually
 uh
 started
 on
 the


Stanford
 campus
 the
 University
 was


founded
 in
 the
 late
 1800s
 uh
 and


unusually
 at
 the
 time
 it
 was
 founded
 as


a
 co-educational
 school
 so
 the
 very


first
 class
 that
 matriculated
 at


Stanford
 had
 both
 men
 and
 women
 in
 it


today
 there's
 7,000
 undergraduates
 at


Stanford
 10,000
 000
 graduate
 students


and
 2,300
 faculty
 members
 the
 endowment


as
 as
 Tron
 just
 uh
 mentioned
 is
 about


$40
 billion
 and
 this
 year
 it
 will


distribute
 to
 the
 operating
 budget
 of
 of


the
 University
 $2
 billion
 so
 that
 is
 the


single
 largest
 line
 item
 in
 Stanford's


$9
 billion
 operating
 budget
 so
 that


brings
 me
 to
 the
 first
 thing
 that
 you


need
 to
 do
 right
 if
 you
 want
 to
 be
 a


successful
 long-term
 investor
 and
 that's


strategy
 and
 here's
 a
 quote
 from
 the


great
 Norwegian
 polar
 Explorer
 amans


Victory
 awaits
 him
 who
 has
 everything
 in


order
 people
 call
 it
 luck
 what
 a
 nice


succinct
 way
 to
 talk
 about
 strategy
 you


have
 a
 goal
 you
 need
 to
 build
 a
 plan
 a


strategy
 to
 achieve
 your
 goal
 we
 have


two
 key
 goals
 for
 the
 Stanford
 endowment


one
 we
 want
 to
 be
 able
 to
 be
 a
 material


part
 of
 the
 of
 the
 life
 the
 academic


life
 of
 the
 current
 generation
 of


students
 and
 Scholars
 at
 Stanford
 so
 I


mentioned
 roughly
 $2
 billion
 do
 flowing


from
 the
 endowment
 this
 year
 it's
 about


5%
 of
 the
 value
 of
 the
 endowment
 that's


goal
 number
 one
 goal
 number
 two
 is
 we


want
 to
 be
 as
 at
 least
 as
 impactful
 and


supportive
 for
 all
 future
 generations
 of


students
 and
 Scholars
 at
 Stanford
 so


that
 introduces
 a
 concept
 that
 we
 call


the
 preservation
 of
 purchasing
 power
 so


that
 just
 means
 that
 if
 you're
 spending


5%
 every
 year
 from
 your
 endowment
 you


have
 to
 earn
 back
 at
 least
 that
 5%
 but


you'll
 also
 have
 to
 earn
 enough
 to


offset
 the
 impacts
 of


inflation
 the
 inflation
 that
 we
 care


about
 at
 Stanford
 is
 higher
 education


price
 inflation
 which
 tends
 to
 run
 a


little
 bit
 higher
 than
 Consumer
 Price


inflation
 so
 if
 CPI
 runs
 at
 2
 to
 3%
 over


40
 or
 50
 years
 higher
 education
 price


inflation
 is
 going
 to
 run
 at
 3
 to
 4%
 so


when
 you
 put
 5%
 of
 payout
 together
 with


4%
 inflation
 you
 you
 have
 a
 pretty
 high


you
 need
 to
 have
 a
 pretty
 high
 uh


expected
 return
 to
 offset
 uh
 your


spending
 and
 still
 preserve
 the


purchasing
 power
 of
 the
 endowment
 so
 the


way
 that
 we
 do
 that
 is
 we
 have
 an
 equity


bias
 in
 the
 portfolio
 equities
 have
 a


higher
 expected
 return
 Then
 fixed
 income


or
 cash
 and
 that's
 really
 important
 in


the
 long
 run
 if
 you
 want
 to
 achieve
 that


second
 goal
 unfortunately
 as
 we
 all
 know


equities
 are
 very
 risky
 you
 rank
 the


lowest
 in
 priority
 in
 the
 capital


structure
 it's
 much
 more
 uh
 possible
 to


lose
 your
 capital
 and
 have
 a
 capital


impairment
 equities
 are
 also
 very
 price


volatile
 and
 volatility
 is
 not
 not
 the


only
 risk
 that
 you
 care
 about
 it's
 not


even
 uh
 you
 know
 maybe
 not
 even
 the
 main


risk
 but
 it
 is
 a
 risk
 and
 the
 reason


that
 it
 is
 a
 risk
 is
 because
 unnecessary


or
 extra
 volatility
 work
 will
 that


you're
 not
 being
 paid
 for
 will
 erode


your
 long-term
 compound
 return
 so
 to


make
 this
 clear
 with
 a
 simple
 example
 if


you
 start
 with
 $100
 and
 you
 have
 a
 50%


return
 in
 year
 two
 and
 a
 negative
 50%


return
 sorry
 50%
 return
 in
 year
 1
 and
 a


negative
 50%
 return
 in
 year
 two
 where
 do


you
 end
 up
 well
 at
 the
 end
 of
 year
 one


your
 $100
 has
 become
 150
 and
 then
 in


year
 two
 you
 lose
 50%
 it
 becom
 75
 so


you're
 up
 50
 down
 50
 but
 you've
 just


lost
 25%
 of
 your
 money
 so
 volatility


erodes
 long-term
 compound
 returns
 you


can
 see
 that
 with
 the
 identity
 shown
 on


the
 bottom
 of
 the
 slide
 whenever


volatility
 is
 greater
 than
 zero
 your


geometric
 or
 your
 compound
 return
 will


be
 lower
 than
 your
 single
 period


expected
 arithmetic
 return
 so
 how
 do
 we


deal
 with
 that
 extra
 risk
 we
 diversify


we
 look
 for
 something
 that
 Noel
 laurat


Harry
 Marco
 it's
 called
 the
 free
 lunch


so
 we
 own
 different
 types
 of
 equities
 we


own
 some
 equities
 in
 the
 United
 States


some
 equities
 in
 Europe
 some
 equities
 in


Asia
 some
 that
 are
 purely
 corporate
 so


think
 of
 venture
 capital
 some
 that
 are


backed
 by
 physical
 assets
 so
 think
 of


real
 estate
 and
 when
 we
 put
 those
 uh


equities
 together
 they
 are
 positively


correlated
 with
 each
 other
 but
 they're


not
 perfectly
 correlated
 so
 we
 they


react
 somewhat
 differently
 to
 different


macroeconomic
 states
 of
 the
 world
 so


we're
 starting
 to
 gain
 some
 stability


through
 that
 diversification
 then
 we


introduced
 two
 other
 asset
 classes
 fixed


income
 and
 absolute
 return
 which
 is
 a


collection
 of
 carefully
 chosen


um
 relative
 value
 strategies
 from
 the


hedge
 fund
 world
 and
 we
 put
 them


together
 with
 the
 equity
 asset
 classes


in
 our
 portfolio
 we
 we
 end
 up
 with
 a


portfolio
 designed
 to
 give
 us
 a
 pretty


high
 expected
 return
 but
 with
 uh
 with
 uh


with
 low
 levels
 of
 volatility
 or


reasonable
 levels
 of
 volatility
 this
 is


our
 policy
 asset
 allocation
 at
 Stanford


right
 now
 so
 this
 is
 the
 the
 most


succinct
 way
 that
 I
 can
 explain
 our


strategy
 down
 the
 left
 hand
 side
 you
 can


see
 all
 the
 major
 asset
 classes
 as
 we


Define
 them
 on
 the
 right
 you
 can
 see


their
 policy
 Target
 weights
 and


everything
 on
 this
 slide
 is
 an
 equity


oriented
 asset
 class
 except
 for
 those


two
 middle
 asset
 classes
 absolute
 return


and
 fixed
 income
 if
 you
 do
 the
 quick


math
 you
 can
 see
 that
 the
 equity
 asset


classes
 add
 up
 to
 about
 70%
 of
 the


portfolio
 so
 here
 you
 can
 see
 we're


designing
 a
 strategy
 to
 achieve
 our
 goal


this
 is
 an
 equity
 oriented
 portfolio
 yet


it
 has
 substantial
 levels
 of


diversification
 when
 we
 model
 this


portfolio
 it
 gives
 us
 an
 expected
 single


period
 return
 of
 8.3%
 so
 that's
 def
 ated


by
 higher
 education
 price
 inflation


expected
 volatility
 of
 15%
 on
 an
 annual


basis
 and
 that
 leads
 to
 a
 compound


return
 expectation
 of
 7.11%
 net
 of
 net


of
 inflation
 so
 if
 this
 is
 true
 if
 we


designed
 the
 if
 we
 specified
 the


portfolio
 correctly
 and
 we
 achieve
 a
 7%


real
 return
 we
 can
 pay
 out
 5%
 a
 year
 or


even
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 and
 still


preserve
 their
 purchasing
 power
 of
 the


Endowment
 for
 future


Generations
 the
 next
 key
 pillar
 that
 we


have
 to
 get
 right
 is
 execution
 and
 this


is
 one
 of
 my
 favorite
 quotes
 from
 the


American
 inventor
 Thomas
 Edison


opportunity
 is
 missed
 by
 most
 people


because
 it
 become
 it
 comes
 dressed
 in


overalls
 and
 looks
 like
 work
 and
 and


this
 really
 is
 what
 we
 do
 most
 days
 at


Stanford
 management
 company
 we
 execute


against
 the
 strategy
 that
 I
 just
 showed


you
 so
 execution
 has
 a
 couple
 parts
 the


first
 is
 portfolio
 management
 so
 every


day
 we
 get
 a
 flash
 estimate
 of
 where
 the


portfolio
 is
 comes
 at
 about
 7:30
 a.m.


and
 we
 may
 start
 to
 make
 one
 of
 two


types
 of
 actions
 the
 first
 is
 we
 may


rebalance
 the
 portfolio
 between
 asset


classes
 so
 as
 Market
 movements
 take


those
 asset
 classes
 away
 from
 their


policy
 weights
 the
 the
 the
 risk
 return


and
 liquidity
 characteristics
 of
 the


portfolio
 start
 to
 shift
 from
 what
 we


think
 is
 ideal
 so
 we
 will
 normally
 sell


what's
 gone
 up
 in
 value
 and
 bring
 it


back
 down
 to
 Target
 and
 we'll
 buy
 what's


gone
 down
 in
 value
 and
 bring
 it
 back
 up


to
 Target
 and
 that
 way
 we
 preserve
 the


right
 risk
 return
 for
 the
 portfolio


going
 forward
 so
 that's
 rebalanced


sometimes
 we
 rebalance
 once
 a
 week
 or


once
 every
 two
 weeks
 in
 volatile
 Capital


Market
 environments
 we
 may
 rebalance


every


day
 the
 second
 type
 of
 portfolio


management
 that
 we
 conduct
 is
 rotating


Capital
 inside
 of
 asset
 classes
 so
 I


should
 take
 a
 moment
 and
 explain
 that


the
 security
 level
 decisions
 for
 the


Stanford
 endowment
 are
 made
 by
 external


partners
 that
 we
 find
 we
 identify
 we
 try


to
 build
 long-term
 relationships
 these


are
 very
 specialist
 Partners
 very
 very


good
 at
 what
 they
 do
 whether
 it's
 stock


picking
 or
 venture
 capital
 or
 private


real
 estate
 it's
 very
 hard
 to
 find
 these


partners
 and
 I'll
 talk
 about
 that
 in
 a


minute
 but
 once
 we
 have
 found
 them
 we


have
 a
 strong
 trustful
 communication
 and


when
 their
 opportunity
 set
 evolves
 we


can
 take
 some
 action
 to
 optimize


Stanford's
 Capital
 so
 if
 their


opportunity
 set
 gets
 more
 attractive
 we


can
 give
 them
 more
 money
 if
 it
 gets
 a


little
 bit
 less
 attractive
 we
 can
 take


some
 money
 back
 so
 we're
 always
 doing


that
 the
 combination
 of
 rebalancing


between
 asset
 classes
 and
 rotating
 capit


Capital
 within
 an
 asset
 class
 can


sometimes
 take
 up
 30
 40
 or
 even
 50%
 of


the
 value
 of
 the
 endowment
 in
 a
 single


year
 so
 they're
 very
 we're
 very
 active


in
 managing
 the


portfolio
 so
 I
 mentioned
 external


Partners
 this
 is
 a
 really
 critical
 part


of
 execution
 uh
 and
 a
 huge
 part
 of
 what


we
 spend
 time
 on
 at
 Stanford
 management


company
 these
 are
 generally
 speaking


pretty
 small
 Niche
 Boutique
 investment


firms
 that
 we
 find
 they're
 very


principally
 oriented
 you
 probably


wouldn't
 know
 the
 names
 of
 most
 of
 them


um
 and
 I'll
 tell
 you
 what
 we
 look
 for


when
 we
 when
 we
 when
 we
 when
 we
 go


looking
 for
 new
 partners
 first
 of
 all
 we


want
 to
 see
 discipline
 we
 want
 to
 see


partners
 that
 understand
 the
 difference


between
 investment
 and
 speculation


understand
 that
 some
 things
 can
 be


analyzed
 with
 a
 high
 degree
 of
 rigor
 and


some
 things
 can't
 be
 and
 we
 want
 them
 to


focus
 their
 investment
 work
 on
 the


former
 and
 not
 the
 latter
 we
 want
 them


to
 have
 a
 strong
 thorough
 and
 repeatable


process
 something
 that
 we
 can
 see
 and


feel
 in
 touch
 that
 surfaces
 all
 the
 hard


and
 soft
 Vari


that
 they
 need
 to
 think
 about
 in
 any


given
 situation
 and
 then
 finally
 we


wanted
 them
 to
 take
 all
 that
 data
 and


apply
 Superior
 investment
 judgment


that's
 the
 hardest
 part
 for
 us
 to
 sus


out
 when
 we're
 meeting
 with
 a
 new


partner
 um
 really
 how
 do
 they
 assess


risk
 and
 return
 what
 kind
 of
 weights
 do


they
 put
 on
 the
 various
 parts
 of
 their


investment
 thesis
 and
 usually
 when
 we


make
 a
 mistake
 about
 a
 partner
 it's


usually
 that
 we
 we
 get
 their
 uh


investment
 judgment
 uh
 wrong
 we
 like
 it


when
 our
 partners
 have
 the
 appropriate


amount
 of
 capital


so
 investment
 success
 often
 leads
 people


to
 have
 too
 much
 Capital
 they
 kind
 of


outgrow
 their
 competitive
 Sweet
 Spot


it's
 very
 common
 we'd
 like
 it
 when
 that


happens
 that
 our
 partners
 return
 Capital


to
 us
 and
 so
 it's
 really
 important
 that


that
 size
 doesn't
 become
 the
 enemy
 of


performance
 in
 our
 portfolio
 and
 finally


we
 we
 try
 to
 structure
 a
 a
 strong


economic
 alignment
 of
 Interest
 with
 our


partners
 so
 are
 we
 compensating
 them


appropriately
 over
 the
 right
 time


Horizon
 over
 the
 right
 cost
 of
 capital


are
 they
 putting
 their
 money
 alongside


us
 uh
 so
 that
 we're
 eating
 the
 same


cooking
 do
 they
 do
 well
 when
 they
 do


well
 for
 Stanford
 these
 are
 all


important
 parts
 of
 what
 makes
 a


successful
 long-term
 relationship
 I


should
 also
 mention
 at
 Stanford
 that
 we


believe
 long-term
 investment
 success


requires
 an
 appropriate
 regard
 for
 human


and
 environmental
 welfare
 so
 we
 insist


that
 our
 partners
 have
 that
 same


philosophy
 that
 philosophical
 alignment


of
 interest
 is
 just
 as
 important
 as
 the


economic
 this
 slide
 sort
 of
 gives
 you


some
 data
 on
 why
 partner
 selection
 or


security
 selection
 is
 so
 important
 we're


looking
 at
 leverage
 buyout
 funds
 from


the
 United
 States
 uh
 formed
 between
 2000


and
 2001
 and
 20
 2020
 so
 these
 are


reasonably
 mature
 buyout
 funds
 the
 top


doed
 line
 line
 is
 the
 top
 fifth


percentile
 buyout
 result
 for
 that
 year


the
 bottom
 line
 is
 the
 bottom
 fifth


percentile
 and
 the
 and
 the
 median
 is


shown
 in
 the
 solid
 line
 in
 the
 middle
 so


one
 thing
 immediately
 jumps
 out
 from
 the


slide
 if
 you're
 if
 you're
 in
 the
 top
 of


the
 distribution
 if
 you're
 in
 the
 top


fifth
 percentile
 of
 the
 leverage
 buyout


Universe
 in
 the
 United
 States
 you're


outperforming
 a
 medium
 by
 around
 20


points
 per
 year
 these
 are
 net
 annual


irrs
 so
 20
 points
 per
 year
 on
 a
 closed


in
 fund
 that's
 10
 or
 12
 years
 in
 in
 in


life
 is
 a
 really
 is
 a
 lot
 of
 money
 at


the
 end
 of
 the
 day
 so
 that's
 an


incredible
 outcome
 if
 you
 can
 be
 in
 the


top
 of
 the
 distribution
 the
 second
 thing


that
 jumps
 off
 the
 slide
 is
 look
 at
 how


bad
 you
 do
 if
 you're
 in
 the
 bottom
 of


the
 distribution
 if
 you're
 the
 bottom


fifth
 percentile
 you're
 under
 performing


the
 median
 by
 20
 points
 per
 year
 you're


almost
 certainly
 ending
 up
 with
 a
 a


result
 that's
 that's
 uh
 that's
 below
 the


public
 markets
 that
 you
 could
 access
 for


you
 know
 very
 easily
 for
 low
 cost
 so


this
 slide
 really
 um
 is
 why
 execution
 is


so
 important
 if
 you
 have
 a
 complex


strategy
 like
 Stanford
 you
 have
 to
 feel


certain
 that
 you
 can
 be
 in
 the
 top
 of


the
 distribution
 in
 this
 type
 of
 asset


class
 I
 could
 show
 you
 similar
 slides


for
 Venture
 Capital
 it
 would
 be
 be
 even


more
 dramatic
 private
 real
 estate


absolute
 return
 strategies
 all
 of
 them


show
 this
 type
 of
 dispersion
 which
 means


that
 you
 really
 need
 to
 execute
 well
 if


you
 have
 the
 type
 of
 strategy
 that


Stanford


has
 how
 do
 you
 execute
 well
 well
 you


have
 to
 have
 the
 right
 team
 so
 we
 uh
 we


look
 for
 we
 hire
 people
 that
 are
 very


intellectually
 curious
 we
 heard
 about


this
 from
 some
 of
 the
 early
 speakers


people
 that
 really
 want
 to
 continually


grow
 as
 investors
 that
 seek
 and
 accept
 a


high
 degree
 of
 personal
 accountability


for
 their
 work
 so
 I
 often
 tell
 our


analyst
 at
 Stanford
 management
 company


you
 are
 the
 Stanford
 endowment
 I
 I


really
 want
 them
 to
 internalize
 uh
 their


work
 for
 Stanford
 it
 helps
 that
 they're


motivated
 by
 Stanford's
 uh
 academic


Mission
 this
 is
 you
 know
 it's
 hard
 work


and
 and
 and
 and
 so
 having
 some


psychological
 benefit
 knowing
 that


you're
 doing
 something
 that
 is
 very


valuable
 for
 the
 world
 is
 really


important
 for
 the


team
 we
 also
 try
 to
 grow
 our
 own
 Talent


so
 we're
 often
 hiring
 right
 out
 of


Stanford
 undergraduate
 uh
 and
 and


training
 our
 own
 training
 our
 own


investment
 professional
 in
 fact
 I'm


joined
 today
 by
 my
 colleague
 TAA


Rosenberg
 who's
 an
 analyst
 in
 our
 office


TAA
 is
 was
 born
 and
 raised
 in


Oslo
 she
 went
 to
 Stanford
 undergraduate


and
 While
 She
 Was
 An
 undergraduate
 there


uh
 she
 took
 our
 class
 in
 economics
 that


we
 teach
 once
 a
 year
 and
 she
 became
 an


intern
 in
 our
 office
 after
 she
 got
 her


Master's
 Degree
 she
 joined
 us
 full-time


and
 so
 it's
 TAA
 is
 a
 great
 example
 of


someone
 who's
 intellectually
 curious


seeks
 and
 accepts
 a
 high
 degree
 of


personal
 accountability
 and
 is
 very


motivated
 by
 Stanford's
 Mission
 we're


delighted
 to
 have
 her
 on
 the
 team


you
 take
 the
 right
 people
 and
 you
 put


them
 in
 the
 right
 culture
 so
 we
 have
 a


very
 open
 collaborative
 culture
 I
 like


to
 think
 we're
 all
 in
 the
 same
 rowo


pulling
 towards
 the
 same
 Shore
 we
 all


sit
 on
 the
 same
 open
 floor
 plan
 we
 try


to
 reduce
 bureaucracy
 we
 try
 to
 minimize


hierarchy
 that's
 a
 lot
 better
 for


communication
 it's
 a
 lot
 better
 for


training
 your
 Junior
 professionals
 and


it's
 also
 a
 lot
 more
 fun
 and
 having
 fun


is
 a
 really
 important
 part
 of
 long-term


success
 so
 the
 final
 final
 pillar
 of


investment
 success
 is
 governance
 and


this
 one
 is
 talked
 about
 less
 but
 it's


just
 as
 important
 here's
 a
 great
 quote


from
 another
 uh
 incredibly
 impressive


Norwegian
 polar
 Explorer
 nonon
 the


difficult
 is
 what
 takes
 a
 little
 time


the
 impossible
 is
 what
 takes
 a
 little


longer
 and
 this
 is
 a
 great
 quote
 about


governance
 so
 governance
 just
 as


important
 as
 the
 other
 two
 pillars
 and


good
 governance
 supports
 the
 disciplined


execution
 of
 the
 right
 strategy
 and
 this


is
 really
 critically
 important


particularly
 in
 times
 of
 Market
 extremes


so
 you
 can
 think
 of
 a
 time
 of
 extreme


Euphoria
 where
 there's
 some
 hot
 sector


some
 hot
 asset
 class
 of
 the
 day
 that's


dramatically
 outperforming
 everything


else
 and
 by
 definition
 your
 Diversified


portfolio
 will
 underperform
 that
 hot


sector
 and
 bad
 governance
 would
 would


say
 chase
 that
 sector
 always
 go
 with
 a


you
 know
 try
 to
 catch
 up
 with
 what's


performing
 well
 that's
 unlikely
 to
 work


out
 well
 over
 time
 and
 certainly
 would


entail
 taking
 a
 lot
 of
 risk
 the
 other


type
 of
 extreme
 is
 fear
 and
 panic
 so


think
 of
 the
 fall
 of
 2008
 when
 everybody


was
 selling
 every
 risky
 asset
 and
 trying


to
 raise
 cash
 the
 right
 thing
 to
 do
 in


that
 invironment
 if
 you
 were
 an


Institutional
 Investor
 was
 to
 buy
 the


things
 that
 people
 were
 selling
 buy
 the


things
 that
 had
 fallen
 40%
 50%
 60%
 and


sell
 the
 other
 stuff
 to
 rebalance
 your


portfolio
 to
 bring
 the
 desired
 risk
 and


return
 back
 to
 the
 portfolio
 on
 a
 go


forward
 basis
 so
 governance
 reinforces


the
 discipline
 execution
 of
 the
 right


strategy
 and
 shelters
 the
 management


team
 from
 external
 influences
 that
 might


make
 that
 very


hard
 okay
 so
 uh
 just
 uh
 to
 finish
 on


this
 one
 this
 is
 our
 long-term


investment
 uh
 results
 so
 if
 you
 had


taken
 so
 Stanford
 management
 company
 was


formed
 in
 1991
 to
 professionally
 manage


the
 endowment
 if
 you
 had
 taken
 $100
 in


1991
 and
 invested
 it
 in
 the
 endowment


portfolio
 you
 would
 have
 made
 32
 times


your
 money
 by
 the
 middle
 of
 last
 year


that's
 roughly
 double
 the
 result
 that


you
 would
 have
 achieved
 in
 a
 in
 a


typical
 uh
 us
 endowment
 uh
 fund
 and


roughly
 four
 times
 uh
 the
 result
 that


you
 would
 have
 achieved
 had
 you
 taken


that
 same
 $100
 and
 invested
 it
 in
 a
 7030


portfolio
 70%
 Global
 equities
 30%
 high


quality
 Bond
 so
 if
 you
 can
 if
 you
 form


the
 right
 strategy
 if
 you
 specify
 the


right
 strategy
 based
 on
 the
 goals
 that


matter
 to
 you
 if
 you
 have
 the
 ability
 to


execute
 on
 that
 strategy
 and
 then
 you


have
 good
 governance
 that
 protects
 you


from
 outside
 interference
 you
 can
 get


uh
 attractive
 long-term
 investment


results
 thank
 you
 very
 much
