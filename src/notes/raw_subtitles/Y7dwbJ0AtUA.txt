I
 think
 we
 don't
 yet
 know
 the
 shape
 and


form
 of
 the
 ultimate
 products.
 Just
 one


just
 obvious
 historical
 analogy
 is
 you


know
 the
 personal
 computer
 from
 sort
 of


invention
 in
 1975
 through
 to
 you
 know


basically
 1992
 was
 a
 text
 prompt
 system


17
 years
 in
 you
 know
 the
 whole
 industry


took
 a
 left
 turn
 into
 gooies
 and
 never


looked
 back
 and
 then
 by
 the
 way
 you
 know


5
 years
 after
 that
 the
 industry
 took
 a


left
 turn
 into
 web
 browsers
 and
 never


looked
 back
 right
 and
 you
 know
 look
 I'm


I'm
 sure
 there
 will
 be
 chat
 bots
 20


years
 from
 now
 but
 I'm
 pretty
 confident


that
 both
 the
 current
 chatbot
 companies


and
 many
 new
 companies
 are
 going
 to


figure
 out
 many
 kinds
 of
 user


experiences
 that
 are
 radically
 different


that
 we
 don't
 we
 don't
 even
 know


Please
 join
 me
 in
 welcoming
 Mark
 Andre


and
 Ben
 Horowitz
 with
 general
 partner


Eric
 Torberg.


Follow
 me
 into
 our
 solo.
 Get
 in
 the
 flow


and
 you
 can
 pitch
 it
 like
 a
 photo.
 Music


makes
 me
 maintain
 and
 make
 melodies
 for


MC's
 motivation
 breaks.
 I'm
 never


>> Thank
 you
 for
 the
 rock
 Kim.
 Who
 did


that?


>> Ben
 picks
 the
 Ben
 picked
 the
 music.


Mark,
 there's
 been
 a
 lot
 of
 talk
 lately


about
 the
 limitations
 of
 LLMs
 that
 they


they
 can't
 do
 true
 invention
 of
 say
 new


science
 that
 they
 can't
 do
 true
 creative


genius
 that
 it's
 just
 combining
 or


packaging.


You
 have
 thoughts
 here.
 What
 say
 you?


>> Yeah.
 So,
 so
 for
 me,
 yes,
 you
 get
 all


these
 questions
 and
 yeah,
 they
 usually


come
 in
 either,
 you
 know,
 sort
 of
 are


are
 language
 models
 intelligent
 in
 the


sense
 of
 like
 can
 they
 actually
 um
 you


know,
 can
 they
 actually
 process


information
 and
 have
 sort
 of
 conceptual


breakthroughs?
 the
 way
 that
 people
 can.


And
 then
 there's
 are
 language
 models
 or


or
 video
 models
 creative,
 you
 know,
 can


they
 can
 they
 create
 new
 art?
 Um


actually
 have
 genuine
 creative


breakthroughs.
 And
 of
 course
 my
 my
 my


answer
 to
 both
 of
 those
 is
 well
 can


people
 do
 those
 things?
 Um
 and
 um
 I


think
 there's
 two
 two
 two
 questions


there
 which
 is
 like
 okay
 even
 if
 some


people
 are
 quote
 unquote
 intelligent
 as


in
 having
 original
 uh
 conceptual


breakthroughs
 and
 not
 just
 let's
 just


say
 regurgitating
 the
 training
 set
 um
 uh


or
 following
 scripts
 um
 uh
 how
 you
 know


what
 percentage
 of
 people
 can
 actually


do
 that
 and
 I
 say
 I've
 only
 met
 a
 few


some
 of
 them
 are
 here
 in
 the
 room
 um
 but


uh
 you
 know
 not
 that
 many
 most
 people


never
 do
 and
 then
 creativity
 I
 mean
 how


many
 people
 are
 actually
 genuinely


creative
 right
 and
 so
 you
 you
 kind
 of


point
 to
 a
 Beethoven
 or
 you
 know
 Van


Gogh
 or
 something
 like
 that
 you're
 like


Okay,
 that's
 creativity
 and
 yeah,
 that's


creativity
 and
 then
 how
 many
 Beethovenas


and
 Van
 Go
 are
 there?
 Obviously,
 not


very
 many.
 So,
 so
 one
 is
 just
 like
 okay,


like
 you
 know,
 if
 it's
 if
 it
 if
 if
 if


these
 things
 clear
 the
 bar
 of,
 you
 know,


99.99%
 of
 humanity,
 you
 know,
 then


that's
 pretty
 interesting
 just
 in
 and
 of


itself.
 But
 then
 I
 you
 dig
 into
 it


further
 and
 you're
 like,
 okay,
 like
 how


many
 actual
 real
 conceptual


breakthroughs
 have
 there
 ever
 been


actually
 ever
 in
 human
 history
 as


compared
 to
 sort
 of
 remixing
 remixing


ideas.
 Um
 and
 you
 know
 like
 if
 you
 look


at
 the
 history
 of
 technology
 it's
 almost


always
 the
 case
 that
 the
 big


breakthroughs
 are
 the
 result
 of
 you
 know


usually
 at
 least
 40
 years
 of
 sort
 of


work
 ahead
 of
 time
 you
 know
 four
 decades


right
 in
 fact
 language
 models
 themselves


are
 the
 culmination
 of
 eight
 decades


right
 of
 previous
 work
 and
 so
 there's


remixing
 and
 then
 in
 the
 arts
 it's
 the


exact
 same
 thing
 you
 know
 novels
 and


music
 and
 everything
 like
 you
 know
 there


are
 clearly
 creative
 leaps
 but
 you
 know


there's
 just
 tremendous
 amounts
 of


influence
 that
 came
 in
 from
 from
 people


who
 came
 before
 and
 even
 if
 you
 think


about
 like
 somebody
 with
 the
 creativity


of
 a
 Beethoven
 like
 there
 There's
 a
 lot


of
 Beethoven
 in
 Mozart
 and
 Heiden
 and
 in


the
 composers
 that
 came
 before
 and
 so


there's
 just
 tremendous
 amounts
 of
 of
 of


remixing
 and
 combination.
 And
 so
 it's


it's
 it's
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 an
 angel's


dancing
 on
 the
 head
 of
 a
 pin
 question


which
 is
 like
 if
 you
 can
 get
 if
 you
 can


get
 you
 know
 within
 you
 know
 I
 don't


know
 one
 you
 know
 001%
 of
 of
 kind
 of


worldbeating
 uh
 you
 know
 generational


creativity
 intelligence
 like
 you're


you're
 you're
 probably
 all
 the
 way


there.
 So
 I
 so
 emotionally
 I
 want
 to


like
 hold
 out
 hope
 that
 there
 is
 you


know
 still
 something
 special
 about
 human


creativity
 and
 I
 I
 certainly
 believe


that
 and
 I
 and
 I
 and
 I
 very
 much
 want
 to


believe
 that
 but
 um
 I
 don't
 know
 when
 I


use
 these
 things
 I'm
 like
 wow
 they
 seem


to
 be
 awfully
 smart
 and
 awfully


creative.
 So
 I'm
 I'm
 I'm
 I'm
 pretty


convinced
 that
 they're
 going
 to
 clear


the
 bar.


>> Yeah.


the
 I
 think
 that
 seems
 to
 be
 a
 common


theme
 in
 your
 analysis
 when
 when
 people


talk
 about
 the
 limitations
 of
 LMS,
 you


know,
 can
 they
 do
 transfer
 learning
 or


or
 just
 learning
 in
 general?
 You
 seem
 to


ask,
 can
 people
 do
 this?


>> Yes.
 Can
 people
 do
 these
 things?
 Well,


it's
 like
 lateral
 thinking,
 right?
 So,


yeah,
 so
 it's
 like
 reasoning
 in
 or
 out


of
 distribution,
 right?
 And
 so
 it's


like,
 okay,
 I
 know
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 who


are
 very
 good
 at
 reasoning
 inside


distribution.
 How
 many
 people
 do
 I


actually
 know
 who
 are
 good
 at
 reasoning


outside
 of
 distribution
 and
 doing


transfer
 learning?
 And
 and
 the
 answer
 is


like
 I
 know
 a
 handful.
 Like
 I
 I
 know
 a


few
 I
 know
 a
 few
 people
 um
 where


whenever
 you
 ask
 them
 a
 question,
 you


get
 an
 extremely
 original
 answer.
 And


usually
 that
 answer
 involves
 bringing
 in


some
 idea
 from
 some
 adjacent
 space
 and


basically
 being
 able
 to
 bridge
 domains.


Um
 and
 so
 you
 know
 you'll
 ask
 them
 a


question
 about
 I
 don't
 know
 you
 know


finance
 and
 they'll
 they'll
 bring
 you
 an


answer
 from
 psychology
 or
 you
 ask
 them
 a


question
 about
 psychology
 and
 they'll


bring
 you
 an
 answer
 from
 biology
 right


or
 whatever
 it
 is.
 And
 so
 I
 I
 know
 you


know
 I
 know
 I
 don't
 know
 sitting
 here


today
 probably
 three
 I
 probably
 know


three
 people
 who
 can
 do
 that
 reliably


out
 of
 the
 you
 know
 I
 I've
 got
 you
 know


I've
 got
 10,000
 in
 my
 address
 book.
 Um


and
 so
 three
 out
 of
 10,000


>> Yeah.
 is
 not
 is
 not
 that
 high
 a


percentage.
 By
 by
 the
 way,
 I
 find
 this


very
 encouraging.
 Like
 I
 I
 yeah,


immediately
 the
 mood
 in
 the
 room
 has


gone
 completely
 to
 hell.
 Um
 I
 find
 this


very
 encouraging.
 I
 find
 this
 very


encouraging
 because
 look
 at
 what


humanity
 has
 been
 able
 to
 build,
 right?


Despite
 all
 of
 our
 limitations,
 right?


And
 and
 look
 at
 all
 the
 creativity
 that


we've
 been
 able
 to
 exhibit
 and
 all
 the


amazing
 art
 and
 all
 the
 amazing
 movies


and
 all
 the
 amazing
 novels
 and
 all
 the


amazing
 technical
 inventions
 and


scientific
 breakthroughs.
 And
 so
 we,
 you


know,
 we've
 been
 able
 to
 do,
 you
 know,


everything
 we've
 been
 able
 to
 do
 with


the
 limitations
 that
 we
 have.
 Um,
 and


so,
 you
 know,
 I
 think
 that,
 you
 know,


like,
 you
 know,
 do
 you
 need
 to
 get
 to


the
 thing
 where
 you
 are
 100%
 positive


that's
 actually
 doing,
 you
 know,


original
 thinking?
 I
 don't
 think
 so.
 Uh,


I
 I
 think
 it'd
 be
 great
 if
 you
 did,
 and


I
 think
 ultimately
 we'll
 probably


conclude
 that
 that's
 what's
 happening.


Um,
 but
 like
 I
 it's
 not
 necessary
 for


like
 just
 tremendous
 amounts
 of


improvement.


>> Ben,
 we
 were
 just
 celebrating
 some
 some


hip-hop
 legends
 at
 your
 paid
 in
 full
 uh


event
 last
 week
 and
 so
 you
 think
 a
 lot


about
 creative
 genius.
 How
 do
 you
 think


about
 this
 question?


Yeah,
 I
 mean
 I
 think
 that
 uh
 I
 agree


with
 Mark
 that
 it's


whatever
 it
 is,
 it's
 very
 useful.
 um


even
 if
 it
 isn't
 all
 the
 way
 that
 level


uh
 I
 think
 that


you
 know
 there's
 something
 about
 the


actual
 like
 real
 time
 human
 experience


that
 humans
 are
 very
 into
 um
 at least
 in


art
 where


you
 know
 with
 the
 current
 state
 of
 the


technology
 kind
 of
 the
 the
 pre-training


doesn't
 have
 quite
 the
 the
 right
 data
 to


to
 to
 get
 to
 um
 what
 you
 really
 want
 to


Uh
 but
 it,
 you
 know,
 it's


pretty
 good.


>> It
 is
 pretty
 good.


>> How
 many
 So
 how
 many
 true
 conceptual
 So


Ben
 Ben Ben
 Ben's
 Ben,
 one
 of
 Ben's


nonprofit
 activities
 is
 something
 called


the
 Pain
 and
 Fall
 Foundation,
 which
 is


honoring
 and
 actually
 providing


essentially
 a
 pension
 a
 pension
 for
 uh


you
 know,
 for
 sort
 of,
 you
 know,
 the


great
 innovators
 in
 in
 in
 rap
 and


hip-hop.
 Um
 and
 and
 so
 he
 has
 he
 knows


and
 has
 many
 of
 we
 were
 just
 at
 the


event
 and
 he
 you
 know
 has
 many
 of
 the


kind
 of
 leading
 lights
 of
 that
 field
 for


the
 last
 50
 years
 you
 know
 perform
 and


and
 it's
 really
 fun
 to
 meet
 them
 and


talk
 to
 them.
 Um
 but
 like
 how
 many


people
 in
 that
 entire
 field
 over
 the


course
 of the
 last
 50
 years
 would
 you


classify
 as
 like
 a
 true
 conceptual


innovator?


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 you
 know
 it's
 interesting.


Well,
 it
 depends
 how
 broadly
 you
 define


it
 but


>> you
 know
 there
 were
 several
 of
 them


there
 last
 you
 know
 on
 Saturday.
 Rock,
 I


think.
 Yeah,
 Rockm,
 you'd
 certainly
 put


in
 that
 category.
 Dr.
 Dre,
 you'd


certainly
 put
 in
 that
 category.
 George


Clinton,
 you'd
 certainly
 put
 in
 that


category.
 Um,


>> you
 know,
 in
 a
 narrower
 sense,
 like
 Cool


G
 Rap
 certainly
 had
 a
 new
 idea.
 Um,


but
 you
 know,
 it
 depends
 like
 a


fundamental
 kind
 of
 musical


breakthrough,
 you
 probably
 just
 say
 like


Rock
 Kim
 and
 George
 Clinton.
 Um,
 are


they
 excited?


>> So,
 so
 two
 out
 of


>> Well,
 I
 mean
 those
 of
 the
 guys
 who
 were


there.


>> Oh,
 yeah.
 Yeah.


>> Yeah.
 But
 yeah,
 it's
 a
 tiny
 percentage.


Tiny
 tiny
 tiny
 tiny
 tiny.


>> We
 had
 Jared
 at
 the
 fireside
 last
 night


with
 Jared
 Leto.
 He
 was
 talking
 about


how
 many
 people
 in
 Hollywood
 are
 are


really
 scared
 or
 against
 this
 um
 what's


happening
 here
 is
 is
 what
 do
 you
 see
 in


you
 know
 when
 you
 talk
 to
 the
 Dr.
 JS
 the


nas
 the
 Kanye's
 are
 they
 excited?
 Are


they
 using
 it?
 Are
 they


>> Yeah.
 No,
 I
 the
 so
 everybody
 uh
 who
 I


speak
 to
 there
 are
 definitely
 people
 who


are
 scared
 in
 music
 but
 like
 there
 are
 a


lot
 of
 people
 who
 are
 very
 very


interested
 in
 it
 and
 particularly
 the


hip-hop
 guys
 are
 interested
 because
 um


it's
 almost
 like
 a
 replay
 of
 what
 they


did
 right
 that
 they
 just
 took
 other


music
 and
 they
 kind
 of
 built
 new
 music


out
 of
 it
 and
 I
 think
 that
 you
 know
 AI


is
 uh
 a
 fantastic
 creative
 tool
 for


them.
 like
 way
 opens
 up
 the
 pallet
 and


then
 for
 you
 know
 a
 lot
 of
 what
 hip-hop


is
 is
 it's
 um
 kind
 of
 telling
 a
 very


specific
 story
 of
 a
 specific
 time
 and


place
 which
 um
 having
 intimate
 knowledge


and
 being
 trained
 just
 on
 that
 thing
 is


is
 actually
 an
 advantage
 as
 opposed


being
 like
 a
 generally
 smart
 uh
 music


model.
 Um,
 people
 also
 use
 the
 same


logic
 of,
 hey,
 whatever
 is
 more


intelligent
 will
 rule
 whatever
 is
 less


intelligent.
 And
 and
 Mark,
 you
 recently


uh


not
 not
 said
 by
 anybody
 who
 owns
 a
 cat.


>> Yeah,
 exactly.


Mark,
 you
 recently
 tweeted,
 "A
 supreme


shape
 rotator
 can
 only
 rotate
 shapes,


but
 a
 supreme
 word
 cell
 can
 rotate
 shape


rotators."
 And
 and
 also,


>> someone's
 clapping
 here.
 And
 also,
 high


IQ
 experts
 work
 for
 midiq
 generalists.


What
 means?


>> Yeah.
 What
 what
 means?
 Uh
 yeah.
 So
 it's


the
 PhDs
 all
 work
 for
 MBAs,
 right?
 So


it's
 like,
 you
 know,
 okay.
 So
 yeah,
 like


so
 yeah.
 Well,
 I
 just,
 you
 know,
 just


take
 it
 up
 a
 level.
 It's
 just
 like
 when


you
 look
 at
 the
 world
 today,
 do
 you


think
 we're
 being
 ruled
 by
 the
 smart


ones,


right?
 Like
 is
 that
 is
 that
 your
 big


conclusion
 from
 like
 current
 events,


current
 affairs,


right?
 Like
 okay,
 we
 put
 the
 geniuses
 in


charge.
 Like


>> you
 mean
 Kamla
 and
 Trump
 aren't
 the


best?


>> Well,
 now
 let's
 not
 even
 be
 specific


towards
 the
 US.
 let's
 just
 look
 all
 over


the
 world.


>> Um,
 you
 know,
 yeah.
 And
 so
 like
 it's


just
 like


there's
 this
 thing.
 So
 I
 think
 two
 two


things
 are
 true.
 One
 is
 we
 we
 probably


all
 kind
 of
 underwrite
 the
 importance
 of


intelligence.
 Um,
 and
 actually
 there's
 a


whole
 kind
 of
 backstory
 here
 of
 like


intelligence
 actually
 turns
 out
 to
 be


this
 like
 incredibly
 inflammatory,
 you


know,
 kind
 of
 topic
 for
 lots
 of
 reasons


over
 the
 last
 hundred
 years.
 um
 uh
 which


which
 we
 could
 we
 could
 talk
 about
 in


great
 detail
 but
 like
 it
 it
 and
 you
 know


it's
 and
 the
 even
 the
 just
 the
 very
 idea


that
 like
 some
 people
 are
 smarter
 than


other
 people
 you
 just
 like
 really
 freaks


people
 out
 and
 people
 people
 don't
 like


to
 talk
 about
 it
 we
 really
 struggle
 with


that
 as
 a
 society
 and
 so
 like
 and
 then


it
 is
 true
 that
 intelligence
 is
 like
 in


humans
 intelligence
 is
 correlated
 to


almost
 every
 kind
 of
 positive
 life


outcome
 right
 and
 so
 u
 intelligence


generally
 in
 the
 social
 sciences
 what


they'll
 tell
 you
 is
 what
 they
 call
 fluid


intelligence
 or
 or
 the
 G
 factor
 or
 IQ
 is


sort
 of
 it's
 sort
 of
 0.4
 four
 correlated


to
 basically
 everything.
 Um,
 and
 so
 it's


0.4
 correlation
 to
 like
 educational


outcomes
 and
 like
 you
 know
 professional


outcomes
 and
 and
 you
 know
 income
 and
 by


the
 way
 also
 like
 life
 satisfaction
 and


by
 the
 way
 non-violence
 you
 know
 being


able
 to
 solve
 problems
 without
 physical


violence
 and
 so
 forth.
 And
 so
 like
 on


the
 one
 hand
 like
 we
 probably
 all


underrate
 intelligence.
 Um
 on
 the
 other


hand
 the
 people
 who
 are
 in
 the
 fields


that
 involve
 intelligence
 probably


overrate
 intelligence.
 Um,
 and
 you
 might


even
 you
 might
 even
 coin
 a
 term
 like


maybe
 like
 intelligence
 supremacist
 or


something
 like
 that
 where
 it's
 just
 like


oh
 like
 intelligence
 is
 very
 important


and
 so
 therefore
 maybe
 it's
 like
 the


most
 important
 thing
 or
 the
 only
 thing


but
 but
 then
 you
 look
 at
 reality
 and


you're
 like
 okay
 that's
 clearly
 not
 the


case.


>> Yeah.
 It's
 still
 zero
 only
 0.4
 right.


Yeah.


>> Well
 so
 to
 start
 with
 it's
 only
 0.4
 and


you
 know
 in
 the
 social
 sciences
 0.4
 is
 a


giant
 correlation
 factor
 right
 like
 most


most
 things
 that
 where
 you
 can
 correlate


whether
 it's
 you
 know
 genes
 or
 observed


behavior
 whatever
 to
 anything
 in
 the


social
 sciences
 the
 correlations
 are


much
 smaller
 than
 that.
 So
 0.4
 is
 is


tiny,
 but
 it's
 still
 only
 0.4.
 So,
 even


if
 you're
 like
 a
 fullon
 if
 you
 even
 if


you're
 like
 a
 full-on
 genetic


determinist
 and
 you're
 just
 like,
 you


know,
 genetic
 IQ
 just
 like
 drives
 all


these
 outcomes,
 like
 it
 still
 doesn't


explain,
 you
 know,
 6
 uh
 of
 the


correlation
 and
 so
 that
 leaves
 it
 but


but
 that's
 just
 on
 the
 individual
 level.


Then
 you
 just
 look
 at
 the
 collective


level.
 Well,
 you
 just
 look
 at
 the


collective
 level
 and
 it's
 like
 a
 famous


famous
 observation
 is
 you
 take
 a
 b
 you


take
 a
 bunch
 of
 you
 take
 any
 group
 of


people,
 you
 put
 them
 in
 a
 mob
 and
 the


mob
 is
 dumber,
 right,
 than
 the
 average


and
 and and
 you
 put
 a
 bunch
 of
 smart


people
 in
 a
 mob
 and
 they
 definitely
 turn


dumber
 like
 and
 you
 see
 that
 all
 the


time,
 right?
 Um
 uh
 and
 so
 you
 put
 people


in
 groups
 and
 they
 they
 they
 behave
 very


differently
 and
 then
 you
 you
 create
 and


then
 you
 create
 these
 you
 know
 questions


around
 like
 who's
 in
 charge
 whether


who's
 in
 charge
 at
 a
 at
 a
 company
 or


who's
 in
 charge
 of
 a
 of
 a
 country
 and


like
 it
 it's
 whatever
 the
 filtration


process
 it's
 clearly
 not
 it's
 not
 it's


it's
 not
 it's
 certainly
 not
 only
 on
 IQ


and
 it
 may
 not
 even
 be
 primarily
 on
 IQ


and
 so
 so
 therefore
 it's
 just
 like
 this


assumption
 that
 you
 kind
 of
 hear
 in
 some


of
 the
 AI
 circles
 uh
 which
 is
 like


inevitably
 the
 smart
 you
 know
 kind
 of


thing
 is
 going
 to
 govern
 the
 dumb
 thing


like
 I
 I
 just
 think
 that's
 like
 very


easily
 uh
 it's
 just
 sort
 of
 very
 easily


and
 obviously
 falsified
 like


intelligence
 isn't
 sufficient
 and
 then


you
 just
 you
 just
 you
 just
 convey
 it.


You
 know,
 we're
 all
 in
 this
 room
 lucky


enough
 to
 know
 a
 lot
 of
 smart
 people
 and


you
 you
 just
 kind
 of
 observe
 smart


people
 and
 like
 some
 smart
 people,
 you


know,
 really
 figure
 out
 how
 to
 have


their
 stuff
 together
 and
 become
 very


successful
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 smart
 people


never
 do.
 Um
 and
 so
 there
 there's
 there


there
 must
 be
 there
 obviously
 are
 and


there
 and
 there
 in
 fact
 must
 be
 many


other
 factors
 that
 have
 to
 do
 with


success
 um
 and
 have
 to
 do
 with
 like


who's
 in
 charge
 than
 just
 raw


intelligence.
 It
 it
 begs
 the
 the


follow-up
 question
 of
 what
 are
 what
 are


some
 examples
 of
 what
 that
 might
 be
 you


know
 skills
 sort
 of
 outside
 of


intelligence
 and
 more
 particularly


specifically
 why
 couldn't
 AI
 systems
 you


know
 learn
 them?


>> Yeah.
 So
 Ben
 like
 what
 what
 what
 other


than
 intelligence
 what
 what
 in
 your


experience
 determines
 for
 example


success
 in
 leadership
 or
 in


entrepreneurship
 or
 in
 in
 solving


complex
 problems
 or
 organizing
 people?


>> Yeah.


There
 there
 are
 many
 things
 um
 you
 know


like
 a
 lot
 of
 it
 is
 uh
 being
 able
 to


have
 a
 confrontation
 in
 the
 correct
 way


and
 like
 there's
 some
 intelligence
 in


that
 but
 a
 lot
 of
 it
 is
 just
 under


really
 understanding
 who
 you're
 talking


to


you
 know
 being
 able
 to
 interpret


everything
 about
 how
 they're
 thinking


about
 it
 and
 just
 kind
 of
 generally


seeing
 decisions
 through
 the
 eyes
 of
 the


people
 working
 in
 the
 company
 not


through
 your
 eyes
 is
 the


skill
 that
 you
 you
 know
 you
 develop
 by


talking
 to
 people
 all
 the
 time,


understanding
 what
 they're
 saying,
 so


forth,
 these
 kinds
 of
 things.
 And
 it's


just
 um


you
 know,
 it's
 certainly
 not
 an
 IQ


thing.
 And
 not
 that
 like
 I
 I
 could


imagine
 an
 AI
 training
 on
 any
 individual


and
 like
 figuring
 it
 all
 out
 and
 knowing


what
 to
 say
 and
 so
 forth.
 Um
 but
 then


you
 also
 need
 that
 integrated
 with
 uh


you
 know
 like
 whatever
 the
 business


ought
 to
 be
 doing.
 So
 you're
 not
 you're


not
 trying
 to
 do
 what's
 popular.
 You're


trying
 to
 get
 people
 to
 do
 what's


correct
 even
 if
 they
 don't
 like
 it.
 And


you
 know
 that's
 a
 lot
 of
 management.
 So


uh


it's
 not
 a
 problem
 anybody's
 working
 on


currently
 but
 maybe
 they
 will.


>> It's
 some
 right
 some
 combination
 of
 like


courage
 some
 combination
 of
 motivation


some
 combination
 of
 um
 of
 emotional
 uh


understanding
 theory
 of
 mind.


>> Yeah.
 what
 you
 know
 what
 do
 people
 want


like
 you
 know
 married
 to
 you
 know
 what


needs
 to
 be
 done
 and
 then
 like
 how


talented
 are
 they
 like
 which
 ones
 can


you
 afford
 like
 if
 they
 jump
 out
 the


window
 it's
 fine
 you
 know
 which
 one's


not
 fine
 you
 know
 this
 kind
 of
 thing


it's
 a
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 like
 weird


subtleties
 to
 it
 uh
 and
 it's
 very


situational
 I
 think
 the
 hardest
 thing


about
 it
 uh
 and
 why
 management
 books
 are


so
 bad
 is
 because
 it's
 situational
 um


you
 know
 like
 your
 company
 your
 product,


your
 people,
 your
 org
 chart
 is
 very
 very


different
 than
 you
 know,
 yeah,
 here
 are


the
 five
 steps
 to
 building
 a
 strategy.


It's
 like,
 well,
 that's
 the
 most
 useless


 thing
 I
 ever
 read
 because
 it
 has


nothing
 to
 do
 with
 you.


>> So,
 one
 of
 the
 interesting
 things
 on


this
 like
 on
 this
 is
 right
 the
 the


concept
 of
 theory
 of
 mind
 is
 really


important,
 right?
 So,
 theory
 of
 mind
 is


can
 you
 in
 your
 head
 model
 what's


happening
 in
 the
 other
 person's
 head,


right?
 And
 and and
 you
 would
 think
 that


maybe
 that
 you
 know
 maybe
 obviously


people
 who
 are
 smarter
 should
 be
 better


at
 that.
 It
 turns
 out
 that
 that
 may
 not


be
 true
 and
 I'll
 the
 reason
 to
 believe


that
 that's
 not
 true
 which
 which
 is
 as


follows.
 So
 the
 so
 the
 the
 US
 military


is
 was
 the
 early
 adopter
 and
 has


continued
 to
 be
 sort
 of
 the
 leading


adopter
 in
 in
 US
 society
 of
 of of


actually
 IQ
 testing
 and
 they
 uh
 they


they
 they
 basically
 launder
 it
 through


something
 called
 the
 ASVAB
 which
 is


their
 they
 call
 vocational
 aptitude


battery
 test
 but
 it's
 basically
 an
 I


it's
 essentially
 an
 IQ
 test.
 Um
 and
 uh


so
 they
 they
 they
 they
 still
 use


basically
 explicit
 IQ
 tests
 and
 they


they
 slot
 people
 uh
 into
 different


specialties
 and
 roles
 uh
 you
 know
 in


part
 with
 according
 IQ
 um
 including
 into


leadership
 roles.
 Um
 and
 and
 so
 they


they
 know
 what
 everybody's
 IQ
 is
 and


they
 they
 kind
 of
 organize
 organize


around
 that.
 And
 one
 of the
 things
 that


they
 found
 over
 the
 years
 is
 if
 the


leader
 is
 more
 than
 one
 standard


deviation
 of
 IQ
 away
 from
 the
 followers,


it's
 a
 real
 problem.
 Um
 and
 and
 and


that's
 true
 in
 both
 directions,
 right?


Um
 if
 if
 the
 leader
 is
 not
 smart
 enough


to
 be
 able
 to
 right
 manage
 the
 you
 know


is
 to
 be
 able
 to
 mo
 you
 know
 for


somebody
 who
 is
 less
 smart
 to
 model
 the


mental
 behavior
 of
 somebody
 who's
 more


smart
 is
 inher
 of
 course
 inherently
 very


challenging
 and
 maybe
 impossible.
 But
 it


turns
 out
 the
 reverse
 is
 also
 true
 which


is
 if
 the
 leader
 is
 two
 standard


deviations
 above
 the
 norm
 of
 the


organization
 that
 he's
 running.
 He
 also


loses
 theory
 of
 mind.
 Right?
 it
 it's


it's
 actually
 very
 hard
 for
 very
 smart


people
 to
 um
 to
 to
 model
 uh
 the
 internal


thought
 processes
 of
 even
 moderately


smart
 people.
 Um
 and
 so
 there
 there's


actually
 there's
 actually
 a
 real
 there's


actually
 a
 real
 need
 to
 have
 a
 level
 of


connection
 there
 that's
 not
 just
 right


and
 therefore
 by
 inference
 if
 you
 had
 a


person
 or
 a
 or
 a
 machine
 that
 had
 you


know
 a
 thousand
 IQ
 or
 something
 like
 it


it
 may
 just
 be
 it
 would
 be
 so
 alien
 its


understanding
 of
 reality
 would
 be
 so


alien
 to
 the
 people
 or
 the
 things
 that


it
 was
 managing
 that
 it
 wouldn't
 it


wouldn't
 even
 be
 able
 to
 connect
 in
 any


sort
 any
 sort
 of
 realistic
 way.
 So
 again


this
 is
 a
 very
 good
 argument
 that
 like


it
 yeah
 this
 is
 the
 world
 is
 going
 to
 be


far
 from
 organized
 by
 IQ
 for
 yeah
 for


centuries
 to
 come.


>> Yeah
 and
 Zuckerberg
 had
 a
 great
 line


which
 is
 intelligence
 is
 not
 life
 and


life
 life
 has
 a
 lot
 of
 dimensionality
 to


it
 that
 is
 independent
 of
 intelligence.


I
 think
 that


you
 know
 if
 you
 spend
 all
 your
 time


working
 on
 intelligence
 you
 lose
 track


of
 that.
 We
 sometimes
 say
 about
 uh
 some


specific
 people
 that
 they're
 too
 smart


to
 properly
 model
 or
 or
 you
 know
 um
 too


they
 s
 sort
 of
 assume
 too
 much


rationality
 on
 other
 people
 or
 they
 just


o
 overthink
 things
 or
 overrationalize


them.
 Um
 yeah
 just
 to
 your
 point
 that


it's
 it's
 on
 everything.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 People
 often
 people


seldom
 do
 what's
 in
 their
 best
 interest


I
 should
 say.


>> You
 know
 I
 also
 suspect
 this
 kind
 of


gets
 more
 into
 the
 biology
 side
 of


things.
 I
 you
 know
 there's
 more
 and
 more


scientific
 evidence
 that
 basically
 also


that
 like
 human
 human
 cognition
 human


cognition
 or
 human
 I
 don't
 whatever
 you


want
 to
 call it
 self-awareness


information
 processing
 decision-m
 sort


of
 experience
 um
 uh
 is
 is
 not
 purely
 a


brain
 like
 the
 basically
 the
 d
 the
 sort


of
 mind
 famous
 mindbody
 dualism
 is
 just


not
 correct
 like
 and
 again
 this
 is
 an


argument
 against
 sort
 of
 IQ
 supremacism


or
 intelligent
 supremacism
 is
 it's
 not


you
 know
 we
 we
 human
 beings
 didn't


experience
 existence
 just
 through
 the


rational
 thought
 u
 and
 and
 and


specifically
 not
 through
 just
 the


rational
 thought
 of
 the
 brain,
 but


rather
 it's
 a
 whole
 body
 experience,


right?
 And
 there's
 there's
 there's


aspects
 of
 our
 nervous
 system
 and


there's
 aspects
 of
 everything
 from
 our


gut
 biome
 to,
 you
 know,
 to
 to
 you
 know,


to
 to
 smells,
 you
 know,
 to
 alactory


senses
 and
 and
 um
 you
 know,
 and
 hormones


and
 like
 all
 all
 kinds
 of
 like


biochemical
 kind
 of
 aspects
 to
 life.
 Um


I
 sus
 if
 you
 just
 kind
 of
 track
 the


research,
 I
 suspect
 we're
 going to
 find


is
 human
 cognition
 is
 a
 full
 body


experience.
 Uh
 much
 much
 more
 than
 much


more
 than
 people
 thought.
 Um
 and
 and
 so


therefore
 to
 actually
 and
 this
 you
 know


this
 is
 like
 a
 and
 this
 is
 you
 know
 one


of
 the
 kind
 of
 big
 fundamental


challenges
 in
 the
 AI
 AI
 field
 right
 now


which
 is
 you
 know
 the
 form
 of
 AI
 that
 we


have
 working
 is
 is
 the
 is
 the
 fully
 mind


body
 dual
 version
 of
 it
 which
 is
 it's


just
 a
 disembodi
 you
 know
 like
 a


disembodied
 brain
 you
 know
 the
 robotics


revolution
 for
 sure
 is
 coming
 when
 that


happens
 when
 we
 put
 AI
 in
 in
 physical


objects
 that
 move
 around
 the
 world
 you


know
 you're
 going
 to
 be
 able
 to
 get


closer
 to
 having
 that
 kind
 of
 you
 know


inte
 integrated
 intellectual
 physical


you
 know
 experience
 you're
 going
 to
 have


sensors
 in
 the
 robots
 are
 going
 to
 be


a
 lot
 more
 data.


But
 it
 is
 just
 to
 me
 at least
 reading


the
 research
 like
 that
 all
 those
 ideas


feel
 very
 nent
 and
 we
 have a
 lot
 of
 work


to
 do
 to
 try
 to
 figure
 that
 out.


>> Do
 you
 have
 a
 sense
 for
 how
 they
 are
 at


theory
 of
 mind
 today?
 Um
 or
 do
 you
 have


a
 where
 the
 limitations
 are?
 you
 like
 to


talk
 to
 them
 a
 lot.
 Are
 there
 any


particular
 things
 that
 are
 particularly


surprising
 to
 you
 as
 you
 do?


>> Yeah,
 I
 would
 say
 generally
 they're


really
 good.
 Um,
 yeah.
 And
 so
 like
 one


of
 the
 one
 one
 of
 the
 more
 I
 find
 one
 of


the
 more
 fascinating
 ways,
 you
 know,
 to


to
 work
 with
 language
 models
 is
 actually


have
 them
 create
 personas.
 Um,
 and
 uh


and
 then
 you
 know,
 basically
 have
 well


actually
 so
 I
 like
 I
 like
 I
 like


basically
 I
 like
 Socratic
 dialogues.
 I


like
 when
 things
 are
 argued
 out
 and
 like


a
 Socratic
 dialogue.
 And
 so
 you
 you
 know


tell
 a
 tell
 any
 advanced
 LLM
 today
 to


create
 a
 Socratic
 dialogue
 and
 it'll


either
 make
 up
 the
 personas,
 you
 can


tell
 what
 it
 is,
 it
 does
 a
 good
 job.
 it


has
 this
 very
 very
 annoying
 property


which
 is
 it
 wants
 everybody
 to
 be
 happy.


Um
 and
 so
 it
 wants
 all
 of
 its
 personas


to
 agree.
 Um
 and
 so
 by
 default
 it
 will


have
 a
 uh
 it
 will
 have
 a
 briefly


interesting
 discussion
 and
 then
 it
 will


sort
 of
 figure
 out
 you
 know
 basically
 it


like
 you're
 watching
 I
 don't
 know
 PBS


special
 or
 something.
 It'll
 it'll
 kind


of
 figure
 out
 how
 to
 bring
 everybody


into
 agreement.
 Everybody's
 happy
 at
 the


end
 of
 the
 discussion.
 And
 of
 course
 I


 hate
 that.
 Like
 it
 drives
 me


nuts.
 I
 don't
 want
 that.
 So
 instead
 I
 I


tell
 it
 I'm
 like
 make
 the
 conversation


more
 tense,
 right?
 And
 like
 fraught
 with


like
 anger
 and
 like
 you
 know
 people,
 you


know,
 going
 to
 get
 like
 increasingly


upset
 throughout
 the
 conversation.
 And


then
 it
 starts
 to
 get
 really


interesting.
 Um
 and
 then
 I
 and
 then
 I


tell
 it,
 you
 know,
 bring
 it,
 you
 know,


use
 introduce
 a
 lot
 more
 cursing.
 Um
 you


know,
 really
 have
 them
 go
 at
 it
 like
 all


the
 gloves
 come
 off,
 they're
 going
 for


pull
 full,
 you
 know,
 you
 know,


reputational
 destruction
 of
 each
 other.


>> You
 do
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 skits.


>> Yeah,
 these
 skits.
 And
 then
 I
 get


carried
 away
 and
 then
 I'm
 like
 it
 turns


out
 they're
 all
 like
 secret
 ninjas
 and


then
 they
 all
 start
 fighting
 and
 you've


got
 Einstein
 you
 know
 you
 know
 you
 know


hitting
 you
 know
 Neils
 Bore
 with


nunchucks
 and
 it
 and
 by
 the
 way
 it's


happy
 to
 do
 that
 too.
 Um
 so
 you
 do
 have


to
 you
 have
 to
 you
 have
 to
 control


yourself
 but
 it
 it
 is
 very
 good
 a
 theory


of
 mind
 and
 then
 I'll
 give
 you
 another


example.
 There's
 a
 there's
 a
 startup


actually
 in
 the
 UK
 uh
 in
 uh
 in
 in
 the


world
 of
 politics
 and
 and
 what
 what
 they


found
 is
 that
 um
 they
 found
 that


language
 models
 now
 are
 good
 enough
 so


specifically
 for
 for
 politics
 which
 is


sort
 of
 a
 sub
 subcategory
 where
 this


this
 idea
 matters.
 Um
 so
 you
 know
 in


politics
 people
 do
 focus
 group
 you
 do


focus
 groups
 of
 voters
 all
 the
 time
 and


and
 by
 the
 way
 many
 businesses
 also
 do


that.
 Um,
 you
 know,
 so
 you
 get
 a
 bunch


of
 people
 together
 from
 different


backgrounds
 in
 a
 room
 and
 you
 kind
 of


guide
 them
 through
 a
 discussion
 and
 try


to
 get
 their
 their
 points
 of
 view
 on


things.
 And
 and
 focus
 groups
 are
 often


surprising.
 Like
 politicians
 who
 if
 you


talk
 to
 politicians
 who
 do
 focus
 groups,


they're
 often
 surprising.
 They're
 often


surprised
 by
 the
 things
 that
 they


thought
 voters
 cared
 about
 is
 actually


not
 the
 things
 that
 voters
 care
 about.


And
 so
 you
 can
 actually
 learn
 a
 lot
 by


doing
 this.
 But
 focus
 groups
 are
 very


expensive
 to
 run.
 And
 then
 there's
 a


long
 lag
 time
 because
 they
 have
 to
 be


actually
 physically
 organized
 and
 you


have
 to
 recruit
 people
 and
 vet
 people


and
 and
 so
 forth.
 Um,
 and
 so
 it
 turns


out
 that
 the
 the
 the
 the


state-of-the-art
 models
 now
 are
 are
 good


enough
 at
 this
 so
 they
 can
 actually
 they


can
 they
 can
 correctly
 um
 accurately


reproduce
 a
 focus
 group
 of
 real
 people


um
 inside
 the
 model.
 Um
 so
 so
 so
 they're


good
 enough
 to
 clear
 that
 bar.
 In
 other


words,
 you
 you
 can
 basically
 have
 a


focus
 group
 actually
 happening
 in
 the


model
 where
 you
 create
 personas
 in
 the


model
 and
 then
 it
 actually
 accurately


represents,
 you
 know,
 a
 college
 student


from,
 you
 know,
 Kentucky
 is
 contrasted


to
 a
 housewife
 from
 Tennessee
 is


contrasted
 to
 a,
 you
 know,
 whatever


whatever
 you
 you
 just
 like
 specify
 this.


And
 so,
 you
 know,
 they're
 good
 enough
 to


clear
 they're
 good
 enough
 to
 clear
 that


bar
 and,
 you
 know,
 we'll
 we'll
 see
 how


far
 they
 get.


>> I
 want
 to
 segue
 to
 the
 bubble


conversation.
 Uh,
 Amin
 and
 G2,
 Jensen


and
 Matt
 spoke
 about
 the
 enormous
 scale


of
 physical
 infrastructure
 being
 built


out.
 AI
 capex
 is
 1%
 of
 GDP.
 How
 should


we
 understand
 and
 think
 about
 this


bubble
 question?


>> Well,
 I
 think
 the
 fact
 that
 it's
 a


question
 means
 we're
 not
 in
 a
 bubble.


That's
 the
 first
 thing
 to
 understand.
 I


mean,
 a
 bubble
 is
 a
 psychological


phenomenon
 um
 as
 much
 as
 anything.
 And


in
 order
 to
 get
 to
 a
 bubble,
 everybody


has
 to
 believe
 it's
 not
 a
 bubble.
 That


that's
 sort
 of
 the
 the
 core
 mechanic
 of


it.
 And
 that,
 you
 know,
 we
 call
 that


capitulation.
 Everybody
 just
 gives
 up.


Like,
 okay,
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 short
 these


stocks
 anymore.
 I'm
 tired
 of
 losing
 all


my
 money.
 I'm
 going
 to
 go
 long.
 Uh
 and


we
 saw
 that
 actually
 in,


you
 know,
 and
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 question


like
 really
 what
 was
 the
 tech
 bubble?
 Um


but
 in
 the
 kind
 of.com
 era
 right
 as
 the


prices
 went
 through
 the
 roof
 Warren


Buffett
 started
 inviting
 investing
 in


tech.
 So
 like
 and
 he
 swore
 he
 would


never
 invest
 in
 tech
 because
 you
 didn't


understand
 it.
 And
 so
 if
 he
 capitulated


nobody
 was
 saying
 it
 was
 a
 bubble
 when


it
 became
 like
 a
 quote
 unquote
 bubble.


Now
 if
 you
 look
 at
 that
 phenomenon


um
 the
 internet
 clearly
 was
 not
 a


bubble.
 Uh
 you
 know
 it
 was
 a
 real
 thing.


It
 was
 in
 the
 short
 term
 there
 was
 a


kind
 of
 price
 dislocation
 that
 happened


because
 uh
 the
 the
 market
 um
 you
 know


there
 were
 just
 not
 enough
 people
 on
 the


network
 to
 make
 those
 products
 go
 at
 the


time
 uh
 and
 then
 the
 prices
 kind
 of


outran
 the
 market.


you
 know,
 in
 AI,
 it's
 much
 harder
 to
 see


that
 because
 there's
 so
 much
 demand
 in


the
 short
 term,
 right?
 Like
 we
 don't


have
 a
 demand
 problem
 right
 now.
 And


like
 the
 idea
 that
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 a


demand
 problem
 five
 years
 from
 now
 to
 me


seems
 quite
 absurd.
 Uh,
 you
 know,
 could


there
 be
 like
 weird
 bottlenecks
 that


that
 appear,
 you
 know,
 like
 we
 just
 at


some
 point
 we
 just
 don't
 have
 enough


cooling
 or
 something
 like
 that?
 Yeah,


you
 know,
 maybe.
 But
 like
 like
 right
 now


if
 you
 look
 at
 demand
 and
 supply
 and


what's
 going
 on
 and
 multiples
 uh
 against


growth,


it
 doesn't
 look
 like
 a
 bubble
 at
 all
 to


me.
 Um
 but


I
 don't
 know.
 Do
 you
 think
 it's
 a


bubble,
 Mark?


>> Yeah.
 Look,
 I
 I
 would
 just
 say
 this.


Yeah.
 Like
 nobody
 know
 So
 nobody
 knows


in
 the
 sense
 of
 like
 the
 experts
 like
 if


you're
 talking
 to
 anybody
 at
 like
 a


hedge
 fun
 or
 a
 bank
 or
 whatever,
 like


they
 definitely
 don't
 know.
 Um
 uh


generally
 the
 CEOs
 don't
 know.
 So
 it
 the


>> by
 the
 way
 a
 lot
 of
 VCs
 don't
 know
 that


they
 just
 get
 upset
 like
 VCs
 get
 like


emotionally
 upset
 when
 you
 guys
 have


higher
 valuations
 like
 it
 it
 makes
 them


like
 like
 angry.
 Uh
 and
 you
 know
 and
 I
 I


get
 it
 all
 the
 time
 and
 I'm
 like
 what


are
 you
 mad
 about?
 Like
 the
 is


working
 man
 be
 happy.
 Come
 on.
 But
 so
 so


like
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 emotion
 around


like
 people
 wanting
 it
 to
 be
 be
 a


bubble.


>> Yeah.
 No,
 nothing's
 worse
 than
 passing


on
 a
 deal
 and
 then
 having
 the
 company


become
 a
 great
 success.
 Like
 it's
 just
 I


was
 just
 just
 put


>> that
 that
 valuation
 is
 outrageous.


>> You
 can
 be
 furious
 about
 that
 for
 30


years
 in
 our
 business.
 It's
 it's


amazing.
 Um
 and
 you
 can
 find
 Yeah.
 You


come
 up
 with
 all
 kinds
 of
 reasons
 to


cope
 and
 and
 explain
 why
 it
 wasn't
 your


mistake.
 But
 it's
 you
 know
 it's
 the


world
 it's
 the
 world
 that's
 wrong,
 not


me.
 Right.
 So
 there
 there's
 a
 lot
 of


that.
 Yeah.
 Uh
 yeah.
 So
 I
 I
 just
 I
 would


just
 I
 would
 just
 say
 like
 I
 would


always
 say
 bring
 the
 conversation
 back


to
 ground
 truth
 fundamentals.
 And
 the


the
 two
 big
 ground
 truth
 fundamentals


are
 number
 one,
 does
 the
 technology


actually
 work?
 Um,
 you
 know,
 can
 it


deliver
 on
 its
 promise?
 And
 then
 number


two,
 is
 are
 customers
 paying
 for
 it?
 Um,


and
 if
 those
 if
 those
 two
 things
 are


true,
 then
 it's
 very
 hard
 to
 it's
 very


hard
 to
 uh
 like
 as
 long
 as
 those
 two


things
 stay
 grounded.
 Um,
 you
 know,
 gen


generally
 generally
 things
 are
 going
 to


I
 think
 are
 going to
 be
 on
 track.


>> Yeah.


When
 Gavin
 was
 up
 here
 with
 DG,
 he
 said


chatbt
 was
 a
 Pearl
 Harbor
 moment
 for


Google,
 the
 moment
 when
 the
 giant
 wakes


up.
 when
 when
 we
 look
 at
 history
 and
 and


platform
 shifts,
 what
 determine
 whether


the
 incumbent
 actually
 wins
 the
 next


wave
 versus
 versus
 new
 entrance
 or
 how


should
 we
 think
 about
 that
 in
 in
 AMP?


>> Well,
 you
 know,
 reacting
 to
 it
 is


important.
 Um,
 but
 that
 doesn't
 mean


like
 I
 it's
 a
 Pearl
 Harbor
 moment.
 I


think


Google
 got
 their
 head
 out
 of
 their
 ass.


It
 was
 the
 sound
 of
 it.


Uh
 so
 you
 know
 they're
 not
 going
 to
 get


completely
 run
 over
 but


nonetheless
 like
 I
 don't
 think
 open
 AI


is
 going
 away.
 So
 like
 they
 they


definitely
 let
 that
 happened.
 Um
 yeah


some
 of
 it
 to
 speed
 and
 then
 just
 look


it's
 execution
 over
 a
 long
 period
 of


time
 and
 uh
 you
 know
 some
 of
 these
 very


large
 companies
 to
 varying
 degrees
 have


lost
 their
 ability
 to
 execute.
 And
 so
 if


you're
 talking
 about
 a
 brand
 new


platform
 and
 you're
 talking
 about,
 you


know,
 kind
 of
 building
 for
 a
 long
 time,


it's
 like,
 you
 know,
 Microsoft
 got


caught
 with
 their
 pants
 down
 on
 Google.


Um,
 Microsoft's
 still
 like
 very
 strong,


but
 they
 missed
 that
 whole
 opportunity.


They
 also
 missed
 the
 opportunity.
 You


know,
 Apple
 was
 nothing
 and
 Microsoft


fully
 believed
 that
 they
 were
 going
 to


own
 mobile
 computing.
 They
 completely


missed
 that
 one.
 But
 they
 were
 still
 so


big
 from
 their
 Windows
 monopoly
 they


could
 build
 into
 other
 things.
 So
 you


know
 I
 think
 generally
 the
 new
 companies


have
 won
 the
 new
 markets.
 Uh


and
 that
 doesn't
 mean
 the
 big
 company


the
 biggest
 companies
 the
 biggest


monopolies
 from
 the
 prior
 generation


just
 last
 a
 long
 time
 is
 the
 way
 I
 would


look
 at
 it.


>> Yeah.
 I
 I
 also
 think
 we
 don't
 quite
 know


like
 it's
 all
 happened
 so
 fast
 we
 we


actually
 don't
 I
 think
 we
 don't
 yet
 know


the
 shape
 and
 form
 of
 the
 ultimate


products.


>> Yeah.


>> Um
 Right.
 And
 so
 and
 so
 like
 because


it's
 it's
 tempting
 and
 this
 is
 kind
 of


what
 what
 always
 happens.
 It's
 kind
 of


it's
 kind
 of
 tempting
 to
 look
 I'm
 not


saying
 what
 that's
 what
 these
 guys
 did


on
 stage
 but
 it's
 kind
 of
 tempting
 to


look
 you
 sometimes
 you
 hear
 the
 kind
 of


reductive
 version
 of
 this
 which
 is


basically
 it's
 like
 oh
 there's
 either


going
 to
 be
 a
 chatbot
 or
 a
 search
 engine


right
 the
 competition
 is
 between
 a


chatbot
 and
 a
 search
 engine
 and
 the


problem
 Google
 has
 is
 the
 classic


problem
 of
 dis
 you
 know
 disruption.
 are


you
 going to
 disrupt
 the
 10
 blue
 links


model
 and
 swap
 in
 you
 know
 at
 you
 know


sort
 of
 uh
 AI
 answers
 and
 you
 know


potentially
 disrupt
 the
 advertising


model
 and
 then
 the
 problem
 OpenAI
 has
 is


they
 have
 the
 the
 full
 you
 know
 the
 full


chat
 product
 but
 you
 know
 they
 don't


have
 the
 advertising
 yet
 and
 they
 don't


have
 the
 distribution
 Google
 scale


distribution
 and
 so
 you
 know
 you
 kind
 of


say
 okay
 that's
 a
 fairly
 that's
 a
 fairly


cl
 like
 that'd
 be
 straight
 out
 of
 a
 like


you
 know
 the
 innovator's
 dilemma
 you


know
 business
 textbook
 like
 this
 is
 just


a
 very
 clear
 you
 know
 one
 one
 versus
 one


you
 know
 kind
 of
 dynamic
 but
 that


assumes
 that
 you
 know
 the
 mistake
 that


you
 could
 make
 in
 thinking
 way
 is
 that


assumes
 that
 the
 forms
 of
 the
 product
 in


5
 10
 15
 20
 years
 that
 that
 are
 going
 to


be
 the
 main
 things
 that
 people
 use
 are


going
 to
 be
 either
 a
 search
 engine
 or
 a


chatbot,
 right?
 Um
 and
 and
 you
 know
 the


just
 there's
 you
 know
 there's
 just


obvious
 historical
 analogies.
 One
 just


obvious
 historical
 analogy
 is,
 you
 know,


the
 the
 personal
 computer
 from
 sort
 of


invention
 in
 1975
 through
 to,
 you
 know,


basically
 1992,


you
 know,
 was
 was
 a
 was
 a
 text
 prompt


system,
 right?
 Um,
 you
 know,
 and
 at
 the


time,
 by
 the
 way,
 an
 interactive
 text


prompt
 was
 a
 big
 advance
 over
 the


previous
 generation
 of
 like
 punch
 card


systems,
 time
 sharing
 systems.
 Uh,
 and


then,
 you
 know,
 it
 was,
 you
 know,
 1992,


so
 was
 what,
 seven,
 17
 years
 in,
 you


know,
 the
 whole
 industry
 took
 a
 left


turn
 into
 GUIEs
 and
 never
 looked
 back,


you
 know.
 And
 then
 by
 the
 way,
 you
 know,


5
 years
 after
 that,
 the
 industry
 took
 a


left
 turn
 in
 web
 browsers
 and
 never


looked
 back,
 right?
 And
 so
 the
 very


shape
 and
 form
 and
 nature
 of
 the
 user


experience
 and
 how
 it
 and
 how
 it
 fits


into
 our
 lives,
 uh,
 you
 know,
 is
 is
 is
 I


think
 still
 unformed.
 And
 so
 like
 and


you
 know,
 look,
 I'm
 I'm
 sure
 there
 will


be
 chat
 bots
 20
 years
 from
 now,
 but
 I


I'm
 I'm
 pretty
 confident
 that,
 um,
 you


know,
 both
 the
 current
 chatbot
 companies


and
 many
 new
 companies
 are
 going
 to


figure
 out
 many
 kinds
 of
 user


experiences
 that
 are
 radically
 different


that
 we
 don't
 we
 don't
 even
 know
 yet.


Yeah.
 And
 by
 and
 by
 the
 way,
 that's
 one


of
 the
 things
 of
 course
 that
 keeps
 the


tech
 industry
 fun,
 which
 is
 it,
 you


know,
 especially
 on
 the
 especially
 on


the
 software
 side,
 you
 know,
 is
 it's
 not


it's
 not
 it's
 not
 obvious
 what
 the
 shape


and
 form
 of
 the
 products
 are.
 And


there's
 just
 I
 think
 there's
 just


tremendous
 headroom
 for
 invention.


>> As
 as
 you're
 coaching
 entrepreneurs
 and


the
 entrepreneurs
 in
 this
 room,
 what


what
 else
 feels
 different
 about
 this
 era


or
 or
 or
 other
 advice
 that
 you
 find


yourself
 whether
 it's
 around
 uh
 sort
 of


the
 talent
 wars
 that
 are
 going
 on
 or


other
 aspects
 that
 feel
 unique
 to
 this


era?
 What
 what
 other
 advice
 do
 you
 want


to
 be
 leaving
 our
 entrepreneurs
 with?


that's
 unique
 to
 this
 era.
 Well,
 like
 I


I
 I
 actually
 think
 you
 said
 the
 right


thing,
 which
 is
 this
 is
 a
 unique
 era.


And
 so


trying
 to


learn
 the
 organizational
 design
 lessons


of
 the
 past
 or
 trying
 to
 learn
 um
 kind


of
 too
 much
 from
 the
 last
 generation
 is


can
 be
 deceptive


because
 things
 really
 are
 different.


like
 the
 way
 these
 you
 know
 the
 way
 your


companies
 are
 getting
 built
 is
 is
 quite


different
 in
 in
 many
 aspects.
 Uh
 and
 you


know
 the
 types
 of


you
 know
 what
 the
 just
 like
 our
 observ


observation
 on
 like
 PhD
 AI
 researchers


is
 just
 very
 different
 than
 like
 a


traditional
 um
 engineer
 full
 stack


engineer
 or
 something
 like
 that.
 So
 you


know
 I
 I
 think
 you
 do
 have
 to
 think


through
 a
 lot
 of
 things
 from
 first


principles
 uh
 because
 it
 is
 different


and
 like
 you
 know
 observing
 from
 the


outside
 it's
 really
 different.


>> Yeah.


>> Yeah.
 And
 I
 would
 just
 offer
 like
 I
 I
 do


think
 things
 are
 going to
 change.
 So
 I


already
 talked
 about
 I
 think
 the
 shape


and
 form
 of
 products
 is
 going
 to
 change.


Um
 uh
 and
 so
 like
 I
 think
 there's
 still


a
 lot
 of
 creativity
 there.
 I
 also
 think


and
 I
 I I
 let's
 say
 I
 think
 that
 um
 like


in
 a
 in
 a
 world
 of
 supply
 and
 demand
 the


thing
 that
 creates
 gluts
 is
 shortages.


Um
 right
 so
 like
 when
 something
 becomes


too
 scarce
 there
 becomes
 a
 massive


economic
 incentive
 to
 figure
 out
 how
 to


unlock
 new
 supply
 and
 so
 the
 the
 the


current
 generation
 of
 AI
 companies
 are


really
 struggling
 with
 uh
 particular


shortages
 of
 of
 the
 really
 talented
 AI


researchers
 and
 engineers
 and
 then


they're
 really
 you
 know
 challenged
 with


shortage
 of
 of
 infrastructure
 capacity


chips
 and
 and
 data
 centers
 and
 power.
 Um


I
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 call
 timing
 on
 this.


There
 will
 come
 a
 time
 when
 both
 of


those
 things
 become
 gluts.
 Um
 and
 so
 you


I
 don't
 know
 I
 don't
 know
 that
 we
 can


plan
 for
 that.
 Um
 although
 I
 I
 would


just
 say
 the
 following.
 Number
 one,
 um


the
 the
 the
 researcher
 engineer
 side
 of


things,
 it
 is
 striking.
 It
 is
 striking


to
 the
 degree
 to
 which
 um
 there
 are


excellent,
 you
 know,
 outstanding
 models


coming
 out
 of
 China
 now.
 Um
 you
 know,


and and
 in
 a
 m
 from
 multiple
 companies


and
 you
 know,
 specifically,
 you
 know,
 uh


Deepseek
 and
 and
 Quinn
 and
 Kimmy.
 Um
 it


is
 striking
 how
 the
 teams
 that
 are


making
 those
 are
 not,
 you
 know,
 the
 name


brand,
 you
 know,
 for
 the
 most
 part,


these
 are
 not
 like
 the
 name
 brand
 people


with
 their
 names
 on
 all
 the
 papers.
 Um


and
 and
 so
 like
 China
 is
 successfully


decoding
 how
 to
 like
 basically
 take


young
 people
 and
 train
 them
 up
 in
 the


field.


>> Well,
 and
 XAI
 to
 a
 large
 extent
 too.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 And
 so
 I
 I
 think
 that
 I


think
 there's
 going
 to
 be
 and
 look
 it


makes
 sense
 up
 until
 it
 it
 makes
 sense


that
 for
 a
 while
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 this


super
 esoteric
 skill
 set
 and
 people
 are


going
 to
 pay
 through
 the
 nose
 for
 it.


But
 like
 you
 know
 there's
 no
 question


the
 information
 is
 right
 being


transferred
 into
 the
 environment.
 People


are
 learning
 how
 to
 do
 this.
 Um
 you
 know


college
 kids
 are
 figuring
 it
 out.
 Um,


and
 so,
 um,
 you
 know,
 there's
 there's


and
 I
 don't
 know
 that
 there's
 ever
 going


to
 be
 a
 talent
 glut
 per
 se,
 but
 like
 I


think
 for
 sure
 there's
 gonna
 there's


gonna
 be
 a
 lot
 more
 people
 in
 the
 future


who
 of
 course
 know
 know
 how
 to
 build


these
 things.
 Um,
 and
 then
 and
 then
 by


the
 way
 also
 of
 course
 you
 know
 AI


building
 AI,
 right?
 So
 that
 the
 the
 the


the
 tools
 themselves
 are
 going
 to
 be


better
 better
 at
 at
 contributing
 to


that.
 And
 so
 and
 and
 I
 think
 that
 I


think
 this
 is
 good
 because
 I
 think
 that


you
 know
 the
 current
 level
 of
 of


shortage
 of
 of
 engineers
 and
 researchers


is
 is
 is
 too
 constraining.
 And
 then
 and


then
 on
 the
 chip
 side
 I
 don't
 I
 don't


want
 to
 I'm
 not
 a
 chip
 guy
 and
 I
 don't


want
 to
 call
 call
 it
 specifically
 but


like
 it
 it's
 never
 been
 the
 case.
 It's


never
 been
 the
 case
 in
 the
 ship
 industry


that
 there's
 ever,
 you
 know,
 every
 every


shortage
 in
 the
 ship
 industry
 has
 always


resulted
 in
 a
 glut
 uh
 because
 the
 the


profit
 the
 profit
 pool
 of
 a
 shortage,


the
 margins
 get
 too
 big,
 the
 incentive


uh
 for
 other
 people
 to
 come
 in
 and


figure
 out
 how
 to
 commoditize
 the


function
 get
 too
 big.
 And
 so,
 you
 know,


Nvidia
 has
 like,
 you
 know,
 the
 best


position
 probably
 anybody's
 ever
 had
 in


chips.
 But
 notwithstanding
 that,
 I
 I


find
 it
 hard
 to
 believe
 that
 there's


going
 to
 be
 this
 level
 of
 pressure
 on


infrastructure
 in
 5
 years.


>> Yeah.
 And
 even
 if
 the
 bottleneck
 within


the
 infrastructure
 moves,
 so
 if
 if
 it


becomes
 power,
 if
 it
 becomes
 cooling
 or


or or
 anything
 else,
 then
 you'll
 have
 a


chip
 glut
 for
 sure.
 Yeah.


>> So
 So
 I
 I
 think
 over
 the
 I
 I
 would
 just


say
 this,
 it's
 likely
 the
 challenges


that
 we
 that
 we
 all
 have
 in
 five
 years


from
 now
 are
 going
 to
 be
 different


challenges.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Like
 don't


don't
 definitely
 this
 industry
 of
 all


industries
 don't
 look
 at
 us
 as
 static


like
 you
 know
 the
 positions
 uh
 could


change
 very
 very
 fast.


Let's
 actually
 close
 on
 a
 more
 of
 this


macro
 note.
 Mark,
 you
 mentioned
 China.


Last
 month,
 we
 were
 in
 DC
 and
 what
 one


of
 the
 big
 questions
 the
 senator
 has
 is


how
 should
 we
 make
 sense
 of
 sort
 of the


state
 of
 the
 AI
 race
 visa
 v
 China.
 Do


you
 you
 want
 to
 share
 just
 the
 the
 high


level
 um
 summary
 of
 what
 what
 you
 shared


with
 them?


>> Yeah.
 So
 my
 sense
 of
 things
 and
 I
 and
 I


think
 the
 current
 I
 think
 the
 current
 if


you
 just
 observe
 currently
 specifically


like
 deep
 sea
 quan
 and
 and
 these
 models


coming
 out
 of
 China
 I
 my
 my
 sense


basically
 is
 like
 I
 would
 say
 the
 US


specifically
 in
 the
 west
 generally
 but


you
 know
 more
 and
 more
 specifically
 the


US
 is
 like
 the
 conceptual
 innovations


are
 you
 know
 have
 been
 you
 know
 coming


out
 coming
 out
 of
 coming
 out
 of
 the
 US


coming
 out
 of
 the
 west
 you
 know
 kind
 of


the
 the
 big
 kind
 of
 conceptual


breakthroughs
 um
 uh
 China
 is
 extremely


good
 at
 picking
 up
 ideas
 and


implementing
 them
 and
 scaling
 them
 and


commoditizing
 them
 and
 and
 you
 know


that's
 that
 they
 do
 that
 obviously


throughout
 the
 manufacturing
 world.
 Um


and
 and
 they're
 doing
 it
 now
 very
 I


think
 successfully
 uh
 sort
 of
 in
 AI.
 Um


and
 so
 I
 would
 say
 that
 they're
 running


they're
 running
 the
 catch-up
 game
 like


really
 well.
 Um
 you
 know
 and
 then


there's
 there's
 sort
 of
 always
 this


question
 of
 like
 how
 much
 of
 that
 is


like
 being
 done
 let's
 just
 say
 like


authentically
 um
 uh
 you
 know
 through


hard
 work
 um
 and
 smart
 people
 and
 then


how
 much
 is
 being
 done
 with
 maybe
 a


little
 bit
 of
 help
 um
 maybe
 a
 little
 USB


stick
 uh
 in
 the
 middle
 of
 the
 night
 uh


you
 know
 kind
 of
 help
 um
 Okay.


>> So,
 uh,
 you
 know,
 there's
 always
 a


little
 bit
 of
 a
 question,
 but
 like


either
 either
 way,
 uh,
 you
 know,
 they're


they're
 doing
 a
 great
 job.
 Uh,
 obviously


they
 they
 aspire
 to,
 you
 know,
 more
 than


that.
 Um,
 and
 there
 are
 many
 very
 smart


and
 creative
 people
 in
 China.
 And
 so,


you
 know,
 it
 will
 be
 interesting
 now
 to


see,
 you
 know,
 the
 level
 to
 which
 the


conceptual
 breakthroughs
 start
 to
 come


from
 there
 and
 whether
 they
 whether
 they


pull
 ahead.
 Um,
 and
 so,
 but
 like
 I
 would


say
 like
 what
 we
 tell
 people
 in


Washington
 is
 like
 look
 this
 this
 is
 a


foot
 this
 is
 now
 this
 is
 a
 full-on
 race.


It's
 a
 foot
 race.
 It's
 a
 game
 of
 inches.


Like
 we're
 not
 going
 to
 have
 a
 5year


lead.
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 like
 maybe
 a


six-month
 lead.
 Like
 we
 have
 to
 run


fast.
 We
 have
 to
 win.
 Like
 we
 we
 have
 to


we
 have
 to
 do
 this.
 We
 we
 can't
 and
 then


we
 can't
 put
 constraints
 on
 our


companies
 that
 the
 the
 the
 Chinese


government
 isn't
 putting
 on
 their
 own


companies.
 And
 so
 um
 you
 know
 we'll
 just


lose
 and
 you
 know
 do do
 you
 really
 want


do
 you
 really
 want
 to
 wake
 up
 in
 the


morning
 and
 live
 in
 a
 world
 you
 know


really
 controlled
 and
 run
 by
 Chinese
 AI?


Most
 of
 us
 would
 say
 no
 we
 don't
 want
 to


live
 in
 that
 world.
 Um
 and
 so
 um
 so
 so


that
 so
 there's
 that
 and
 I
 would
 say
 I


feel
 moderately
 good
 about
 that
 just


because
 I
 think
 that
 I
 think
 we're
 we're


really
 good
 at
 software.
 um
 you
 know
 the


minute
 this
 goes
 into
 you
 know
 embodied


AI
 in
 the
 form
 of
 robotics
 I
 think


things
 get
 a
 lot
 scarier
 and
 you
 know


this
 is
 the
 thing
 I'm
 now
 spending
 time


in
 DC
 trying
 to
 really
 educate
 people
 on


which
 is
 you
 know
 the
 ch
 because
 the
 US


and
 the
 west
 have
 chosen
 to


de-industrialize
 to
 the
 extent
 that
 we


have
 over
 the
 last
 40
 years
 um
 you
 know


China
 China
 specifically
 now
 has
 this


giant
 industrial
 ecosystem
 for
 building


you
 know
 sort
 of
 mechanical
 electrical


and
 um
 uh
 and
 semiconductor
 and
 now


software
 you
 know
 devices
 of
 all
 kinds


including
 phones
 and
 drones
 phones
 and


cars
 um
 and
 robots.
 Um
 and
 so
 uh
 you


know
 there's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 phase
 two
 to


the
 AI
 revolution.
 It's
 going
 to
 be


robotics.
 It's
 going
 to
 happen
 you
 know


pretty
 quickly
 here
 I
 think.
 Um
 and
 when


it
 does
 like
 even
 if
 the
 US
 stays
 ahead


in
 software
 like
 the
 robots's
 got
 to
 get


built
 and
 that's
 not
 an
 easy
 thing.
 And


it's
 not
 just
 like
 a
 company
 that
 does


that.
 It's
 got
 to
 be
 an
 entire


ecosystem.
 Um
 and
 it's
 you
 know
 it's


going
 to
 be
 you
 know
 it's
 going
 to
 you


know
 like
 I
 mean
 you
 know
 the
 car


industry
 was
 not
 three
 car
 companies.
 It


was
 thousands
 and
 thousands
 of
 of
 of


component
 suppliers
 building
 all
 the


parts.
 And
 it's
 been
 the
 same
 thing
 for


airplanes
 and
 the
 same
 thing
 for


computers
 and
 everything
 else.
 Um
 it's


going to
 be
 the
 same
 thing
 for
 robotics.


Um
 and
 you
 know
 by
 default
 sitting
 here


today
 that's
 all
 going
 to
 happen
 in


China.
 And
 so
 even
 if
 they
 never
 quite


catch
 us
 in
 software
 they
 might
 just


like
 lap
 us
 in
 hardware
 and
 and
 that'll


be
 that.
 Um
 you
 know
 the
 good
 news
 is
 I


I
 think
 there's
 a
 growing
 awareness
 in


there's
 a
 growing
 awareness
 I
 would
 say


across
 the
 political
 political
 spectrum


in
 the
 US
 that
 like
 de-industrialization


went
 too
 far.
 Uh
 and
 there's
 a
 growing


desire
 to
 kind
 of
 figure
 out
 how
 to


reverse
 that.
 Um,
 and
 um,
 you
 know,
 I


say
 I'm
 guardedly
 optimistic
 that
 we'll


be
 making
 progress
 on
 that,
 but
 I
 think


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 work
 to
 be
 done


>> on
 that
 call
 to
 arms.
 Uh,
 let's
 wrap.


Uh,
 thank
 you
 Mark
 and
 Ben.
 To
 to
 wrap


up,
 I'd
 like
 to
 welcome
 back.


>> Thank
 you,
 everybody.


[Applause]
