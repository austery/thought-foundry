Companies
 pour
 billions
 into
 AI,
 but


where
 is
 the
 money?
 Numbers
 don't
 lie.


Mackenzie's
 latest
 state
 of
 AI
 survey


reveals
 that
 only
 11%
 of
 companies


report
 significant
 tangible
 impact
 on


company
 level
 earnings
 from
 their
 Genai


investments.
 S&P
 Global
 found
 that
 42%


of
 companies
 abandoned
 most
 of
 their
 AI


projects
 in
 2025,
 which
 is
 up
 from
 just


17%
 the
 year
 before.
 And
 that's
 based
 on


the
 survey
 of
 more
 than
 2400
 IT
 decision


makers.
 Only
 onethird
 said
 that
 they


broke
 even
 and
 14%
 recorded
 losses.
 The


average
 company
 in
 the
 US
 abandoned


about
 46%
 of
 AI
 proof
 concepts
 before


reaching
 production.
 We're
 witnessing


the
 greatest
 disconnect
 between


investment
 and
 financial
 returns
 in


modern
 business
 history.
 Record
 AI


funding
 meets
 systematically


disappointing
 financial
 results.
 We
 hear


AI
 this,
 AI
 that,
 but
 show
 us
 the
 money.


This
 is
 episode
 five
 of
 my
 series
 AI


hive
 versus
 reality.
 And
 in
 this


episode,
 we
 will
 dissect
 the
 topic
 of


how
 much
 AI
 is
 actually
 making
 for


businesses
 in
 the
 US,
 if
 anything
 at


all.
 Let's
 dive
 in.
 The
 measurement


problem.
 First
 of
 all,
 let's
 talk
 about


how
 AI
 impact
 gets
 measured.
 How
 do
 we


know
 where
 the
 line
 is
 between
 nice
 to


have
 AI
 and
 AI
 that's
 actually
 moving


the
 business
 metrics?
 I'm
 going
 to
 speak


about
 it
 from
 the
 perspective
 of
 a


product
 manager.
 Every
 time
 I
 put


something
 in
 my
 product,
 it
 is
 my
 job
 to


ensure
 that
 the
 feature
 that
 I'm
 putting


in
 achieves
 one
 of
 the
 three
 things.
 It


either
 makes
 money,
 saves
 money,
 or


retains
 money.
 In
 the
 B2B
 world,
 the


overarching
 idea
 is
 pretty
 much
 the


same.
 When
 a
 business
 signs
 a
 contract


with
 a
 new
 vendor,
 let's
 say
 a
 new
 AI


project
 management
 tool,
 they
 do
 that


with
 one
 of
 the
 three
 goals
 in
 mind.
 The


app
 will
 either
 bring
 money,
 retain


money,
 or
 save
 money
 for
 the
 business.


Now,
 what
 is
 an
 ROI?
 ROI
 only
 exists


when
 there
 is
 a
 dollar
 tag
 attached.
 ROI


is
 not
 when
 you
 can
 write
 15
 emails


instead
 of
 10
 in
 the
 same
 time
 frame.


ROI
 isn't
 when
 your
 app
 summarizes
 last


month's
 analytics
 so
 you
 can
 prep
 a
 deck


faster
 to
 report
 results.
 ROI
 is
 a


finance
 ratio.
 Hard
 dollar
 benefit
 minus


total
 dollar
 cost
 divided
 by
 total


dollar
 cost.
 Outcomes
 that
 stay
 in
 hours


or
 NPS
 point
 never
 reach
 the
 numerator.


Productivity
 and
 ROI
 are
 never
 the
 same.


And
 the
 metrics
 that
 measure
 the
 two
 are


not
 the
 same.
 And
 the
 signals
 that


you're
 getting
 from
 tracking
 both
 of


them
 are
 not
 the
 same.
 So
 how
 should
 ROI


be
 measured
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 AI


products?
 Revenue
 growth.
 Did
 the
 AI


solution
 lead
 to
 actual
 new
 sales,


upsells
 or
 market
 expansion?
 Cost


reduction.
 Did
 the
 AI
 automate
 anything


fully
 or
 did
 it
 optimize
 processes
 to


actually
 lower
 operating
 expenses
 and


retention
 or
 savings?
 Did
 AI
 help
 retain


customers
 who
 might
 have
 otherwise


turned?
 Now,
 let's
 talk
 about
 the


metrics
 that
 look
 impressive,
 but
 the


ones
 that
 die
 on
 CFO's
 desk,
 the


so-called
 vanity
 metrics.
 The
 most


obvious
 one
 is
 hours
 saved.
 It's
 a
 big


round
 number,
 but
 unless
 headcount
 or


overtime
 spent
 actually
 goes
 down,
 this


is
 potential
 savings,
 not
 book
 dollars.


For
 engineering,
 PR
 is
 merged
 or
 lines


of
 code
 generated.
 Development
 platforms


service
 this
 metric
 by
 default,
 but
 it


shows
 speed,
 and
 speed
 does
 not
 equal


value.
 Faster
 code
 only
 matters
 if
 it


ships
 revenue
 producing
 features
 sooner


and
 that
 time
 gain
 gets
 monetized.


Tickets
 resolved
 per
 agent.
 It
 does
 make


support
 dashboards
 look
 heroic,
 but
 it


needs
 translation
 into
 actual
 headcount


reduction.
 Here's
 a
 quick
 litmus
 test.


Does
 the
 metric
 appear
 on
 the
 profit
 and


loss
 statement?
 Revenue,
 cost
 of
 goods


sold,
 the
 day-to-day
 cost
 of
 operating
 a


business
 like
 salaries,
 rent,
 software,


or
 forecasted
 cash
 flow.
 If
 yes,
 it's
 a


candidate
 for
 ROI.
 If
 not,
 it's
 a


productivity
 or
 quality
 metric.
 Now,
 why


does
 traditional
 ROI
 not
 work
 for
 AI


investments?
 It
 doesn't
 work
 because
 AI


creates
 value
 slowly
 and
 methodically.


Unlike
 standard
 technical
 systems,
 AI


improves
 over
 time
 as
 it
 learns
 from


more
 data
 and
 feedback.
 With
 AI
 apps,


rapid
 ROI
 calculation
 is
 extremely


unreliable
 because
 it
 often
 improves


things
 that
 do
 not
 have
 that
 clear-cut


cost
 savings
 or
 immediate
 revenue.
 The


benefits
 are
 harder
 to
 tie
 directly
 to


financial
 metrics
 because
 they
 show
 up


months
 or
 years
 later.
 AI
 rarely
 works


in
 isolation.
 It
 often
 coincides
 with


other
 changes
 like
 new
 processes
 or


software
 or
 business
 models.
 But
 when


you're
 being
 asked
 to
 quantify
 the


impact,
 it's
 really
 tough
 to
 pinpoint


what
 portion
 of
 value
 stems
 from
 AI


specifically.
 But
 the
 problem
 is
 that


the
 companies
 often
 do
 deploy
 AI
 in


isolation.
 So
 measuring
 ROI
 is
 really


hard.
 But
 productivity
 is
 a
 lot
 easier


to
 throw
 in
 a
 dashboard
 and
 tell
 a


story.
 So
 that
 became
 the
 new
 narrative


of
 the
 modern
 tech.
 Look
 how
 productive


we
 all
 are.
 And
 productivity
 became
 the


northstar,
 the
 productivity
 obsession.


There
 is
 evidence
 that
 starting
 2022


when
 GBT
 came
 out,
 US
 companies
 started


shifting
 their
 focus
 from
 traditional


profitability
 metrics
 to
 productivity


metrics.
 The
 shift
 occurred
 during
 that


AI
 hysteria
 when
 everybody
 thought
 that


AI
 tools
 would
 significantly
 boost


efficiency
 and
 speed
 and
 productivity


even
 more
 so
 than
 the
 short-term


profits.
 Now
 why
 did
 companies
 move


towards
 productivity
 metrics?
 A
 lot
 of


leaders
 rebranded
 their
 corporate


strategy
 around
 efficiency
 as
 seen


notably
 at
 Meta
 in
 2023
 where
 the


company
 labeled
 the
 year
 of
 the
 year
 of


efficiency
 amplifying
 productivity.
 KPIs


across
 various
 industries
 were
 redefined


and
 expanded
 by
 AI.
 Companies
 started


measuring
 things
 like
 development
 time


or
 speed
 of
 time
 to
 market.
 moving


beyond
 just
 standard
 profit
 margins.
 By


mid
 to
 late
 2024
 and
 into
 2025,
 a
 lot
 of


companies
 realized
 that
 productivity


gains
 alone
 were
 not
 translating
 to


clear
 bottomline
 results
 such
 as


profits.
 Companies
 also
 learned
 that
 the


cost
 of
 maintaining
 AI
 doesn't
 always


get
 justified
 by
 productivity
 gains.


Productivity
 metrics
 grew
 and
 plateaued


and
 companies
 started
 rebalancing


towards
 traditional
 profitability
 such


as
 net
 income
 or
 cash
 flow.
 So
 the


narrative
 and
 executive
 commentary


around
 AI
 changed
 in
 2025
 saying
 that
 to


measure
 AI
 ROI,
 you
 have
 to
 be
 measuring


productivity
 and
 profitability
 together,


not
 in
 isolation.
 Now
 let's
 look
 at


three
 realworld
 AI
 rollouts
 and
 three


wildly
 different
 bank
 statements.
 GitHub


Copilot
 helped
 developers
 finish
 tasks


55%
 faster
 in
 controlled
 experiments,


but
 Microsoft
 has
 not
 reported
 any


corresponding
 value.
 And
 an
 independent


study
 showed
 no
 cycle
 time
 improvement


and
 a
 higher
 bug
 rate.
 Meta's
 year
 of


efficiency
 paired
 AI
 tooling
 with
 mass


layoffs.
 They
 cut
 their
 headcount
 by
 22%


and
 ultimately
 doubled
 their
 operating


margin.
 There's
 your
 example
 where
 AI


delivered
 the
 ROI
 because
 cost


structures
 were
 aggressively


re-engineered.
 McDonald's
 AI
 drive-thru


pilot
 built
 on
 IBM's
 LLM
 promised
 labor


savings,
 but
 ended
 in
 viral
 ordering


failures
 and
 was
 shut
 down
 in
 2024
 with


no
 returns
 whatsoever.
 Three
 companies,


three
 productivity
 stories,
 and
 only
 one


outcome.
 Now,
 why
 didn't
 productivity


obsession
 work?
 Productivity
 jumps
 are


clear
 for
 individuals,
 for example,


faster
 report
 writing
 or
 customer


service
 resolutions.
 But
 aggregating


them
 across
 the
 company
 often
 reveals


less
 impact.
 Time
 saved
 does
 not


immediately
 result
 in
 more
 output
 or


revenue
 because
 that
 time
 can
 be


reallocated
 to
 less
 measurable
 or
 lower


value
 tasks.
 For
 example,
 meetings.
 Can


we
 all
 just
 admit
 that
 all
 the
 time


we're
 able
 to
 save
 by
 not
 writing


updates
 or
 documentation
 results
 in


leaving
 the
 office
 an
 hour
 earlier
 or


using
 that
 time
 to
 book
 more
 unnecessary


meetings.
 Most
 companies
 have


implemented
 AI
 in
 isolated
 teams
 or


business
 units
 rather
 than
 transforming


entire
 workflows
 end
 to
 end
 and
 lots
 of


resources
 were
 spent
 on
 training
 and


updating
 those
 workflows,
 AI
 outputs
 and


change
 management.
 These
 overhead
 costs


often
 offset
 productivity
 improvements.


The
 only
 thing
 that
 AI
 has
 done
 for
 sure


is
 that
 it
 has
 contributed
 to


disproportionate
 difficulty
 getting
 into


entry-level
 roles.
 I
 can
 see
 it
 in


comments
 under
 my
 own
 videos.
 Only


companies
 that
 deeply
 change
 their


processes
 and
 invested
 in
 AI
 talent


consistently
 see
 bottomline
 results.


Most
 don't.
 Let's
 talk
 about
 some


non-obvious
 trends.
 There
 is
 a
 clear


evidence
 that
 American
 VC
 investment
 in


AI
 startups
 including
 the
 so-called
 GBT


rappers
 continues
 to
 be
 very
 strong
 and


even
 growing
 in
 2025
 despite
 a
 broader


shift
 towards
 focus
 on
 profitability.


And
 that
 is
 happening
 because
 the
 sector


is
 benefiting
 from
 the
 maturation
 of


generative
 AI.
 Before
 2023,
 VC


investment
 in
 AI
 startups
 was
 largely


driven
 by
 innovation
 hype
 and
 rapid


growth
 ambitions.
 Investors
 put
 a
 huge


focus
 on
 cuttingedge
 technology
 and


groundbreaking
 applications.
 And
 funds


were
 often
 thrown
 at
 all
 kinds
 of
 ideas


without
 clear
 paths
 to
 profitability.


This
 is
 what
 VC
 scene
 looked
 like
 two


years
 ago.
 Large
 amounts
 of
 capital


poured
 into
 early
 stage
 startups


focusing
 primarily
 on
 novel
 AI


capabilities
 rather
 than
 business
 models


or
 financial
 returns.
 Valuations
 shot


through
 the
 roof.
 Everyone
 was
 throwing


money
 at
 anything
 that
 sound
 even


remotely
 generative
 AI.
 Emphasis
 was


placed
 on
 capturing
 market
 share
 and


technological
 leadership
 quickly
 over


immediate
 or
 near-term
 profitability.


The
 deal
 cycles
 were
 very
 fast
 and
 many


investments
 were
 speculative
 bets
 on
 the


transformative
 potential
 of
 AI
 expecting


returns
 in
 longer
 term.
 And
 lastly,
 Soft


Bank's
 early
 big
 bets
 on
 OpenAI
 and


other
 visionary
 startups
 exemplified


that
 growth
 at
 all
 cost
 mentality.
 But


starting
 2024,
 there
 has
 been
 a
 clear


shift
 towards
 a
 different
 kind
 of


evaluation.
 Investors
 are
 way
 more


careful
 now.
 They're
 looking
 closely
 at


unit
 economics,
 real
 traction,
 customer


retention,
 and
 all
 the
 boring
 stuff
 that


actually
 matters.
 The
 investment
 dollars


have
 concentrated
 more
 on
 mature
 or


enterprise
 ready
 AI.
 So,
 you
 might
 be


thinking,
 well,
 that's
 it
 for
 GBT


rappers,
 then.
 Nope,
 not
 dead.
 Welcome


to
 the
 rapper
 wars.
 The
 AI
 rapper


concept
 emerged
 as
 startups
 began


building
 specialized
 applications
 on
 top


of
 powerful
 existing
 AI
 models
 like
 GBT


or
 Claude
 or
 Llama.
 Instead
 of


developing
 foundational
 AI
 from
 scratch,


which
 requires
 immense
 resources,


companies
 started
 wrapping
 AI


capabilities
 into
 domain
 specific


products.
 The
 AI
 rapper
 economy
 matured


beyond
 simple
 interfaces
 to
 more
 complex


and
 more
 functional
 applications.


Rappers
 evolved
 into
 multi-layered


applications
 that
 solve
 specific


industry
 problems
 like
 legal
 or


healthcare
 or
 finance
 or
 software


engineering.
 They
 embed
 AI
 into
 existing


business
 workflows
 and
 they
 often
 offer


very
 advanced
 features.
 For
 example,


legal
 AI
 rapper
 Harvey
 grew
 to
 $5


billion
 valuation
 and
 75
 million
 annual


recurring
 revenue.
 Coding
 AI
 rapper


Nisphere
 reached
 2.5
 billion
 valuation


with
 100
 million
 ARR
 rapidly.
 The
 market


for
 AI
 rappers
 expanded
 drastically
 with


the
 generative
 AI
 industry
 projected
 to


hit
 38
 billion
 by
 late
 2025.
 And
 the


biggest
 part
 of
 this
 prediction
 is


driven
 by
 rappers.
 So
 in
 summary,
 the
 AI


rapper
 economy
 has
 evolved
 from
 rapid


hypedriven
 wave
 of
 simple
 API
 based


applications
 to
 advanced
 and
 arguably


the
 biggest
 industry
 segment
 in
 AI.
 It


has
 given
 a
 chance
 to
 founders
 big
 and


small
 to
 commercialize
 AI
 by
 wrapping


sophisticated
 models
 into
 practical
 and


revenue
 generating
 applications.


Conclusion.


So
 despite
 the
 hype,
 AI
 doesn't


automatically
 generate
 returns.
 And


that's
 not
 pessimism.
 It's
 pattern


recognition.
 So
 when
 you
 hear
 headlines


like
 AI
 is
 revolutionizing
 everything,


ask
 where
 is
 the
 money.
 Productivity
 is


not
 ROI.
 Automation
 is
 not


profitability.
 Time
 saved
 is
 not
 money


made
 unless
 you
 can
 show
 it
 on
 your
 P&L.


Media
 loves
 bold
 narratives
 because
 they


drive
 clicks.
 But
 business
 doesn't


reward
 narrative.
 It
 rewards
 profits.


The
 US
 is
 still
 the
 land
 of
 capitalism.


And
 underneath
 the
 noise,
 the
 AI
 ROI


curve
 is
 quite
 slow.
 So,
 stop
 the
 panic.


You're
 not
 going
 to
 be
 replaced


overnight.
 AI
 is
 not
 moving
 fast
 enough


to
 wipe
 your
 entire
 career
 in
 a
 single


quarter,
 but
 it
 is
 moving
 fast
 enough


that
 you
 cannot
 afford
 to
 relax.
 You've


got
 time
 to
 upskill,
 but
 use
 it
 well.
 As


always,
 I
 hope
 this
 was
 helpful.
 Let
 me


know
 what
 you
 guys
 think
 in
 the


comments.
 We'll
 see
 you
 next
 time.
