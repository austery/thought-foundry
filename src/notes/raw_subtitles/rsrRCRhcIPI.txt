This
 video
 series
 is
 for
 tech


professionals
 already
 living
 and
 working


in
 the
 US,
 Canada,
 the
 UK,
 or
 the


European
 Union.
 If
 you're
 based
 outside


these
 regions
 or
 in
 an
 outsourcing
 heavy


market,
 the
 data
 in
 this
 video
 will
 not


apply
 to
 your
 situation.
 I
 do
 not
 cover


immigration,
 international
 job
 hunting,


or
 topics
 like
 how
 to
 break
 into
 tech


without
 a
 college
 degree.
 If
 that's
 what


you're
 here
 for,
 this
 probably
 isn't
 the


right
 channel,
 and
 that's
 okay.
 But
 if


you
 are
 operating
 within
 these
 markets,


keep
 watching.
 There's
 a
 lot
 ahead
 for


various
 seniority
 levels
 and
 career


tracks
 in
 tech.
 If
 you're
 hoping
 this
 is


one
 of
 those
 videos
 where
 I
 tell
 you
 how


to
 pivot
 into
 data
 science
 in
 3
 months


with
 a
 boot
 camp
 and
 a
 dream,
 it's
 not.


I
 will
 not
 be
 selling
 you
 the
 90-day


data
 science
 fantasy.
 This
 is
 a
 very


real
 and
 unfiltered
 experience
 of


learning
 data
 science
 as
 a
 non-engineer


while
 juggling
 a
 full-time
 job
 and


running
 a
 YouTube
 channel.
 I've
 been


doing
 this
 for
 5
 months
 now
 and
 spoiler,


no,
 not
 everybody
 can
 do
 it.
 And
 I'll


tell
 you
 exactly
 why
 some
 people
 make


it,
 why
 most


don't.
 Under
 the
 last
 few
 videos,
 I
 got


multiple
 comments
 from
 people
 asking


whether
 it's
 possible
 to
 switch
 to
 data


science
 after
 a
 non-technical


background.
 The
 most
 popular
 request
 was


whether
 it's
 possible
 to
 do
 it


completely
 for
 free.
 The
 insights
 in


this
 video
 are
 based
 exclusively
 on
 my


own
 experience
 for
 a
 couple
 of
 reasons.


Number
 one,
 there
 is
 no
 research
 or
 data


set
 that
 shows
 reliable
 outcomes
 for


people
 making
 this
 transition.
 And
 if


you
 interview
 a
 h
 100
 people
 who
 did
 it,


you
 will
 get
 a
 100
 different
 results.


Secondly,
 I
 have
 personally
 invested


close
 to
 $200,000
 into
 my
 own
 education.


Not
 scholarships,
 not
 from
 my
 parents.
 I


earned
 all
 of
 that
 money
 in
 my
 20s
 and
 I


spent
 all
 of
 it
 on
 my
 education.
 I've


done
 a
 college,
 I've
 done
 two


universities,
 and
 I've
 done
 a
 lot
 of


professional
 education.
 So,
 trust
 me


when
 I
 say
 that.
 I
 know
 a
 lot
 about


educational
 models
 and
 I've
 seen
 pretty


much
 all
 of
 them.
 Third,
 I've
 dealt
 with


a
 crippling
 imposttor
 syndrome
 for
 most


of
 my
 life.
 I've
 overstudied
 more


subjects
 that
 I
 needed
 to
 just
 to
 feel
 a


little
 bit
 of
 confidence
 in
 myself.
 So


the
 whole
 how
 to
 go
 from
 a
 non-technical


non-engineering
 background
 to
 technical


that
 question
 hits
 very
 close
 to
 home.


To
 level
 set,
 I
 am
 a
 product
 manager
 and


I
 have
 been
 working
 in
 the
 tech
 industry


building
 technical
 systems
 and
 software.


my
 entire
 life
 since
 age
 19,


professional
 life.
 I
 am
 not
 a
 data


scientist
 and
 I'm
 not
 planning
 on


switching
 careers,
 at least
 for
 now.
 But


right
 now,
 I'm
 going
 through
 a
 proper


training
 in
 data
 science,
 the
 exact
 same


curriculum
 that
 I
 would
 be
 following
 if


I
 were
 to
 change
 careers.
 The
 reason
 I'm


going
 through
 it
 is
 because
 a
 lot
 of


active
 PMs
 are
 trying
 to
 jump
 that
 AI


train
 right
 now
 and
 qualify
 as
 AI
 or


machine
 learning
 product
 managers.
 I'm


not
 chasing
 that
 route
 as
 I
 have
 worked


on
 machine
 learning
 applications
 and


smart
 devices
 in
 the
 past,
 but
 I
 do
 want


to
 stay
 up
 to
 speed
 with
 the
 pace
 of
 the


innovation
 and
 the
 change.
 And
 no,
 I
 do


not
 want
 to
 do
 a
 3-day
 AI
 for
 product


management
 boot
 camp
 that
 is
 not
 even


scratching
 the
 surface
 of
 what
 machine


learning
 product
 development
 really


looks
 like.
 If
 anything,
 it
 gives
 people


inflated
 confidence
 thinking
 that


they're
 now
 qualified
 AIPMs
 and
 then


they
 start
 slapping
 those
 new
 badges
 on


their
 LinkedIn.
 And
 then
 when
 it's
 time


to
 actually
 contribute
 and
 execute,
 that


badge
 disappears
 in
 a
 day.
 I'm
 a
 big


believer
 that
 if
 you
 want
 to
 get
 into


AI,
 data
 science,
 or
 machine
 learning,


even
 as
 a
 non-developer,
 it
 is
 essential


to
 go
 through
 technical
 training
 because


you
 will
 be
 guiding
 people
 who
 do
 build


this
 technology.
 And
 why
 would
 any
 of


them
 respect
 you
 if
 you
 don't
 really


know
 what
 you're
 doing?
 This
 is
 what
 I


preach
 in
 my
 channel.
 Most
 people
 don't


lack
 the
 ability
 to
 learn
 technical


skills.
 They
 just
 have
 a
 mental
 block


that
 stops
 them
 from
 starting.
 And
 the


solution
 I'm
 offering
 is
 to
 get
 over
 the


mental
 block
 and
 do
 hard
 things.
 I'm


probably
 the
 exact
 kind
 of
 person
 you


would
 call
 non-technical
 picking
 up
 data


science.
 And
 if
 I
 wanted
 to
 do
 a
 full


career
 pivot,
 I
 would
 be
 doing
 it
 in
 the


exact
 same
 way
 that
 I'm
 doing
 it
 right


now,
 just
 with
 more
 focus
 on
 the


interview
 prep.
 So,
 let's
 dive
 into
 it.


Where
 am
 I
 learning?
 How
 it's
 going?
 And


who
 I
 think
 can
 realistically
 make
 the


jump.
 Hi,
 this
 is
 Daria
 and
 this
 is


TechBake
 It
 Real.
 Please
 subscribe
 and


give
 us
 a
 thumbs
 up.
 We're
 putting
 a
 lot


of
 work
 into
 this
 channel
 trying
 to


deliver
 the
 most
 honest
 and
 real
 results


about
 the
 tech
 world
 and
 the
 tech
 scene


in
 2025.
 So,
 where
 am
 I
 learning
 data


science?
 I
 am
 using
 a
 learning
 platform


called
 DataQuest
 and
 I'm
 doing
 their


course
 called
 Data
 Scientist
 in
 Python.


This
 video
 is
 not
 sponsored
 by
 anybody.


The
 only
 reason
 I'm
 sharing
 it
 is


because
 I
 actually
 like
 the
 program.
 I


picked
 it
 after
 comparing
 it
 to
 a
 few


other
 options
 and
 Data
 Quest
 made
 the


most
 sense
 to
 me.
 I
 think
 it's
 very


reasonably
 priced
 and
 the
 content
 is


very
 solid.
 It's
 an
 11-monthlong
 program


and
 if
 you
 want
 to
 follow
 the
 pace,
 I'd


say
 you
 would
 need
 to
 spend
 about
 an


hour
 to
 an
 hour
 and
 a
 half
 every
 single


day.
 What
 I
 do
 is
 I
 usually
 study
 three


times
 a
 week
 for
 about
 two
 and
 a
 half
 to


three
 hours
 per
 session
 and
 I'm
 still
 on


track
 to
 finish
 within
 the
 11
 months.
 I


picked
 this
 program
 because
 it
 covers


pretty
 much
 everything
 you
 would
 need
 to


be
 able
 to
 land
 a
 junior
 role
 as
 a
 data


analyst
 or
 even
 as
 a
 junior
 machine


learning
 engineer.
 It
 covers
 coding,


math,
 stats,
 SQL,
 data
 operations,


machine
 learning
 models,
 deep
 learning


training,
 and
 at
 the
 end
 of
 each


chapter,
 you
 have
 a
 project
 to
 complete,


which
 can
 be
 uploaded
 and
 added
 to
 your


portfolio
 on
 GitHub.
 You
 also
 get
 access


to
 a
 community
 that
 can
 review
 and


comment
 on
 your
 work.
 You
 can
 also
 look


at
 what
 others
 are
 doing,
 and
 there
 is


also
 a
 big
 question
 bank
 that
 you
 can


leverage
 when
 prepping
 for
 interviews.


How
 it's
 going?
 Honestly,
 I'm
 doing


great.
 I'm
 enjoying
 the
 course.
 I'm


learning
 a
 lot,
 and
 I'm
 practicing
 a


lot.
 I
 love
 how
 structured
 it
 is.
 I
 love


that
 it
 has
 a
 very
 healthy
 amount
 of


adult
 gamification.
 And
 by
 that,
 I
 mean


that
 I'm
 not
 collecting
 any
 stars
 or


magic
 coins.
 It's
 just
 the
 courses
 are


broken
 into
 small
 lessons
 and
 you
 feel


good
 about
 completing
 them
 one
 after


another.
 Another
 game
 changer
 for
 me
 is


the
 integration
 of
 AI
 assistance
 into


the
 modern
 learning
 platforms
 because


you
 can
 ask
 all
 the
 questions
 you
 have


always
 been
 too
 embarrassed
 to
 ask
 in


class.
 I
 remember
 that
 feeling
 way


before
 AI
 technology
 became
 so


ubiquitous
 back
 when
 I
 was
 in
 middle


school
 or
 high
 school
 or
 even


university.
 Every
 time
 you
 got
 stuck


when
 solving
 a
 problem,
 unless
 you
 could


figure
 it
 out
 on
 your
 own,
 you
 had
 to
 go


to
 a
 prof
 to
 a
 teaching
 assistant
 or
 to


a
 tutor
 and
 you
 had
 to
 be
 very


vulnerable
 in
 front
 of
 other
 people.
 You


would
 get
 a
 limited
 amount
 of
 time
 and


you
 don't
 want
 to
 sound
 stupid.
 And
 then


the
 prof
 leaves
 and
 you
 have
 even
 more


questions
 that
 you
 want
 to
 ask.
 And
 then


you
 come
 home
 and
 you
 have
 a
 choice.


Either
 you
 invest
 your
 time
 into


understanding
 every
 aspect
 of
 it
 and


going
 through
 numerous
 links
 and


resources
 to
 find
 your
 answers
 and
 get


behind
 on
 other
 subjects
 or
 you
 move


past
 it
 but
 deep
 inside
 you
 know
 that


you
 will
 have
 gaps
 in
 understanding.
 So


for
 me
 their
 AI
 assistant
 Chandra
 AI
 is


a
 gamecher.
 I
 can
 ask
 the
 stupidest


questions.
 I
 can
 write
 my
 code
 in
 five


different
 variations
 and
 get
 feedback
 on


every
 single
 one.
 I
 can
 look
 at
 the


trade-offs.
 I
 can
 see
 what's
 working.
 I


can
 see
 what's
 not
 working.
 I
 can
 ask


question
 about
 every
 single
 line
 of


code.
 Honestly,
 it's
 great.
 The
 learning


has
 definitely
 become
 much
 easier.
 That


I
 can
 tell
 you
 for
 sure.
 After
 a
 few


months,
 I
 developed
 a
 much
 stronger


understanding
 of
 how
 machine
 learning


systems
 are
 built,
 how
 they're
 trained,


how
 the
 data
 is
 structured,
 and
 how


algorithmic
 outputs
 are
 generated.
 I'm


also
 rebuilding
 my
 fluency
 in
 Python


after
 not
 using
 it
 for
 a
 really
 long


time
 since
 university.
 Now
 what
 I'm
 not


doing,
 I
 am
 not
 preparing
 for


interviews.
 I'm
 learning
 to
 be
 a
 more


competent
 product
 manager
 in
 the
 machine


learning
 domain,
 but
 I'm
 not
 trying
 to


land
 a
 data
 science
 job
 tomorrow.
 With


that
 said,
 if
 your
 goal
 is
 to
 land
 a
 job


in
 data
 science,
 just
 be
 aware,
 this


course
 has
 extra
 practice
 problems
 after


every
 chapter,
 and
 I
 usually
 skip
 them.


You'll
 want
 to
 do
 them,
 especially
 if


you're
 gearing
 up
 for
 interviews.
 And
 I


think
 after
 doing
 this
 course
 for


several
 months,
 I'm
 able
 to
 describe
 the


profile
 of
 a
 non-technical
 or
 a


non-engineer
 person
 who
 in
 my
 humble


opinion
 would
 be
 capable
 of
 making
 a


career
 pivot
 and
 really
 doing
 this
 for
 a


living.
 If
 there
 is
 anything
 you
 listen


to
 in
 this
 video,
 please
 listen
 to
 this


part.
 This
 is
 the
 most
 important
 part


that
 I
 think
 is
 crucial
 for


understanding
 if
 you're
 exploring
 data


science
 as
 a
 field
 and
 coming
 from


non-technical
 background.
 who
 can


actually
 make
 this
 career
 switch.
 First,


let's
 define
 what
 non-technical
 means.


Non-technical
 can
 be,
 hey,
 I'm
 a


journalist
 and
 I
 studied
 English


literature
 at
 uni
 and
 I
 want
 to
 become
 a


data
 scientist.
 A
 non-technical
 can
 be,


hey,
 I'm
 a
 customer
 success
 rep
 and
 I


really
 want
 more
 money
 and
 I'm
 exploring


data
 science.
 Non-technical
 can
 be
 I'm
 a


UX
 designer
 and
 I
 want
 to
 get
 into
 tech


field
 and
 I
 want
 to
 switch
 to
 data


analytics.
 And
 non-technical
 can
 be
 my


situation
 where
 I'm
 a
 product
 manager.
 I


build
 technical
 systems,
 but
 I
 don't


code
 on
 a
 daily
 basis.
 Can
 I
 become
 a


data
 scientist?
 So,
 all
 four
 seemingly


non-technical,
 but
 are
 they
 all
 equal?


Let's
 look
 at
 the
 structure
 of
 the


course.
 You're
 going
 to
 need
 to
 become


proficient
 in
 data
 science
 languages


such
 as
 Python.
 You're
 going
 to
 be


studying
 data
 operations.
 You're
 going


to
 brush
 up
 on
 statistics
 and


probability
 theory.
 You're
 going
 to
 be


studying
 machine
 learning
 models.
 you're


going
 to
 be
 working
 with
 a
 lot
 of
 data


data
 cleaning
 and
 data
 visualization.


Depending
 on
 the
 area
 of
 data
 science


that
 you're
 going
 to
 go
 to,
 you're
 going


to
 need
 to
 upskill
 in
 industry
 specific


knowledge
 later
 on.
 All
 of
 these
 require


a
 certain
 level
 of
 understanding
 of


technical
 logic
 as
 well
 as
 experience


with
 data
 sets
 and
 data
 analysis,


probability
 and
 statistics,
 system


architecture,
 etc.
 It's
 fine
 if
 you


learned
 it
 before
 or
 had
 prior


experience
 and
 need
 a
 refresher.
 But
 I


can
 definitely
 see
 how
 one
 may
 get


discouraged
 if
 you
 have
 never
 touched
 a


line
 of
 code
 in
 your
 entire
 life.
 Never


performed
 any
 statistical
 analysis,


never
 had
 practice
 of
 applying


systematic
 thinking
 or
 quantitative


reasoning
 on
 a
 regular
 basis.
 A
 few


words
 on
 the
 mental
 block.
 I
 strongly


believe
 that
 there
 are
 far
 more
 people


capable
 of
 technical
 or
 technically


adjacent
 careers
 than
 it
 seems.
 But
 many


don't
 even
 try.
 Not
 necessarily
 because


they
 cannot
 grasp
 technical
 concepts,


but
 because
 of
 a
 mental
 block.
 If
 deep


inside
 you,
 you
 look
 at
 this
 curriculum


and
 you're
 like,
 "Well,
 I
 think
 this
 is


quite
 doable."
 But
 in
 the
 past,
 every


time
 you
 tried
 and
 got
 stuck,
 you
 lost


faith
 in
 yourself.
 Let
 me
 tell
 you
 a


story
 from
 my
 own
 example.
 Until
 I
 was


about
 22,
 I
 thought
 that
 I
 would
 never


be
 able
 to
 code
 because
 the
 stereotype


that
 I
 grew
 up
 around
 was
 that
 if
 you


want
 to
 code,
 you
 must
 be
 exceptionally


good
 at
 math.
 And
 the
 interesting
 thing


is
 that
 I
 have
 always
 been
 perfectly


fine
 with
 math
 and
 perfectly


comfortable.
 I
 could
 do
 stats,
 I
 could


do
 algebra,
 calculus,
 geometry,
 but
 I


was
 always
 a
 kid
 who
 wouldn't
 finish
 the


last
 two
 hardest
 problems
 on
 exam.
 Like


for
 example,
 if
 I
 had
 an
 exam
 and
 there


were
 40
 problems
 to
 go
 through,
 I'd
 be


able
 to
 do
 36
 38
 max,
 but
 I
 would
 never


get
 to
 those
 two
 or
 four
 extra
 hard
 ones


at
 the
 very
 end
 that
 require
 more


abstract
 thinking.
 And
 because
 of
 that,


I
 always
 thought
 I
 was
 dumb
 and
 I
 was


convinced
 that
 programming
 wasn't
 for


me.
 And
 that
 was
 until
 I
 actually
 went


to
 university.
 And
 I
 will
 always
 be


grateful
 to
 my
 professors
 and
 frankly
 to


myself
 for
 picking
 a
 life
 science


degree.
 So
 I
 majored
 in
 biochemistry,


biochemical
 engineering
 when
 I
 got
 into


uni.
 And
 my
 self-esteem
 went
 up
 because


finally
 I
 saw
 how
 the
 math
 that
 I
 had


been
 studying
 for
 years
 applies
 to


something
 very
 real
 and
 very
 important.


I
 realized
 that
 it's
 not
 that
 I
 was
 too


dumb
 to
 do
 difficult
 math.
 It's
 that
 I


do
 much
 better
 at
 it
 when
 I
 can
 see
 the


impact
 of
 my
 own
 calculations.
 At


universities,
 math
 classes
 that
 I
 had


within
 my
 degree
 were
 taught
 in
 the


context
 of
 chemistry.
 It's
 one
 thing
 to


solve
 a
 bunch
 of
 equations
 and
 having


zero
 context
 of
 where
 it
 applies
 and


it's
 a
 totally
 different
 thing
 when


you're
 being
 given
 a
 problem
 and
 all
 of


a
 sudden
 you
 go,
 "Oh
 my
 god,
 I
 actually


understand
 how
 this
 formula
 or
 how
 this


entire
 concept
 helps
 me
 calculate
 let's


say
 a
 half-life
 of
 a
 reaction
 or


something
 along
 those
 lines.
 This
 is
 the


mental
 block
 I'm
 talking
 about.
 For


years,
 I
 was
 convinced
 I
 was
 too
 dumb


for
 it
 when
 objectively
 I
 wasn't.
 But
 it


took
 me
 20
 years
 to
 find
 the
 right


learning
 style
 for
 myself
 to
 realize


that
 I
 can
 be
 good
 enough
 for
 this.
 The


reason
 I
 think
 that
 data
 science
 is
 now


more
 accessible
 to
 people
 than
 it
 was


before
 is
 because
 of
 AI
 integration
 into


those
 learning
 platforms
 and
 the


availability
 of
 LLM
 apps
 in
 general


because
 you
 can
 take
 any
 educational


information
 and
 restructure
 it
 to
 suit


your
 learning
 style.
 You
 can
 ask
 for


examples
 that
 you
 understand.
 You
 can


ask
 for
 analogies
 that
 you
 understand


and
 you
 don't
 have
 to
 stick
 to
 a


standard
 script
 and
 if
 there's
 something


that's
 not
 making
 sense,
 you
 just
 go,


"Okay,
 well
 then
 this
 is
 just
 not
 for


me."
 However,
 once
 you're
 past
 that


mental
 block,
 you
 have
 to
 be
 real
 with


yourself
 and
 assess
 your
 chances.
 The


reality
 check.
 When
 you're
 asking


yourself,
 is
 it
 possible
 for
 me
 to


switch
 to
 data
 science?
 You
 have
 to
 be


looking
 at
 two
 factors.
 Your
 work


experience
 and
 your
 primary
 education.


You
 got
 to
 have
 some
 prior
 experience
 or


some
 foundation
 in
 math
 or
 science
 or


work
 experience
 in
 tech
 rules
 at least.


If
 you
 have
 no
 educational
 foundation


and
 no
 experience
 working
 with
 data
 or


systems,
 you're
 signing
 up
 for
 a
 brutal


uphill
 battle.
 Even
 if
 you
 land
 a
 role


somehow,
 you
 will
 be
 surrounded
 by


people
 who
 have
 spent
 years
 training
 in


this
 field
 and
 you
 might
 not
 be
 able
 to


keep
 up.
 Plus,
 if
 the
 industry
 changes,


you
 won't
 have
 that
 mindset
 to
 adapt


because
 your
 skill
 will
 be
 very
 much


limited
 to
 exactly
 what
 you
 learned.
 The


reason
 why
 my
 profile
 is
 a
 candidate
 for


a
 career
 pivot
 is
 because
 of
 the


following.
 I
 have
 two
 undergrad
 degrees,


one
 in
 business,
 one
 in
 biochemical


engineering.
 My
 master's
 is
 in
 product


management
 and
 system
 design.
 I
 have


worked
 in
 the
 tech
 industry
 for
 the
 past


nine
 years
 and
 I
 have
 built
 very


technical
 systems
 already.
 I
 have


studied
 calculus,
 stats
 and
 programming


in
 the
 past.
 No,
 I
 don't
 code
 on
 a
 daily


basis
 but
 I
 do
 have
 a
 pretty
 good


understanding
 of
 how
 to
 read
 code.
 In


university
 I
 worked
 on
 chemistry


adjacent
 coding
 problems
 like
 lab
 data


analysis
 and
 reaction
 prediction.
 I've


already
 used
 many
 of
 the
 core
 data


science
 tools
 just
 not
 in
 a
 job
 title.


So
 to
 all
 the
 people
 who
 did
 science
 and


engineering
 degrees
 at
 school
 just
 not


computer
 science
 guys
 you've
 already


done
 a
 lot
 of
 data
 science
 training
 and


you
 have
 a
 very
 good
 shot
 at
 it.
 This
 is


more
 than
 doable
 for
 you.
 So
 while
 I


feel
 non-technical
 sometimes
 objectively


I'm
 not
 starting
 from
 scratch.
 Do


matter?
 Yes.
 This
 field
 has
 a
 high


barrier
 to
 entry.
 If
 you
 studied


mathematical
 sciences
 or
 life
 sciences


such
 as
 physics,
 chemistry
 or
 biology
 or


if
 you
 studied
 any
 kind
 of
 engineering,


mechanical,
 chemical,
 biological,


medical,
 you
 will
 be
 miles
 ahead
 of


someone
 with
 a
 communications
 degree
 and


no
 technical
 exposure.
 Who
 has
 a


realistic
 shot?
 Who
 can
 realistically


get
 into
 data
 science
 from
 a


non-engineer
 background?
 So
 it
 is


possible
 if
 you
 work
 in
 tech
 already
 or


in
 a
 tech
 adjacent
 or
 a
 data
 adjacent


role.
 So
 roles
 such
 as
 product


management,
 technical
 support,
 finance


and
 risk
 analysts.
 If
 you're
 building


technical
 products,
 systems,


applications,
 and
 you
 deal
 with


technical
 problems
 every
 single
 day,


databases,
 APIs,
 all
 of
 that,
 you're


very
 tech-savvy
 and
 you're
 capable
 of


reading
 the
 code.
 Or
 if
 you
 studied
 hard


science
 or
 engineering
 discipline
 and


you
 did
 that
 at
 an
 accredited
 university


where
 you
 were
 constantly
 tested
 and


assessed
 on
 your
 knowledge
 and
 you're


comfortable
 with
 numbers,
 logic
 and


systems.
 Maybe
 you
 haven't
 coded
 in


years,
 but
 you
 know
 how
 to
 learn
 it.
 Who


in
 my
 opinion
 is
 going
 to
 have
 a
 very


hard
 time,
 almost
 impossible
 chance
 at


getting
 into
 data
 science
 unless
 you
 go


back
 to
 school
 full-time.
 If
 you
 have


never
 worked
 in
 tech,
 if
 you
 have
 never


studied
 anything
 scientific
 and
 you're


chasing
 quick
 money,
 if
 you
 believe
 a


3-month
 boot
 camp
 is
 going
 to
 get
 you
 a


machine
 learning
 job,
 if
 you
 want
 the


title
 but
 not
 the
 hard
 work
 that
 comes


with
 it.
 Now,
 if
 you
 want
 to
 come
 at
 me


and
 tell
 me
 about
 that
 one
 friend
 of


yours
 who
 was
 a
 hairdresser
 yesterday,


did
 a
 3-month
 boot
 camp
 in
 data
 science,


and
 became
 a
 machine
 learning
 engineer,


by
 all
 means,
 go
 ahead.
 You
 could


comment,
 but
 let's
 be
 honest,
 that
 is


not
 representative,
 first
 of
 all.
 And


secondly,
 let's
 see
 how
 long
 that
 person


will
 last
 in
 that
 job.
 You're
 free
 to


leave
 the
 comment.
 I
 just
 want
 to
 say


that
 this
 channel
 isn't
 Willy
 Wonka's


factory.
 I
 am
 not
 handing
 out
 golden


tickets
 to
 people
 who
 believe
 in
 Santa


Claus,
 the
 tooth
 fairy,
 or
 the


six-figure
 salaries
 after
 a
 boot
 camp.


It's
 not
 going
 to
 happen.
 It
 is


impossible.
 Do
 not
 expect
 a
 miracle


after
 a
 3month
 boot
 camp.
 Conclusion:


Can
 you
 do
 it
 without
 a
 degree?
 No.
 Not


in
 the
 way
 people
 mean
 it.
 You
 need
 some


sort
 of
 formal
 training.
 If
 it's
 not
 a


full
 degree,
 then
 previous
 training
 in


science
 or
 engineering
 or
 years
 of
 work


experience
 in
 tech.
 Can
 you
 get
 into


data
 science
 from
 any
 background?
 No.
 Is


it
 easy?
 No.
 But
 is
 it
 possible
 if
 you


work
 your
 ass
 off
 and
 have
 some


prerequisites
 under
 your
 belt?
 Yes,
 very


much
 so.
 How
 long
 is
 it
 going
 to
 take


you
 if
 you
 do
 have
 the
 relevant


background?
 One
 to
 one
 and
 a
 half
 years


of
 active
 studying
 plus
 interview
 prep


while
 having
 a
 full-time
 job.
 I
 want
 to


say
 that
 the
 amount
 of
 effort
 it's
 going


to
 take
 will
 be
 equal
 to
 doing
 a


part-time
 masters
 while
 having
 a
 9
 toive


job.
 And
 that's
 a
 wrap.
 That
 was
 my


opinion
 on
 the
 realistic
 path
 to
 data


science
 for
 non-engineers.
 I
 would
 love


to
 hear
 your
 thoughts,
 especially
 if


you're
 currently
 transitioning
 and
 can


share
 feedback
 on
 how
 it's
 going.
 I


would
 also
 love
 to
 hear
 the
 success
 and


failure
 stories
 about
 your
 transition


into
 data
 science.
 Let's
 talk
 about


that.
 I
 hope
 this
 was
 helpful.
 Till
 next


time.
 Bye.
