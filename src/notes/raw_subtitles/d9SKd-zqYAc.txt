So
 DIA
 is
 the
 world's
 leading
 AI
 video


platform.
 We
 crossed
 100
 million
 AR.
 We


launched
 the
 first
 product
 to
 a
 million


AR.
 It
 took
 us
 4
 months.
 We
 then
 went


from
 1
 million
 AR
 to
 3
 million
 AR
 in
 one


year.
 But
 we
 basically
 tripled
 revenue


from
 there.
 Tripled
 again
 and
 then
 we


doubled
 and
 doubled.
 Are
 we
 doing
 this


because
 it's
 fun
 and
 new?
 Are
 we
 doing


this
 because
 it's
 actually
 useful
 for


the
 customer?
 People
 are
 not
 trying
 to


like
 use
 a
 model
 to
 do
 something.


They're
 trying
 to
 solve
 a
 problem
 that


they
 have.
 Right?
 In
 our
 case,
 the


problem
 is
 making
 a
 video
 for
 something.


I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 AI
 apps
 are
 feeling


this
 today
 where
 you
 may
 go
 viral,
 have


a
 lot
 of
 people
 who
 are
 interested
 in


your
 product
 and
 they
 come
 to
 you
 and


play
 around
 with
 it.
 But
 it's
 really


important
 to
 understand
 who
 are
 coming


because
 they
 have
 a
 real
 use
 case
 that's


recurring
 and
 who's
 coming
 because
 it's


a
 cool
 fun
 thing
 that
 they
 want
 to
 try


out.
 Do
 we
 actually
 think
 that
 they
 look


real
 enough
 to
 work
 or
 is
 it
 a
 gimmick?


Sometimes
 you'll
 be
 the
 hottest
 company


in
 town
 and
 everybody
 will
 want
 to
 talk


to
 you.
 Other
 times
 you'll
 be
 deemed
 as


the
 incumbent
 that
 nobody
 cares
 about
 or


like
 you're
 not
 doing
 something
 that's


fun
 or
 kind
 of
 in
 the
 current
 sort
 of


hype
 cycle.
 And
 no
 matter
 like
 which
 of


those
 cycles
 you're
 in,
 I
 think
 the
 most


important
 thing
 is
 really
 just
 like


Victor
 Roelli
 and
 I'm
 one
 of
 the


co-founders
 and
 the
 CEO
 of
 Synthesia.


Sadesia
 is
 the
 world's
 leading
 AI
 video


platform
 for
 the
 enterprise
 and
 for


businesses.
 At
 its
 core,
 really
 what
 we


help
 our
 customers
 do
 to
 land
 whatever


message
 they
 have
 for
 their
 customers,


their
 employees,
 their
 partners
 with
 the


most
 engagement
 and
 effectiveness


possible.
 So
 we've
 built
 a
 platform
 that


enables
 anyone
 who
 knows
 how
 to
 use
 a


PowerPoint
 to
 create
 a
 video.
 We're


really
 what
 we're
 all
 about,
 right,
 is


communicating
 in
 video,
 which
 is
 the


most
 effective
 way
 to
 deliver
 a
 message.


Today,
 we
 crossed
 100
 million
 AR.
 We've


raised
 $330
 million
 in
 venture
 capital.


Commercially,
 we
 work
 with
 more
 than
 70%


of
 the
 Fortune
 100.
 Today,
 we
 have
 more


than
 65,000
 customers
 all
 around
 the


world.
 People
 are
 not
 trying
 to
 like
 use


a
 model
 to
 do
 something.
 They're
 trying


to
 solve
 a
 problem
 that
 they
 have,


right?
 In
 our
 case,
 the
 problem
 is


making
 a
 video
 for
 something.


We
 started
 the
 company
 in
 2017.
 The


first
 three
 years
 of
 the
 company,
 it


wasn't
 very
 fun.
 and
 the
 tech
 didn't


really
 work
 and
 it
 was
 it
 was
 a
 kind
 of


an
 uphill
 battle.
 So
 this
 was
 like
 the


first
 time
 the
 world
 really
 saw
 a
 neural


network
 generate
 video
 at
 a
 pretty
 high


quality
 fully
 automatically
 right
 if
 you


saw
 the
 output
 of
 that
 face
 tof
 face


video
 and
 you
 would
 have
 to
 do
 that
 in
 a


visual
 effect
 studio
 you
 would
 be


talking
 like
 millions
 of
 dollars
 to


create
 a
 clip
 like
 this
 and
 this
 thing


actually
 did
 it
 in
 real
 time
 and
 when
 I


saw
 that
 for
 the
 first
 time
 my
 mind


started
 running
 I
 felt
 like
 this
 going


to
 change
 everything
 about
 how
 we
 create


video
 but
 it's
 also
 going
 to
 change


everything
 about
 video
 itself
 as
 a


medium
 but
 I
 felt
 like
 it
 was
 worth


exploring
 starting
 a
 company
 around
 this


technology
 when
 we
 see
 new
 technologies


the
 first
 thing
 we
 do
 always
 imagine
 all


the
 1,000
 ways
 it
 can
 go
 wrong,
 right?


Cars,
 smartphones,
 AI,
 video
 generation,


music
 generation.
 That's
 always
 what
 we


default
 to.
 But
 it
 just
 turns
 out
 most


of
 the
 time
 that
 technologies
 end
 up


being
 used
 mostly
 for
 good
 things
 by


good
 people.
 And
 there's
 a
 subset
 of


people
 use
 it
 for
 bad
 things.
 And
 I


think
 being
 optimistic
 about
 technology,


especially
 in
 the
 early
 stages
 of
 it,
 I


think
 is
 actually
 a
 huge
 arbitrage
 in


itself.
 I
 mean,
 essentially
 we
 went
 out


right
 and
 we
 we
 told
 people
 look
 in
 10


years
 you're
 going
 to
 be able
 to
 make
 a


Hollywood
 film
 from
 your
 laptop
 just


with
 your
 imagination.
 you
 won't
 need


anything
 else
 than
 that
 and
 it's
 got
 to


be
 more
 or
 less
 free
 to
 do
 it.
 And
 a
 lot


of
 people
 just,
 you
 know,
 thought
 that


there
 was
 a
 crazy
 idea.
 It
 was
 just
 it


was
 in
 the
 AI
 winter.
 You
 know,
 there


had
 been
 a
 lot
 of
 like
 disillusionment


like
 a
 bunch
 of
 companies
 funding
 in
 the


years
 before
 we
 started
 the
 company
 had


all
 kind
 of
 like
 turned
 out
 to
 not


really
 work
 because
 technology
 was
 just


too
 immature.
 We
 got
 turned
 down
 by
 like


100
 investors,
 something
 like
 that
 until


we
 eventually
 sent
 a
 cold
 email
 to
 Mark


Cuban.
 He
 was
 probably
 the
 only
 person


we
 met
 who
 totally
 shared
 our
 vision
 of


the
 future.
 So
 he
 wasn't
 evaluating
 the


vision.
 He
 was
 bought
 in
 on
 that.
 He
 was


more
 kind
 of
 evaluating
 if
 he
 thought


the
 team
 was
 worth
 funding
 and
 if
 you


think
 we
 had
 a
 shot
 at
 at
 building


something
 real.
 You
 need
 one
 person
 to


say
 yes.
 That's
 all
 it
 takes.
 And


generally
 it's
 easier
 to
 try
 and
 find


people
 who
 already
 share
 kind
 of
 like


your
 vision
 of
 of
 what's
 going
 to
 happen


in
 the
 world
 as
 opposed
 to
 trying
 to


convince
 them
 of
 it.
 Especially
 if


you're
 not
 doing
 something
 that's
 in
 the


kind
 of
 current
 hype
 cycle.
 If
 in
 your


gut
 you
 truly
 really
 feel
 that
 you're
 on


to
 something
 and
 that
 someone
 if
 it's


not
 you
 someone
 is
 going
 to
 build
 a
 big


company
 around
 your
 the
 product
 that


you're
 doing
 you
 should
 continue


throughout
 the
 entire
 journey
 of


synthesis
 I've
 never
 a
 day
 in
 my
 life


doubted
 that
 someone
 is
 going
 to
 build
 a


big
 company
 around
 this
 technology
 I


could
 doubt
 myself
 sometimes
 I
 could


doubt
 by
 execution
 I
 could
 be
 afraid


that
 I
 was
 too
 early
 for
 where
 we
 were


but
 I
 never
 doubted
 that
 this
 technology


was
 going
 to
 be
 extremely
 valuable
 for


the
 world
 and
 someone
 was
 going
 to
 build


a
 company
 around


The
 hard
 thing
 is
 knowing
 when
 to


continue
 and
 when
 to
 pivot,
 right?
 We


started
 off
 with
 a
 million
 dollars,


right?
 Which
 is
 is
 not
 a
 lot
 of
 money


when
 you're
 building
 a
 company
 like
 what


we
 were
 trying
 to
 build.
 And
 so
 we
 had


to
 figure
 out
 like
 what
 do
 we
 think
 we


can
 realistically
 both
 build
 and
 sell


before
 having
 to
 raise
 the
 next
 round,


right?
 Which
 we
 would
 have
 to
 show
 some


kind
 of
 progress.
 And
 the
 first
 thing
 we


we
 we
 stumbled
 upon
 was
 this
 idea
 of
 AI


dubbing,
 which
 is
 give
 us
 a
 real
 video


shot
 with
 an
 actual
 camera.
 we
 can


translate
 it
 for
 you
 by
 replacing
 the


voice
 over
 with
 a
 different
 language
 but


then
 also
 reanimating
 the
 face
 so
 it


looks
 like
 uh
 the
 actor
 speaking
 a


different
 language
 which
 will
 be
 useful


if
 you're
 making
 a
 Hollywood
 film
 and


you
 want
 to
 distribute
 that
 all
 over
 the


world
 if
 you
 can
 make
 it
 look
 like
 it


was
 recorded
 in
 French
 Italian
 that


would
 be
 good
 for
 those
 audiences
 and


that
 value
 proposition
 was
 actually
 good


enough
 like
 that
 is
 definitely
 valuable


when
 you
 can
 do
 it
 but
 the
 technology


was
 very
 early
 it
 only
 worked
 if
 you


look
 straight
 at
 the
 camera
 it
 took
 two


PhDs
 you
 know
 like
 10
 days
 to
 make
 a


30-se
 secondond
 clip
 um
 it
 didn't
 scale


at
 all
 the
 quality
 threshold
 was


insanely
 high,
 right?
 Cuz
 all
 these


video
 people,
 they
 wouldn't
 accept


anything
 but
 like
 the
 very
 best
 in
 terms


of
 of
 the
 quality
 and
 it
 was
 just
 clear


to
 us
 that
 it
 was
 a
 vitamin.
 It
 wasn't
 a


painkiller,
 right?
 Like
 people
 liked


that.
 They
 thought
 it
 was
 cool.
 Um
 but


if
 we
 disappeared,
 no
 one
 is
 going
 to


yell
 and
 scream,
 you
 know?
 They
 are,
 you


know,
 we'll
 go
 back
 to
 translating
 the


way
 we
 did
 things
 before.
 So
 we
 went


back
 to
 the
 drawing
 board
 and
 we
 of


course
 talked
 to
 lots
 of
 people
 during


this
 period.
 We
 kind
 of
 realized
 that


rather
 than
 focusing
 on
 the
 people
 who


are
 already
 making
 video
 all
 the
 time,


there
 was
 a
 huge
 group
 of
 people,


billions
 of
 people
 probably
 that
 weren't


making
 videos
 at
 all.
 And
 these
 people


are
 desperate
 to
 make
 video.
 And
 they


were
 basically
 telling
 us,
 hey,
 I
 want


to
 deliver
 this
 message
 to
 someone.
 And


I
 know
 I
 should
 be
 doing
 a
 video
 or


audio
 because
 that's
 what
 people
 want
 to


consume.
 I
 just
 don't
 know
 where
 to


start.
 I
 don't
 know
 how
 to
 use
 a
 camera.


My
 boss
 won't
 give
 me
 any
 budget
 to


record
 it.
 And
 I
 know
 that
 there's
 so


many
 problems
 after
 I've
 actually
 shot


the
 content
 even
 though
 I
 get
 to
 make
 a


video
 because
 you
 can't
 edit
 a
 video


after
 you've
 shot
 it.
 And
 there's
 all


these
 problems
 of
 of
 video,
 right?
 And


then
 we
 we
 spoke
 more
 and
 more
 to
 these


people
 and
 ultimately
 learned
 a
 lot
 what


these
 people
 wanted
 to
 do
 was
 like


corporate
 videos.
 And
 corporate
 videos


are
 a
 lot
 easier
 than
 Steven
 Spielberg


filmed,
 right?
 And
 so
 if
 we
 could
 just


essentially
 help
 our
 customers
 with
 kind


of
 like
 the
 talking
 head
 style
 footage,


that
 would
 be
 pretty
 big.
 And
 that
 was
 a


much
 smaller
 domain
 than
 make
 any
 kind


of
 Hollywood
 film
 you
 can
 imagine,


right?
 So
 we
 built
 this
 avatar


technology
 that
 became
 one
 of
 the


central
 of
 the
 product
 today.
 That's


when
 the
 company
 started
 to
 really
 take


off
 very
 quickly.
 We
 had
 a
 lot
 of
 uh


conviction
 on
 a
 technology
 very
 early.


It
 was
 very
 unclear
 what
 the
 right
 first


use
 case
 was.
 You
 know,
 something
 that


was
 both
 valuable
 and
 you
 could


realistically
 build.
 But
 I
 think
 we


found
 our
 way
 there.
 You
 could
 argue


that
 we
 should
 just
 have
 built
 the


avatar
 technology
 from
 day
 one.
 But
 back


that
 day
 one,
 none
 of
 us
 had
 any
 idea


how
 we
 would
 potentially
 do
 that,
 right?


the
 research
 evolved
 over
 the
 years.
 We


learned
 the
 technology
 better
 and
 better


and
 so
 I
 think
 product
 market
 fit
 is
 one


of
 those
 kind
 of
 things
 which
 is
 is
 much


more
 art
 than
 science
 and
 I
 think
 we're


very
 much
 led
 by
 by
 deep
 understanding


of
 the
 customers
 that
 we're
 serving
 and


of
 course
 deep
 insight
 into
 into
 the


technologies.
 It
 it
 ultimately
 turned


out
 the
 right
 ways.


Once
 we
 launched
 the
 product
 and
 we
 had


the
 first
 avatar
 MVP
 out
 there,
 we
 went


viral
 very
 quickly.
 And
 so
 we
 had
 like


lots
 of
 people
 coming
 onto
 the
 website,


lots
 of
 people
 making
 kind
 of
 free
 demo


videos
 of
 avatars
 by
 typing
 in
 things


because
 it
 was
 fun
 and
 cool
 and
 they


want
 to
 show
 all
 their
 friends
 and
 it's


amazing.
 The
 first
 time
 you
 see
 it,


you're
 kind
 of
 mind
 blown,
 right?
 But
 a


lot
 of
 these
 people
 did
 not
 have
 any


real
 use
 case
 and
 we
 could
 see
 that
 in


the
 retention,
 right?
 They
 weren't


coming
 back.
 They
 were
 just
 making
 a
 few


videos,
 showing
 it
 to
 people,
 not
 making


any
 more
 videos.
 And
 so
 that
 wasn't


really
 like
 a
 sustainable
 revenue
 stream


for
 us.
 But
 there
 was
 a
 small
 group
 of


people
 and
 they
 kept
 using
 the
 product


you
 know
 they
 kept
 coming
 back
 and
 uh
 we


we
 we
 kind
 of
 went
 into
 that
 group
 and


that
 spent
 a
 lot
 of
 time
 speaking
 to


those
 folks
 and
 that's
 where
 we


uncovered
 sort
 of
 interesting
 value


equation
 right
 where
 these
 people
 were


not
 comparing
 our
 videos
 to
 real
 videos


or
 camera
 videos
 they're
 comparing
 our


videos
 to
 text
 documents
 and
 when
 that's


the
 comparison
 then
 the
 quality


threshold
 looks
 very
 different
 right
 the


feature
 request
 that
 they
 needed
 look


very
 different
 so
 it
 was
 an
 organic


thing
 I
 think
 of
 of
 letting
 yourself
 be


guided
 by
 customers
 but
 also
 applying
 a


lot
 of
 like
 critical
 thinking.
 The


critical
 thinking
 is
 like
 difficult
 when


you
 have
 so
 much
 inbound
 interest.
 I


think
 a
 lot
 of
 AI
 apps
 are
 feeling
 this


today
 where
 you
 may
 go
 viral
 have
 a
 lot


of
 people
 who
 are
 interested
 in
 your


product
 and
 that
 come
 to
 you
 and
 play


around
 with
 it.
 But
 it's
 really


important
 to
 understand
 who
 are
 coming


because
 they
 have
 a
 real
 use
 case
 that's


recurring
 and
 who's
 coming
 because
 it's


a
 cool
 fun
 thing
 that
 they
 want
 to
 try


out.
 Early
 days
 of
 2021,
 we
 have


customers
 who
 will
 scream
 and
 yell
 if
 we


shut
 down
 the
 product
 tomorrow.
 That's


always
 I
 think
 a
 good
 asset
 test
 of
 like


do
 you
 have
 something
 real
 or
 not
 or
 do


people
 kind
 of
 mildly
 care
 but
 not


really.
 We
 all
 realize
 that
 there
 are


lots
 of
 unanswered
 questions
 for
 sure


but
 there
 clearly
 is
 something
 right


there's
 a
 kernel
 of
 something
 that
 is
 uh


that
 is
 huge
 and
 I
 think
 it
 was
 kind
 of


double
 exciting
 in
 some
 ways
 because
 it


felt
 like
 it
 was
 our
 little
 secret
 and


it
 was
 for
 a
 couple
 of
 years
 it
 wasn't


very
 obvious
 from
 the
 outside
 that


anyone
 had
 any
 real
 use
 for
 this
 tech.


That
 was
 a
 fun
 couple
 of
 years
 where
 we


felt
 like
 we
 know
 something
 the
 rest
 of


the
 world
 doesn't
 and
 and
 we're


capitalizing
 on
 it.


We
 figured
 very
 early
 on
 actually
 in


2021
 that
 we
 wanted
 to
 focus
 in
 the


enterprise
 because
 that
 was
 clearly


where
 there
 was
 the
 most
 value
 to
 drive


and
 that
 was
 clearly
 where
 we
 could
 you


know
 get
 to
 the
 kind
 of
 biggest
 contract


size.
 But
 it
 was
 also
 very
 obvious
 to
 us


that
 the
 growth
 channels
 and
 the
 way
 to


get
 this
 in
 the
 hands
 as
 many
 people
 as


possible
 was
 not
 through
 enterprise


sales.
 It
 was
 through
 just
 giving
 people


access
 to
 the
 product,
 letting
 them
 play


around
 with
 it,
 let
 them
 find
 their
 own


use
 case,
 letting
 them
 qualify


themselves
 before
 they
 spoke
 to
 the


sales
 team.
 What
 was
 hard
 is
 when
 you're


building
 both
 bottoms
 up
 motion
 and


you're
 trying
 to
 build
 a
 tops
 down


motion.
 Those
 things
 conflict
 in
 many


different
 ways.
 As
 a
 startup,
 you
 have


limited
 resource.
 And
 a
 lot
 of
 things


you
 build
 for
 a
 big
 company
 will
 have


very
 little
 impact
 on
 a
 small
 company,


right?
 Like
 if
 you
 build
 admin
 tooling


uh
 for
 like
 a
 CIO,
 a
 50%
 company
 is
 not


going to
 care
 about
 that.
 So
 they
 won't


get
 much
 value
 out
 of
 it.
 On
 the
 other


hand,
 if
 you
 build
 tools
 for
 like
 small


businesses,
 a
 lot
 of
 that
 will
 not
 have


value
 for
 someone
 who
 is
 um
 is
 really


big
 business,
 right?
 There's
 always
 like


these
 trade-offs
 that
 you
 make.
 But
 I


think
 when
 you
 look
 at
 the
 last,
 you


know,
 10-15
 years,
 some
 of
 the
 companies


that
 have
 had
 like
 the
 best
 and
 most


impressive
 runs
 are
 companies
 that
 have


managed
 to
 combine
 the
 kind
 of
 vacuum


effect
 of
 PLG
 where
 when
 you
 really
 get


it
 working,
 right,
 it's
 just
 this
 vortex


that
 just
 like
 sucks
 in
 traffic
 and


convert
 it
 into
 both
 paying
 customers


and
 credit
 cards,
 but
 also
 spits
 out,


you
 know,
 the
 world's
 best
 enterprise


leads
 with
 1010
 worldclass
 sales
 team


that
 knows
 how
 to
 handhel
 customers,


take
 them
 through
 a
 sales
 process,
 make


them
 successful,
 and
 do
 all
 these


different
 things.
 And
 it's
 interesting


because
 it's
 not
 just
 in
 the
 expression


of
 the
 product
 and
 the
 product
 roadmap.


A
 lot
 of
 people
 tend
 to
 think
 that,
 but


it's
 also
 very
 much
 in
 just
 like
 the


people
 you
 hire,
 right?
 Some
 people


really
 love
 like
 the
 self-service
 world


and
 that's
 what
 they're
 passionate


about.
 Other
 people
 really
 love


enterprise
 sales.
 And
 so
 marrying
 like


those
 two
 cultures
 together
 is


definitely
 a
 challenge,
 but
 um
 I
 think


we've
 in
 broadstrokes
 done
 pretty
 well


on
 it.


I
 think
 a
 mistake
 people
 often
 make


especially
 people
 who
 maybe
 have
 already


had
 a
 job
 in
 like
 big
 tech
 or
 like
 a


successful
 companies
 they
 go
 out
 and


then
 they
 try
 to
 hire
 people
 from


Google,
 Meta,
 OpenAI
 like
 you
 know


whatever
 kind
 of
 is
 the
 hot
 companies
 of


our
 time
 and
 they
 go
 out
 they
 hey
 I
 have


this
 cool
 startup
 idea
 why
 don't
 you


join
 me
 I'll
 pay
 you
 not
 as
 much
 but


I'll
 try
 and
 pay
 you
 almost
 roughly
 as


much
 etc.
 And
 of
 course
 this
 can
 work.


There
 are
 very
 smart
 people
 who
 work


there
 who
 also
 wants
 to
 the
 startup


hustle.
 But
 often
 times
 you
 just
 can't


get
 them
 straight
 up
 or
 if
 you
 do
 get


them
 and
 they
 are
 used
 to
 a
 very


different
 salary,
 a
 very
 different


lifestyle
 uh
 working
 in
 a
 big
 tech


company
 as
 opposed
 to
 being
 in
 a


startup.
 So
 that's
 actually
 often
 not


the
 best
 path.
 So
 I
 think
 that
 the


better
 way
 of
 doing
 it,
 which
 is
 what
 we


did,
 is
 you
 try
 and
 find
 people
 that
 are


a
 bit
 off.
 You
 know,
 they're
 not
 like


the
 most
 obvious
 people
 to
 join
 your


startup,
 but
 there's
 something
 you
 like


about
 them.
 That
 could
 be
 that
 they
 have


just
 a
 lot
 of
 hustle,
 a
 lot
 of
 grit


engineers
 that
 maybe
 haven't
 worked
 at


like
 a
 tier
 one
 or
 tier
 two
 company,
 but


they
 are
 great
 open
 source
 project
 that


they're
 managing
 and
 updating.
 Like


there
 are
 a
 lot
 of
 other
 signals
 you
 can


find
 good
 people,
 right?
 And
 if
 you
 can


find
 these
 people
 who
 are
 truly
 hungry


and
 wants
 to
 work
 at
 a
 startup
 and
 wants


to
 put
 in
 the
 work,
 you
 gather
 a
 great


group
 of
 those
 and
 they
 will
 very
 often


outperform
 the
 10
 people
 who
 used
 to


work
 in
 big
 tech
 uh
 with
 their
 comfy


lifestyles.
 people
 you
 can
 take
 and
 we


help
 shape
 give
 them
 opportunities
 to
 do


something
 that's
 your
 only
 option
 in
 the


early
 days
 finding
 that
 like
 racktac


group
 of
 underdogs
 that
 have
 the


collective
 energy
 to
 to
 go
 up
 against


the
 competitors
 and
 incumbents
 I
 think


that
 there
 is
 nothing
 that
 prepares
 you


to
 really
 start
 a
 business
 like
 starting


a
 business
 like
 spending
 4
 years
 in


Mckenzie
 is
 not
 going
 to
 make
 you
 a


better
 entrepreneur
 make
 you
 have
 a


little
 bit
 more
 network
 and
 maybe


slightly
 easy
 to
 raise
 money
 but
 if
 you


actually
 truly
 if
 you
 know
 deep
 in
 your


heart
 that
 you
 want
 to
 build
 a
 company


and
 you
 are
 a
 builder
 I
 think
 you
 just


get
 started
 as
 quickly
 as
 you
 And
 don't


be
 afraid
 of
 starting
 too
 early.
 The
 the


doom
 scenario
 is
 is
 rarely
 as
 bad
 as


people
 kind
 of
 think
 it
 is
 or
 make
 it


out
 to
 be.
 And
 most
 big
 companies
 really


value
 people
 who
 have
 tried
 to
 do


something
 themselves
 even
 if
 they


failed.
 I
 do
 think
 that
 we
 will
 see
 less


and
 less
 text
 in
 the
 world.
 I
 don't


think
 we
 will
 be
 consuming
 most
 of
 our


information
 in
 text.
 I
 think
 there'll
 be


still
 be
 a
 place
 for
 text.
 You
 know,
 we


still
 go
 to
 the
 theater,
 we
 still
 listen


to
 vinyl.
 Like
 there'll
 there'll


definitely
 be
 a
 place
 for
 text
 to
 exist.


But
 I
 think
 in
 in
 the
 world
 of


information
 sharing,
 training
 knowledge,


etc.
 I
 do
 think
 that
 we
 will
 move
 into
 a


world
 which
 we
 consume
 almost
 everything


as
 video
 and
 audio
 and
 maybe
 VR
 and
 AR


um
 in
 in
 10
 20
 years
 with
 those


technologies.
 I
 do
 think
 that's
 going
 to


happen
 like
 and
 I
 don't
 think
 it's
 going


to
 be
 as
 bad
 as
 people
 think
 it
 is.
 A


lot
 of
 people
 are
 very
 like
 averse
 to


the
 idea
 that
 people
 wouldn't


necessarily
 be
 using
 tech
 as
 much
 as
 as


they
 are
 today.
 But
 I
 think
 as
 humans


it's
 very
 clear
 that
 we
 always
 been
 on


this
 trajectory
 towards
 more
 interactive


and
 more
 visual
 and
 more
 auditory


content
 that
 reminds
 us
 more
 of
 like


actually
 being
 in
 the
 real
 world,
 right?
