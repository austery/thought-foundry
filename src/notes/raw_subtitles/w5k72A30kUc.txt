We're
 living
 in
 an
 extraordinary
 moment


in
 history.
 We
 are
 at
 a
 moment
 here
 in


2025
 where
 we
 have
 world
 historic


gamechanging
 technologies
 now
 starting


to
 scale.
 But
 America
 and
 the
 world


itself
 are
 going
 through
 huge


contortions.


And
 there's
 been
 three
 previous


junctures
 where
 Americans
 have
 found


themselves
 in
 this
 exact
 place.
 And
 the


key
 piece
 of
 this
 is
 tipping
 points.


When
 do
 you
 go
 from
 the
 slow
 slow
 build


of
 a
 thing
 that's
 kind
 of
 clunky
 and
 not


really
 working
 to
 you
 all
 of a
 sudden


get
 an
 iPhone
 that
 goes,
 "Holy


this
 is
 the
 most
 amazing
 thing
 in
 the


world."
 And
 then
 everybody
 needs
 them.


And
 what
 I'm
 trying
 to
 tell
 you
 now
 is


we
 are
 in
 the
 middle
 of
 three
 tipping


points
 that
 are
 world
 historic
 changes


that
 are
 happening
 around
 it.
 I'm
 Pete


Leiden.
 I've
 basically
 been
 following


the
 story
 of
 technology
 and
 its


evolution
 and
 looking
 ahead
 into
 how


it's
 going
 to
 change
 the
 world
 over
 the


next
 25
 years.


[Music]


Way
 back
 way
 back
 in
 the
 '9s
 and
 the


earliest
 days
 of
 the
 internet,
 there
 was


really
 only
 one
 place
 in
 the
 world
 that


was
 really
 all
 over
 that
 and
 that
 was


Wired
 magazine.
 And
 it
 was
 in
 those


early
 days
 that
 the
 founders
 of
 Wired


picked
 up
 on
 me
 as
 someone
 who
 had
 the


same
 kind
 of
 sensibility
 about
 the


transformative
 nature
 of
 these


technologies.
 And
 so
 they
 wooed
 me
 to


work
 with
 them
 in
 the
 early
 days
 of


Wired.
 Now
 people
 had
 no
 idea
 what
 was


even
 going
 on
 with
 the
 internet
 and


literally
 what's
 email,
 what's
 the
 web.


They
 had
 no
 idea
 how
 these
 goofball


startups
 with
 names
 like
 Amazon
 were


ever
 going
 to
 amount
 to
 anything.
 And


the
 other
 thing
 that
 was
 going
 on
 there


beyond
 this
 digital
 revolution
 was


essentially
 the
 beginning
 of


globalization.
 And
 so
 myself
 and
 my


co-author
 which
 was
 Peter
 Schwarz
 wrote


a
 famous
 iconic
 cover
 story
 at
 Wired


that
 was
 called
 the
 long
 boom.
 And
 it


was
 a
 history
 of
 the
 future.
 The
 story


from
 1980
 which
 was
 in
 our
 past
 to
 2020


which
 was
 in
 our
 future
 trying
 to


explain
 what
 was
 really
 coming.


Now
 those
 of
 us
 who
 are
 in
 technology


and
 those
 of
 us
 have
 been
 immersed
 in
 it


which
 I
 have
 been
 for
 most
 of
 my
 career


now
 can
 see
 clearly
 these
 kind
 of


incremental
 stages
 of
 these
 new


technologies
 that
 all
 successful
 new


technologies
 go
 through
 a
 technology


adoption
 curve.
 Let's
 say
 like
 Uber,
 the


idea
 like,
 oh
 my
 god,
 instead
 of
 a
 taxi,


it's
 all
 on
 your
 phone
 and
 then
 all
 of
 a


sudden
 when
 enough
 people
 show
 how


amazing
 it
 is,
 boom,
 the
 entire
 crew


moves
 over
 and
 the
 old
 system
 of
 the


taxi
 system
 is
 gone.


So,
 you're
 watching
 an
 old
 system
 being


essentially
 dismantled
 or
 having
 to
 come


down
 at
 the
 same
 time
 as
 we're
 taking


off
 on
 these
 new
 technologies
 to
 build


the
 next
 systems.
 We're
 in
 the
 middle
 of


that
 right
 now
 is
 smack
 in
 the
 middle
 of


that
 in
 our
 era.
 But
 we've
 also
 seen


this
 in
 American
 history
 before.


There's
 been
 three
 previous
 junctures


where
 Americans
 have
 found
 themselves
 in


this
 exact
 place.
 Now,
 that's
 not
 to
 say


it's
 common.
 Like,
 you
 know,
 this
 is
 80


years
 ago,
 the
 last
 time
 we
 saw
 this,


and
 they
 tend
 to
 come
 in
 these
 80ear


cycles.
 But
 what's
 amazing
 about
 these


things
 is
 they
 have
 bursts
 of


unbelievably
 widespread
 innovation
 that


last
 for
 25
 years.
 The
 last
 big
 one
 was


coming
 off
 World
 War
 II,
 1945.


80
 years
 ago,
 America
 was
 on
 a
 very


similar
 parallels.


[Music]


We
 had
 basically
 were
 watching
 the


essentially
 dismantling
 of
 the
 old
 world


that
 had
 been
 working
 pretty
 well,
 the


economy
 and
 societies
 of
 the
 west
 and


then
 there
 had
 been
 a
 crash
 and
 you
 run


into
 the
 great
 depression
 of
 the
 1930s.


Now
 what
 that
 was
 was
 the
 old
 system
 of


running
 the
 economy
 just
 wasn't
 working.


And
 so
 what
 happens
 is
 you
 watch
 these


junctures
 in
 American
 society.
 We
 get


super
 polarized.
 For
 example,
 there
 was


an
 America
 first
 movement
 in
 the
 30s.
 We


were
 on
 the
 verge
 of
 violent
 conflict
 in


America.
 And
 then
 you
 had
 the
 FDR
 and


the
 kind
 of
 New
 Deal
 coalition
 that
 came


out
 of
 the
 depression
 and
 they
 started


to
 get
 traction.
 But
 anyhow,
 we
 had
 to


resolve
 this
 political
 tension
 in


America.
 And
 frankly,
 it
 had
 to
 do
 it
 in


the
 world
 because
 the
 world
 also
 is


going
 through
 this
 juncture.
 And
 so
 from


1945
 to
 1970,
 we
 watched
 the
 great


post-war
 boom.
 Many
 people
 call
 it
 the


high
 point
 of
 global
 capitalism.
 And
 you


built
 this
 crazy
 economy
 where
 you
 did


many
 things
 that
 were
 completely


different
 than
 the
 previous
 era.
 Tax
 the


rich
 at
 90%.
 You
 watched
 incredible


investment
 in
 public
 infrastructure
 like


the
 interstate
 highway
 system
 and


building
 suburbs.
 You
 basically
 watched


the
 GI
 Bill
 and
 education,
 building


institutions
 for
 higher
 education,


expanding
 it
 for
 the
 boomers.
 That
 all


happened
 in
 25
 years.
 was
 a
 great


society.
 The
 whole
 thing
 25
 years
 and


then
 we
 ran
 in
 the
 70s.
 It
 started
 kind


of
 getting
 along
 in
 the
 tooth.


Stagflation,
 oil
 shocks.
 But
 here's
 the


point.
 Old
 system
 had
 to
 come
 down.


Super
 conflict
 around
 it.
 And
 ultimately


the
 building
 of
 a
 thing
 that
 was


dramatically
 different
 than
 before.


We've
 been
 through
 that
 before.
 And


funny
 enough,
 like
 I
 say,
 if
 you
 go


another
 80
 years
 back,
 we
 did
 it
 again.


It's
 1865.
 What
 is
 1865?
 It's
 the
 end
 of


the
 American
 Civil
 War.
 Now,
 this
 is
 a


good
 example
 of
 how
 passions
 run
 very


high
 and
 political
 conflict
 is
 extreme


at
 these
 junctures.
 And
 the
 Civil
 War


was
 the
 most
 extreme.
 I
 mean,
 we


literally
 had
 to
 have
 750,000


Americans
 died
 in
 the
 Civil
 War.
 America


since
 the
 founding
 had
 been
 in
 tension


with
 these
 two
 economic
 systems.
 One
 was


essentially
 a
 system
 of
 the
 early


manufacturing
 economy
 where
 you
 needed


free
 labor
 in
 the
 north.
 But
 in
 the
 old


south,
 we
 basically
 had
 slavery
 and
 they


said,
 "No,
 we're
 not
 going
 there.
 We're


not
 going
 to
 give
 it
 up.
 We're
 not
 going


to
 let
 go
 of
 this
 old
 system.
 We're


going
 to
 fight
 to
 the
 death
 on
 the


thing."
 And
 so,
 this
 is
 a
 good
 example.


Anyone
 rooted
 in
 the
 old
 systems
 that


are
 going
 down
 are
 passionately
 want
 to


defend
 that
 at
 all
 cost.
 Now,
 the
 thing


that
 people
 do
 not
 know
 about
 the
 Civil


War
 or
 don't
 really
 remember
 as
 much


about
 the
 Civil
 War
 is
 the
 Civil
 War


after
 1865
 had
 an
 unbelievable
 explosion


of
 progress
 that
 lasted
 for
 what
 do
 you


know
 25
 years.
 For
 example,
 the


Homestead
 Act,
 which
 is
 you
 gave
 anybody


who
 went
 out
 west


150
 acres
 for
 free.
 There
 was
 also
 land


grant
 universities.
 All
 these
 little


states
 started
 building
 institutes
 of


higher
 education
 to
 educate
 average


people
 but
 also
 to
 be
 pushing
 scientific


understanding
 of
 agriculture.
 But
 here's


the
 other
 progress
 that
 was
 going
 on.
 It


was
 technology.
 It
 was
 only
 after
 the


war
 that
 America
 blew
 out
 like
 175,000


miles
 of
 rail
 and
 essentially
 stitched


the
 entire
 continent
 together
 with
 this


steelbased
 rails.
 And
 essentially
 we


reinvented
 America
 in
 25
 years.
 And


here's
 the
 even
 crazier
 thing
 though.


You
 go
 back
 another
 80
 years,
 we
 did
 it


again.


1787
 to
 about
 1810,
 1815,
 we
 had
 created


what
 is
 America.
 One
 way
 to
 understand


what
 was
 happening
 in
 America
 at
 that


time
 was
 it
 was
 part
 of
 a
 bigger
 part
 of


Western
 Europe
 and
 particularly
 an


extension
 of
 Britain
 which
 was
 going


through
 the
 enlightenment
 at
 the
 time.


The
 Enlightenment
 is
 essentially
 a


fundamental
 system
 change
 from
 a
 feudal


society
 kind
 of
 dominated
 by
 the


Catholic
 Church
 and
 all
 that
 kind
 of


stuff
 into
 essentially
 what
 we
 would
 now


consider
 the
 modern
 world.
 And
 they


invented
 six
 huge
 things
 that
 we
 still


are
 working
 within
 today.
 Now
 the
 reason


I'm
 kind
 of
 saying
 that
 is
 that
 had


world
 historic
 implications.
 That
 was
 a


building
 of
 a
 civilization
 that
 we


essentially
 invented.
 We
 humans
 but
 we


Western
 Europe
 in
 basically
 a
 space
 of


120
 years.
 The
 forward
 motion
 of


innovation


essentially
 from
 the
 west
 was
 coming


with
 those
 crazy
 ass
 Americans
 who
 had


this
 wide
 open
 continent
 to
 spread
 it


to.
 And
 that
 is
 what
 America's
 role
 has


been
 visav
 the
 West
 in
 every
 one
 of


those
 epics.
 I'm
 arguing
 we
 have
 one


more
 crank
 of
 that
 wheel
 with
 the


arrival
 of
 three
 world
 historic
 changes


that
 are
 happening
 around
 us
 today.
 And


the
 most
 obvious
 one
 is
 the
 arrival
 of


artificial
 intelligence.


Chat
 GPT.
 Maybe
 you've
 heard
 of
 it.
 If


you
 haven't,
 then
 get
 ready
 because
 this


promises
 to
 be
 the
 viral
 sensation
 that


could
 completely
 reset
 how
 we
 do
 things.


>> The
 arrival
 of
 generative
 AI.
 With
 the


arrival
 of
 chat
 GBT
 3.5
 in
 November
 of


2022,
 I
 think
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 that
 as


a
 world
 historic
 moment.
 I
 think
 people


will
 look
 back
 on
 that
 is
 the
 starting


gun
 of
 what
 will
 be
 understood
 as
 the


age
 of
 AI.
 And
 I
 use
 age
 in
 a
 very


explicit
 way,
 which
 is
 when
 you
 talk


about
 a
 different
 age
 that
 humans
 enter


like,
 oh,
 the
 humans,
 you
 know,
 entered


the
 bronze
 age
 or
 the
 iron
 age.
 I
 mean,


you're
 talking
 about
 essentially
 a


fundamental
 gamechanging
 technology,
 a


breakthrough,
 a
 step
 change
 in
 our


abilities
 that
 once
 you
 cross
 that


threshold,
 you
 don't
 go
 back.
 We're


going
 to
 watch
 an
 explosion
 of


amplification.
 Our
 the
 amplification
 of


our
 mental
 powers
 with
 digital
 computers


and
 now
 AI
 are
 going
 to
 be
 very
 similar


to
 the
 amplification
 of
 our
 physical


powers
 that
 mechanical
 engines
 initially


by
 steam
 created
 the
 prosperity
 and


wealth
 of
 the
 world
 that
 we
 know
 now


where
 we're
 just
 going
 to
 say,
 "Holy


 we
 had
 no
 idea
 this
 is
 the
 world


we're
 in.


This
 is
 the
 first
 time
 we
 have
 an
 energy


source
 that
 is
 a
 technology.
 100%
 a


technology,
 not
 a
 commodity.
 We
 don't


have
 to
 dig
 it
 up
 as
 coal.
 We
 don't
 have


to
 tap
 into
 it
 as
 oil.
 Why
 is
 that


important?
 Because
 once
 it's
 a


technology,
 you
 can
 consistently
 drive


down
 the
 cost.
 And
 there's
 a
 kind
 of
 a


rule
 of
 thumb
 in
 manufacturing
 which
 if


you
 double
 the
 number
 of
 producing
 solar


panels,
 you
 will
 come
 up
 with
 about
 20%


of
 a
 drop
 in
 cost.


And
 this
 is
 the
 point,
 it's
 going
 to


keep
 getting
 cheaper.
 And
 the
 same
 thing


flipping
 around
 the
 same
 thing
 with


electric
 cars.
 People
 think,
 well,


electric
 cars
 are
 still
 expensive
 and


whatever.
 You're
 not
 thinking
 this


through
 because
 battery
 technology
 is


the
 same
 thing.
 That's
 in
 lithium


batteries.
 We're
 now
 getting
 whole


another
 generations
 of
 batteries
 like


solid
 state
 batteries
 that
 essentially


will
 be
 a
 next
 generation.
 But
 the
 point


is
 the
 forward
 motion
 of
 costs
 coming


down
 on
 clean
 energies
 is
 just


beginning.
 And
 when
 that
 happens,
 you're


going
 to
 have
 what?
 Abundant
 clean


energy.


basically
 right
 around
 the
 time
 that
 we


essentially
 had
 our
 earliest


breakthroughs
 on
 generative
 AI
 which
 is


about
 15
 years
 ago.
 We
 also
 had
 the
 big


breakthrough
 in
 what
 they
 call
 crisper


which
 is
 we
 figured
 out
 a
 way
 to
 cheaply


and
 easily
 edit
 the
 genome
 of
 any
 living


thing.
 And
 you
 just
 take
 one
 example.
 We


now
 know
 how
 to
 take
 a
 cell,
 put
 it
 in
 a


vat,
 and
 you
 can
 give
 it
 the
 same
 amino


acids
 and
 the
 same
 kind
 of
 nutrients
 and


the
 same
 things
 that
 a
 cow
 roaming


around
 a
 field
 for
 like
 years
 chewing
 on


grass
 would
 get
 those
 same
 nutrients,


the
 same
 amino
 acids,
 and
 essentially


would
 produce
 in
 their
 muscles,
 the


meat.
 That
 same
 thing
 can
 happen
 in
 a


vat
 to
 actually
 grow
 the
 same
 cow
 cell


into
 actual
 meat.
 Not
 like
 kind
 of
 meat,


not
 like
 plant-based
 meat
 that's
 kind
 of


like
 meat.
 It's
 meat.
 It's
 the
 same


cell.
 It
 tastes
 exactly
 the
 same.
 And


what's
 happened?
 We've
 only
 25
 years


ago.
 It's
 like
 2003
 was
 the
 first
 time


humans
 had
 ever
 cracked
 or
 understood


the
 human
 genome.
 Took
 three
 billion


dollars
 and
 it
 took
 15
 years
 to
 do
 it.


The
 cost
 of
 doing
 that
 from
 three


billion
 had
 been
 driven
 down
 so
 far
 it


was
 a
 thousand
 bucks.
 It's
 now
 at
 the


point
 where
 it's
 about
 a
 hundred
 bucks


and
 eventually
 it's
 going
 to
 keep


driving
 down
 to
 50
 bucks
 or
 nothing.


It's
 not
 just
 the
 same
 level.
 It
 is


twice
 as
 fast.
 We
 can
 now
 essentially


design
 these
 things
 for
 outcomes
 that
 we


want
 to
 happen
 cheaply
 and
 easily.


So
 the
 technology
 story
 of
 today,
 AI,


clean
 energies,
 even
 bioengineering
 is


kind
 of
 familiar
 at
 some
 level.
 The
 next


several
 iterations
 here
 though,
 I
 think,


is
 putting
 a
 bigger
 lens
 on
 what's
 going


on
 today.
 And
 it
 gets
 us
 back
 to
 what
 we


were
 describing
 is
 what's
 happening
 in


America
 is
 a
 once
 in
 80
 year


reinvention.
 And
 in
 fact,
 it's
 even


possible
 that
 what's
 going
 on
 here
 is


essentially
 the
 early
 days
 of
 building
 a


21st
 century
 civilization.
 And
 so
 when


you
 think
 about
 that,
 you
 go
 beyond
 the


technology.
 That's
 like
 the
 foundation.


And
 so
 the
 next
 thing
 up
 I
 think
 from


technologies,
 you
 start
 thinking,
 okay,


well,
 what
 could
 you
 build
 with
 those


technologies?
 What
 kind
 of
 an
 economy


would
 you
 want
 to
 build?
 The
 economic


system
 that
 the
 United
 States
 has
 been


based
 on
 that
 has
 worked
 for
 essentially


the
 top
 10%
 for
 sure
 and
 certainly
 for


the
 top
 1%
 has
 not
 been
 working
 for
 80%.


And
 it's
 gotten
 to
 the
 point
 where
 they


just
 have
 had
 it.
 So,
 as
 crazy
 as
 it


sounds,
 we
 could
 be
 at
 a
 point
 in
 the


world
 right
 now
 in
 2025
 where
 we
 are


watching
 the
 beginnings
 of
 a
 shift
 from


financial
 capitalism
 born
 and
 raised
 out


of
 the
 Enlightenment
 to
 essentially
 some


version
 of
 a
 sustainable
 capitalism.


We're
 going
 from
 a
 world
 of


representative
 democracy,
 which
 was
 a


brilliant
 move
 forward,
 to
 essentially
 a


digital
 democracy.
 And
 we're
 also
 going


to
 go
 from
 a
 world
 of
 nation
 states,


which
 again
 was
 a
 great
 breakthrough


from
 empires
 and
 colonies
 of
 the
 past,


to
 some
 kind
 of
 global
 governance
 that


coordinates
 the
 10
 billion
 people
 on


this
 planet.
 That's
 the
 level
 of
 change


I
 think
 we're
 actually
 heading
 into.


That's
 the
 level
 of
 change
 I
 think
 your


kids
 are
 going
 to
 be
 wrestling
 with.
 And


that's
 the
 level
 of
 change
 I
 think


America
 is
 going
 through
 now.
 And
 the


quicker
 we
 start
 to
 wrap
 our
 heads


around
 that
 challenge
 and
 and
 the
 kind


of
 scala
 of
 the
 invention
 we're
 up
 to,


the
 the
 better
 off
 we're
 all
 going
 to


be.
