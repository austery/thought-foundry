From
 the
 New
 York
 Times,
 it's
 the


headlines.
 I'm
 Tracy
 Mumford.
 Today's


Thursday,
 October
 30th.
 Here's
 what


we're
 covering.


[Music]


>> We
 have
 more
 nuclear
 weapons
 than


anybody.
 We
 don't
 do
 testing.
 You
 know,


we've
 halted
 it
 years,
 many
 years
 ago,


but
 with
 others
 doing
 testing,
 I
 think


it's
 appropriate
 that
 we
 do.
 Also,


>> President
 Trump
 says
 that
 the
 US
 will


resume
 testing
 nuclear
 weapons,


something
 the
 country
 hasn't
 done
 in


more
 than
 30
 years.


>> It'll
 be
 announced.
 You
 know,
 we
 have


test
 sites.
 It'll
 be
 announced.


>> It's
 unclear
 what
 that
 will
 entail.
 And


Trump
 didn't
 clarify
 his
 remarks
 when


asked.
 He
 could
 intend
 to
 just
 show
 off


the
 US's
 missiles
 or
 other
 nuclear


capable
 assets,
 potentially
 prompted
 by


Russia's
 announcements
 in
 the
 last
 few


days
 that
 it
 had
 tested
 both
 a


nuclearpowered
 missile
 and
 a


nuclearpowered
 torpedo
 capable
 of


causing
 a
 tsunami.
 Or
 Trump
 could
 mean


detonating
 a
 weapon
 like
 the
 testing


that
 used
 to
 be
 done
 in
 the
 Pacific
 or


underground
 in
 Nevada.
 For
 years,


American
 weapons
 engineers
 have
 said


that's
 unnecessary
 because
 they
 can


model
 tests
 on
 a
 computer.
 But
 recently,


as
 the
 US
 has
 been
 updating
 its
 aging


arsenal,
 there
 have
 been
 some
 calls
 to


start
 testing
 again.
 If
 that
 does


happen,
 it
 would
 likely
 trigger
 similar


actions
 by
 other
 nuclear
 armed


countries.


President
 Trump's
 comments
 about
 nuclear


testing
 came
 while
 he
 was
 in
 the
 middle


of
 a
 highstakes
 diplomatic
 tour
 of
 Asia.


A
 tour
 that
 wrapped
 today
 after
 a


face-to-face
 meeting
 with
 Chinese


President
 Xiinping.
 No
 big
 trade
 deal


was
 announced,
 but
 there
 were
 signs
 of


progress
 in
 easing
 the
 tensions
 that


have
 rocked
 both
 countries
 economies


since
 Trump
 returned
 to
 office
 and
 took


an
 aggressive
 stance
 toward
 Beijing.


After
 the
 two
 spoke,
 Trump
 said
 he's


reducing
 a
 small
 slice
 of
 his
 tariffs
 on


the
 country.
 He
 also
 said
 China
 agreed


to
 postpone
 its
 restrictions
 on


exporting
 rare
 earth
 minerals,
 a


resource
 China
 has
 a
 near
 total
 lock
 on.


The
 minerals
 are
 crucial
 for
 batteries


and
 computer
 chips
 that
 are
 used
 in


everything
 from
 coffee
 makers
 to
 fighter


jets.
 China
 had
 previously
 tightened


controls
 on
 the
 materials
 in
 a
 tit


fortat
 response
 to
 Trump's
 high
 tariffs.


This
 meeting
 was
 a
 really
 important
 step


in
 stabilizing
 what
 really
 was
 a


relationship
 that
 had
 looked
 like
 it
 was


going
 to
 go
 off
 the
 rails
 again.


>> My
 colleague
 David
 Pearson
 was
 in
 South


Korea
 for
 the
 meeting
 between
 the
 world


leaders
 which
 only
 came
 together
 after


months
 of
 escalating
 trade
 threats.


>> I
 think
 the
 thing
 that
 really
 changed


was
 a
 realization
 on
 the
 US
 side
 that


this
 leverage
 that
 China
 has
 over
 rare


earth
 is
 a
 really
 big
 deal.
 by
 taking


away
 these
 minerals,
 these
 magnets
 that


are
 the
 cornerstone
 for
 modern
 life,
 I


think
 President
 Trump
 realized,
 okay,
 we


need
 to
 come
 up
 with
 some
 sort
 of


solution
 here.
 And
 so
 I
 think
 we
 can


expect
 things
 to
 stabilize
 for
 the
 near


future.
 But
 you
 know,
 the
 reality
 is


this
 is
 a
 very
 very
 fragile


relationship.
 And
 I
 don't
 think
 that
 has


fundamentally
 changed.
 There's
 still


reservoirs
 of
 mistrust
 between
 these
 two


countries
 that
 can't
 be
 resolved.
 So,


what
 we
 have
 is
 a
 band-aid.


[Music]


>> Meanwhile,


>> well,
 um,
 it
 just
 continues
 to
 go


higher.
 It
 is
 opening
 at
 a
 $5
 trillion


market
 cap.
 Nvidia,
 the
 tech
 giant
 that


makes
 almost
 all
 of
 the
 chips
 used
 for


artificial
 intelligence,
 smashed
 a


record
 yesterday,
 becoming
 the
 first


publicly
 traded
 company
 to
 be
 valued
 at


$5
 trillion.


>> 5
 trillion
 is
 extraordinary
 considering


it
 was
 only
 4
 months
 ago
 it
 hit
 $4


trillion.


>> Part
 of
 what
 tipped
 the
 stock
 price
 into


record-breaking
 territory
 was
 signs
 of
 a


potential
 thaw
 on
 trade
 between
 China


and
 the
 US.
 The
 US
 currently
 prohibits


Nvidia
 from
 selling
 its
 most
 advanced


chips
 to
 the
 country,
 but
 a
 change
 on


that
 front
 would
 be
 a
 multi-billion


dollar
 opportunity
 for
 the
 company.


Since
 Trump
 returned
 to
 office,
 he's


repeatedly
 used
 Nvidia's
 chips
 as


leverage
 in
 foreign
 policy
 discussions,


striking
 deals
 to
 sell
 the
 chips


everywhere
 from
 the
 UAE
 to
 Japan.
 At
 the


same
 time,
 as
 Nvidia's
 stock
 continues


to
 boom,
 its
 growing
 role
 in
 the


American
 economy
 has
 set
 off
 alarm
 bells


for
 many
 on
 Wall
 Street.
 They're


concerned
 that
 potentially
 too
 much
 of


the
 US
 economy
 is
 riding
 on
 the
 success


of
 AI.
 Nvidia
 now
 makes
 up
 almost
 10%
 of


the
 value
 of
 the
 S&P
 500.
 And
 according


to
 one
 economist,
 almost
 all
 of
 the


growth
 of
 the
 US's
 GDP
 in
 the
 first
 half


of
 this
 year
 came
 from
 spending
 on
 data


centers.


Now,
 one
 last
 update
 related
 to
 the


Trump
 administration.
 In
 DC,
 officials


are
 continuing
 the
 president's


retribution
 campaign
 against
 those


involved
 in
 prosecuting
 cases
 related
 to


January
 6th.
 Here's
 what
 happened
 this


week.
 Two
 federal
 prosecutors
 filed


sentencing
 paperwork
 for
 a
 man
 who'd


been
 found
 guilty
 of
 showing
 up
 near


President
 Obama's
 house
 with
 firearms


and
 ammunition
 back
 in
 2023.
 In
 their


memo,
 they
 requested
 a
 stiff
 sentence,


writing
 that
 the
 man
 had
 previously
 been


part
 of
 the
 quote
 mob
 of
 riers
 on


January
 6th,
 something
 he'd
 also
 faced


charges
 for
 before
 Trump
 granted
 blanket


clemency
 to
 those
 accused
 of
 being


involved.
 The
 memo
 also
 noted
 that
 the


man
 had
 apparently
 found
 Obama's
 address


from
 one
 of
 Trump's
 social
 media
 posts.


Then
 yesterday,
 in
 an
 extraordinary


move,
 the
 Justice
 Department
 withdrew


the
 sentencing
 papers,
 saying
 they'd


been
 entered
 in
 error.
 When
 they
 were


resubmitted
 hours
 later,
 all
 references


to
 January
 6th
 were
 gone.
 So
 was
 any


mention
 of
 Trump's
 message,
 and
 the


prosecutors
 who
 originally
 filed
 them


were
 placed
 on
 leave.


Since
 Trump
 returned
 to
 office,
 many


prosecutors
 who've
 worked
 on
 January
 6


related
 cases
 have
 been
 demoted
 or
 fired


by
 the
 administration
 as
 part
 of
 Trump's


broader
 effort
 to
 root
 out
 people
 he


believes
 to
 be
 disloyal.

>> Melissa
 absolutely
 decimated
 this


portion
 of
 the
 island.
 Only
 places
 that


have
 four
 concrete
 walls
 are
 still


standing
 and
 usually
 their
 roofs
 are


gone.


>> In
 Jamaica,
 the
 Times
 has
 been
 speaking


with
 people
 on
 the
 ground
 after


Hurricane
 Melissa
 slammed
 into
 the


island
 this
 week.


>> There
 are
 some
 things
 that
 are
 just


completely
 level
 where
 there's
 nothing


there.
 Um,


>> the
 category
 5
 storm
 knocked
 out
 power


and
 a
 lot
 of
 communications,
 and
 that's


complicated
 search
 and
 rescue
 efforts.


Officials
 say
 they're
 still
 looking
 for


victims
 after
 finding
 at
 least
 five


bodies
 in
 St.
 Elizabeth
 Parish
 on
 the


southwestern
 coast.


>> Tell
 me,
 how
 are
 how
 are
 things
 looking


in
 St.
 Elizabeth?


>> Um,
 it's
 not
 looking
 good
 at
 all.
 We


were
 hit
 very
 hard.
 Total
 devastation.


Conditions
 are
 really
 bad.
 I
 I
 am


>> in
 one
 town
 there,
 Black
 River,
 the


mayor
 told
 the
 Times
 his
 community
 was


quote
 totally
 destroyed
 with
 the


courthouse,
 the
 libraries,
 churches,
 and


other
 buildings
 gone.


>> The
 hospital
 was
 badly
 damaged
 and
 they


are
 making
 best
 use
 of
 the
 conditions


that
 they
 have
 there
 currently.


>> He
 estimated
 that
 the
 surge
 of
 seawater


rose
 to
 16
 ft.
 A
 UN
 official
 said
 the


devastation
 in
 Jamaica
 was
 unprecedented


and
 recovery
 will
 be
 a
 challenge
 as
 many


roads
 are
 still
 blocked.


The
 UN
 also
 said
 it's
 moving
 to
 help


other
 countries
 in
 Melissa's
 path,


including
 Cuba
 and
 Haiti,
 where
 at least


20
 people
 were
 killed.
 The
 storm
 has


weakened
 to
 a
 category
 1
 at
 this
 point,


but
 is
 still
 wreaking
 havoc
 in
 the


Caribbean,
 causing
 damage
 in
 the
 Bahamas


and
 Turks
 and
 Caos
 overnight.
 It's


expected
 to
 approach
 Bermuda
 later


today.


[Music]


And
 finally,
 something
 may
 have
 changed


about
 your
 favorite
 chocolate
 bar
 in


recent
 years
 without
 you
 noticing.


>> Chewy
 chunks
 of
 caramel
 each
 covered
 in


real
 milk
 chocolate.


>> Candies
 like
 Rolos,


>> Almond
 Joy's
 got
 real
 milk
 chocolate,


coconut,


>> Almond
 Joy,


>> good
 peanuts,
 and
 good
 chocolate
 make
 a


very
 good
 bar.


>> And
 Mr.
 Good
 bar
 used
 to
 say
 milk


chocolate
 on
 the
 wrapper.
 Now
 the


rappers
 say
 chocolate
 candy.
 The


difference
 is
 that
 milk
 chocolate
 is
 an


FDA
 regulated
 term.
 To
 use
 it,
 you
 got


to
 have
 a
 certain
 amount
 of
 cocoa
 butter


in
 the
 product.
 But
 as
 climate
 change


and
 droughts
 have
 driven
 up
 cocoa


prices,
 some
 candy
 companies
 have


pivoted,
 replacing
 cocoa
 butter
 with


other
 fats.
 The
 Hershey
 Company,
 which


makes
 Mr.
 Good
 bars,
 Almond
 Joys,
 and


Rolos
 declined
 to
 comment,
 but
 the
 Times


compared
 product
 labels
 and
 checked
 an


ingredient
 database
 run
 by
 the


Department
 of
 Agriculture
 to
 find
 that


the
 labels
 have
 changed
 in
 the
 last
 few


years.
 An
 expert
 in
 the
 world
 of
 candy


science,
 the
 woman
 who
 developed


flavored
 Peeps
 told
 the
 Times,
 "There's


lots
 of
 techniques
 to
 subtly
 cut
 cocoa


costs,
 like
 replacing
 chocolate
 coating


with
 compound
 coating,
 which
 uses


vegetable
 fats
 instead."
 Butterfinger


and
 Baby
 Ruth
 have
 been
 made
 that
 way


for
 years.
 Another
 method,
 add
 more


sugar.
 One
 analyst
 told
 the
 Times
 that


candy
 companies
 had
 been
 cutting
 back
 on


added
 sugar
 for
 the
 last
 decade
 or
 so
 in


response
 to
 health
 trends,
 but
 they've


been
 quietly
 putting
 it
 back
 in
 to


replace
 the
 ever
 more
 expensive
 cocoa.


There's
 also
 been
 another
 more
 dramatic


strategy.
 Drop
 the
 chocolate
 altogether.


You
 may
 see
 that
 in
 the
 Halloween
 bag
 of


treats
 this
 year.
 The
 Hershey's


Halloween
 assortment
 includes
 light


green
 Kit
 Kats
 and
 cookies
 and
 cream


fangs,
 neither
 of
 which
 contains
 any


chocolate
 at
 all.


Those
 are
 the
 headlines.
 Today
 on
 the


Daily,
 Palestinians
 in
 Gaza
 share
 their


experiences
 of
 trying
 to
 return
 home


after
 the
 ceasefire
 between
 Israel
 and


Hamas.
 You
 can
 listen
 to
 that
 in
 the
 New


York
 Times
 app
 or
 wherever
 you
 get
 your


podcasts.
