- These are soft robots.
Their structural components are built,
not out of metal or wood,
but flexible materials
like plastic tubing.
But how do they work?
and why would you want a soft
robot in the first place?
This video was sponsored by KiwiCo.
Check out their robots
at the end of the show.

So I came up to Stanford
to meet Zach Hammond and his soft robot.
How's it going?
All right, you want to tip it?
So is the idea that the
robot could walk this way?
- Totally, yeah.
So you can kind of chain
these rolls together
to kind of roll around in any environment.
They call this punctuated
rolling locomotion.
Wherein it's kind of stuck
on a face until it tips over and now it's
on a new face and it can then continue to
move its center of gravity. Once that center
of gravity exits the support polygon or the
base, then it tips over one of the edges of
the face.
- This is a different soft robot made out
of flexible tubing. It was designed to mimic
the way a turtle walks, where diagonally opposite
legs move together. It's powered entirely
by compressed air and perhaps most impressive,
it requires no electronics. All of the circuitry
is pneumatic and this means the robot can
be used in places like mines, where electronics
could spark explosions, or in the strong magnetic
fields around MRI machines. But why would
you want a soft robot in the first place?
- One of the things that I like to do is just
to take the robot and kind of like beat it
up a little bit and show how it's compliant
and compressive.
- Nope, because they're safer.
- If you'd like to take a whack at it, you
know, feel free.
- But I don't think this is your work, I don't
want to break it, obviously.
- No, feel free, go for it
- For operation around humans, there's not
much damage a soft robot can do to you. I
can stand on these?
- Yep.
- This is a pretty crazy compliant robot.
- Because the the fundamental structure of
this robot is compliant, there's only some
maximum force that it could ever exert on
me. So it's inherently safe to be operating
around people.
- Could we make it fall and have me be inside
it?
- Yeah. Yeah, we could do that for sure. Just
watch your head.
- Yep, if I go over here.
- If you're there, yeah, we can do that.
- All right, let's try it. Here it comes.
Well, that's not bad at all. Is it?
- I can try another shape. That's supposed
to open up one of the faces, so you can jump
out of it quickly.
- Okay.
- I haven't tested it in a little while, so...
- Sure.
- I don't know how it's gonna go, but let's
try this. There you go that's the face right
there to your right and you can exit the trust
from that face.
- Boom.
- Perfect.
- Just that easy. Did you build this by yourself?
- Me and one other grad student built this
entire thing ourselves, basically.
- And how long did it take?
- We did it in about a month, I want to say,
like actually constructing everything.
- And was it tricky? I mean, were you sewing
that stuff?
- Yep, we sewed this all ourselves.
- The main structural members of this robot
are fabric tubes inflated with air.
- Yeah, so these red tubes are a nylon fabric
and then internally, there is a polyethylene
tube that provides the air tightness.
- The tubes are inflated to about six PSI
above atmospheric. So it's almost one and
a half atmospheres. Each tube passes through
pairs of rollers connected to a motor. The
rollers pinch the tube, so it bends kind of
like a pinched straw.
- Add the rods and then we have this like
high friction material wrapped around the
rods. And then that coupled with the fact
that we have this pressurized tube that's
kind of pushing the membrane of the tube into
the rollers, prevents us from slipping.
- By driving the motor, it changes the length
of the tubes.
- Kind of like when a clown creates a twist
in a balloon and then folds that balloon into
a balloon animal. The difference between what
the clown does and what we do is that there's
some passage of air between adjacent segments
of the tube. So that as the robot drives around,
we're not pressurizing the segments of the
tube.
- This robot is made of four inflated tubes,
each one connected to a pair of motors, forming
triangular sides.
- We also think that they kind of look like
sausage links when put together, which is
why we've named these robots after different
sausages. So this one's called Polish, that
one over there is Chorizo, There's a Linguica
and a kielbasa over there somewhere.
- So what shape is the overall thing? It's
an octahedron?
- Yeah, we call it an octahedron because if
you drew lines between these kind of kinematic
joints here, it would create an octahedral
shape.
- Driving the motors together, allows the
robot to dramatically change shape. It can
get very tall or short and squat. But since
the tubes themselves don't change in length,
the overall perimeter of the robot, the length
of all the edges combined doesn't change.
So the robot is considered isoparametric.
How do you feel when you watch those Boston
Dynamics videos?
- Oh, I love those videos, they're so cool.
- The Boston Dynamics robots are kind of terrifying.
- Mm-hmm.
- I guess and the idea with soft robots, it's
to like convince people that robots are good
and soft and kind, and friendly and fake?
- That's definitely true, yeah. There are
some things that you can do to rigid systems
to make them feel like compliant systems based
on how you're controlling the motors. But
yeah, they're definitely, you know, heavy
expensive and can be dangerous if they're
not used correctly.
- The hard robots we're used to are strong
and precise. Their actions are accurate and
repeatable, but they are also heavy and they
can't really change their volume as dramatically,
but this robot is still capable of carrying
a heavy load.
- So I have a GUI in MATLAB.
- Oh nice.
- That enables me to just put in the positions
that I want the robots to move in inches and
then send them out. There's another other
functionality of some like stored configurations
to send to the robots.
- Soft robots also have the advantage of shape
changing. They can become tall to go over
obstacles or short to fit under obstructions.
- So if there is some rock that it didn't
see or that it wanted to roll over. It could
simply do that and the compliance of the tubes
would simply just bend around that disturbance.
- Do you imagine robots like this doing work
in space?
- Oh yeah, definitely.
- So one of the nice things about these types
of structures is that they can shrink down
their volume very drastically. And because
volume on rockets is such an expensive premium,
being able to have a robot that can pack down
small for transport is very valuable. So NASA
was at one point looking into trust robots
for exactly that reason. And they've contacted
us since we've made this robot to explore
different ideas for space exploration projects.
So one of the things that they're thinking
about doing is deploying robots underneath
a sheet of ice. So they're gonna drill through
this sheet of ice and then deposit a robot
through what is a kind of a small diameter
hole. And so if you can have a robot that
can change its volume very drastically or
be disassembled and then reassembled to form
like a much larger structure. Then you can
have large robots that are able to fit through
these tight spaces and be deployed in kind
of difficult to access areas.
- Is this a little bit like an octopus? Is
that how you could think of it?
- There is some connection there because they
use their shape changing ability and their
compliance to squeeze through tight passageways,
and then also to wrap their body around objects.
So for example, they can open jars with their
tentacles, and one of the things that we want
to use this robot for is grasping and manipulating
objects.
- So this robot is even capable of picking
objects up off the ground.
- We'll try that and see if we can grab it.
Because of the compliance of the tubes, it
has a natural ability to grasp and manipulate
objects because as it does so, the tubes bend
ever so slightly, which increases the contact
area and distributes evenly, the forces that
are exerted on the object.
- So, I mean is the biggest risk if it pops?
- Yeah, that's a a big risk. I mean you obviously
need the compressed air for your structure
and so if you have a leak. Oh. Then you don't
have a robot, right?
- It's a pretty big drawback of soft robots.
- You know, some things that you could do
to mitigate that would be to have onboard
a small compressor, which isn't there to provide
power to the robot, but would help you maintain
pressure, if there were any small leaks.
- when you tell someone you're working on
a robot and they see this, does it defy expectations?
- Totally. They have no idea what it is I'm
talking about until I show them like a video
or a picture. I think most people's conception
of soft robots was really expanded by the
movie Big Hero 6. And I think they did a great
job in kind of showcasing what a soft robot
can do and why they're useful, and kind of
just popularizing the notion. It's really
great to have compliance built into any mechanical
system, especially as we want robots to work
closer and closer with humans. So I think
we'll definitely see more soft robots in the
future.
- Hey, this video was sponsored by KiwiCo
and since I was up in the Bay Area, I got
to visit KiwiCo headquarters which was mostly
empty because COVID, but I met with a few
designers who make the awesome projects that
come in KiwiCo crates.
- There you go.
- Oh boy.
- And I'm not gonna lie, it kind of seems
like the best job. I was in awe of some of
the ideas they have brought to life. Dude,
that's cool. Look at that. You know, KiwiCo
offers eight subscription lines for kids of
all ages and everything you need comes right
in the box, so that means no running out to
the store. Each create, not only gets kids
If I can get them learning little things every
day that can all add up to a big perspective
change in how they see the world. So for viewers
of this video, KiwiCo is offering 50% off
your first month of any crate. Just go to
kiwico.com/veritasium50 I will put that link
down in the description. So I want to thank
