- This is a video about
a single simple rule
that underpins all of
physics, every principle,
from classical mechanics
to electromagnetism,
from quantum theory to general relativity,
right down to the ultimate
constituents of matter,
the fundamental particles.
All of it can be replaced
by this single rule.
It feels like we're
approaching spooky territory.
- We're approaching spooky territory.
I hear you and I agree.
- [Derek] It may in fact
explain the behavior
of life itself.
- I think I'm stuck in some
classical mindset where, to me,
the local picture,
the differential equation way
of thinking about the universe,
that that's really what's going on.
But I fear that I have
it exactly backwards.
- And it all starts with a simple problem.
If you wanna slide a mass
from point A to point B,
what shape of ramp will
get it there the fastest?
This is known as the
problem of fastest descent.
- You know, common sense, you might say
take the shortest path.
Straight line from A to B.
- [Derek] But if you
bend the ramp down a bit
at the beginning,
well, the mass accelerates
to a higher speed earlier.
So even though it
travels slightly farther,
it travels faster and
beats the straight ramp.
So the question is, what shape
provides the perfect balance
of acceleration and path length
to minimize travel time?
According to Galileo, it
was the arc of a circle.
He showed that this is
faster than any polygon.
But is it the fastest?
Nearly 60 years later, in June of 1696,
Johann Bernoulli set this
problem as a challenge
to the best mathematicians in the world.
- Mainly because he's a big show off
and he wants to show that
he's better than all of them.
- [Derek] He gave everyone six months
to come up with solutions,
but none were submitted.
So Gottfried Leibniz, a
friend of Bernoulli's,
persuaded him to extend the deadline
to give foreigners a chance.
- And I think Newton was
probably the intended target
because everybody thought
of him as the best,
and so Johann would've wanted to show
that he was better than Newton.
He was no longer a really active
mathematician or physicist.
He was working as the warden of the Mint,
like a big high government position.
- [Derek] And on the
29th of January, 1697,
Newton returned home
after a long day at work
to find Bernoulli's challenge in the mail.
Irritated, he wrote,
"I do not love to be dunned
and teased by foreigners
about mathematical things."
But the problem was too enticing,
so Newton spent the rest
of the day and night on it,
and by 4:00 a.m. he had
come up with a solution,
something that took Bernoulli two weeks.
Newton submitted his solution
to the journal Philosophical Transactions.
- He sent his solution
there but didn't sign it.
And Johann Bernoulli,
after seeing the solution,
is alleged to have said,
"I recognize the lion by his claw."
You know, that, "Okay, you
don't need to sign it, Newton,
I can tell who you are.
Who else could give such a solution?"
- [Derek] And while overall
Newton dominated Bernoulli,
in this instance,
Bernoulli's solution
actually out-shone Newton's.
- I could see why Johann Bernoulli
wanted to challenge everybody,
because he came up with a really clever,
I would say like a truly
creative, beautiful solution.
- To do it, he took inspiration
from a problem faced by
ancient philosophers.
How does light travel
from one place to another?
This was contemplated
by Hero of Alexandria
in the 1st century AD.
He realized that in a
single medium, like air,
light always follows the shortest path.
A consequence is that when
light reflects, say, off a lake,
the angle of incidence is always equal
to the angle of reflection.
Any other path between
the start and end points
would be longer.
But when light goes from
one medium into another,
like from air into water,
it bends in a peculiar way.
It refracts and it doesn't
follow the shortest path.
- If you've ever dropped something
at the bottom of a swimming pool
and you look for it through the water,
if you put your hand in there,
it's not necessarily where you think it is
because the light has bent
away from the flat surface.
- So what is the guiding principle here?
Well, over the next 1,600
years people slowly figured out
that the sine of the angle of incidence
divided by the sine of
the angle of refraction
is equal to a constant, n,
which depends on the
nature of the two media.
This came to be known as Snell's Law.
But no one knew why it worked.
That is, until 1657.
- So another great mathematician
enters our story at this point.
This is Pierre Fermat.
By day he was a judge,
but at night he'd come home
and hang out with his wife and kids
and then do what he really loved the most,
which was work on math for fun.
And he mostly worked in pure math
but at one point he got
interested in the question of,
why does light obey this
principle of refraction?
- [Derek] And he thought
maybe Hero of Alexandria
was on the right track,
but it's not distance
that is being minimized,
but rather time.
But to see if this was true for refraction
would be difficult.
He would have to work out
every possible path light could take
by varying the point where
it intersects the boundary
and compute the time for each,
and then show that light takes the path
for which the total travel
time is the shortest.
- He doesn't know how to solve it
and he worries that it's
gonna come out complicated
even if he could solve it,
so he's not gonna do it. 
I think it's 'cause he
wasn't super interested
in physics, actually.
But anyway, years go by,
he gets interested in it five years later
and tries to solve it,
and then he does solve it
and he shows that Snell's
Law actually pops out
as the minimizing path
for light, you know,
under these conditions
of moving from one medium
with one speed of light
to another with another.
- [Derek] And that constant, n,
well, that's just equal
to the speed of light
in the first medium
divided by the speed of
light in the second medium,
which allows us to rewrite
Snell's Law like this.
- And he says this thing,
I just wanna read you a
little quote 'cause I love it.
He says that this is
"the most extraordinary,
the most unforeseen,
and the happiest calculation" of his life.
See, it's good to do physics.
(both laugh)
If you use that principle of least time,
you can explain everything
that was known about light
at the time of Fermat.
It's the first time, as far as I know,
that anyone shows that nature obeys
an optimization principle,
that nature does the best possible thing.
In this case, that light takes
the shortest possible time.
- [Derek] Now, Bernoulli knew
about Fermat's principle of least time,
and he thought he could
use it to solve the problem
of fastest descent.
- He converted the problem
from a mechanics problem
about a particle sliding down a chute
to a problem about optics.
- [Derek] Instead of a mass
that's accelerated by gravity,
he imagined a ray of light
that would go faster and faster
as it went into layers of
less and less dense media.
And if you make the
layers thinner and thinner
where Snell's Law is
obeyed at each interface,
you eventually get a continuous curve.
Now the question is,
how should the speed of light change
from one layer to the next
so that it accurately
models a falling object?
- [Steven] You could try to
solve the problem by thinking,
if the particle has to fall from A to B,
it's gonna be picking up kinetic energy,
it's going faster and faster
as it slides down the chute
and it's converting the
loss in potential energy
into this kinetic energy.
If you write down the
conservation of energy
for that relationship,
you find that the velocity
that the particle achieves
at any time,
having fallen a distance, let's say y,
its velocity squared will
be proportional to y,
the height from the top.
So velocity goes like
the square root of y.
And that'd be sort of like saying
imagine light moving in a way where,
instead of a constant speed of light,
the speed of light is proportional
to the distance from the top.
- [Derek] Now let's zoom in
and look at a single interface.
We can plug in our expression
for the speed of light in each layer
into Snell's Law.
Then find that the sine of the first angle
divided by the square root
of y for the first layer
is equal to the sine of the second angle
divided by the square root
of y for the second layer.
And now here's the key insight.
Snell's Law also holds for the next layer,
and there the ingoing
angle is simply theta 2.
So this is also equal to
the sine of the third angle
divided by the square root of y3.
And the same goes for the next
layer and the next and so on.
In other words,
this ratio must be equal to
some constant, call it k.
And this equation, the story goes,
Bernoulli immediately recognized
as the equation of a cycloid.
That is the path traced out by a point
attached to the rim of a rolling wheel.
This is also known as
a brachistochrone curve
from the Greek for shortest time.
- [Steven] And so the astonishing solution
is that the fastest way to get from A to B
is to follow an arc of a cycloid.
Not a circle, a shape called a cycloid.
- Now, this curve also has
another surprising property.
No matter where I release the mass from,
it always reaches the
end at the same time.
For this reason,
it's also known as the tautochrone curve,
from the Greek for same time.
Upon finding this solution,
Bernoulli wrote, "In this way
I have solved at one stroke
two important problems,
an optical and a mechanical one,
and have achieved more than
I demanded from others.
I have shown that the two problems
taken from entirely separate
fields of mathematics
have the same character."
Little did Bernoulli know he
was onto something much bigger.
Around 40 years later,
one of his students,
Pierre Louis de Maupertuis,
also studied the behavior
of light and particles,
and he noticed that there are cases
where the two behave very similarly.
This made him think,
what if Fermat's principle of least time
wasn't the most fundamental?
I mean, why should nature
care about minimizing time?
Maybe there is a more foundational
quantity being minimized,
one that doesn't only govern
light, but also particles.
So, in the 1740s, he
proposed a new quantity,
which he called the action.
It is mass times velocity times distance.
His thinking went something like this.
The farther something travels,
the greater the action.
The faster it goes,
the greater the action.
And if it's a particle,
then the more massive it is,
the greater the action.
If there are multiple
segments to the journey,
then the total action is just the sum
of the mass times velocity
times distance for each segment.
To see the principle in action,
here is a super simple example
with no friction or losses.
Imagine a 0.5 kilogram ball
is rolled over the ground
for 6 meters at 3 meters per second.
Then that would be 9 units of action.
If the ball then bounces
and travels another 6 meters
at 3 meters per second,
then the action for the whole trip
is 9 plus 9, or 18 units of action.
Now, what Maupertuis claimed
is that out of all possible trajectories
where the ball bounces off the wall,
the path it will follow
is the one that minimizes the action.
In 1744, he wrote,
"This action is the
true expense of Nature,
which she manages to make
as small as possible."
So what was the response to
Maupertuis' revolutionary idea?
He was attacked and ridiculed.
One of his longtime friends,
a fellow physicist named Samuel Konig,
wrote that "not only is
your principal wrong,
you also stole it from Leibniz."
Voltaire, who used to be a
close friend of Maupertuis,
accused him of plagiarism,
bad physics, being stupid,
and just about anything
else he could think of.
In fact, he wrote a 32-page pamphlet
just to mock Maupertuis.
Of course, this may have
been partly due to rumors
Voltaire's lover had an
affair with Maupertuis.
But not everyone attacked him.
Some just ignored him.
- Maupertuis, I've taken
a lot of math and physics
in my life.
I think you're the first person
I ever heard pronounce it.
He doesn't get much mention.
- All of this was terribly
stressful for Maupertuis
who was nearing the end of his life,
and more than anything,
he thought the principle of least action
would be what he was remembered for.
That would be his legacy.
But now he was attacked,
mocked, ridiculed, and ignored.
Unfortunately, this treatment
was at least somewhat justified
because Maupertuis came
up with this principle
by kind of just picking
it out of thin air.
There was no obvious reason
why nature should care
about mass times velocity times distance,
or even less, why that
quantity should be minimized.
And mathematically, the
principle of least action
wasn't rigorous either.
But there was one man who
vehemently defended it,
and that man was Leonhard Euler.
The first thing Euler did
was he replaced the sum with an integral
so you could calculate the action
while speed or direction
changed continuously.
And he used this to find
the path of a particle
around a central mass,
like the orbit of a planet around a star.
Solving this meant that
out of every possible path
between two points,
he would have to find the one
for which the action was the smallest.
This is similar to the
problem Fermat tried to solve,
only now, instead of
changing one variable,
he would have to vary every
possible point along the path,
which is infinitely many.
Needless to say, this was an arduous task.
Math had not yet developed the tools
required to handle such problems.
Fortunately, Euler himself
invented a new method.
It was clunky and time
consuming, but it worked.
Through this process,
he realized that the
principle of least action
only works if the total
energy is conserved,
and it is the same for
all paths considered.
These were two conditions
that Maupertuis hadn't
realized were necessary.
So Euler improved the mathematical
rigor of the principle.
He found two extra conditions
and he provided a specific
example of it working.
- Euler is an astonishingly powerful
and not just great mathematician,
but appears to be a good guy.
As far as we could tell,
he was very generous.
You can still read Euler
and really understand it.
He helps you, he's empathetic.
You know, he was like you are, man.
He's trying to explain stuff.
- But Euler was still
far from a general proof.
That would have to wait for
another legendary mathematician,
Joseph-Louis Lagrange.
Joseph-Louis Lagrange
was a shy 19-year-old,
mostly self-taught.
But despite his age,
he was already working at
the forefront of mathematics,
including with Euler's new method.
In 1754, he shared his results with Euler,
who replied that Lagrange
had "extolled the theory
to the highest summit of perfection,"
which caused him "the greatest joy."
But besides being world
class mathematicians,
the two had another thing in common.
They were both huge proponents
of the principle of least action.
And around five years later,
just a year after Maupertuis' death,
Lagrange succeeded in
providing a general proof.
Is there any intuitive
way to think about action?
I feel like there's an intuitive
way to think about force
and there's kind of an intuitive
way to think about energy,
but is there an intuitive
way to think about action?
- I don't know.
I wanna watch your show to learn.
I hope you'll come up with it
because I don't have a
good feeling about action.
- [Derek] Now I wanna
explain Lagrange's proof,
but I don't want to do it the way he did.
So instead, we'll go through three steps.
First we'll explain the general approach
Euler and Lagrange came up with.
Then we'll rewrite the
principle into its modern form.
And finally we'll apply this
math to a simple example
to show you why it works.
So first, the general approach.
If there are infinite possible paths,
how do you find the one
with the least action?
Well, Euler and Lagrange
realized you can do it
in a similar way to how you
find the minimum of a function.
There you take the derivative
and set it equal to 0.
And where the slope is horizontal,
that must be the minimum.
So if you took a tiny step
to the left or the right,
the value of the function
basically doesn't change.
And similarly, if you have
the path of least action,
then if you were to change it a little bit
by, say, adding a tiny bump
here or flattening it out there,
imagine we're just adding
a tiny function, eta,
to our path of least action,
well, then the action
basically shouldn't change
because we're at this
really special point,
the path of least action.
You add a little bit to the minimal path
but the action is still the same.
If that is the optimal path
that has the least action,
then any other path must have more action.
- So the counter there
is like all of this is the first order.
So if you're looking at linear terms
that are proportional
to eta, the deviation,
then the first order,
the difference in action will be 0.
And the way you could imagine this is like
let's say you're at the bottom of a bowl
and you're at the minimum
and you make some tiny step
away and we call that step eta.
If that change would
be proportional to eta,
you would maybe increase on this side
but decrease on this side
and then this would no
longer be a minimum.
So sort of the coefficient
of eta has to be 0.
But since you're at a minimum,
it kind of goes like a parabola,
so it can be proportional to eta squared
or potentially some higher order term.
So there is a tiny
deviation in the action,
but it's not proportional to eta.
So the first order,
the change in action
between the optimal path
and some trial path is 0.
- So what you can write
is that the action of this trial path
minus the action of the true path
is equal to 0 to first order.
This is a compact way
of writing the principle of least action,
and it's the general approach you use
to solve all these problems.
So with that in hand,
let's rewrite the principle
into its modern form,
starting with Maupertuis' action,
which is the sum of mass
times velocity times distance.
But Euler changed this into an integral,
so it's the integral
of mass times velocity
integrated over distance.
Now the velocity is equal to ds over dt,
which we can rearrange
to get ds equals vdt.
And plugging this in,
we have an integral of
mv squared over time.
But wait, that's just
twice the kinetic energy.
And as Euler pointed out,
the total energy must be conserved.
Total energy is just
kinetic plus potential.
So we can rewrite this
as T equals E minus V.
And filling this in for
the second T gives us
that the variation of T plus
E minus V integrated over time
is equal to 0.
Now we can split this integral into two,
and since the energy is constant,
we can integrate this term
over time to get this.
And we can simplify this even further.
Just like with a normal derivative,
we can write the variation of E times t
as E times the variation of t
plus t times the variation of E.
But remember, as Euler found,
the energy of different
paths has to be the same,
so the variation between them is 0
and this term drops out.
If we rearrange this like so,
then we find that the
variation of this integral
is equal to minus the energy
times the variation of time.
This looks a lot like some
other minimization principle,
if only this was equal to 0.
Well, we can make this 0
by only considering paths that
have the same travel time.
If you do that, then there's
no longer any variation in time
and this term drops out.
And what we find is that
Maupertuis' principle
has changed into another form
where now the variation of kinetic energy
minus potential energy
integrated over time is equal to 0.
- T minus V, kinetic energy
minus potential energy,
and then you integrate that along a path
that you're traveling from A to B,
and then integrate it
with respect to time.
It's all very strange
and yet that turns out to be
the correct thing to integrate.
- [Derek] Now this is a little weird.
We started with mass times velocity
integrated over distance,
and now we have the kinetic energy
minus the potential energy
integrated over time.
And somehow both are ways
to write the principle of least action.
But that also means
that this integral here,
T minus V integrated over time,
is another way to write the action.
The first person
to write the principle
of least action like this
was William Rowan Hamilton in 1834,
and by doing so, he got the
principle named after him.
- So the principle of least action
that we write as integral of Ldt,
L being being the Lagrangian,
the T minus V, the kinetic
minus potential energy,
they don't call it Lagrange's Principle,
they call it Hamilton's Principle.
So I guess Hamilton is building
on Lagrange in that way.
- Hamilton's Principle is the modern way
of writing the principle of least action
and the way you'd find it in
almost every physics book.
In part that's because
Hamilton's Principle tells you
how objects move from one place to another
rather than just giving
you the shape of the path.
Two other important differences
between both principles
are that the action is
now an integral over time
instead of space.
And a consequence is that
with Hamilton's Principle,
you now need a start and end point,
and also a start and end time.
The third is that with
Maupertuis' principle,
you need to keep the energy
of different paths the same,
but the time can vary.
While with Hamilton's Principle,
the energies can differ
but the time has to be
the same between paths.
So now we have our general approach
and the modern way of
writing the principle,
so let's apply it to a simple
example to see why it works.
Let's say I throw this ball
straight up in the air,
so it goes from some start point
to say a different end point
in a certain amount of time.
Now if we call the height
of the ball y of t,
then we can plot these two points like so,
and then we can imagine
infinitely many possible trajectories
that could connect these two points.
Some go a little higher, some lower,
some have wiggles, others don't.
The only condition
is that all paths must have
the same start and end point
and the same amount of
time elapsed between them.
Now to find the real trajectory,
we proceed as before.
We imagine that this is
the true path, y of t,
the one with the least action.
And then we imagine making
small variations to it
by pushing it up a little here,
down a little there, and so on,
making tiny changes at every time step,
which we'll call eta of t.
So when you add y and eta together,
you get this new trial path,
let's call it q of t.
And since the variations are small,
the difference in action
between these two paths is 0.
Our next task is to solve this equation.
So we compute the action for each path.
For this, we need the kinetic
and potential energy for each,
and we write them as a
function of y and eta.
Plugging that in,
you get the difference in
actions is equal to this.
But wait, this first integral
is just the action of the true path,
so these integrals cancel,
and what you're left with is just that.
m times dy over dt
times d eta over dt
minus eta times the
derivative of the potential
integrated over time
is equal to 0.
We can rewrite this further
by using integration by parts.
That allows us to replace
this term with this one.
And if we plug that in,
we now have some function
that when multiplied by eta
and integrated over time
has to be equal to 0.
But since eta can be just about anything,
this can only be true if this part is 0.
So what we found is that the
action is minimal for the path
that satisfies this curious
differential equation.
Now it might look
complicated, but it's not.
Minus the derivative of the
potential is just the force.
And the second derivative of height?
Well, that's just acceleration.
So if we rearrange this,
we find that the path that satisfies
the principle of least action
is the one that obeys F equals ma.
In other words, the principle
of least action is equivalent
to Newton's Second Law,
but it covers more than just mechanics.
Fermat's principle of least time
turned out to be nothing
more than a special case
of the principle of least action.
So with this single principle,
you could suddenly describe everything,
from light reflecting and refracting,
to the swinging of a pendulum clock,
to planets orbiting the sun
and stars orbiting the core of the galaxy.
What used to be viewed
as entirely separate fields of physics
were now all unified under
a single simple rule.
The variation of the action is 0.
After Euler found out
about Lagrange's proof,
he wrote to him,
"How satisfied would
not Mr. Maupertuis be,
were he still alive,
if he could see his
principle of least action
applied to the highest degree of dignity
to which it is susceptible."
With Lagrange's proof,
we now have two ways to
solve any mechanics problem.
You can either use forces and vectors
or you can use energies and scalars.
It seems like the
principle of least action
is just way too complicated.
It is so unnecessary.
Who would ever use this, you know,
when you could just use
Newton's Second Law?
Like that's a piece of cake.
- Your options are either use all of this
or just start with F equals ma,
and they give you the same answer.
Why ever use the
principle of least action?
Well, that's because Euler and
Lagrange came up with a way
to make all of this like
super, super simple.
- [Derek] If this is the action,
then T minus V is called the Lagrangian.
Now let's replace everything we did before
with the Lagrangian.
Then you see that the
principle of least action works
whenever this differential
equation is satisfied.
- So all you have to do now
if you wanna solve any mechanics problem
is you just write down the
kinetic and potential energy
and you plug it into this
equation and you're done.
And that becomes extremely powerful.
- I remember thinking,
"Man, force is like hard
to get the right answer."
You can do it if you're good,
and people who are good
at mechanics can do it.
But with the Lagrangian approach,
you have this machine
crank out the principle
of least action on it
and you get the right equation to motion
and you don't have to be a good physicist.
That was what I took from it,
that as a math guy I can do physics
thanks to Lagrange and Euler.
- And it doesn't just
work in one dimension.
If you have more dimensions,
then you just solve the
Euler-Lagrange equation
for each coordinate.
- Another thing that's great is
you could use weird coordinate systems
that might be better
suited to the problem.
Like if you were doing a
problem with something rotating,
you might want to use polar coordinates
instead of Cartesian coordinates.
And this will give you the
correct equations of motion
in polar coordinates,
which again might be kind of
tricky to do with vectors.
- [Derek] Like with the double pendulum.
Trying to solve this using
forces is extremely hard.
- Because as one pendulum is swinging,
it provides the attachment point
for the pendulum hanging below it,
and so that pendulum is in
this moving reference frame
as it's swinging.
It's a very nasty job to write
down the correct F equals ma
for a double pendulum.
But if you write it down with
kinetic and potential energy,
it's pretty easy.
- This is actually how
we made this simulation.
Now, there is one little side note
we should give about the
principle of least action,
because the name is a little misleading.
- Although we often refer to the principle
as the principle of least action,
it's probably good to
add a little caveat here,
that sometimes it's not
necessarily the minimum.
Just as when you find in calculus
when you set a derivative to 0,
that doesn't guarantee
you're getting the minimum
of a function.
The principle of least
action more properly stated
should be the principle
of stationary action.
That the laws of motion
come from demanding a stationary point,
which is tantamount to this condition
of setting a certain derivative to 0
and then getting the
Euler-Lagrange equation from that.
So very often it is a true
minimum, but not always.
- But action is much more fundamental
than just classical mechanics.
Around the turn of the 20th century,
action popped up as the
key part of a solution
to one of the biggest
problems in atomic physics
at the time.
The UV catastrophe.
- It's kind of spooky
that this breakthrough
that starts the ball rolling
toward quantum theory
brings action in.
Not energy and not force, action.
It gives you a hint, yeah.
- But that and much more
will have to wait for a separate video,
so make sure you're subscribed
to get notified when it comes out.
The story of the principle of least action
is the story of how knowledge compounds,
growing through steady
progress one step at a time
until it changes how we
see the world completely.
And it's not just big
scientific discoveries
where this happens.
Learning a little every
day compounds over time,
making you smarter and
a better problem-solver.
And you can start doing
this right now for free
with this video's sponsor, Brilliant.
Brilliant helps you get smarter every day
while building real practical skills
in everything from math and physics
to data science and programming,
whatever it is that sparks your curiosity.
What I love most about Brilliant
is that you learn by doing,
getting hands on with real problems
that help you build intuition.
And since all their
lessons are bite-sized,
it's easy to take small steps
toward mastering huge topics
like the language of most
of physics, calculus.
Brilliant recently updated
their excellent course on calculus
which doesn't just
explain the big concepts,
it guides you through them
interactively one step at a time.
That way you don't just memorize concepts,
you really understand them
in a way that just clicks.
Now, I truly believe that
learning a little bit every day
is one of the best gifts
you can give yourself.
And with Brilliant, it's super easy.
All it takes is a few minutes,
which could be on your
commute, on a break, whenever.
And before you know it,
you're ending each day a bit smarter.
