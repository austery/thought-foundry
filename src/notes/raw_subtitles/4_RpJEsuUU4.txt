[Music]


Hi
 everybody.
 I'm
 Nicolola
 Tangan,
 the


CEO
 of
 Norwegian
 Sovereign
 Wealth
 Fund.


And
 today
 I'm
 in
 really
 good
 company


with
 Judy
 Marx,
 who
 is
 the
 CEO
 and


president
 of
 Otis.
 Now
 Otis
 is
 an


incredible
 company.
 It's
 a
 lifts
 and


elevator
 company,
 and
 they
 move
 2.4


billion
 people
 every
 day
 across
 200


countries.
 Now,
 uh
 I
 think
 Judy's


leadership
 is
 just
 like
 a
 standout


example
 of
 innovation
 and
 people
 first


culture.
 And
 so
 big
 welcome.
 Thanks


Nikolai.
 Great
 to
 be
 great
 to
 be
 here
 in


Oslo
 with
 you.
 So
 the
 first
 thing
 is
 so


now
 um
 Judy
 we
 we
 go
 into
 an
 elevator


right
 you
 and
 I
 uh
 together
 and
 um
 you


press
 you
 know
 fifth
 floor.
 Just
 how
 how


do
 you
 know
 that
 you're
 in
 a
 good


elevator?
 Well
 the
 first
 thing
 is


actually
 as
 technology
 develops


hopefully
 you're
 going
 to
 press
 that


floor
 before
 you
 ever
 get
 to
 the
 get
 to


the
 unit
 and
 the
 car
 itself.
 But
 to
 me


it's
 about
 ride
 quality.
 It's
 about


safety.
 Uh,
 and
 it's
 about
 um
 just
 the


general
 passenger
 experience.
 And
 I


think
 that
 passenger
 experience
 is
 going


to
 be
 one
 of
 the
 many
 things
 that


changes
 in
 the
 near
 future.
 What
 is
 a


ride
 ride
 quality?
 What
 is
 that?
 Uh,


it's
 something
 you
 feel.
 Yeah.
 You
 feel


how
 do
 you
 feel?
 How
 do
 you
 What
 do
 you


feel?
 Oh,
 I
 think
 I
 think
 every
 person


has
 a
 reaction.
 Is
 it
 smooth?
 Is
 it
 uh


is
 does
 it
 bother
 my
 does
 it
 bother
 my


ears?
 Um,
 how
 does
 it
 It's
 just
 a
 It's
 a


It's
 a
 very
 personal
 experience.
 Should


it
 like
 accelerate
 a
 lot?
 Should
 it
 uh


be
 I
 mean
 just
 what
 should
 it
 like
 start


with
 a
 bang?
 Should
 it
 start
 smoothly?


What
 what
 should
 it
 do?
 Well,
 you
 know


the
 goal
 and
 and
 Noli,
 you
 know,
 I'm
 an


engineer.
 So,
 so
 the
 goal
 is
 the
 faster


you
 can
 get
 to
 acceleration,
 the
 more


people
 you
 can
 move
 safely
 and
 move


quickly.
 And
 when
 I
 talk
 to
 customers,


what
 they
 want
 is
 to
 use
 the
 least


amount
 of
 space
 to
 move
 the
 most
 amount


of
 people
 as
 efficiently
 and
 quickly
 as


they
 can.
 because
 if
 they're
 not
 using


it
 for
 a
 hoist
 for
 an
 elevator,
 they
 can


rent
 it.
 They
 can
 sell
 that
 space,
 you


know,
 whether
 it's
 an
 apartment
 building


or
 retail.
 So,
 the
 goal
 is
 to
 accelerate


and
 not
 stop
 at
 every
 floor.
 Um,
 so
 so


but
 but
 it's
 a
 balance
 in
 terms
 of


physiology
 and
 it's
 a
 balance
 in
 terms


of
 how
 fast
 you
 can
 you
 can
 actually


move
 the
 people.
 But
 the
 reason
 we
 group


people
 in
 in
 a
 in
 a
 product
 where
 you


you
 push
 the
 floor
 before
 you
 ever
 get


into
 the
 elevator
 and
 then
 it
 tells
 you


which
 one
 to
 go.
 The
 reason
 we
 group


them
 is
 to
 be
 able
 to
 have
 less
 stops


and
 to
 accelerate
 more
 quickly
 and
 to


move
 people
 more
 quickly.
 Should
 there


be
 music
 in
 an
 elevator?
 I
 think
 there


there
 should
 be
 and
 uh
 we
 were
 the
 first


elevator
 that
 put
 music
 in
 uh
 many
 many


years
 ago.
 What's
 your
 favorite
 what's


your
 favorite
 elevator
 music?
 Uh
 I
 Well,


it's
 interesting.
 We
 actually
 believe


elevators
 now
 can
 offer
 you
 to
 choose


your
 music.
 All
 right.
 So,
 I
 think
 it's


up
 to
 anybody.
 But
 the
 original
 reason


that
 music
 was
 put
 in
 elevators
 was
 when


there
 used
 to
 be
 elevator
 attendance


before
 they
 were
 autonomous.
 And
 so,


this
 was
 to
 to
 settle
 people's
 fears
 who


were
 used
 to
 having
 someone
 in
 there.


So,
 they
 felt
 more
 comfortable.
 They


they
 listened
 to
 calming
 music
 and


that's
 where
 elevator
 music
 came
 from.


Oh,
 wow.
 Very
 interesting.
 Now,
 you
 are


you
 are
 in
 a
 lot
 of
 iconic
 buildings


around
 the
 world.
 Uh,
 what
 are
 you
 what


are
 you
 most
 proud
 of?
 Well,
 I
 I'd
 have


to
 go
 back
 to
 some
 of
 the
 buildings


we've
 been
 in
 since
 day
 since
 the
 day


they
 were
 built.
 Uh,
 we
 were
 the
 only
 US


or
 non-French
 company
 to
 be
 in
 the


Eiffel
 Tower
 from
 day
 one.
 We're
 still


modernizing
 and
 maintaining.
 We
 have


full
 service
 on
 the
 Eiffel
 Tower
 and


it's
 truly
 iconic.
 Same
 with
 the
 Empire


State
 Building.
 Uh,
 you
 know,
 as
 that


building
 went
 up
 in
 13
 months,
 it
 was


the
 highest
 building
 in
 the
 world
 at
 the


time
 and
 it
 really
 stretched
 us


technologically.
 We
 still
 are
 working


for
 for
 Tony
 Malcin
 uh
 and
 the
 Empire


State
 Building.
 He
 went
 up
 in
 13
 months.


The
 whole
 Empire
 State
 Building
 was
 How


long
 How
 long
 time
 do
 you
 think
 they


would
 have
 it
 would
 have
 taken
 them


today?
 A
 lot
 longer.
 And
 why


why
 regulations
 were
 were
 not
 okay.
 So


lots
 of
 people
 no
 regulations.
 Yeah,
 you


know,
 I
 think
 about
 um
 as
 recent
 as
 uh


last
 month,
 I
 was
 transiting
 through


Inchan
 through
 through
 through
 the


Inchan
 terminal
 to
 the
 new
 terminal,
 and


we've
 got
 our
 largest
 moving
 walkway


there.
 It's
 over
 130
 m
 long,
 one
 one


unit.
 So,
 uh
 you
 know,
 we
 do
 moving


walkways,
 we
 do
 escalators,
 but
 but


iconic
 buildings,
 we
 have
 the
 Burge,
 we


have
 the
 tallest
 building
 in
 the
 world.


Now,
 that
 that'll
 change
 over
 time
 as
 as


buildings
 continue
 to
 rise,
 but
 um
 you


know,
 it
 it
 only
 matters
 to
 you
 for
 the


building
 you
 use.
 So,
 I
 can
 talk
 iconic,


but
 it
 kind
 of
 only
 matters
 where
 you


live
 and
 what
 you
 use.
 And
 as
 long
 as


that's
 reliable
 and
 gets
 you
 where
 you


need
 to
 be,
 you
 don't
 even
 think
 about


the
 elevator.
 Well,
 regulations
 is
 an


interesting
 thing,
 right?
 So,
 they


managed
 to
 rebuild
 Notradam
 in
 5
 years


because
 they
 were
 told
 they
 didn't
 need


to
 to
 care
 about
 regulations.
 So
 um
 it


can
 have
 have
 a
 big
 big
 difference


moving
 um
 looking
 at
 the
 the
 total


market.
 So
 one
 of
 the
 fascinating
 things


I
 think
 is
 just
 how
 few
 elevator


companies
 there
 are.
 Yeah,
 it's
 very


very
 consolidated.
 Very
 consolidated.


Right.
 So
 you
 got
 like
 uh
 you
 got
 Otis,


Tiss
 Con.
 Well
 I
 I
 out
 of
 respect
 for
 my


competitors
 Schindler
 and
 then
 there's


four
 Japanese
 competitors
 and
 a
 few


Chinese
 competitors.
 Yeah.
 So
 why
 is


this
 all
 consolidated?
 Uh
 I
 think
 it's
 a


variety
 of
 reasons.
 I
 think
 the
 the


single
 most
 important
 is
 the
 nature
 of


the
 work
 we
 do
 life
 safety
 uh
 high-risk


high
 uh
 business
 uh
 in
 terms
 of
 both


installations
 I
 mean
 we
 work
 at
 heights


um
 but
 I
 think
 more
 importantly
 the
 fact


that
 um
 we
 move
 people
 every
 day
 uh
 and


you
 think
 about
 just
 uh
 you
 know
 and


you've
 heard
 me
 say
 this
 before
 I
 we


can't
 train
 or
 control
 a
 single


passenger
 whether
 it's
 a
 rowdy
 group
 of


football
 fans
 jumping
 up
 and
 down
 on
 an


escalator
 or
 uh
 or
 a
 group
 of
 of
 of


college
 fraternity
 uh
 brothers
 who
 who


want
 to
 see
 how
 many
 people
 they
 can
 fit


in
 an
 elevator.
 Um
 you
 know
 we
 we
 don't


control
 that
 and
 yet
 everyone
 has
 to


have
 a
 safe
 ride
 every
 time.
 Why
 do
 you


make
 so
 much
 money?
 Why
 is
 this
 business


so
 profitable?
 Well,
 the
 business
 is


profitable.
 Um
 and
 it's
 because
 of
 the


service
 business.
 So
 what
 happens
 is
 and


and
 we
 do
 we
 do
 focus
 on
 this
 as
 a
 as
 a


a
 service-driven
 business
 model
 on
 a


flywheel.
 Uh
 the
 beauty
 of
 our
 business


is
 our
 product
 stays
 in
 place.
 It
 may


move
 up
 and
 down.
 It
 may
 move


diagonally.
 It
 may
 move
 uh
 a
 moving


walkway,
 but
 it
 stays
 forever,
 which


means
 you
 have
 the
 service
 which
 is


regulated.
 The
 regulation
 Nikolai
 is
 on


the
 customer.
 So
 when
 you
 think
 about


the
 fact
 that
 someone
 something
 has
 to


have
 scheduled
 maintenance
 for
 us,
 it's


a
 subscription
 service.
 It's
 annual.
 Uh


we
 have
 many
 that
 go
 multiple
 years,
 but


customers
 have
 to
 have
 that
 if
 they're


going
 to
 get
 their
 unit
 inspected
 by
 the


local
 government,
 local
 authorities,
 uh


and
 continue
 to
 use
 it.
 So,
 and
 if
 it


and
 if
 it
 doesn't
 pass
 the
 rate,
 they


close
 it
 down,
 right?
 They
 close
 it
 down


or
 they
 require
 repair.
 So,
 the
 repair


part
 of
 our
 business
 is
 part
 of
 our


service
 business
 as
 well.
 Uh
 it's
 a


break
 fix
 kind
 of
 business.
 These
 are


electromechanical
 becoming
 more
 digital


but
 but
 elevators
 age
 just
 like
 any


other
 uh
 equipment
 you
 have
 in
 your
 in


your
 life.
 Um
 whether
 it's
 an
 appliance


whether
 it's
 a
 washing
 machine
 and
 and


they
 need
 to
 to
 be
 replaced
 and
 in
 our


case
 they
 need
 to
 be
 replaced
 in
 place


in
 a
 live
 building
 and
 we
 call
 that


modernization
 and
 that's
 that's
 really


the
 next
 big
 market
 service
 business


itself
 uh
 over
 24%
 in
 terms
 of
 of


margin.
 Um,
 and
 it's
 a
 it's
 a
 people


business.
 It's
 where
 we've
 got
 44,000
 uh


professional
 field
 mechanics
 who
 take


care
 of
 that
 every
 day.
 That's
 why
 we're


a
 service
 company.
 Um,
 now
 you're
 very


strong
 in
 particular
 regions,
 right?
 Uh,


countries,
 areas.
 Um,
 now
 I
 wouldn't
 say


you
 have
 kind
 of
 card
 the
 the
 world
 up


amongst
 you
 because
 of
 course
 you


haven't,
 but
 you
 know,
 you
 for
 instance


are
 very
 strong
 in
 Spain.
 Uh,
 just
 what


are
 the
 tell
 us
 about
 the
 areas
 where


you
 are
 particularly
 strong
 and
 why?


Yeah.
 So
 I
 think
 again
 and
 it
 gets
 back


to
 density.
 Um
 we
 try
 and
 and
 we
 don't


measure
 or
 I
 don't
 challenge
 our
 team
 to


be
 number
 one
 globally.
 I
 challenge
 them


to
 be
 tops
 in
 their
 own
 markets.
 And
 and


we
 go
 to
 market
 obviously
 through
 four


regions.
 And
 these
 regions
 all
 break


down
 into
 operating
 units,
 operating


areas
 and
 eventually
 1400
 branches.


These
 1400
 branches
 are
 small
 P&Ls.
 They


each
 have
 strengths
 and
 weaknesses.
 Um


but
 but
 part
 of
 it
 is
 is
 legacy
 in
 terms


of
 where
 we
 are.
 We
 are
 a
 US
 company.
 We


were
 founded
 in
 Yoners,
 New
 York
 in


1853.
 Um
 so
 so
 our
 US
 strength
 is


strong.
 We're
 number
 one
 in
 that
 market


and
 that's
 a
 a
 very
 um
 a
 very
 attractive


market
 for
 us
 and
 one
 where
 we're
 we're


very
 pleased
 with
 our
 with
 our
 results.


Um
 why
 are
 you
 not
 stronger
 in
 China?


Well,
 so
 it's
 interesting.
 Uh
 we
 got
 to


China
 40
 years
 ago.
 Uh
 we
 were
 one
 of


the
 first
 American
 companies
 in
 we


started
 in
 Tenzin
 and
 spread
 throughout


the
 throughout
 the
 country.
 Um,
 but
 I
 I


think
 if
 you
 were
 now
 number
 three
 in


China,
 we
 used
 to
 be
 number
 four
 when
 I


first
 got
 here.
 Uh,
 I
 think
 if
 you
 look


at
 um
 the
 investments
 that
 were
 made
 in


China
 between
 2000
 and
 2015,
 uh,
 we
 did


not
 invest
 and
 expand
 to
 the
 same
 scale


as
 some
 of
 our
 competitors
 under
 the


former
 parent.
 Uh,
 I'm
 I
 I'm
 not


revisiting
 that.
 I
 think
 it
 was
 just
 uh


there
 was
 really
 strong
 growth,
 just
 not


strong
 enough.
 Um,
 but
 yeah,
 back
 to


your
 other
 question.
 Uh
 the
 southern


Europe
 is
 a
 very
 very
 attractive


business
 for
 us.
 Um
 you
 know
 we've
 got


over
 a
 quarter
 of
 a
 million
 units
 in
 in


Spain
 alone.
 Uh
 and
 you
 think
 about


density
 in
 Europe
 where
 every
 building


every
 building.
 Think
 of
 any
 city.
 Look


out
 here
 in
 Oslo.
 You
 know
 once
 you
 get


past
 three
 stories
 uh
 there's
 at least


one
 one
 lift
 in
 every
 in
 every
 building.


M.
 So
 tell
 me
 about
 the
 driver
 series


because
 you
 got
 you
 got
 some
 really


powerful
 long-term
 demographic
 drivers.


Just
 what
 how
 do
 you
 see
 them?
 Yeah.
 So


so
 for
 a
 business
 that's
 been
 around


we'll
 go
 on
 172
 years
 in
 September,
 we


still
 have
 these
 these
 these
 mega
 trends


um
 that
 that
 get
 you
 excited
 and
 and


actually
 show
 room
 for
 growth.
 Uh


urbanization
 remains
 um
 you
 know
 we've


seen
 the
 urbanization.
 So
 we
 kind
 of
 we


pile
 them
 high.
 We
 p
 we
 high
 and
 dense.


Uh
 but
 if
 you
 think
 about
 um
 emerging


markets
 and
 even
 mature
 markets,
 people


are
 still
 moving
 to
 cities.
 Uh
 China


alone,
 there's
 still
 another
 at
 least


250
 million
 people
 that
 they
 want
 to


move
 off
 the
 farms,
 raise
 out
 of
 poverty


and
 move
 to
 urban
 areas.
 Southeast
 Asia,


India
 is
 going
 through
 a
 tremendous


amount
 of
 of
 urbanization.
 Um
 but
 we're


even
 seeing
 that
 uh
 you
 know
 the


business
 is
 still
 growing
 even
 on
 the


equipment
 side
 in
 in
 Northern
 Europe
 uh


and
 in
 in
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 world.
 What
 is


driving
 it
 here?
 The
 fact
 that
 we
 get


older
 and
 can't
 manage
 to
 walk
 the


stairs.
 Yeah,
 that's
 the
 second
 trend


which
 is
 which
 is
 um
 you
 know
 is
 the


aging
 population.
 I
 I
 actually
 stopped


talking
 about
 us
 getting
 older
 and
 I
 I


use
 the
 term
 longevity.
 Yeah,
 it
 sounds


better
 for
 you
 and
 I
 totally.
 But
 if
 you


think
 about
 the
 the
 aging
 population
 and


the
 demand
 needs,
 um
 people
 want
 to
 stay


in
 their
 homes
 as
 they
 age.
 Uh
 we're


seeing
 uh
 senior
 living
 pick
 up


everywhere
 uh
 in
 terms
 of
 buildings,
 but


if
 we
 can
 add
 mobility
 to
 homes
 uh
 as
 we


all
 age,
 uh
 people
 need
 that.
 And
 then


as
 you
 the
 the
 next
 the
 next
 step
 which


we've
 already
 we
 already
 used
 and
 have


proven
 in
 lots
 of
 buildings
 is
 our


ability
 to
 allow
 robots
 to
 operate
 uh


elevators
 which
 will
 then
 be
 humanoids


who
 have
 the
 ability
 to
 to
 control
 the


elevator
 to
 come
 in
 and
 and
 to
 be
 able


to
 deliver
 services
 to
 to
 people
 as
 they


as
 they
 live
 longer.


Now
 you
 are
 you
 are
 a
 very
 important


service
 business.
 Um
 what's
 the
 best


service
 you
 have
 seen
 anywhere?
 What's


the
 best
 service
 experience
 you've
 ever


had?
 Uh
 I
 would
 tell
 you
 our
 best


service
 is
 in
 Japan.
 Um
 and
 it's
 an


expectation
 there.
 It's
 an
 expectation


of
 excellence.
 The
 code
 is
 higher.
 The


demand
 the
 requirements
 are
 higher
 from


the
 customers.
 Uh
 and
 it's
 not
 even
 in


the
 sophistication
 of
 of
 course
 we
 have


to
 have
 an
 earthquake
 sensor
 in
 every


elevator
 due
 to
 the
 due
 the
 nature
 of


the
 uh
 the
 country
 and
 the
 needs.
 Um,


but
 there
 is
 an
 expectation
 of
 quality


in
 Japan.
 Not
 unique
 to
 our
 industry,


but
 certainly
 in
 our
 industry.
 If
 we


have
 an
 elevator
 breakdown
 in
 Japan
 and


we
 have
 to
 uh
 they
 have
 to
 call
 our
 Otus


line,
 our
 help
 line
 for
 for
 a
 request


for
 a
 mechanic
 because
 because
 our


elevator
 stopped,
 our
 branch
 manager


actually
 goes
 physically
 to
 see
 that


customer
 to
 explain
 what
 happened,
 to


apologize,
 and
 to
 make
 sure
 it
 doesn't


happen
 again.
 That
 doesn't
 happen


anywhere
 else
 in
 the
 world.
 No.
 Well,


that
 you
 know
 it's
 so
 interesting


because
 if
 you
 had
 asked
 me
 what's
 best


service
 experience
 I
 ever
 had,
 I
 would


say
 it
 was
 in
 a
 Rio
 Khan
 in
 Coyoto.
 A


Rioan
 is
 a
 guest
 house
 and
 it
 was
 just


unbelievable.
 And
 I
 remember
 in
 the


guest
 book
 it
 was
 uh
 signed
 by
 I
 think


it
 was
 one
 of
 the
 first
 Hiltons
 you
 know


she
 said
 this
 epitomizes
 what
 service


should
 be
 all
 about.
 And
 it
 made
 such
 an


impression
 on
 me
 just
 personality
 you


know
 the
 way
 they
 handled
 you


personally.
 So
 why
 tell
 me
 why
 is
 this


specific
 to
 Japan?
 I
 I
 I
 think
 it's


cultural
 expectation.
 I
 I
 would
 tell
 you


the
 other
 part
 of
 it
 which
 are
 and
 you


know
 they
 stood
 they
 stood
 outside
 the


guest
 house
 and
 they
 waited
 until
 they


couldn't
 see
 us
 anymore.
 You
 know
 when


it
 took
 us
 5
 minutes
 to
 walk
 down
 the


street
 and
 they
 were
 just
 standing


there.
 Unbelievable.
 Yeah.
 The
 other
 the


other
 part
 though
 is
 is
 there's
 also
 a


recognition
 in
 Japan
 of
 they
 are
 the
 the


largest
 the
 the
 most
 rapidly
 aging


society.
 So
 there's
 there's
 planning
 in


place
 and
 and
 how
 I
 would
 correlate
 that


to
 our
 business
 is
 it's
 probably
 the


most
 mature
 business
 we
 have
 in
 dealing


with
 obsolescence
 of
 parts
 and
 of


equipment.
 So
 there's
 this
 just
 this
 me


mental
 mindset
 of
 thinking
 of
 everything


in
 advance
 and
 then
 being
 extremely


customer
 focused.
 So
 are
 you
 trying
 to


make
 Otis
 um
 more
 of
 a
 Japanese
 company?


Um
 I
 think
 there's
 mindset
 mindset


customer
 centricity
 absolutely.
 Uh
 we're


the
 only
 non-Japanese
 player
 in
 Japan
 in


our
 industry
 and
 we've
 been
 there
 for
 a


long
 time
 uh
 over
 70
 years
 I
 believe.
 Um


and
 and
 we've
 learned
 a
 lot
 from
 that


and
 we
 do
 rotate
 our
 leaders
 through


there
 especially
 uh
 the
 last
 at
 least


the
 leaders
 um
 in
 my
 tenure
 have
 all
 at


the
 top
 have
 all
 been
 non-Japanese
 so


they
 can
 experience
 it
 and
 then
 take
 it


back
 to
 their
 country.
 Uh
 but
 we
 share


lessons
 learned
 amongst
 amongst
 the


group.
 Um
 but
 but


expectations
 very
 high.
 What
 type
 of


regulations
 are
 there
 for
 elevators?
 Oh,


there's
 there's
 regulations
 that
 vary
 by


city,
 by
 country,
 by
 parts
 of
 the
 world.


Um
 very
 specific
 we
 call
 it
 code
 uh
 very


specific
 codes
 on
 safety
 standards,
 on


limitations,
 on
 inspection
 regimes.
 Uh


we
 have
 some
 countries
 where
 the


maintenance
 has
 to
 happen.
 it's


regulated
 by
 by
 by
 schedule.
 Uh
 others


where
 you
 have
 the
 control
 and
 it's


unscheduled
 but
 you
 have
 to
 meet
 the


objectives.
 Uh
 but
 if
 you
 go
 even
 in
 the


US
 uh
 I
 think
 our
 factory
 in
 Florence,


South
 Carolina
 builds
 to
 over
 70
 or
 80


different
 codes
 just
 to
 support
 the
 US


and
 Canada.
 And
 what
 kind
 of
 mold
 does


that
 provide
 you
 with?
 I
 mean is


different.
 That's
 tremendous.


Tremendous.
 Uh
 which
 is
 why
 we
 haven't


had
 why
 we're
 so
 consolidated.
 Um,
 first


of
 all,
 you
 know,
 are
 are
 customers


going
 to
 trust
 a
 brand
 new
 brand?
 Uh,


again,
 you're
 trusting
 them
 with


people's
 lives.
 Uh,
 but
 second,
 you
 have


this
 moat
 that
 says
 there
 is
 no
 one


global
 standard.
 There's
 no
 one
 global


uh
 requirement.
 Uh,
 so
 uh
 for
 someone
 to


enter
 and
 to
 and
 to
 truly
 hit
 larger


than
 a
 one
 city
 market
 uh
 takes
 a


tremendous
 amount
 of
 knowledge,


investment,
 risk
 management
 uh
 and


that's
 why
 I
 think
 it's
 so
 consolidated.


Why
 do
 they
 never
 fall
 down?


Elevators.
 Yeah.
 Well,
 there's
 a
 very


rarely.
 I
 mean,
 you
 hardly
 hear
 about


them
 if
 you
 think
 about
 it.
 They
 just


kind
 of
 hang
 there
 in
 a
 rope
 and
 then


Well,
 there
 is
 this
 thing
 called
 a


counterwe,
 right?
 And
 you
 can
 see
 them.


We
 were
 in
 the
 monk
 museum
 yesterday
 and


it
 was
 not
 our
 elevator,
 but
 you
 could


see
 the
 it
 was
 glass,
 so
 you
 could
 see


the
 uh
 the
 counterwe
 moving
 as
 the


elevator
 goes.
 Um,
 but
 I
 mean
 in
 the


monk
 museum,
 we
 saw
 pictures
 of
 angst.


There's
 very
 little
 angst
 in
 your
 in


your
 elevators,
 right?
 That's
 the
 goal


is
 is
 no
 angst.
 No
 angst
 and
 no
 uh
 no


enttrapments.
 But
 the
 enttrapments
 do


happen
 on
 occasion
 when
 power
 goes
 out


when
 when
 there
 are
 issues.
 Uh
 the


elevator
 is
 uh
 it's
 safer
 to
 be
 in
 an


elevator
 than
 fly
 in
 an
 airplane.
 And


you
 know
 how
 safe
 airplanes
 are.
 Um


again
 with
 so
 many
 people
 every
 day


using
 it,
 it's
 uh
 it's
 a
 proven


technology.
 But
 I
 think
 the
 biggest


reason
 that
 that
 it's
 so
 safe
 is
 it's


got
 it's
 got,
 you
 know,
 a


multi-redundant
 safety
 system.
 We
 call


it
 a
 safety
 chain.
 Uh
 so
 there's
 there's


three
 layers
 of
 safety,
 which
 is
 why
 you


never
 fall.
 Uh
 there's
 there's
 always
 a


mechanical
 layer,
 but
 there's
 you
 have
 a


governor
 and
 you
 just
 have
 the
 ability


uh
 with
 the
 safeties
 to
 to
 make
 sure


that
 people
 stop.
 The
 that
 today's
 the


future
 and
 and
 what
 we're
 seeing
 already


today
 in
 some
 of
 our
 offerings
 is
 making


sure
 that
 when
 you
 stop,
 even
 if
 they
 it


has
 to
 be
 an
 emergency,
 you
 you
 you


actually
 stop
 at
 a
 landing
 so
 that


people
 don't
 get
 caught
 between
 floors.


Uh
 which
 is
 which
 is
 the
 worst


experience
 someone
 can
 have.
 the
 fire


brigade
 will
 show
 up
 and
 they
 have
 to


break
 through
 a
 wall
 or
 something.
 So,


that's
 available.
 But
 the
 challenge,


Nikolai,
 is
 we
 have
 elevators.
 The


beautiful
 news
 is
 we've
 built
 reliable


elevators.
 Uh
 we
 have
 elevators
 that


have
 been
 around
 50
 70
 years.
 Um
 and


more.
 I've
 been
 in
 some
 from
 the
 1890s.


So,
 they
 get
 modernized,
 but
 you
 know,


again,
 as
 that
 technology
 gets
 applied,


there's
 22
 million
 elevators
 and


escalators
 in
 use
 every
 day.
 uh
 there's


a
 lot
 of
 install
 base
 to
 get
 to
 to


continue
 to
 modernize
 and
 make
 things


more
 technologically
 uh
 advanced.
 Why
 is


it
 important
 to
 have
 the
 installed
 base


to
 have
 a
 high
 density
 of
 install
 base?


Well,
 it's
 all
 about
 uh
 productivity
 and


and
 of
 your
 service
 fleet,
 right?
 So,
 if


you
 can
 along
 route
 have
 the
 density


where
 people
 don't
 have
 to
 travel
 and


have
 much
 as
 much
 non-productive
 time,


uh
 you
 have
 the
 ability
 to
 have
 more


productive
 mechanics
 and
 if
 you
 can
 give


them
 the
 tools
 and
 technology
 to
 help


them,
 that's
 even
 better.
 But
 it
 it


starts
 with
 a
 very
 basic
 algorithm
 on
 on


routing.
 Um
 which
 is
 you
 know
 the
 kind


of
 the
 the
 math
 challenge
 that
 that
 many


of
 us
 had
 earlier
 in
 life.
 How
 do
 you


how
 do
 you
 develop
 a
 route
 when
 you
 have


that
 density?
 It
 gives
 you
 that
 ability


to
 you
 know
 if
 a
 mechanic
 yesterday
 can


handle
 11,
 how
 do
 you
 get
 that
 same


mechanic
 to
 handle
 12
 elevators
 in
 a


day?
 And
 I
 use
 those
 numbers
 as
 just


representative.
 It's
 nice
 to
 hear
 you


talk
 about
 your
 44,000
 mechanics
 because


you
 nearly
 get
 tears
 in
 your
 eyes.
 I


It's
 just
 clear
 to
 me
 that
 you
 love
 your


mechanics.
 I
 do.
 And
 I
 I
 hope
 they
 know.


Tell
 me
 about
 them.
 Tell
 me
 about
 them.


So So
 it's
 an
 interesting
 business.
 Um


it's
 a
 people
 business.
 Yeah.
 And
 these


mechanics
 are
 professionals.
 And
 I
 I
 I
 I


try
 to
 show
 them
 the
 respect
 they


deserve.
 Uh
 I
 don't
 use
 the
 word


employees
 in
 our
 company.
 I
 use
 the
 word


colleagues
 because
 I
 think
 it's


respectful.
 Uh
 but
 we
 have
 no
 business


without
 our
 mechanics.
 Um
 and
 uh
 these


44,000
 are
 dedicated.
 I
 call
 it
 a
 humble


pride.
 They
 care
 about
 Otis.
 Um,
 many
 of


them,
 their
 fathers
 worked
 for
 us
 as


mechanics.
 It's
 very
 much
 a
 trade
 that


gets
 passed
 down.
 Uh,
 the
 trades
 changed


quite
 a
 bit.
 It's
 not
 as
 mechanical.
 Uh,


it's
 not
 as
 much
 lube
 and
 oil
 anymore.


It's
 it's
 a
 lot
 more
 uh
 trouble
 find


troubleshooting
 and
 digital.
 Uh,
 but


there's
 still
 that
 mechanical
 need
 for


people.
 And
 so,
 we're
 calling
 on
 44,000


mechanics
 who
 don't
 typically
 show
 up
 at


an
 office
 ever.
 Uh,
 or
 very
 rare.
 We'll


do
 we'll
 do
 safety
 huddles.
 We'll
 do


those
 at
 job
 sites.
 But
 but
 these
 are


people
 who
 work
 fairly
 independently
 but


are
 part
 of
 our
 company
 and
 as
 they


succeed
 we
 succeed.
 Uh
 if
 you
 even
 have


you
 even
 have
 a
 like
 a
 coin
 or
 a
 medal


that
 you
 give
 some
 of
 them.
 Tell
 me


about
 I
 do.
 I
 have
 a
 um
 you
 know
 out
 of


respect
 I
 have
 a
 a
 coin
 that
 I've
 made.


It's
 my
 CEO
 coin.
 Uh
 it's
 about
 this


big.
 Um
 they're
 all
 numbered
 and
 anytime


I
 get
 to
 see
 a
 mechanic
 at
 a
 job
 site
 uh


I
 thank
 them
 and
 I
 tell
 them
 they're
 the


heart
 and
 soul
 of
 our
 company
 and
 they


are
 um
 you
 know
 our
 growth
 is
 limited
 to


our
 mechanics
 capabilities
 and
 the


number
 of
 mechanics
 we
 have.
 We've
 added


uh
 over
 10%
 uh
 of
 mechanics
 since
 in
 the


5
 years
 since
 we
 became
 independent.
 Uh


we're
 going
 to
 add
 we
 added
 2,000
 last


year.
 We
 we'll
 add
 more
 this
 year.


That's
 our
 growth
 limiter.
 Believe
 it
 or


not,
 that's
 our
 growth
 limiter.
 So
 in
 in


the
 world
 of
 AI
 um
 we're
 not
 shrinking


we're
 we're
 adding
 mechanics.
 Where
 did


you
 get
 the
 idea
 of
 the
 coin?
 I
 mean


I've
 I've
 heard
 about
 that
 from
 the


army.
 Um
 yeah
 I
 was
 in
 the
 defense


business
 uh
 earlier
 in
 my
 career


aerospace
 and
 defense
 and
 I
 always
 found


it
 um
 meaningful.
 Um
 to
 me
 it's
 it's


more
 impactful
 though
 when
 you
 can
 uh
 do


it
 in
 person
 and
 with
 a
 thank
 you.
 And


it's
 only
 mechanics.
 I
 I
 the
 supervisors


look
 at
 me
 and
 they're
 like
 how
 about


me?
 And
 I'm
 like,
 "No,
 no,
 no.
 You're


part
 of
 you're
 part
 of
 the
 the


management
 team.
 Um,
 we
 we
 reward
 you


other
 ways,
 but
 it's
 just
 it's
 my
 way
 of


saying
 thank
 you."
 And
 most
 of
 our


mechanics
 are
 are
 part
 of
 uh
 are
 part


most
 of
 our
 labor
 is
 represented
 by


collective
 bargaining
 all
 over
 the


world.
 I
 know
 people
 tend
 to
 think
 of


that
 as
 a
 Europe
 ccentric
 thing.
 Uh


obviously
 we
 have
 works
 councils
 across


Europe,
 but
 our
 our
 US
 workforce
 is


represented,
 our
 Korean
 workforce,
 our


Japanese
 workforce.
 For
 us,
 it's
 the
 way


we've
 always
 done
 business.
 we
 respect


and
 and
 work
 with
 work
 this
 way
 and
 it


it
 works
 fine.
 Why
 don't
 more
 US


companies
 do
 it
 do
 work
 with
 workforce


this
 way?
 Yeah,
 I
 I
 can't
 talk
 to
 that.


Our
 our
 relationship's
 strong.
 We
 have
 a


multi-
 multi-industry
 union
 and
 uh
 and


every
 job
 whether
 it's
 installation
 or


service
 in
 the
 US
 and
 Canada
 is
 done
 by


our
 by
 our
 labor.


Moving
 on
 to
 innovation,
 what
 are
 the


most
 interesting
 innovations
 that
 you


are
 seeing
 just
 now
 in
 the
 elevator


industry?


There's
 a
 few
 uh
 I'd
 say
 the
 the
 most


interesting
 that'll
 probably
 have
 the


largest
 impact
 is
 in
 the
 world
 of


connected
 elevators.
 Um
 so
 whether
 it's


the
 IoT
 connection
 where
 we've
 got
 a


million
 of
 our
 elevators
 connected
 so
 we


have
 a
 huge
 data
 lake
 so
 that
 we
 can
 do


preventive
 and
 eventually
 prognostic


maintenance
 but
 be
 transparent.
 So
 IoT


just
 to
 so
 that's
 internet
 of
 things.


internet
 of
 things.
 It's
 it's
 the


equipment
 operation
 and
 and
 everything


being
 sent
 to
 us
 on
 a
 a
 very
 uh
 pseudo


real-time
 basis.
 I'll
 I'll
 define
 it


differently.
 You
 need
 information
 from


from
 a
 villa
 uh
 elevator
 a
 little


differently
 than
 you
 need
 it
 from
 the


Rison
 Blue
 uh
 in
 terms
 of
 the
 the
 period


periodicity
 of
 how
 often
 you
 get
 it.
 Um,


but
 it
 gives
 us
 tremendous
 information


on
 the
 elevator,
 uh,
 how
 it
 operates.


And
 not
 only
 can
 our
 mechanic
 see
 that,


our
 field
 mechanic,
 our
 Otus
 line
 help


desk
 can
 see
 it,
 and
 our
 customers
 can


see
 it.
 And
 so
 we
 give
 them
 a
 dashboard


so
 they
 can
 see
 the
 health
 status
 of


their
 equipment.
 Uh,
 but
 I
 think
 where


it's
 going
 to
 I
 know
 where
 it's
 going
 to


take
 us
 is
 the
 our
 ability
 as
 we
 do


scheduled
 maintenance
 to
 say,
 "Listen,


this
 door
 operator
 that's
 moving
 the


doors
 back
 and
 forth,
 we
 know
 at
 I'll


make
 a
 up
 a
 number
 at
 15,000
 uses,
 um,


it's
 going
 to
 either
 need
 alignment
 or


replacement.
 So,
 when
 we're
 doing


scheduled
 maintenance
 anyway
 and
 and


coming
 by
 to
 do
 all
 of
 our
 our
 scheduled


maintenance,
 we
 can
 either
 replace
 it
 or


align
 it
 before
 it
 ever
 breaks.
 And
 that


matters
 that
 that
 uptime
 matters
 to


people
 because
 people
 only
 care
 about


elevators
 when
 they're
 not
 working
 as


you
 and
 I
 know
 that's
 when
 they
 that's


when
 they
 look
 around
 they're
 like,
 "Oh


yeah,
 I'm
 in
 I'm
 in
 an
 elevator
 and
 I


and
 I
 have
 an
 issue
 or
 or
 there's
 a
 you


know
 there's
 a
 block
 and
 I
 can't
 use
 the


escalator."
 Um
 so
 for
 us
 that
 uptime
 is


is
 is
 absolutely
 critical.
 So
 but
 that


connected
 goes
 beyond
 the
 c
 our


customers.
 So
 those
 are
 property


managers,
 condominium
 service
 customers.


Um
 the
 the
 connected
 is
 going
 to
 go
 to


the
 passenger
 now.
 So
 we
 have
 apps
 on
 on


your
 phones
 where
 you
 can
 call
 the


escalator
 from
 your
 from
 your
 apartment


before
 you
 ever
 or
 the
 elevator
 before


you
 ever
 get
 to
 it.
 So
 you
 actually
 make


the
 call
 and
 it
 says,
 "Okay,
 it's
 here."


Um,
 we
 have
 many
 office
 buildings
 where


as
 you
 pass
 through
 the
 the
 the
 access


control,
 the
 turn
 style
 to
 get
 in,
 the


security
 to
 get
 in,
 it
 recognizes
 you


and
 then
 it
 tells
 you
 what
 what
 where
 to


go.
 Uh,
 and
 then
 we
 have
 we
 have
 certain


clients
 where
 not
 only
 does
 it
 uh
 tell


you
 where
 to
 go,
 but
 it
 knows
 if
 you're


going
 to
 the
 eighth
 floor
 and
 you're
 the


first
 person
 there,
 as
 you
 get
 there,
 it


turns
 on
 the
 lights
 on
 the
 floor.
 So,
 so


we're
 part
 of
 a
 building
 ecosystem.
 I


like
 to
 think
 of
 us
 as
 the
 spine.
 Um
 but


again
 when
 we
 understand
 traffic
 we
 we


we
 have
 traffic
 flow
 for
 every
 building


in
 the
 world.
 So
 it's
 a
 tremendous


amount
 of
 data
 analytics
 that
 can
 help


us.
 But
 maybe
 you
 want
 to
 choose
 your


own
 music.
 Um
 the
 other
 thing
 which


maybe
 I
 mean
 now
 they
 go
 up
 and
 down.


When
 will
 they
 start
 to
 go
 sideways?
 You


know
 I
 I'm
 not
 sure
 that
 the
 sideways


for
 an
 elevator
 is
 the
 best
 use
 of
 an


elevator.
 Um
 there's
 other
 modes
 of


transit
 that
 that
 accomplish
 this.


whether
 they're
 moving
 walkways,
 whether


they're
 things
 you've
 you've
 been
 on
 in


in
 airports
 where
 you
 have
 uh
 you
 know,


moving
 moving
 vehicles.
 Um
 I
 just
 go


back
 one
 last
 time
 to,
 you
 know,
 and


I've
 seen
 this
 now
 in
 our
 in
 our
 labs.


Um
 so
 if
 you
 think
 as
 you
 age
 and
 and


you
 need
 to
 go
 to
 a
 doctor's
 office
 and


you
 walk
 in
 the
 elevator
 and
 you
 don't


you
 don't
 recall
 what
 is
 it?
 Is
 it
 6:15?


What
 what
 I
 don't
 know
 where
 I'm
 going,


you
 can
 talk
 to
 the
 elevator
 and
 say,
 "I


need
 to
 see
 Dr.
 Dr.
 Smith."
 uh
 and
 it
 it


takes
 you
 where
 you
 need
 to
 go.
 So
 this


passenger
 experience
 is
 going
 to


continue
 to
 improve
 over
 time
 um
 and
 as


technology
 improves.
 Uh
 moving
 on
 to


leadership.
 So
 um
 Otis
 came
 out
 of
 uh
 a


conglomerate
 called
 United
 Technologies


and
 this
 happened
 during
 COVID.
 So


pretty
 challenging,
 right?
 What
 did
 you


what
 did
 you
 learn
 from
 this?
 Yeah,
 so


we
 were
 preparing
 uh
 the
 United


Technologies
 board
 in
 November
 of
 2018


decided
 that
 we
 were
 going
 to
 do
 a


three-way
 spin.
 Mhm.
 Uh,
 United


Technologies
 would
 remain
 at
 that
 time.


Um,
 we
 would
 spin
 off
 as
 Otis
 and


Carrier,
 the
 HVAC
 company,
 would
 spin


off
 as
 well,
 and
 we
 had
 a
 16-month


window
 to
 complete
 this.
 Simultaneous
 to


that,
 Nikolai,
 we
 were
 also
 uh
 from
 an


Otis
 perspective
 returning
 to
 earnings


growth.
 And
 that
 was
 our
 time
 to
 prove


that
 we
 knew
 not
 just
 how
 to
 prepare
 to


be
 an
 independent
 company,
 but
 to
 show


that
 to
 the
 world.
 So
 we
 we
 took
 2019
 to


prove
 that
 to
 prepare.
 Uh
 and
 then
 uh
 we


were
 at
 our
 industry
 uh
 investor
 day
 in


February
 at
 the
 New
 York
 Stock
 Exchange


and
 all
 excited
 for
 our
 equity
 road
 show


at
 the
 end
 of
 March
 and
 all
 of a
 sudden


the
 world
 changed
 pretty
 drastically.
 So


we
 did
 the
 equity
 road
 show
 remote.
 Uh


and
 then
 we
 we
 launched
 the
 company


midnight
 on
 April
 3rd
 right
 in
 the


middle
 of
 COVID.
 New
 York
 Stock
 Exchange


was
 remote.
 everything
 was
 remote
 and
 um


and
 we
 knew
 we
 had
 to
 go.
 We
 knew
 we


were
 going
 to
 spin.
 We
 knew
 it
 was
 the


right
 thing
 to
 do.
 We
 knew
 we
 were


prepared.
 But
 as
 you
 think
 about
 April


3rd,
 um
 closing
 the
 books
 for
 the
 first


time,
 uh
 getting
 ready
 for
 your
 first


earnings
 call,
 all
 of
 this
 first
 board


meeting
 being
 everything
 being
 remote.


Um
 it
 took
 a
 tremendous
 amount
 of


agility,
 resilience,
 and
 we
 were
 an


essential
 service.
 So
 construction


continued
 in
 parts
 of
 the
 world
 uh
 and


as
 co
 uh
 oscillated
 through
 parts
 of
 the


world
 and
 what
 we
 did
 is
 we
 took
 the


lessons
 from
 China
 which
 had
 already


gone
 through
 that
 first
 burst
 in


February
 and
 March
 and
 quickly
 moved
 it


around
 the
 world
 and
 said
 here's
 how
 you


get
 to
 customers.
 We
 had
 customers
 who


absolutely
 needed
 us,
 hospitals,


transit,
 and
 again
 back
 to
 my
 respect


for
 our
 field.
 They
 were
 out
 there
 every


day
 in
 the
 middle
 of
 this
 this
 Corona


virus
 um
 going
 to
 going
 to
 c
 hospitals


to
 make
 sure
 that
 people
 could
 be
 taken


care
 of.
 And
 that's
 that's
 kind
 of
 where


you
 see
 this
 resonance
 with
 our
 mission.


So,
 we
 had
 to
 run
 a
 business,
 we
 had
 to


lead,
 and
 we
 had
 to
 communicate.
 And
 I


was
 I
 was
 on
 from
 a
 from
 an
 apartment.


We
 were
 rebuilding
 our
 our
 condominium


and
 my
 husband
 and
 I
 were
 living
 in
 a


small
 apartment.
 I
 was
 doing
 real
 time


he
 was
 he
 was
 my
 he
 was
 my


cinematographer
 and
 we
 were
 doing
 real


time
 communication
 with
 the
 company
 um


from
 a
 from
 a
 a
 very
 vacant
 uh
 uh
 place.


As
 a
 matter
 of
 fact,
 my
 communications


person
 would
 call
 me
 and
 she'd
 say,
 "Do


you
 at least
 have
 a
 plant
 to
 put
 in
 the


background
 or
 a
 piece
 of
 artwork?"
 And
 I


said, "No,
 no,
 this
 is
 temporary."
 I


said, "Let
 this
 will
 make
 people
 listen


to
 the
 message."
 So
 we
 we
 rallied
 the


team
 uh
 and
 um
 and
 and
 got
 not
 just
 got


through
 it,
 but
 I
 would
 tell
 you
 we
 we


got
 ready
 to
 to
 thrive
 and
 accelerate.


And
 I
 remember
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 first


year
 um
 I
 I
 got
 the
 leadership
 team


together
 and
 I
 and
 I
 said,
 "Okay,
 get


ready
 to
 accelerate."
 And
 they
 said,


"Dude,
 we're
 in
 the
 middle
 of
 a
 black


swan
 event.
 I
 mean,
 we've
 never
 faced


anything
 like
 this.
 Our
 teams
 responded


incredibly
 well.
 The
 service
 business


held
 up
 well.
 It
 gave
 us
 that


resilience.
 Uh,
 I
 was
 I
 did
 not
 lay
 off


a
 single
 colleague
 during
 this
 time


period.
 We
 we
 all
 took
 we
 took
 cuts.
 We


did
 whatever
 we
 had
 to
 because
 I
 knew
 we


would
 come
 back.
 I
 didn't
 know
 when,
 but


at
 Nikolai,
 I
 knew
 we'd
 come
 back.
 And


so,
 at
 the
 end
 of
 that
 first
 year,
 I


said,
 "Get
 ready
 to
 accelerate."
 And
 I


said,
 "Because
 the
 race
 is
 going
 to


start
 again
 on
 January
 1st.
 We're
 a
 new


company
 and
 we've
 got
 to
 come
 out
 of
 the


gates
 strong."
 It's
 interesting
 how
 the


companies
 you
 know
 who
 didn't
 lay
 off


people
 came
 back
 so
 much
 stronger
 and
 we


see
 it
 in
 so
 many
 industries
 but
 um
 when


you
 uh
 so
 a
 spin
 basically
 means
 that


you
 split
 the
 company
 into
 several


pieces
 right
 so
 you
 get
 your
 own


identity
 and
 so
 on
 and
 and
 and


accountability
 totally
 and
 that
 uh
 very


often
 unleashes
 this
 incredible
 energy


right
 so
 how
 did
 you
 see
 that
 in
 Otis


what
 did
 it
 meant
 to
 what
 did
 it
 mean
 to


people
 to
 have
 to
 have
 their
 own
 kind
 of


name
 on
 the
 on
 the
 Yeah,
 they
 they
 loved


it
 and
 it's
 it's
 not
 on
 the
 door,
 right?


Our
 mechanics
 wear
 it
 totally
 on
 their


door.
 Why
 is
 it
 so
 important
 for
 people?


Um,
 I
 think
 it's
 people
 want
 to
 be
 part


of
 something
 uh
 bigger.
 They
 want
 to


understand
 purpose.
 They
 want
 to


understand
 and
 in
 our
 case,
 they
 they


resonate
 with
 how
 they
 keep
 the
 world


moving.
 Um,
 but
 I
 think
 they
 also
 want


to
 be
 appreciated.
 And
 you
 know,
 when


you're
 part
 of
 a
 conglomerate,
 uh,
 you


know,
 the
 earnings
 calls
 for
 the


conglomerate,
 you
 know,
 we
 were
 one


line.
 um
 we
 were
 one
 line
 in
 the
 in
 the


releases.
 We
 were
 one
 we
 were
 a
 oneline


segment
 so
 there
 was
 very
 little


visibility
 and
 um
 over
 time
 you
 know


that
 accountability
 if
 we
 had
 had
 a
 bad


if
 we
 had
 a
 bad
 quarter
 one
 of
 the
 other


divisions
 made
 up
 for
 it.
 You
 don't
 have


that
 there's
 nowhere
 to
 hide.
 Um
 so
 so


that
 that
 that
 that
 drive
 to
 make
 sure


everything
 we
 were
 doing
 mattered.
 We


were
 getting
 rid
 of
 of
 initiatives
 that


didn't
 matter.
 we
 weren't
 having
 to
 do


things
 that
 were
 important
 to
 someone


else
 but
 maybe
 not
 to
 Otis.
 So
 that
 that


100%
 focus
 every
 day
 on
 on
 discipline
 on


operating
 and
 on
 on
 what
 mattered
 um
 is


what
 shows
 in
 the
 results
 and
 people


people
 they
 rally.
 It's
 interesting.


There's
 a
 book
 called
 uh
 the
 power
 of
 us


and
 it's
 about
 who
 do
 you
 want
 to
 belong


to
 and
 what
 does
 it
 mean?
 What
 does
 it


mean
 to
 you?
 And
 so
 this
 is
 just
 an


example
 of
 you
 know
 you
 belong
 to


something
 which
 is
 a
 bit
 smaller
 a
 bit
 a


bit
 more
 accountable
 accountable
 and
 uh


has
 a
 big
 uh
 has
 a
 big
 effect.
 Now
 you


had
 been
 run
 you
 had
 been
 run
 inside
 you


uh
 United
 Technologies
 as
 a
 cash
 call


right
 for
 was
 it
 eight
 years
 you
 didn't


show
 earnings
 growth.
 Yeah.
 How
 how
 did


that
 how
 do
 you
 think
 that
 felt
 for


management
 to
 be
 run
 as
 a
 cash
 call?


Yeah.
 So
 I
 I
 I
 was
 not
 there
 during
 most


of
 that
 time
 but
 uh
 there
 was
 clearly
 a


view
 um
 and
 so
 we
 were
 acquired
 in
 1976.


So
 you
 think
 about
 the
 company
 formed
 in


1853.
 First
 time
 on
 the
 New
 York
 Stock


Exchange
 was
 1920
 ironically
 a
 100red


years
 before
 we
 went
 back
 almost
 the


same
 month.
 Um
 and
 and
 over
 time
 uh


Otis'
 service
 business
 was
 strong,
 but


post
 the
 GFC
 we
 were
 we
 were
 out
 of
 out


of
 sync
 with
 our
 pricing
 was
 much
 higher


than
 financial
 crisis.
 Yeah,
 sorry.


Greater
 financial
 crisis.
 Um
 so
 uh
 as


part
 of
 the
 parent
 there
 were
 two
 two


metrics
 that
 people
 were
 incentivized
 on


uh
 profit
 and
 cash
 flow
 and
 when
 you
 do


that
 and
 you
 don't
 incentivize
 on
 growth


in
 any
 organization
 uh
 you
 can
 get
 to
 a


point
 where
 you
 harvest
 a
 business
 and
 o


Otis
 was
 being
 harvested
 uh
 the
 cash


flow
 greater
 than
 1%
 or
 or
 1.0
 0
 in


terms
 of
 of
 cash
 flow
 to
 to
 net
 income.


Uh
 and
 we
 we
 maintain
 that
 now.
 We're


still
 doing
 it
 which
 which
 which
 I'm


proud
 of.
 But
 um
 but
 it
 it
 threw
 off


tremendous
 cash
 and
 that
 cash
 went
 to


the
 parent
 and
 the
 parent
 did
 the


capital
 allocation
 which
 is
 something
 we


obviously
 do
 ourselves
 now.
 As
 part
 of


that
 capital
 allocation,
 they
 had
 a
 very


significant
 investment
 they
 wanted
 to


make
 in
 a
 in
 a
 in
 other
 divisions


instead
 of
 uh
 investing
 in
 the
 elevator


business
 in
 China.
 uh
 in
 elevator


business
 in
 China
 service
 I
 mean
 our
 R&D


as
 a
 percent
 of
 sales
 during
 some
 of


those
 years
 as
 Otus
 under
 the
 parent
 was


far
 less
 than
 1%
 our
 capex
 was
 far
 less


than
 1%.
 So
 it
 was
 truly
 it
 was
 you
 know


the
 the
 even
 the
 IT
 systems
 were
 rather


antiquated
 but
 but
 those
 were
 capital


decisions
 that
 cor
 that
 a
 conglomerate


gets
 to
 make.
 So
 how
 have
 you
 what
 have


you
 in
 terms
 of
 the
 corporate
 culture
 uh


what
 have
 you
 changed
 since
 you
 took


over?
 Well,
 we've
 stayed
 uh
 we've
 stayed


true
 to
 who
 we
 are.
 We've
 um
 focused
 on


something
 we
 call
 our
 absolutes.
 Uh


other
 people
 call
 this
 um
 you
 know
 a


values
 for
 us.
 Values
 is
 an
 interesting


term,
 but
 absolutes
 really
 sets
 the
 line


that
 uh
 it's
 it's
 a
 go
 no-go.
 You
 have


to
 do
 these
 to
 be
 part
 of
 our
 company.


Uh
 safety
 was
 always
 an
 absolute
 at


Otis.
 It
 needs
 to
 be.
 Uh
 it's
 expanded


from
 physical
 safety.
 again
 people


working
 in
 dangerous
 situations
 working


at
 heights
 exposed
 to
 electricity.
 Um
 we


do
 have
 17
 manufacturing
 plants
 but


again
 the
 majority
 of
 our
 workforce
 is


in
 the
 field.
 Uh
 so
 safety
 is
 critical


and
 I
 think
 what
 we've
 seen
 over
 the


past
 few
 years
 is
 we've
 added
 to
 the


physical
 well-being
 of
 safety
 to


well-being
 in
 general.
 Uh
 we
 have
 our
 if


our
 colleagues
 don't
 have
 their
 mind
 in


their
 work
 they
 can
 get
 hurt
 uh
 or
 worse


or
 even
 worse.
 So,
 so
 safety
 is
 first.


Our
 our
 second
 absolute
 is
 ethics.
 And


for
 us,
 you
 know,
 compliance
 is


absolutely
 critical,
 but
 more


importantly,
 doing
 the
 right
 thing
 even


when
 no
 one's
 looking
 is
 critical,


especially
 when
 you're
 working
 alone.


Uh,
 and
 the
 last
 one,
 which
 which
 we


changed
 when
 I
 got
 there,
 it
 was


controls,
 which
 I
 thought
 was


interesting,
 but
 more
 not
 something
 that


all
 72,000
 colleagues
 could
 participate


in.
 And
 to
 me,
 just
 quality
 was
 the


right
 right
 third
 absolute.
 So
 we


focused
 on
 that.
 Um
 but
 we
 also
 uh


created
 a
 culture
 where
 we
 want
 every


voice
 to
 be
 heard.
 Uh
 the
 best
 ideas


come
 from
 inside
 the
 company,
 but
 they


they
 don't
 come
 from
 me.
 They
 don't
 come


from
 the
 leadership
 team.
 They
 come
 from


our
 team
 that's
 that's
 out
 with


customers,
 whether
 they're
 sales,


whether
 they're
 field.
 Uh
 and
 and
 we


want
 to
 hear
 those.
 So
 we
 wanted
 every


voice
 to
 be
 heard.
 and
 and
 we've
 created


an
 environment
 where
 the
 voices
 are


heard
 and
 every
 single
 one
 of
 our


colleagues
 has
 the
 not
 just
 the
 ability


but
 the
 responsibility
 to
 stop
 work
 if


they
 don't
 think
 that
 do
 do
 people


disagree
 with
 you
 inside
 the
 company


absolutely
 how
 do
 you
 deal
 with
 that
 uh


most
 days
 very


well
 not
 always
 I'll
 be
 honest
 um
 you


know
 I
 think
 it's
 important
 are
 they


often
 right
 oh
 yeah
 they're
 closer
 to
 it


they're
 closer
 to
 it.
 Um,
 and
 and
 you


know,
 it's
 I
 kind
 of
 think
 that
 if
 you


have
 if
 you
 decide
 everything,
 the


company
 can
 never
 be
 better
 than
 you.


Yeah.
 If
 you
 have
 the
 combination
 of
 all


types
 of
 opinions,
 you
 could
 create


incredible
 things.
 Yeah.
 It's
 amazing.


And
 um
 I
 I
 have
 a
 a
 very
 easy
 email
 and


a
 mobile
 number
 that
 that
 most
 people


have,
 whether
 they're
 inside
 the
 company


or
 outside.
 I
 get
 customer
 complaints


directly
 to
 me.
 I
 read
 all
 my
 own


emails.
 I
 don't
 nobody
 nobody
 filters


anything.
 It
 doesn't
 go
 to
 another
 box.


Um
 I
 think
 it's
 important
 to
 understand


what's
 happening.
 Um
 but
 uh
 I
 think
 you


know
 culture
 matters
 and
 in
 our
 case


there's
 this
 I
 called
 it
 humble
 pride


but
 there's
 this
 this
 this
 absolute


zealousness
 to
 make
 sure
 um
 especially


with
 our
 mechanics
 that
 things
 are
 are


put
 back
 right
 that
 that
 the
 elevators


back
 in
 operation
 as
 quick
 as
 possible.


And
 sometimes
 they
 they
 do
 this
 um


almost
 to
 an
 extreme
 where
 I'm
 like
 that


would
 be
 billable
 guys.
 I
 know
 I
 know


you
 want
 to
 get
 can
 you
 can
 you
 at least


record
 this
 for
 us
 so
 that
 we
 can
 we
 can


capture
 it
 as
 well.
 Um
 but
 but
 that's


where
 you
 again
 you
 just
 get
 these


incredible
 ideas
 on
 well
 you
 know
 if
 we


if
 we
 put
 something
 like
 this
 in
 the
 pit


you
 know
 then
 then
 we
 can
 we
 can
 make


sure
 or
 if
 we
 put
 a
 camera
 here
 or
 if
 we


did
 or
 put
 a
 sensor
 here
 you
 know
 this


this
 would
 help


what
 uh
 what's
 the
 role
 of
 a
 CEO


I
 think
 or
 roles
 roles
 yeah
 I
 think
 uh


there
 I
 think
 the
 most
 the
 two
 most


important
 roles
 in
 my
 mind
 are
 setting


strategy
 um
 and
 that's
 that's
 pivotal
 um


vision
 mission
 strategy
 but
 it's


absolutely
 about
 setting
 the
 strategy


and
 making
 sure
 everyone
 understands
 it


and
 not
 only
 understands
 it
 but
 they


believe
 in
 it
 and
 they
 execute
 it.
 Um
 so


setting
 it
 correctly
 is
 really
 important


in
 a
 long
 cycle
 business
 like
 ours.
 It


matters
 because
 that
 strategy
 can
 last


years
 and
 decades.
 Um
 risk
 management
 is


a
 key
 factor
 and
 today
 that
 that
 that


these
 enterprise
 risks
 are
 are
 are
 less


technical
 uh
 are
 less
 operational
 and


are
 more
 about
 people
 and
 then
 factors


that
 you
 have
 to
 deal
 with
 that
 you
 may


not
 control
 at
 all.
 And
 then
 I
 think
 the


last
 is
 um
 is
 just
 in
 my
 my
 case
 I
 think


it
 really
 is
 about
 getting
 to
 the
 core


of
 of
 what's
 important
 customer


centricity.
 Um
 driving
 that
 operational


discipline
 without
 me
 being
 part
 of
 it


but
 instilling
 that
 what
 matters
 so
 that


everyone
 understands
 every
 day
 what's


important.
 How
 important
 is
 storytelling


in
 this?
 Oh
 I
 think
 storytelling
 is


absolutely
 critical.
 I
 uh
 you
 know
 I'm


an
 engineer
 by
 background
 but
 that's
 not


how
 you
 talk
 to
 people.
 uh
 you
 talk
 to


them
 with
 respect
 but
 you
 have
 to


context
 everything
 and
 it's
 that
 context


whether
 it's
 with
 investors
 whether
 it's


with
 government
 officials
 whether
 it's


with
 the
 mechanics
 whether
 it's
 a
 town


hall
 I
 I
 I
 came
 before
 before
 I
 came
 to


see
 you
 earlier
 this
 week
 I
 met
 with
 our


team
 here
 in
 Oslo
 about
 20
 people
 in
 the


office
 and
 if
 I
 could
 get
 to
 20
 people


every
 day
 I
 would
 to
 tell
 them
 you
 know


here's
 what
 we're
 about
 here's
 how
 we're


doing
 and
 here's
 here's
 what
 we
 need
 to


do
 to
 grow
 and
 to
 thank
 you
 know,


there's
 there's
 your
 storyteller
 some


days,
 your
 cheerleader
 some
 days.
 Um,


because
 I
 think
 the
 CEO
 needs
 to
 be
 the


optimist.
 Um,
 and
 I
 I
 am
 an
 optimist


because
 you
 get
 to
 see
 more
 of
 the


company
 and
 more
 of
 of
 the
 business


world
 than
 anyone
 else.
 And
 if
 you
 can


synthesize
 that
 and
 tell
 that
 story


about
 whether
 it's
 the
 mega
 trends,


whether
 it's
 where
 we're
 going,
 whether


it's
 how
 we're
 performing,
 or
 to
 just


recognize
 your
 teams,
 it
 matters.


Tell
 me
 about
 the
 importance
 of
 being
 an


optimist.
 I
 mean,
 don't
 you
 think
 it's


important
 to
 point
 out
 uh
 the
 bad
 stuff?


And
 Oh,
 yeah.
 Bad
 stuff's
 easy.
 I
 mean,


you
 know,
 as
 as
 any
 leader,
 not
 just
 a


CEO,
 but
 anybody
 listening
 to
 this,
 you


know,
 most
 days
 you're
 dealing
 with


exceptions,
 right?
 Most
 people
 aren't


dealing
 with
 routine
 as
 a
 leader.
 You're


dealing
 with
 with
 either
 the
 top
 end
 of


things
 going
 right
 or
 the
 bottom
 end
 of


things
 going
 wrong.
 So,
 so
 you
 come
 in


every
 day
 and
 you
 forget
 about
 that
 80%.


You
 don't
 even
 deal
 with
 the
 80%
 in
 the


middle,
 right?
 That's
 what
 process
 takes


care
 of.
 That's
 what
 discipline
 takes


care
 of.
 That's
 what
 organizations
 below


you
 take
 care
 of.
 You're
 dealing
 with


the
 top
 and
 the
 bottom.
 Um
 I
 think
 too


many
 people
 focus
 on
 on
 the
 problems
 of


the
 day.
 Too
 many
 pe
 which
 they're
 real.


Too
 many
 people
 focus
 on
 on
 you
 know
 oh


we
 had
 this
 issue.
 So
 you're
 going
 to
 do


issue
 resolution.
 Um
 you
 need
 to
 pull


back
 and
 look
 at
 that
 top
 10
 too.
 It's


not
 just
 the
 top
 10%
 of
 the
 people
 but


what's
 going
 right.
 And
 you
 have
 to


paint
 the
 picture.
 And
 it's
 it's
 a
 valid


picture.
 It's
 not
 like
 monk.
 You
 have
 to


paint
 that
 picture
 of
 what's
 possible


because
 if
 you're
 a
 good
 leader,
 you


have
 followership
 and
 people
 will
 trust


you.
 But
 you
 have
 to
 build
 that
 trust,


Nikolai.
 And
 that
 takes
 time
 and
 takes


proof.
 Now,
 you're
 among
 a
 small
 handful


of
 female
 leaders
 in
 industrial


companies.


um
 how
 can
 you
 encourage
 more
 women
 to


go
 into
 these
 traditionally


maledominated
 areas


or
 does
 it
 not
 matter?
 I
 you
 know
 I
 I


don't
 think
 it
 matters
 if
 you're
 a
 good


leader.
 Um
 I
 I've
 been
 41
 years
 almost


42
 now
 almost
 41
 in
 industry.
 Um
 and


I've
 always
 been
 in
 male-dominated


industries.
 So
 uh
 to
 me
 this
 is
 just
 my


normal.
 Um
 I
 don't
 think
 I've


experienced
 things
 different
 than
 you


know
 if
 you're
 in
 if
 you're
 in
 retail
 or


consumer
 package
 goods
 or
 telco.
 Um
 this


is
 there
 are
 problems
 to
 be
 solved.


There
 are
 businesses
 to
 be
 led
 and
 I


would
 highly
 encourage
 women.
 I
 mean
 we


start
 very
 early
 in
 with
 STEM
 programs


with
 our
 made
 to
 move
 communities
 um


social
 program
 uh
 to
 drive
 this
 earlier


in
 school.
 I
 would
 tell
 anyone,
 girl,


boy,
 stay
 in
 math
 and
 science.
 I
 mean,


you
 know,
 it's
 the
 only
 career
 you
 you


can
 actually
 at
 at
 10
 to
 12
 years
 old,


take
 yourself
 off
 an
 entire
 future


career
 path,
 whether
 it
 be
 in
 STEM
 or


something
 else,
 by
 just
 getting
 off
 the


math
 and
 science
 path.
 Um,
 so
 I


encourage
 everyone
 to
 do
 that.
 Um,
 I
 do


care
 about
 women
 uh
 having


opportunities.
 Um,
 and
 they
 need
 to


perform,
 but
 but
 they
 can.
 And
 I
 don't


understand
 how
 some
 companies
 or
 or


other
 organizations
 would
 not
 want


access
 to
 half
 the
 world's
 talent.
 Oh,


no.
 Totally.
 And
 now,
 if
 you
 uh
 could


not
 have
 the
 job
 in
 artist,
 what
 would


you
 do?


Oh,
 you
 sound
 like
 my


husband.
 What
 are
 you
 going
 to
 do
 next,


Jude?


Um,
 boy,
 that's
 a
 great
 question.
 I
 I
 I


have
 always
 thought
 I'd
 love
 to
 to
 be


able
 to
 share
 uh
 what
 I've
 learned.
 Um,


to
 me,
 mentoring,
 coaching
 is
 important.


So,
 some
 form
 of
 that,
 whether
 it's


teaching,
 uh,
 I
 think
 I
 would
 love
 Well,


you'd
 be
 a
 great
 teacher.
 I'm
 sure
 you


can
 teach
 at
 whatever
 business
 school


you
 want.
 Uh,
 we'll
 see.
 Um,
 but
 but


right
 now,
 you
 know,
 I
 I
 uh
 I
 I'm
 not
 I


don't
 think
 about
 that.
 I
 think
 about


really
 where
 where
 we
 can
 take
 the


company.
 And
 it's
 not
 about
 me.
 It's


it's
 it's
 an
 iconic
 brand,
 Nikolai,
 that


that
 we
 really
 want
 to
 make
 an
 iconic


company.
 And
 to
 me,
 those
 are,
 you
 know,


there's
 a
 nuance
 there
 in
 terms
 of
 how


we
 perform,
 how
 we
 show
 up
 every
 day.


But,
 um,
 I
 I
 it's
 more
 than
 being
 an


optimist.
 As
 I
 look
 at
 all
 the
 data,
 we


have
 so
 much
 room
 in
 front
 of
 us
 to


grow.
 I
 I
 mean
 I
 it's
 almost
 a
 luxury
 to


have
 the
 organic
 opportunities
 we
 have


versus
 needing
 to
 get
 distracted


inorganically
 versus
 needing
 to
 go
 into


adjacent
 markets.
 And
 what's
 your
 what's


your
 inner
 drive?
 What
 is
 it
 that
 drive


you?


Wow.
 Um
 I
 I
 I'm
 extremely
 competitive.


I'm
 extremely
 impatient.
 Uh
 hopefully


some
 of
 those
 have
 have
 uh
 gotten
 a


little
 little little little
 more


softened
 over
 time
 but
 not
 not
 gone


away.
 Is
 that
 a
 person
 you
 want
 to
 show?


I
 if
 it
 is
 I
 don't
 know.
 Um
 you
 know


just
 show
 the
 world.
 Yeah.
 Just
 make
 a


difference.
 Yeah.
 Make
 a
 difference.
 Um


and
 it
 is
 personal.
 It's
 very
 personal.


Um,
 I
 care
 very
 deeply
 and
 uh
 when
 we


when
 we
 don't
 perform
 to
 the
 level
 we


should,
 I'm
 the
 first
 to
 admit
 it.
 Uh,
 I


got
 on
 every
 quarter,
 the
 day
 after


earnings,
 I
 talked
 to
 our
 top
 500


leaders.
 Uh,
 and
 um,
 there
 was
 something


that
 that
 I
 was
 that
 we
 missed
 this
 last


quarter
 that
 we
 didn't
 do
 as
 well
 as
 we


should
 have.
 Uh,
 let's
 put
 it
 that
 way.


And
 it
 it
 will
 get
 addressed.
 Um,
 but
 I


was
 the
 first
 to
 say
 to
 these,
 you
 know,


I
 own
 it.


M
 I
 underestimated
 the
 impact
 of
 change


and
 I
 and
 and
 we'll
 deal
 with
 it.
 When


do
 you
 wake
 up
 in
 the
 morning?
 I
 wake
 up


early
 around
 5:00
 a.m.
 uh
 most
 mornings.


And
 what
 do
 you
 do
 when
 you
 wake
 up?
 Uh


first
 is
 is
 um
 be
 available
 and
 look
 at


what's
 happened
 in
 in
 in
 Asia
 uh
 and


Asia
 at
 large,
 whether
 it's
 our


Asia-Pacific
 business
 or
 China.
 Uh
 my


team
 there
 knows
 anytime
 after
 5,
 they


can
 quickly
 send
 a
 text
 if
 I'm
 if
 they


need
 to
 talk
 to
 me.
 uh
 they
 try
 to
 give


me
 kind
 of
 that
 freedom
 of
 sleep
 a
 uh


otherwise
 you
 this
 is
 such
 a
 global


business
 you'd
 never
 sleep
 uh
 I'm
 a


morning
 person
 though
 uh
 a
 few
 times
 a


week
 I
 go
 do
 a
 kind
 of
 highintensity


workout
 when
 I'm
 in
 when
 I'm
 when
 I'm
 at


least
 in
 the
 states
 so
 hopefully


hopefully
 home
 uh
 I'm
 not
 home
 much
 um


because
 the
 the
 only
 way
 to
 see
 this


business
 is
 to
 be
 with
 it
 in
 the
 markets


we're
 in
 uh
 80%
 of
 our
 workforce
 is


outside
 the
 US
 um
 because
 we're
 We're


you
 you'll
 see
 us
 in
 every
 town,
 every


city.
 Um
 and
 part
 of
 my
 responsibility


is
 to
 be
 there.
 So,
 and
 to
 be
 with
 our


teams,
 be
 with
 our
 customers,
 be
 with


the
 governments,
 and
 uh
 make
 sure
 we


understand
 where
 the
 markets
 are


heading.
 And
 again,
 be
 there
 to
 thank


our
 teams.
 If
 you
 were
 stuck
 in
 a
 lift


with
 a
 historic
 figure,
 who
 would
 it
 be?


Well,
 I'm
 convinced
 since
 I
 have
 a


picture
 of
 him
 staring
 at
 me
 in
 my


office,
 it
 would
 be
 Elijah
 Otis.
 Um


because
 come
 on,
 somebody
 else.


Unrelated
 to
 the
 company.
 own
 related
 to


the
 company.
 Wow,
 that's
 a
 tough


question.


Um,
 who
 would
 it
 be?
 I
 I
 think
 it
 would


be
 it
 would
 have
 to


be
 maybe
 maybe
 Ben
 Franklin
 because
 I


think
 of
 him
 as
 kind
 of the
 original


innovator
 uh
 and
 yet
 someone
 who


accomplished
 a
 lot
 in
 his
 life
 and
 he


had
 some
 incredible
 values.
 He
 did
 and


integrity.
 He
 did
 and
 he
 had
 longevity.


So,
 maybe
 maybe
 all
 of
 it
 worked.


Absolutely.
 How
 do
 you
 relax?


Uh
 I'm
 not
 good
 at
 relaxing.
 Um
 and


there's
 not
 a
 lot
 of
 time
 for
 it.
 Um


what
 do
 you
 read
 if
 you
 you
 know
 I
 read


I
 read
 uh
 I
 try
 to
 read
 u
 books
 on


leadership.
 I
 try
 to
 read
 books
 on


because
 we
 can
 all
 and
 we
 need
 to
 all


learn.
 Uh
 if
 you
 have
 a
 CEO
 sitting


across
 from
 you
 that
 doesn't
 think


they're
 still
 in
 a
 learning
 mode.
 Uh
 I


would
 tell
 you
 you
 know
 that's
 uh
 then


then
 they're
 they're
 going
 to
 become


stagnant.
 Um
 in
 today's
 world
 there's


just
 just
 more
 to
 more
 to
 learn.
 I'm


right
 now
 I'm
 reading
 this
 book
 called


Radical
 Uncertainty.
 Uh
 and
 um
 you
 know


I
 probably
 wouldn't
 have
 read
 this


before.
 I
 I
 joke
 with
 I
 was
 we
 were
 the


other
 night
 together
 and
 and
 I
 I
 said
 to


Adena
 Freriedman,
 the
 CEO
 of
 NASDAQ,
 I


said,
 "I
 thought
 we
 only
 got
 to


experience
 one
 black
 swan
 as
 a
 CEO."
 Um


so
 these
 are
 interesting
 times,
 but


times
 of
 opportunity.
 Uh
 this
 book
 is


more
 focused
 on
 on
 what
 uncertainty
 can


be
 predicted
 and
 what
 can't.
 And
 you


know
 as
 CEOs
 we
 talk
 a
 lot
 about
 control


what
 we
 can
 control
 and
 I
 absolutely


believe
 that
 the
 question
 is
 defining


what
 we
 can
 control
 and
 what
 I'm
 trying


to
 get
 out
 of
 this
 book
 is
 is
 there
 more


I
 can
 control
 that
 I
 just
 am
 not


thinking
 about


now
 we
 got
 tens
 of
 thousands
 of
 young


people
 listening
 to
 this
 podcast.
 What


what
 advice
 would
 you
 give
 them?
 Oh
 I


I'd
 give
 them
 um
 the
 same
 advice
 I'd


give
 myself
 at
 a
 younger
 age.
 Um
 you
 can


do
 anything.
 Um,
 you
 know,
 I
 think
 about


just
 just
 how
 how
 fortunate
 I
 am
 every


day.
 Uh,
 to
 to
 be
 leading
 such
 an
 an


amazing
 business,
 but
 to
 be
 h
 able
 to


have
 an
 impact.
 Um,
 so
 I
 would
 tell
 them


uh
 stay
 in
 math
 and
 science.
 I
 would


tell
 them
 whether
 you're
 going
 to
 be
 a


business,
 you
 know,
 a
 business
 person
 or


not,
 I
 I
 would
 tell
 them
 be
 true
 to
 your


values.
 Understand
 your
 own
 personal


values.
 I
 think
 that's
 really
 critical.


where's
 the
 line
 that
 you
 won't
 cross?


Uh
 I
 would
 tell
 them
 think
 about
 uh


especially
 a
 younger
 me,
 think
 about


taking
 more
 risk
 at
 a
 younger
 age,
 but


know
 the
 risk
 you're
 taking.
 Um
 and
 and


have
 fun.
 I
 mean,
 that's
 what
 it's
 all


about.
 Well,
 that's
 a
 list
 of
 very
 good


uh
 pieces
 of
 advice.
 So,
 um
 uh
 big
 thank


you
 for
 uh
 you
 know,
 moving
 moving
 us


all
 around
 the
 world,
 you
 know,
 2.4


billion
 people
 a
 day.
 um
 and
 for


creating
 so
 much
 value
 for
 shareholders


and
 also
 for
 being
 such
 a
 tremendous


role
 model
 for
 for
 leaders
 around
 the


world.
 No,
 thanks.
 Thank
 you.
 Thank
 you.
