[Music]


hi
 everyone
 I'm
 Nikolai
 tangan
 the
 COO


of
 the
 Norwegian
 Sovereign
 wealth
 fund


and
 today
 I'm
 thrilled
 to
 welcome
 Dan


pink
 who
 is
 written
 seven
 New
 York
 Times


bestsellers
 he's
 done
 groundbreaking


work
 on
 the
 power
 of
 regret
 work


creativity
 behaviors
 and
 so
 on
 and
 so


today
 we'll
 talk
 mainly
 about
 regret


drive
 and
 timing
 like
 when
 so
 welcome


Dan
 thank
 you
 thank
 you
 great
 to
 be
 here


you're
 great
 so
 your
 latest
 book
 um
 the


power
 regret
 explores
 that
 we
 should


kind
 of
 learn
 from
 our
 regrets
 now
 My


Philosophy
 has
 always
 been
 to
 kind
 of


try
 to
 learn
 from
 it
 and
 move
 on
 but
 you


think
 a
 bit
 differently
 no
 I
 think


that's
 I
 think
 we're
 we're
 actually


we're
 actually
 fairly
 close
 what
 I'm


really
 pushing
 back
 against
 is
 this
 idea


especially
 here
 in
 America
 where
 people


say
 I
 don't
 have
 any
 regrets
 everything


happens
 for
 a
 reason
 that
 the
 path
 to
 a


life
 well-
 lived
 is
 to
 be
 positive
 all


the
 time
 never
 be
 negative
 to
 always


look
 forward
 never
 look
 back
 and
 that
 is


profoundly
 bad
 advice
 what
 what
 would


you
 want
 to
 kind
 of
 uh
 write
 about
 this


I
 had
 regrets


of
 my
 own
 such
 as
 um
 well
 I
 mean
 the


catalyzing
 moment
 was
 when
 my
 our
 elder


daughter
 graduated
 from
 University
 and
 I


was
 sitting
 in
 this
 very
 large


Auditorium
 and
 I
 was
 having
 this
 kind
 of


the
 outof
 body
 experience
 that
 many


parents
 have
 where
 you
 see
 a
 kid
 and
 you


think
 like
 just
 yesterday
 this
 22y
 old


woman
 was
 two
 years
 old
 how
 did
 this


happen
 and
 then
 internally
 I
 thought
 how


is
 it
 possible
 for
 me
 to
 have
 a


22-year-old
 kid
 when
 I'm
 like
 only
 25


myself
 and
 it
 just
 didn't
 compute
 and
 I


started
 thinking
 about
 that
 I
 real
 I


started
 thinking
 about
 my
 own
 college


experience
 and
 I
 had
 some
 regrets
 about


my
 own
 college
 experience
 um
 I
 wish
 I


had
 taken
 more
 risks
 wish
 I
 had
 been


Kinder
 wish
 I
 had
 worked
 harder
 and
 when


I
 came
 back
 to
 to
 Washington
 where
 I


live
 after
 this
 graduation
 I
 knew
 that


nobody
 wanted
 to
 talk
 about
 regrets
 I


was
 really
 conscious
 of
 my
 regrets
 at


that
 time
 because
 of
 this
 marker
 in
 my


life
 but
 I
 knew
 that
 nobody
 wanted
 to


talk
 about
 regrets
 and
 and
 why
 is
 that


you
 know
 it's
 it's
 one
 of
 the
 most


popular
 tattoo
 I'm
 not
 very
 into
 tattoos


but
 supposedly
 it's
 one
 of
 the
 most


popular
 tattoos
 no
 regrets
 but
 because


the
 tattoo
 the
 tattoo
 is
 BS
 the
 tattoo


is
 the
 tattoo
 is
 performance
 art
 uh
 when


I
 came
 back
 thinking
 that
 nobody
 wanted


to
 talk
 about
 regrets
 and
 I
 talked
 about


my
 own
 regrets
 I
 discovered
 that


everybody
 wanted
 to
 talk
 about
 their


regrets
 that
 everybody
 had
 these
 regrets


they
 were
 just
 looking
 for
 the


opportunity
 so
 what
 we
 had
 what


basically
 what's
 happened
 Nikolai
 is


that
 we've
 been
 sold
 especially
 here
 in


America
 and
 I
 think
 that
 there
 is


something
 this
 no
 regrets
 philosophy
 is


distinctly
 American
 because
 I
 think


Americans
 are
 over
 indexed
 on
 positivity


Scandinavians
 they
 understand
 negativity


well
 we
 are
 dark
 yes
 precisely
 you


understand
 negativity
 and
 so
 what
 I'm


saying
 what
 we
 know
 empirically
 this
 is


not
 a
 philosophy
 what
 we
 know
 from


science
 is
 that
 the
 path
 to
 a
 good
 life


is
 to
 be
 positive
 most
 of
 the
 time
 but


not
 all
 the
 time
 to
 look
 forward
 a
 lot


of
 the
 time
 but
 not
 all
 the
 time
 and
 so


what
 I'm
 trying
 to
 do
 is
 recalibrate
 our


understanding
 of
 this
 emotion
 because
 if


we
 interrogate
 if
 we
 understand
 it
 if
 we


scrutinize
 it
 if
 we
 listen
 to
 our


regrets
 it
 leads
 us
 to
 a
 better
 life
 but


it's
 Universal
 you
 say
 it's
 particularly


in
 America
 but
 it's
 Universal
 right
 it's


all
 over
 the
 place
 regret
 itself
 is


universal
 absolutely
 the
 response
 to


regret
 there's
 no
 regrets
 all
 positive


all
 the
 time
 is
 uniquely
 American
 but


regret
 is
 one
 of
 the
 most
 common


emotions
 that
 human
 beings
 have


regardless
 of
 your
 nationality
 in


particular
 investors
 I
 think
 right
 we


regret
 all
 kind
 of
 things
 we
 did
 and
 the


things
 we
 didn't
 do
 and
 yeah
 so
 so
 so


that's
 interesting
 you
 have
 something


called
 counteract
 ual
 thinking
 what
 is


that
 yeah
 well
 counterfactual
 thinking


is
 the
 is
 one
 of
 the
 great
 superpowers


of
 our
 brains
 and
 it
 underlies
 our


ability
 to
 experience
 regret
 it
 so
 when


we
 go
 look
 backward
 in
 time
 and
 imagine


a
 scenario
 that
 runs
 counter
 to
 the


actual
 facts
 um
 and
 it
 is
 an
 incredible


cognitive
 capacity
 it's
 one
 reason
 why


5-year-olds
 don't
 have
 regrets
 because


they
 can't
 do
 counterfactual
 thinking


and
 so
 it's
 part
 of
 what
 makes
 us
 so
 how


does
 that
 work
 for
 an
 investor
 then
 how


can
 an
 investor
 use
 that
 well
 it
 depends


I
 so
 I
 Think
 It's
 Tricky
 with
 an


investor
 because
 you
 can
 so
 you
 can
 go


back
 and
 look
 at
 a
 you
 can
 go
 back
 and


look
 at
 a
 decision
 that
 you
 made
 right


and
 you
 can
 evaluate
 it
 in
 two
 different


ways
 for
 an
 investor
 and
 other
 kinds
 of


things
 as
 well
 you
 can
 you
 can
 evaluate


it
 based
 on
 the
 actual
 outcome
 and
 I


think
 that's
 dangerous
 I
 think
 what
 you


should
 need
 should
 do
 is
 evaluate
 it


based
 on
 what
 you
 knew
 at
 the
 time
 what


what
 you
 knew
 at
 the
 time
 and
 was
 this
 a


good
 decision
 at
 the
 time
 you
 can
 say


you
 know
 I'm
 going
 to
 um
 I
 I
 I
 put
 uh
 $2


million
 in
 in
 um
 in
 a
 crypto
 fund


because
 it
 seemed
 like
 the
 thing
 to
 do


and
 maybe
 it
 worked
 out
 but
 it
 might
 not


that
 might
 not
 have
 been
 a
 good
 decision


at
 the
 time
 it
 could
 have
 been
 that
 you


you
 put
 $2
 million
 into
 some
 other
 kind


of
 fund
 and
 it
 was
 a
 smart
 decision
 at


the
 time
 and
 it
 hasn't
 worked
 out
 or


hasn't
 worked
 out
 yet
 so
 you
 have
 to


scrutinize
 the
 decision
 itself
 rather


than
 the
 outcome
 so
 Howard
 Marx
 is


talking
 a
 lot
 about
 that
 that
 we
 should


be
 careful
 judging
 a
 decision
 on
 the
 on


the
 outcome
 um
 Annie
 Duke
 who's
 been
 on


your
 show
 has
 talked
 about
 this
 inde
 she


talks
 about
 people
 being
 outcom
 ISS
 uh


and
 and
 how
 that's
 the
 dangerous
 way
 to


to
 to
 make
 to
 evaluate
 decisions
 yeah


okay
 you
 mentioned
 that
 there
 are
 uh


several
 types
 of
 regrets
 I
 think
 you


divide
 them
 into
 four
 and
 one
 is
 the


foundation
 regret
 right
 the
 fact
 that


you
 didn't
 work
 harder
 uh
 yeah
 well
 you


work
 hard
 you
 you
 did
 a
 law
 degree
 at


Yale
 so
 you
 must
 have
 very
 hard
 but
 but


the
 yeah
 so
 so
 so
 just
 to
 give
 it
 just


to
 give
 some
 context
 to
 this
 what
 I
 did


is
 I
 I
 did
 a
 uh
 I
 gathered
 regrets
 from


people
 all
 over
 the
 world
 I
 put
 an


online
 survey
 uh
 qualitative
 piece
 of


research
 and
 we
 now
 have
 a
 database
 of


regrets
 from
 about
 26,000
 people
 in
 134


countries
 so
 it's
 it's
 pretty
 remarkable


and
 around
 the
 world
 it
 seemed
 people


had
 the
 same
 four
 core
 regrets
 one
 of


them
 was
 this
 regret
 that
 I
 call
 a


foundational
 regret
 which
 is
 actually


it's
 interesting
 because
 I
 think
 there's


a
 financial
 component
 to
 it
 it's
 small


decisions
 people
 make
 early
 in
 life
 no


single
 one
 of
 which
 is
 cataclysmic
 but


that
 leads
 to
 terrible
 consequences


later
 on
 and
 so
 the
 classic
 one
 is
 I


spent
 too
 much
 and
 saved
 too
 little
 and


now
 I'm
 broke
 so
 this
 is
 like
 the
 like


like
 like
 the
 marshmallow
 test
 right


that
 a
 little
 bit
 yeah
 okay
 so
 people


are
 good
 at
 deferring
 you
 know
 you


rather
 party
 than
 doing
 your
 homework
 a


little
 bit
 a
 little
 bit
 I
 mean
 in
 the


book
 The
 the
 example
 I
 use
 is
 the
 famous


Fable
 of
 the
 the
 grasshopper
 and
 the
 Ant


yeah
 uh
 yeah
 and
 so
 and
 so
 but
 it


doesn't
 reallyand
 I
 think
 one
 of
 the


interesting
 things
 about
 regret
 is


what's
 going
 on
 underneath
 the
 surface


so
 it's
 not
 about
 financial
 regrets
 it's


about
 not
 doing
 the
 work
 in
 in
 in
 the


short
 term
 that
 pays
 off
 in
 the
 long


term
 so
 it
 could
 be
 things
 like
 health
 I


ate
 too
 much
 I
 didn't
 eat
 right
 and
 I


didn't
 exercise
 and
 now
 I'm
 profoundly


healthy
 uh
 I
 didn't
 treat
 my
 kids
 well


and
 now
 I'm
 aange
 for
 them
 so
 it
 could


be
 thing
 it
 could
 be
 things
 like


basically
 small
 decisions
 that


accumulate
 early
 it's
 like
 that
 old
 the


Hemingway
 line
 where
 these
 two


characters
 are
 talking
 and
 one
 guy
 says


the
 American
 guy
 says
 um
 I
 went
 bankrupt


and
 the
 guy
 says
 how'd
 you
 go
 bankrupt


and
 he
 says
 two
 ways
 gradually
 then


suddenly
 and
 that's
 how
 that's
 how


people
 experience
 these
 regrets


absolutely
 well
 we
 can
 talk
 about
 budget


deficits
 perhaps
 another
 time
 but
 okay


boldness
 regrets
 well
 I
 mean
 budget


deficits
 are
 the
 ant
 in
 the
 grasshopper


right
 there
 it's
 just
 that
 it's
 just


that
 the
 the
 the
 the
 the
 Reckoning
 the


winter
 seems
 to
 be
 endlessly
 deferred
 in


that
 case
 yeah
 boldness
 boldness
 um
 very


common
 regret
 and
 I
 think
 a
 really


interesting
 one
 about
 the
 Human


Condition
 you're
 at
 a
 juncture
 in
 your


life
 you
 can
 play
 it
 safe
 or
 you
 can


take
 the
 chance
 and
 overwhelmingly


people
 regret
 not
 taking
 the
 chance
 U


much
 more
 than
 even
 people
 who
 took
 a


chance
 and
 it
 doesn't
 work
 out
 for
 them


um
 it's
 not
 taking
 the
 chance
 and
 again


it's
 not
 domain


specific
 uh
 I
 stayed
 in
 this
 deadend
 job


instead
 of
 starting
 a
 business
 because
 I


was
 too
 scared
 I
 didn't
 ask
 somebody
 out


on
 a
 date
 I
 didn't
 travel
 I'm
 at
 a


juncture
 in
 my
 life
 play
 it
 safe
 take


the
 chance
 and
 when
 people
 don't
 take


the
 chance
 not
 all
 the
 time
 but


overwhelmingly
 they
 regret
 not
 taking


when
 should
 you
 have
 been
 more
 bold
 when


should
 I
 have
 been
 more
 bold
 oh
 I
 should


not
 I
 should
 have
 been
 more
 bold
 about


my
 My
 overall
 education
 choices
 uh
 I
 uh


going
 to
 law
 school
 was
 an


quintessential
 Act
 of
 timidity
 not


boldness
 uh
 what
 I
 should
 have
 done
 is


followed
 what
 I
 was
 really
 interested
 in


and
 and
 today
 I
 would
 be
 I
 would
 I
 don't


know
 what
 I
 would
 be
 but
 I
 would
 not
 be


I
 would
 not
 have
 taken
 that
 detour
 uh


into
 law
 school
 that's
 that's
 one
 that's


one
 example
 I
 think
 about
 it
 even
 now
 in


my
 professional
 life
 like
 literally
 is
 a


gender
 difference
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 bold


interesting
 um
 it's
 unclear
 that's
 an


interesting
 question
 it's
 it's
 unclear


did
 another
 piece
 of
 quantitative


research
 where
 in
 of
 an
 American
 sample


looking
 for
 gender
 differences
 and


um
 um
 there
 weren't
 that
 many
 uh
 there


is
 some
 research
 on
 it's
 a
 it's
 my
 most


popular
 footnote
 I've
 ever
 written
 it
 in


this
 in
 this
 book
 it's
 it's
 on
 sexual


regrets
 and
 essentially
 what
 it
 comes


down
 to
 to
 your
 point
 is
 that
 is
 that


men
 tend
 to
 regret
 the
 people
 they


didn't
 sleep
 with
 and
 women
 tend
 to


regret
 the
 people
 they
 did
 sleep
 with
 so


this
 seems
 like
 there
 might
 be
 a


difference
 in
 boldness
 regrets
 based
 on


gender
 but
 I
 don't
 think
 I
 don't
 have


enough
 data
 to
 say
 that
 with
 any


certainty
 no
 what
 about
 um
 leadership
 so


it's
 interesting
 you
 know
 we've
 had
 a


lot
 of
 CEOs
 on
 this
 uh
 podcast
 and


several
 of
 them
 say
 they
 have
 no


boldness
 they
 have
 they
 have
 no
 feir


Gene
 what
 do
 you
 mean
 well
 they
 never


they
 never
 oh
 fear
 oh
 no
 no
 no
 fear
 Gene


um
 you
 know
 what
 fear
 is
 a
 valuable


motion
 to
 have
 you
 know
 um
 again
 you


don't
 want
 to
 over
 index
 on
 fear
 but
 you


want
 to
 have
 a
 little
 bit
 it's
 like
 it's


like
 all
 these
 emotions
 you
 want
 to
 have


here
 you
 go
 like
 like
 there's
 a


portfolio
 theory
 of
 emotions
 you
 realize


it's
 like
 you
 want
 to
 have
 more
 positive


emotions
 than
 negative
 emotions
 but
 you


don't
 want
 to
 have
 a
 portfolio
 that's


only
 positive
 emotions
 you
 actually


you're
 come
 on
 you
 want
 investors
 to


have
 a
 little
 fear
 no
 totally
 you
 know


what
 I
 mean
 so
 so
 if
 if
 you
 have
 a
 no


fear
 Gene
 you're
 probably
 uh
 my
 hunch
 is


that
 in
 general
 the
 no
 fear
 Gene
 has


been
 not
 completely
 edited
 out
 of
 the


population
 but
 has
 been
 diminished


because
 people
 with
 no
 fear
 aren't


around
 to
 pass
 on
 their
 dream
 you
 want
 a


little
 fear
 you
 don't
 want
 you
 want
 a


little
 fear
 just
 as
 you
 want
 a
 little


regret
 you
 want
 a
 little
 sadness
 you


want
 a
 little
 grief
 you
 want
 in
 your


portfolio
 of
 emotions
 you
 want
 some
 of


this
 stuff
 that
 is
 unpleasant
 yeah
 what


about
 moral
 kind
 of
 the
 goodness
 side
 of


things
 um
 you're
 at
 a
 juncture
 in
 your


life
 you
 can
 do
 the
 right
 thing
 you
 can


do
 the
 wrong
 thing
 and
 I
 have
 found
 in


just
 in
 my
 26,000
 people
 overwhelmingly


when
 people
 do
 the
 wrong
 thing
 most
 of


us
 most
 of
 the
 time
 regret
 it
 um
 we


still
 do
 it
 but
 a
 lot
 of
 of
 us
 regret
 it


because
 I
 think
 I
 think
 generally
 most


of
 us
 are
 good
 and
 want
 to
 be
 good
 and


feel
 crappy
 when
 we're
 not
 good


connection
 about
 relationships
 not
 only


romantic
 relationships
 just


relationships
 that
 were
 intact
 should


have
 been
 intact
 they
 come
 apart
 you


want
 to
 reach
 out
 you
 don't
 and
 then
 you


regret
 it
 m
 uh
 and
 and
 what's


interesting
 about
 a
 lot
 of
 these


relationships


is
 the
 way
 that
 a
 lot
 of
 relationships


come
 apart
 and
 this
 full
 spectrum
 of


relationships
 not
 only
 romantic


relationships
 but
 relationships
 with


friends
 with
 siblings
 with
 parents
 is


that
 it's
 undramatic
 they
 drift
 apart


they
 don't
 sometimes
 they
 do
 that
 but


many
 cases
 they
 drift
 apart
 this
 person


wants
 to
 reach
 out
 they
 say
 oh
 man
 I


haven't
 talked
 to
 Nikolai
 for
 like
 five


years
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 really
 awkward
 if


I
 reach
 out
 and
 he's
 not
 going
 to
 care


but
 there's
 often
 a
 reason
 why
 you
 drift


apart
 right
 you
 come
 back
 to
 your


reunion
 your
 30
 year
 reunion
 or
 whatever


and
 you
 think
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 great
 fun


and
 then
 pretty
 quickly
 you
 understand


why
 why
 you
 don't
 meet
 up
 every
 day
 in


some
 cases
 yes
 and
 some
 so
 the
 thing
 is


like
 you
 don't
 have
 regrets
 about
 that


you
 don't
 you
 don't
 have
 a
 regret
 about


relationships
 that
 that
 that
 drifted


apart
 and
 you
 don't
 care
 about
 if
 you


drift
 apart
 from
 someone
 you
 say
 oh
 I


haven't
 talked
 to
 Fred
 for
 30
 years
 I


don't
 I
 don't
 I
 don't
 care
 one
 bit


that's
 not
 a
 regret
 that
 might
 be
 a
 wise


decision
 but
 there
 are
 many
 instances
 in


our
 lives
 particularly
 with
 friendships


where
 we
 do
 regret
 drifting
 apart
 and
 I


have
 several
 people
 in
 the
 book


who
 you
 know
 based
 on
 even
 my
 interviews


with
 them
 started
 changing
 the
 story
 by


like
 reaching
 out
 to
 people
 who
 they
 had


hadn't
 reached
 out
 to
 before
 now
 you
 say


you
 should
 tell
 people
 about
 your


regrets
 right
 yeah
 um
 why
 a
 couple
 of


reasons
 number
 one
 it's
 an
 unburdening


of
 of
 sorts
 uh
 that
 there
 is
 there's


some
 evidence
 that
 when
 we
 uh
 it's
 sort


of
 a
 lifting
 of
 the
 weight
 of
 your


shoulders
 but
 I
 think
 there's
 a
 more


important
 one
 with
 more
 important
 reason


than
 simply
 the
 unburdening
 and
 it's


this
 it's
 a
 there's
 a
 sensemaking


function
 we
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 evidence
 about


this
 um
 when
 people
 uh
 write
 about
 their


regrets
 or
 talk
 about
 their
 regrets


there's
 a
 transformation
 that
 occurs


regret
 like
 all
 negative
 emotions
 is


Blobby
 it's
 amorphous
 it's
 vaporous
 when


we
 write
 about
 them
 or
 talk
 about
 them


we
 convert
 that
 vapor
 into
 words
 which


are
 concrete
 and
 those
 are
 less
 menacing


and
 we
 can
 scrutinize
 them
 we
 can


analyze
 them
 we
 can
 interrogate
 them
 so


I
 think
 there's
 a
 there's
 a
 there's
 a


very
 strong
 uh
 uh
 argument
 for
 doing


that
 what's
 more
 you
 mentioned


leadership
 before
 we
 we
 make
 a


forcasting
 error
 sometimes
 when
 we
 say


if
 we
 talk
 about
 our
 mistakes
 or
 our


vulnerabilities
 people
 will
 think
 less


of
 us
 and
 in
 many
 cases
 not
 all
 but
 in


many
 cases
 they
 actually
 think
 more
 of


us
 they
 admire
 our
 cander
 they
 admire


our
 courage
 well
 nobody
 likes
 perfect


people
 that's
 true
 too
 I
 mean
 that's
 a


more
 parsimonious
 explanation
 why
 do
 we


try
 to
 be
 perfect
 but
 nobody
 likes
 us
 if


we
 perfect
 uh
 because
 we're
 making
 a


we're
 making
 a
 forecasting
 error
 I
 mean


truly
 it's
 like
 I
 mean
 human
 beings
 are


a
 washing
 in
 all
 kinds
 of
 predictive


errors
 about
 first
 of
 all
 they
 they
 make


they
 they
 make
 the
 the
 biggest
 error
 is


that
 they
 think
 people
 are
 watching
 them


and
 care
 about
 them
 much
 more
 than
 is


than
 is
 nobody's
 nobody's
 watching
 you


nobody
 and
 people
 only
 care
 about


themselves
 I
 give
 you
 I'll
 that
 is
 one


of
 my
 most
 profound
 forget
 about
 writing


a
 research
 as
 a
 as
 a
 lived
 experience


that
 is
 one
 of
 the
 most
 transformative


things
 that
 ever
 happened
 to
 me
 is
 when


probably
 in
 my
 late
 20s
 early
 30s
 I


basically
 stopped
 caring
 about
 what


other
 people
 thought
 of
 me
 because
 I


discovered
 that
 they
 weren't
 thinking


about
 me
 they
 were
 thinking
 about


themselves
 what
 are
 the
 implications
 of


of
 that
 finding
 the
 fact
 that
 nobody


really
 thinks
 about
 us
 we
 should
 do
 what


we
 think
 is
 the
 right
 thing
 to
 do
 what


moves
 us
 what
 we
 care
 about
 um
 and
 not


not
 uh
 uh
 construct
 our
 lives
 around


what
 other
 people
 how
 how
 other
 people


are
 going
 to
 evaluate
 us
 and
 so
 I
 think


that
 it
 leads
 to
 I
 think
 it
 leads
 to


Greater
 boldness
 I
 think
 it
 can
 lead
 to


Greater
 authenticity
 I
 think
 it
 can
 lead


at
 the
 at
 the
 individual
 level
 to


Greater
 to
 Greater
 happiness
 there
 are
 a


lot
 of
 people
 who
 are
 there
 is
 some
 sort


of
 latent
 evidence
 in
 some
 of
 the
 regret


research
 that
 what
 PE
 a
 regret
 that


people
 have
 is
 leading
 someone
 else's


life
 rather
 than
 leading
 their
 own
 life


okay
 I
 love
 it
 so
 to
 the
 listeners
 just


don't
 think
 about
 what
 people
 think
 just


do
 what
 the
 heck
 you
 want
 again
 a
 little


bit
 again
 I'm
 not
 the
 world
 is
 not


binary


nickel
 the
 like
 you
 want
 to
 think
 about


I
 mean
 you
 know
 you
 want
 to
 care
 at
 some


level
 about
 what
 people
 think
 but
 you


don't
 want
 to
 you
 don't
 want
 to
 you


don't
 want
 to
 over
 index
 on
 that
 but
 um


but
 I
 I
 think
 it's
 important
 to
 figure


you
 know
 it's
 it's
 a
 lifelong
 Quest
 it's


not
 like
 I
 figured
 it
 out
 at
 age
 60
 uh


who
 am
 I
 what
 am
 I
 about
 who
 do
 I
 care


about
 who
 do
 I
 love
 what
 contribution
 do


I
 want
 to
 make
 the
 world
 um
 that's
 not


an
 that's
 it's
 not
 like
 like
 God
 or
 or


Darwin
 delivers
 that
 answer
 to
 you
 in
 a


little
 box
 it's
 something
 that
 you
 spend


your
 life
 moving
 toward
 yeah
 one
 um
 kind


of
 last
 fun
 thing
 from
 the
 book
 I


thought
 was
 that
 you
 uh
 photograph
 uh


the
 Olympic
 uh
 kind
 of
 Champions
 right


the
 gold
 medal
 winners
 are
 really
 happy


and
 the
 bronze
 people
 really
 happy
 the


silver
 people
 not
 happy
 what's
 that


about
 well
 it's
 interesting
 this
 is
 a


really
 interesting
 piece
 of
 so
 I
 mean


you
 know
 you
 have
 a
 background
 in
 social


psychology
 this
 is
 one
 of
 those
 very


provocative
 findings
 in
 social


psychology
 that
 has
 been
 replicated


multiple
 times
 so
 uh
 it's
 it's
 it
 goes


back
 to
 counterfactual
 thinking
 there


are
 two
 kinds
 of
 counterfactual
 thinking


we
 can
 do
 we
 can
 do
 a
 downward


counterfactual
 and
 an
 upward


counterfactual
 right
 an
 upward


counterfactual
 is
 when
 we
 imagine
 how


things
 could
 have
 been
 better
 upward


counterfactuals
 that's
 regret
 they
 make


us
 feel
 worse
 but
 they
 can
 help
 us
 do


better
 downward
 counterfactuals
 are
 when


you
 imagine
 how
 things
 could
 have
 been


worse
 so
 I
 see
 a
 lot
 in
 the
 database


particularly
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 romantic


regrets
 mostly
 women
 saying
 I
 regret


marrying
 that
 idiot
 but
 at
 least
 I
 have


these
 two
 great
 kids
 so
 I
 can
 imagine


how
 things
 could
 have
 turned
 out
 worse


in
 the
 in
 the
 Olympic
 medal
 example
 the


the
 silver
 medalist
 was
 like
 ah
 if
 only


I
 write
 about
 a
 bike
 race
 if
 only
 I
 had


pedal
 a
 little
 bit
 faster
 I
 could
 have


been
 a
 gold
 medalist


the
 the
 bronze
 medalist
 is
 like
 H
 at


least
 I
 finished
 third
 rather
 than
 thato


who
 finished
 fourth
 who
 doesn't
 have
 any


medals
 at
 all
 exactly
 I
 think
 it's
 so


funny
 because
 I
 did
 this
 very
 difficult


uh
 study
 in
 the
 intelligence
 service


where
 we
 studied
 Russian
 and
 we
 were
 uh


16
 people
 and
 I
 was
 second
 to
 last
 I
 was


just
 going
 of
 hang
 on
 with
 my
 nails
 I'm


so
 happy
 I'm
 like
 super
 happy
 can
 you


imagine
 being
 last
 nearly
 failed
 you


know
 and
 I
 and
 I
 managed
 to
 scrape


through
 that's
 uh
 uh
 that's
 a
 downward


kind
 of
 fact
 ual
 totally
 yeah
 so
 so


downward
 counter
 upward
 counterfactual


is
 if
 only
 downward
 counterfactual
 is
 at


least
 yeah
 so
 at
 least
 I
 didn't
 finish


last
 at
 least
 I
 passed
 moving
 on
 next


book
 drive
 the
 surprising
 truth
 about


what
 motivate
 us
 and
 you
 talk
 about
 uh


the
 importance
 of
 autonomy
 Mastery
 and


and
 purpose
 um
 tell
 me
 about
 it
 should


we
 start
 with
 Mastery
 uh
 Master


masteries
 are
 well
 the
 the
 reason
 these


things
 are
 are
 valuable
 is
 that
 we
 have


once
 again
 uh
 overstated
 the
 efficacy
 of


a
 certain
 kind
 of
 reward
 what
 I
 call
 an


if
 then
 reward
 if
 you
 do
 this
 then
 you


get
 that
 what
 what
 psychologists
 call
 a


controlling
 contingent
 reward
 what
 the


research
 shows
 pretty
 clearly
 is
 that


not
 in
 all
 cases
 but
 in
 many
 cases
 if


then
 rewards
 are
 good
 for
 simple
 tasks


with
 shorttime
 Horizons
 they're
 less


good
 for
 Creative
 conceptual
 tasks
 with


longer
 time
 Horizons
 um
 and
 so
 what


you're
 better
 off
 doing
 is
 is
 uh


creating
 a
 reward
 system
 that's
 focused


Less
 on
 the


narrow
 reward
 and
 more
 on
 these
 other


elements
 of
 your
 work
 life
 so
 one
 is


Mastery
 Master
 is
 our
 desire
 to
 get


better
 at
 things
 to
 to
 improve
 to
 grow


there's
 some
 fascinating
 research
 from


Teresa
 M
 at
 Harvard
 Business
 School


showing
 that
 the
 single
 biggest
 data-


day
 motivator
 on
 the
 job
 is
 making


progress
 making
 progress
 and
 meaningful


work
 this
 is
 why
 people
 this
 is
 why


people
 play
 musical
 instruments
 on
 the


weekend
 is
 why
 they
 do
 Sports
 on
 the


weekend
 it's
 why
 they
 have
 hobbies
 it's


why
 even
 people
 who
 are
 seasoned


professionals
 um
 and
 have
 every
 kind
 of


extrinsic
 reward
 they
 could
 possibly


imagine
 they
 still
 want
 to
 do
 a
 little


bit
 better
 they
 still
 want
 to
 try


something
 else
 why
 does
 uh
 micromanagers


kill
 pleasure
 well
 that
 has
 to
 do
 more


with
 autonomy
 than
 with
 Mastery
 but


micromanagement
 can
 be
 a
 can
 be
 a


barrier
 to
 Mastery
 but
 um
 you
 know


here's
 the
 thing
 you
 you
 part
 of
 this


goes


to
 what
 you
 believe
 about
 human
 beings


do
 you
 believe
 that
 human
 that
 most


human
 beings
 are
 autonomous
 and


self-directed
 and
 want
 to
 do
 decent
 work


or
 do
 you
 believe
 that
 most
 human
 beings


are
 shiftless
 lazy
 and
 don't
 care
 now
 in


many
 cases
 people
 believe
 the
 first


thing
 about
 themselves
 always
 but
 they


believe
 the
 second
 thing
 about
 other


people
 which
 doesn't
 actually
 compute
 um


and
 so
 micromanagement
 is
 is
 is
 thwarts


autonomy
 what
 a
 basic
 need
 that
 we
 have


is
 to
 be
 self-directed
 have
 some
 amount


of
 sovereignty
 some
 amount
 of
 control


over
 what
 we
 do
 how
 we
 do
 it
 when
 we
 do


it
 where
 we
 do
 it
 and
 micromanagement


kills
 that
 uh
 and
 you
 know
 what
 we
 want


are
 people
 I'm
 surprised
 this
 word


hasn't
 taken
 off
 because
 somebody
 used


it
 in
 an
 interview
 with
 me
 um
 that
 you


know
 when
 I
 was
 interviewing
 somebody


like
 we
 need
 macrom
 managers
 who


essentially
 set
 the
 direction
 hold


people


accountable
 and
 give
 people
 the
 tools


they
 need
 to
 get
 better
 and
 do
 the
 best


work
 they
 possibly
 can
 I
 think
 it's


interesting
 Sam
 wman
 he
 said
 that
 when


you
 ask
 people
 to
 do
 something
 don't
 be


too
 descriptive
 about
 what
 you
 want
 to


achieve
 uh
 about
 what
 you
 want
 to


achieve
 yeah
 yeah
 uh
 that's
 possible
 I


think
 you
 certainly
 don't
 want
 to
 be
 too


descriptive
 about
 precisely
 how
 to
 do
 it


in
 many
 cases
 um
 and
 what
 you
 want
 so


because
 what
 you
 could
 be
 doing
 it's
 an


interesting
 Insight
 because
 sometimes


when
 you
 say
 here's
 what
 I
 want
 to


achieve
 the
 people
 doing
 it
 might


actually
 have
 a
 higher
 level
 of


achievement
 in
 mind
 when
 you
 don't
 when


you
 don't
 when
 you're
 less
 directive
 so


the
 way
 to
 understand
 autonomy
 is
 to


understand
 is
 to
 understand
 it's


opposite
 this
 is
 actually
 to
 me
 a


thinking
 tool
 that
 I
 use
 all
 the
 time
 so


you
 take
 something
 like
 autonomy


autonomy
 is
 not
 something
 like
 you
 know


a
 glass
 or
 a
 pen
 or
 anything
 like
 that


it's
 not
 concrete
 it's
 not
 something


that
 you
 can
 picture
 and
 we
 sometimes


have
 a
 harder
 time
 putting
 getting
 our


minds
 around
 that
 so
 a
 tool
 that
 I
 use


to
 think
 about
 those
 kinds
 of
 things
 is


to
 imagine
 what's
 the
 opposite
 and
 the


opposite
 of
 autonomy
 is
 control
 and
 I'm


convinc
 that
 human
 beings
 have
 only
 two


reactions
 to
 control
 they
 comply
 or
 they


defy
 and
 and
 um
 and
 I
 think
 if
 you're


running
 an
 organization
 if
 you're


teaching
 kids
 in
 school
 if
 you're


coaching
 a
 team
 you
 don't
 want
 people


perfectly
 compliant
 and
 you
 certainly


want
 people
 who
 are
 Divine
 you
 want
 them


engaged
 and
 the
 way
 that
 people
 engage


is
 through
 self-direction
 the
 way
 that


you
 engage
 is
 yourself
 Direction
 the
 way


that
 I
 engage
 yourself
 Direction
 the
 way


that
 everybody
 watching
 or
 listening
 to


this
 engages
 is
 by
 having
 some


sovereignty
 over
 themselves
 by
 having


some
 direction
 over
 their
 own
 lives
 well


if
 you
 control
 after
 five
 years
 you
 got


the
 wrong
 people
 left
 in
 The
 Firm
 right


that's
 a
 great
 point
 because
 everybody


else
 exits
 so
 what
 you
 have
 is
 you
 have


a
 you
 have
 an
 army
 of
 compliant
 people


yeah
 terrible
 now
 you
 talk
 about
 task


time
 technique
 and
 team
 yeah
 what
 is


that
 four
 T's
 uh
 those
 are
 the


dimensions
 of
 work
 that
 people
 seem
 to


want
 some
 autonomy
 over
 so
 time
 is
 you


know
 I
 want
 to
 be
 able
 to
 come
 in
 when
 I


want
 more
 or
 less
 um
 this
 is
 one
 reason


why
 in
 Professional
 Services
 the


billable
 hour
 is
 absolutely
 destructive


of
 autonomy
 and
 we
 have
 some
 interesting


research
 that
 it's
 destructive
 of


well-being
 um
 uh
 task
 is
 I
 want
 some


control
 over
 what
 I
 do
 uh
 team
 is
 I
 want


some
 control
 over
 who
 I
 get
 who
 I
 work


with
 and
 um
 and
 technique
 is
 I
 want
 some


control
 over
 how
 I
 do
 what
 I
 do
 and


those
 are
 going
 to
 vary
 based
 on
 the


task
 so
 for
 instance
 you
 don't
 want
 a


brain
 surgeon
 to
 have
 like
 you
 know
 a


surgery
 team
 doing
 brain
 surgery
 to
 have


you


know
 100%
 autonomy
 over
 technique
 hey


today
 we're
 going
 to
 try
 something
 new


in
 our
 brain
 surgery
 that's
 probably
 not


a
 good
 idea
 but
 what
 are
 the


implications
 for
 bonuses
 for
 instance
 in


the
 financial
 sector
 right
 we
 we
 go
 some


bonuses
 yeah
 yeah
 yeah
 it
 depends
 it


it's
 it's
 actually
 trick
 it's
 actually


trickier
 than
 people
 on
 either
 side
 of


it
 there
 there's
 there
 some
 ideology
 on


both
 sides
 there's
 ideology
 among
 some


people
 saying
 bonuses
 are
 dehumanizing


they're
 overly
 controlling
 there
 other


side
 that
 says
 bonuses
 are
 the
 only
 way


people
 will
 do
 things
 um
 it
 depends
 I


think
 that
 the
 optimal
 compensation


structure
 is
 first
 of
 all
 hire
 great


people
 pay
 them
 a
 sign
 pay
 them
 a


healthy
 base
 salary
 and
 then
 offer


bonuses
 based
 on
 simple
 straightforward


criteria
 that
 are
 hard
 to
 gain
 one
 of


the
 things
 you
 see
 about
 bonuses
 is
 one


of
 the
 things
 you
 see
 about
 bonuses


particularly
 in
 less
 in
 financial


services
 but
 in
 other
 kinds
 of
 areas
 is


that
 the
 the
 compensation
 schemes
 are
 so


incredibly
 complex
 about
 what
 you're


rewarding
 and
 how
 much
 that
 you


basically
 need
 an
 entire
 administrative


apparatus
 to
 run
 the
 bonus
 scheme
 and


then
 basically
 a
 Judicial
 arm
 to
 to


litigate
 the
 disputes
 within
 that
 in


financial
 services
 or
 just
 like


investing
 yeah
 I
 mean
 if
 the
 if
 your


portfolio
 goes
 up
 you
 deserve
 a
 piece
 of


the
 action
 if
 if
 if
 you're
 working
 at
 a


company
 and
 you're
 a
 big
 contributor
 and


the
 company
 makes
 a
 greater
 profit
 you


deserve
 some
 of
 that
 profit
 there's
 no


question
 about
 that
 so
 um
 so
 uh
 simple


um
 not
 high
 simple
 not
 high
 stakes
 and


connected
 to
 measures
 that
 matter
 you


argue
 that
 the
 school
 system
 is
 a
 bit


screwed
 um
 yeah
 I
 mean
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 I


I
 don't
 know
 if
 I
 use
 those
 that
 precise


no
 no
 but
 you've
 talked
 about
 kind
 of


performance
 goals
 versus
 learning
 goals


heck
 yeah
 yeah
 of
 course
 um
 yeah
 I
 mean


the
 it
 depends
 on
 where
 in
 the
 world
 you


are
 I
 don't
 think
 it's
 true
 everywhere


um
 uh
 in
 the
 United
 States
 it's


particularly
 in
 certain
 Elite
 corners
 of


the
 United
 States
 it's
 basically
 all


performance
 goals
 performance
 goals
 is


getting
 a
 an
 a
 on
 a
 test
 uh
 learning


goals
 is
 mastering
 the
 material
 and


believe
 me
 you
 can
 get
 an
 A
 on
 a
 test


without
 mastering
 the
 material
 I'm
 a


case
 in
 point
 I
 mean
 when
 I
 was
 in


school
 I
 was
 you
 know
 I
 was
 very


compliant
 I
 was
 very
 good
 at
 performance


goals
 it's
 why
 I
 got
 an
 A
 on
 basically


on
 every
 single
 test
 in
 six
 years
 of


French
 in
 school
 and
 can't
 speak


French
 B
 sa
 how
 do
 you
 screen
 for
 these


things
 when
 you
 interview
 people
 when


you
 hire
 them
 interesting
 question
 um
 I


don't
 know
 um
 because
 in
 general
 we're


pretty
 bad
 at
 hiring
 across
 the
 board


forget
 about
 these
 criteria
 in
 general


we
 H
 we
 don't
 hire
 we're
 still
 doing
 for


instance
 unstructured
 job
 interviews


when
 there's
 no
 evidence
 those
 have
 any


predictive


value
 and
 so
 I'm
 not
 sure
 how
 I'm
 not


sure
 how
 you
 screen
 for
 it
 uh
 I
 think


that
 the
 way
 you
 I
 I
 think
 that
 the
 way


you
 screen
 for
 it
 would
 be
 to
 to
 uh
 look


at
 past
 performance
 and
 give
 people


sample
 uh
 assignments
 on
 on
 how
 on
 how


good
 they
 are
 I
 mean
 I
 think
 that's
 one


of
 the
 what
 we
 see
 in
 some
 of
 the


research
 on
 interviewing
 is
 that


structured
 interiew
 interviews
 which
 are


boring
 for
 the


interviewers
 and
 giving
 people
 uh
 test


assignments
 that
 match
 what
 they're


actually
 going
 to
 do
 on
 the
 job
 have


some
 predictive
 value
 and
 I
 would


probably
 just
 go
 with
 those
 and
 and


chances
 are
 the
 people
 who
 do
 well
 on


those
 are
 people
 who
 have
 a
 propensity


for
 a
 sense
 of
 autonomy
 for
 a
 sense
 of


Mastery
 and
 for
 um
 some
 sense
 of
 purpose


do
 cosos
 have
 stronger
 drives
 than


others
 I
 don't
 know
 I
 mean
 it
 probably


depends
 on
 the
 it
 probably
 depends
 on


the
 CEO
 if
 you
 pressed
 me
 to
 the
 wall


and
 said
 you
 had
 and
 I
 had
 to
 offer
 a


yes
 no
 answer
 to
 that
 I
 would
 say
 no
 um


I
 just
 think
 you
 know
 CEOs
 could
 be
 CEOs


not
 because
 they
 have
 a
 songer
 drive


because
 they're
 they're
 Wier
 they're


better
 at
 politics
 um
 they're
 they're


you
 know
 they're
 they're
 they're
 tall
 uh


they're
 male
 uh
 they're
 more
 conformist


so
 that
 could
 be
 why
 they're
 CEOs
 too


rather
 than
 where
 they
 have
 some
 kind
 of


innate
 drive
 that
 separates
 them
 from


the
 great
 unwashed
 who
 aren't
 CEOs
 so


when
 you
 look
 at
 the
 the
 cohort
 of
 C


what
 do
 you
 what
 do
 you
 think
 it
 depends


I
 mean
 it's
 it's
 it's
 varied
 I
 think


there's
 a
 big
 difference
 between
 a
 CEO


who
 comes
 up
 through
 the
 ranks
 and
 a
 CEO


who
 is
 a
 Founder
 first
 of
 all
 I
 think


those
 are
 two
 they're
 both
 have
 the
 same


name
 CEO
 but
 I
 think
 that
 they're


different
 species
 in
 what
 ways
 uh
 just


in
 the
 terms
 of
 the
 skills
 they
 had
 to


use
 to
 get
 to
 where
 they
 are
 um
 and


their
 and
 at
 some
 level
 their
 approach


to
 their
 their
 just
 a
 skill
 I
 guess
 to


over
 to
 to
 simplify
 that
 on
 I
 just
 think


the
 skills
 that
 you
 need
 to
 become
 a
 CEO


of
 a
 publicly
 held
 company
 that
 you


worked
 at
 for
 35
 years
 and
 to
 become
 the


CEO
 of
 a
 venture
 funded
 startup
 that
 has


a
 new
 idea
 or
 new
 technology
 those
 are


fundament
 those
 are
 those
 are
 different


skills
 there's
 some
 overlap
 but
 those


are
 different
 skills
 and
 I
 think
 that


different
 people
 are
 attracted
 to
 those


kinds
 of
 things
 absolutely
 now
 how
 does


uh
 personal
 energy
 levels
 come
 into
 play


here
 interesting
 um
 I'm
 not
 sure
 um
 what


is
 energy
 I
 don't
 know
 um
 you
 know
 can


it
 can
 be
 you
 know
 it
 can
 it
 can
 neither


be
 created
 nor
 destroyed
 I
 guess
 is
 what


the
 physicist
 would
 tell
 us
 uh
 it's
 an


interesting
 question
 and
 I
 don't
 know


enough
 about
 it
 I
 wonder
 if
 it
 is
 a


metaphor
 for
 something
 else
 it's


possible
 that
 it's
 a
 metaphor
 for


different
 Notions
 of
 intelligence
 uh


it's
 possible
 for
 different
 aspects
 of


Personality
 I'm
 I'm
 skeptical
 I
 don't


know
 again
 just
 to
 be
 clear
 on
 that
 I'm


skeptical
 that
 it's
 a
 thing
 in
 itself


that's
 I'm
 skeptical
 that
 it
 that
 energy


at
 sense
 that
 we're
 talking
 about
 is
 a


thing
 in
 itself
 I
 I'm
 convinced
 it
 is
 a


metaphor
 for
 something
 important
 though


and
 it
 could
 be
 um
 ambition
 it
 could
 be


uh
 intellectual
 capacity
 it
 could
 be
 um


some
 other
 some
 some
 other
 kind
 of


personality
 trait
 extroverts
 are


probably
 perceived
 as
 more
 energetic


than
 other
 people
 perceived
 yes
 you


think
 they
 are
 I
 don't
 know
 um
 uh
 it


could
 be
 it
 it
 could
 be
 that
 they
 are
 I


they're
 certainly
 they're
 certainly


they're
 certainly
 perceived
 that
 way
 um


you
 know
 here's
 the
 thing
 people
 who
 are


manic
 have
 very
 high
 energy
 levels
 so


the
 idea
 that
 energy
 that
 a
 high
 energy


level
 is
 inherently
 a
 good
 thing
 and


produces
 good
 results
 is
 something
 that


we
 have
 to
 question
 oh
 and
 I
 guess
 ADHD


is
 uh
 just
 trying
 to
 medicate
 them
 uh


absolutely
 and
 that
 there
 could
 be
 there


could
 be
 there
 could
 be
 downsides
 to


that
 I
 do
 think
 it's
 an
 interesting


question
 though
 and
 I
 don't
 think
 it's
 I


don't
 think
 uh
 Jim
 lore
 and
 Barry
 and
 um


what's
 his
 name
 um
 Tony
 Schwarz
 wrote
 a


book
 about
 this
 maybe
 20
 years
 ago
 about


how
 we
 should
 not
 manage
 our
 time
 but
 we


should
 manage
 our
 energy
 as
 a
 as
 a


personal
 matter
 but
 I
 don't
 think
 that


there
 is
 either
 I
 don't
 think
 there


there
 is
 much
 in
 the
 way
 of
 good
 quality


research
 on
 what
 you
 and
 I
 are
 you
 and
 I


know
 what
 we're
 talking
 about
 I
 think


that's
 what's
 so
 interesting
 you
 and
 I


know
 what
 we're
 talking
 about
 we
 can


have
 a
 conversation
 about
 energy
 and
 we


we
 understand
 what
 we
 mean
 but
 if
 I


press
 how
 would
 you
 define
 energy
 uh
 I


mean
 it's


uh
 it's
 something
 you
 radiate
 it's


something
 that
 keeps
 you
 going
 when


you're
 tired
 it's
 something
 that
 makes


you
 wake
 up
 early
 it's
 something
 some


kind
 of
 inferiority
 complex
 that
 makes


you
 work
 very
 hard
 I
 mean
 this
 bu
 of


things
 uh
 right
 exactly
 so
 I
 think
 it's


like
 a
 proxy
 it's
 a
 metaphor
 for


something
 else
 and
 it
 could
 be
 it
 could


be
 a
 mix
 it
 could
 be
 a
 mix
 of
 things


yeah
 yeah
 do
 you
 think
 that
 you
 have
 a


high
 energy
 level
 well
 I
 wake
 up
 early


for
 sure
 do
 you
 but
 that
 but
 that's


that's
 bi
 part
 of
 that
 is
 biological
 no


I
 know
 I
 don't
 yeah
 yeah
 and
 we
 are


moving
 on
 well
 how
 about
 that
 for
 a


segue
 segue
 into
 your
 next
 book


when
 uh
 why
 is
 uh
 timing
 important
 what


is
 it
 with
 timing
 which
 is
 important


well
 there's
 so
 so
 many
 aspects
 of


timing
 that
 are
 important
 I
 think
 the


the
 error
 that
 we
 make
 in
 in
 navigating


Our
 Lives
 is
 thinking
 that
 timing
 is
 an


art
 when
 when
 it's
 actually
 closer
 to
 a


science
 there's
 incredible
 this
 is
 one


of
 my
 FV
 I
 mean
 I
 I
 love
 all
 my
 my
 my


children
 like
 all
 the
 books
 I
 found
 are


fascinating
 this
 book
 when
 I
 wrote


largely
 because
 I
 wanted
 to
 read
 it
 like


I
 like
 I
 realized
 I
 was
 making
 all
 these


when
 decisions
 and
 I
 didn't
 know
 how
 to


do
 it
 and
 when
 I
 started
 looking
 at
 the


research
 there
 is
 a
 massive
 amount
 of


research
 out
 there
 on
 when
 to
 do
 things


but
 it's
 splattered
 across
 all
 different


domains
 so
 there's
 some
 in
 economics
 and


biology
 there's
 as
 we
 hinted
 at
 there's


a
 whole
 field
 called
 chronobiology
 U
 and


so
 um
 I
 think
 the
 lesson
 of
 that
 is
 that


we
 should
 make
 t
 our
 timing
 decisions


based
 on
 science
 rather
 than
 on


intuition
 and
 what
 are
 the
 and
 how
 do


how
 that
 work
 uh
 so
 what
 you
 what
 do
 you


do
 so
 there
 different
 so
 there
 there


different
 dimensions
 of
 that
 one
 of
 them


is
 what
 do
 you
 do
 at
 a
 on
 a
 at
 a
 given


day
 and
 I
 think
 what's
 I
 think
 to
 me
 one


of
 the
 most
 powerful
 stats
 that
 I
 came


across
 in
 that
 research
 is
 that
 time
 of


day
 explains
 20%
 of
 the
 variance
 in


performance
 that's
 Inc
 when
 you
 think


about
 that
 that's
 incredible
 and
 that's


based
 on
 like
 scientific
 data
 that
 you


have
 from
 lots
 of
 tests
 for
 instance
 in


Denmark
 exactly
 all
 all
 not
 just
 not


just
 in
 in
 in
 one
 particular
 place
 but


but
 throughout
 uh
 many
 many
 studies


showing
 that
 that
 time
 of
 day
 explains


20%
 of
 the
 variant
 now
 if
 you
 think


about
 that
 let's
 just
 unpack
 that
 for
 a


second
 because
 it's
 even
 saying
 it
 it's


like
 wow
 God
 that's
 kind
 of
 incredible


when
 we
 think
 about
 what
 explains


variance
 in
 performance
 some
 of
 it
 is
 is


is
 energy
 perhaps
 some
 of
 it
 is
 ambition


some
 of
 it
 is
 social
 Advantage
 some
 of


it
 is
 innate


intelligence
 um
 innate
 intelligence


social
 Advantage
 those
 are
 hard
 if


there's
 deficit
 that's
 that's
 hard
 to


remedy
 time
 of
 day
 that's
 really
 easy
 to


remedy
 so
 I
 think
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 power


in
 all
 of
 that
 so
 what
 it
 suggests
 is


that
 there
 are
 in
 general
 guidelines
 for


what
 sorts
 of
 tasks
 to
 do
 at
 different


times
 of
 day
 based
 in
 part
 on
 the
 task


and
 based
 in
 part
 on
 the
 chronotype


chronotype
 is
 do
 you
 wake
 up
 early
 and


go
 to
 sleep
 early
 naturally
 do
 you
 wake


up
 late
 and
 go
 to
 sleep
 late
 um
 or
 are


you
 somewhere
 in
 between
 now
 do
 you
 go


to
 you
 say
 you
 wake
 up
 early
 do
 you
 go


to
 sleep
 early
 yeah
 yeah
 I'm
 like
 9
 9:30


yeah
 great
 so
 you're
 until
 5
 perfect
 so


you're
 kind
 of
 a
 lark
 you're
 you're


someone
 who's
 who
 has
 a
 much
 more
 of
 a


morning
 uh
 a
 a
 morning
 typee
 there
 a
 lot


of
 ADV
 and
 you
 were
 in
 between
 I'm
 in


between
 yeah
 there
 are
 a
 lot
 of
 I'm
 not


a
 night
 all
 I'm
 not
 an
 early
 morning


person
 and
 that's
 that's
 what
 most


people
 are
 most
 people
 are
 kind
 of
 in


the
 middle
 um
 there's
 a
 lot
 of


advantages
 to
 that
 so
 what
 do
 you
 so
 how


do
 you
 stret
 today
 so
 you
 should
 do


walham
 morning
 okay
 so
 um
 for
 the
 80%
 of


us
 who
 are
 not
 night
 owls
 now
 night
 we


have
 an
 outlier
 here
 the
 people
 who
 are


the
 opposite
 of
 you
 who
 naturally
 wake


up
 late
 and
 go
 to
 sleep
 late
 who
 we


think
 are
 lazy
 and
 the
 nightclubbers


exactly
 we
 think
 that
 those
 people
 are


diletant
 and
 not
 serious
 they
 just
 have


a
 different
 chronotype
 many
 of
 them
 just


have
 a
 different
 chronotype
 um
 let's


take
 the
 80%
 of
 us
 who
 are
 either
 like


you
 or
 like
 me
 here's
 what
 you
 should
 do


early
 in
 the
 day
 that's
 when
 we
 should


do
 our
 analytic
 work
 and
 analytic
 work


is
 work
 that
 requires
 heads
 down
 focus


and
 attention
 writing
 is
 a
 good
 example


of
 that
 analyzing
 data
 figuring
 out
 a


strategy
 something
 that
 requires
 heads


down
 Focus
 the
 reason
 for
 that
 is
 that


is
 that
 during
 this
 peak
 period
 that
 we


have
 mostly
 early
 in
 the
 day
 for
 most
 of


us
 we're
 most
 we're
 more
 Vigilant
 we're


able
 to
 battle
 away
 distractions
 so
 do


your
 analytic
 work
 early
 in
 the
 day
 the


middle
 of
 the
 day
 early
 afternoon


midafternoon


it's
 generally
 a
 terrible
 time
 of
 day


and
 we
 see
 Inc
 there's
 incredible


research
 on
 like
 healthcare
 like
 errors


in
 health
 care
 in
 the
 afternoon
 lack
 of


handwashing
 in
 the
 the
 health
 care
 data


you
 don't
 want
 to
 have
 an
 operation
 in


the
 timate
 you
 absolutely
 do
 not
 nobody


in
 my
 family
 is
 permitted
 I
 mean
 if
 you


get
 hit
 by
 a
 bus
 and
 there's
 no
 other


choice
 yeah
 but
 a
 discretionary
 there
 is


nobody
 in
 my
 family
 who
 is
 permitted
 to


have
 a
 medical
 procedure
 in
 the


afternoon
 I'm
 not
 I'm
 not
 joking
 around


how
 much
 worse
 is
 it
 it
 depends
 um
 but


you
 you
 have
 anesthesia
 errors
 four


times
 more
 likely
 oh
 wow
 um
 you
 have
 uh


doctors
 and
 nurses
 and
 other
 he
 uh
 big


drop
 off
 in
 handwashing
 uh
 if
 you
 look


at
 there's
 some
 fascinating
 research
 on


both
 the
 prescri
 even
 just
 regular


doctor's
 appointments
 the
 prescribing
 of


unnecessary
 antibiotics
 and
 even


uh
 opioids
 much
 greater
 in
 the
 afternoon


than
 in
 the
 morning
 wow
 um
 yeah
 and
 so


that
 that
 trough
 period
 of
 the
 day
 um
 if


you
 can
 where
 you
 can
 you
 want
 to
 do


some
 of
 your
 administrative
 work
 and


then
 the
 evening
 what
 do
 you
 do
 well


later
 in
 the
 day
 it's
 kind
 of


interesting
 so
 what
 you
 have
 is
 you
 have


you
 move
 through
 the
 day
 basically
 your


mood
 moves
 through
 the
 day
 sort
 of
 a


peak
 a
 trough
 and
 a
 recovery
 um
 your


vigilance
 is
 highest
 here
 so
 if
 you
 look


at
 later
 in
 the
 day
 late
 afternoon
 early


evening
 what
 you
 see
 from
 for
 most
 of
 us


we'll
 talk
 about
 the
 night
 ows
 in
 a


moment
 what
 you
 see
 for
 most
 of
 us
 is


rising
 mood
 but
 lower
 vigilance
 that


makes
 it
 good
 for
 creativity
 for
 things


that
 don't
 require
 you
 know
 inhibition


so
 brainstorming
 is
 a
 great
 example
 of


that
 brainstorm
 in
 the
 afternoon
 not
 in


the
 morning
 people
 too
 Vigilant
 in
 the


morning
 most
 of
 us
 so
 they're
 going
 to


knock
 down
 the
 good
 ideas
 they're
 going


to
 knock
 down
 the
 outlandish
 ideas
 here


so
 so
 do
 your
 more
 creative
 iterative


work
 and
 so
 where
 you
 can
 push
 your


analytic
 work
 early
 your
 administrative


work
 in
 the
 middle
 and
 your
 iterative


creative
 work
 later
 in
 the
 day
 now
 if


you're


night
 the
 world
 is
 UN
 to
 you
 your
 L
 case


yeah
 you
 know
 what
 it's
 I
 don't
 put
 it


on
 the
 night
 ow
 I
 put
 it
 on
 the
 people


who
 employ
 night
 owls
 let
 your
 night


owls
 do
 their
 thing
 if
 they
 want
 to
 work


in
 the
 middle
 of
 the
 night
 let
 them
 work


in
 the
 middle
 of
 the
 night
 don't
 make


them
 go
 to
 an
 8:00
 staff
 meeting
 and


when
 they
 can
 barely
 open
 their
 eyes


think
 that
 they're
 somehow
 lazy
 what
 we


see
 with
 night
 ows
 though
 is
 interesting


night
 owls
 okay
 more
 likely
 to
 have


addiction
 problems
 more
 likely
 to
 go
 to


jail
 but
 we
 also
 see
 night
 Al
 testing


higher
 on
 both
 creativity
 and
 and
 uh


general
 intelligence
 well
 they're


probably
 more
 likely
 to
 be
 musicians
 and


artists
 and
 Painters
 it
 could
 be
 that


people
 who
 and
 I
 think
 there
 is
 some


interesting
 I
 don't
 think
 we
 know
 it


very
 well
 that
 there
 is
 some
 interesting


ways
 that
 our


chronotype
 can
 steer
 us
 to
 certain
 kinds


of
 profession
 so
 for
 instance
 there
 are


people
 who
 at
 least
 anecdotally
 who
 say


I
 want
 to
 be
 a
 school
 teacher
 but
 they


don't
 have
 an
 early
 they
 don't
 they
 have


like
 a
 night
 out
 chronotype
 and
 they
 got


to
 you
 got
 to
 be
 with
 the
 with
 287
 year


olds
 at
 at
 7:30
 in
 the
 morning
 that's


miserable
 for
 a
 night
 owl
 and
 so
 they


don't
 last
 as
 they
 don't
 last
 as
 that


Dan
 what's
 the
 key
 to
 good
 breaks
 the


the
 conceptual
 key
 to
 breaks
 and
 this
 is


important
 um
 is
 um
 thinking
 of
 breaks
 as


part
 of
 your
 work
 rather
 than
 a


deviation
 from
 your
 work
 not
 thinking
 of


breaks
 as
 a
 concession
 as
 a
 weakness
 but


thinking
 them
 as
 integral
 to
 your
 to


your
 work
 number
 one
 something
 is
 better


than
 nothing
 so
 even
 a
 short
 break
 is


better
 than
 no
 break
 at
 all
 second
 uh


social
 is
 better
 than
 solo
 so
 that


breaks
 with
 other
 people
 are
 more


restorative
 than
 breaks
 on
 your
 own
 even


with
 uh
 even
 for
 introverts
 we
 know
 not


a
 surprise
 moving
 is
 better
 than


stationary
 so
 a
 break
 my
 having
 a
 break


here
 sitting
 staring
 into
 space
 not
 as


good
 as
 just
 going
 out
 and
 for
 a
 walk


very
 interesting
 for
 um
 I
 I
 think
 around


the
 world
 is
 outside
 is
 better
 than


inside
 and
 this
 to
 me
 is
 one
 of
 those


insights
 in
 science
 that
 is


underappreciated
 the
 advantage
 of
 being


outside
 the
 advantage
 of
 being
 and
 I


don't
 mean
 in
 National
 Park
 I
 mean
 you


and
 I
 are
 talking
 here
 in
 Washington
 DC


taking
 a
 walk
 outside
 in
 Washington
 DC


and
 seeing
 the
 trees
 um
 and
 then
 finally


uh
 the
 the
 importance
 of
 brakes
 being


fully
 detached
 people
 what
 does
 that


mean
 it
 means
 that
 hey
 I'm
 going
 to
 take


a
 break
 now
 and
 go
 off
 for
 a
 walk
 and


you
 spend
 your
 whole
 walk
 looking
 at


your
 phone
 that's
 not
 fully
 detached


does
 it
 mean
 that
 taking
 a
 break
 at
 your


desk
 and
 looking
 at
 the
 at
 the
 screen
 is


a
 good
 thing
 it's
 probably
 not
 a
 good


thing
 because
 it
 violates
 the
 outside


and
 the
 in
 motion
 uh
 the
 social
 side
 of


it
 so
 uh
 it's
 probably
 that's
 probably
 a


bad
 that's
 that's
 a
 suboptimal
 kind
 of


break
 yeah
 the
 optimal
 kind
 of
 break
 is


in
 the
 afternoon
 go
 out
 for
 a
 walk
 15
 20


minutes
 with
 someone
 you
 like
 leaving


your
 phone
 behind
 talking
 about


something
 other
 than
 work
 that's
 a
 good


break
 good
 naps
 naps
 I've
 I
 this
 is
 this


is
 one
 of
 those
 cases
 where
 the
 science


changed
 my
 position
 my
 political


position
 I
 was
 politically
 opposed
 to


naps
 CU
 I
 thought
 they
 were
 s
 of
 lazy


and
 I
 always
 felt
 terrible
 if
 I
 ever
 I


didn't
 take
 naps
 very
 often
 if
 I
 took
 a


nap
 I
 always
 felt
 terrible
 I
 would
 wake


up
 really
 groggy
 sort
 of
 ashamed
 of


myself
 um
 what
 what
 it
 shows
 is
 that


problem
 I
 had
 was
 that
 every
 time
 I
 took


a
 break
 my
 boss
 came
 in
 and
 thought
 I


was
 so
 bad
 but
 now
 this
 and
 the
 reason


why
 I
 want
 to
 talk
 about
 it
 now
 is
 so


that
 everybody
 understands
 that
 I'm


taking
 that
 I'm
 taking
 it
 up
 for
 a


reason
 a
 good
 reason
 it's
 a
 sign
 it's
 a


you're
 if
 you
 walk
 into
 nikolai's
 office


and
 he's
 taking
 a
 break
 it's
 just


another
 marker
 that
 he's
 an
 extremely


high
 performer
 that's
 how
 you
 should


interpret
 that
 thank
 you
 uh
 yeah
 uh
 naps


are
 naps
 are
 okay
 they're
 not
 for


everybody
 but
 there's
 some
 pretty
 good


evidence
 that
 they
 they
 can
 smooth


things
 out
 particularly
 short
 naps
 which


really
 surprised
 me
 so
 naps
 under
 under


20
 minutes
 are
 incredibly
 restorative


you
 nap
 longer
 than
 that
 you
 begin
 to


develop
 what
 uh
 biologists
 call
 Sleep


inertia
 which
 is
 essentially
 like
 the


kind
 of
 groggy
 boggy
 feeling
 you
 get
 but


uh
 a
 very
 short
 nap
 is
 powerful
 M
 what


is
 a
 napino
 ha
 uh
 that
 is
 the


scientifically
 optimal
 nap
 where
 you


I've
 done
 this
 on
 bad
 days
 I'm
 not
 a


huge
 Napper
 but
 I
 will
 and
 I
 this
 is


what
 I
 do
 is
 I
 sit
 in
 a
 chair
 in
 my


office
 I
 drink
 a
 cup
 of
 coffee
 okay
 I
 I


don't
 even
 enjoy
 it
 I
 I
 actually
 just


put
 ice
 cubes
 and
 hot
 coffee
 guzzle
 it


okay
 25
 minutes
 so
 and
 I
 set
 my
 timer
 on


my
 phone
 for
 25
 minutes
 I
 close
 my
 eyes


I
 put
 in
 noise
 cancelling
 headphones
 I


close
 my
 eyes
 I
 put
 my
 feet
 on
 an


ottoman
 and
 I
 can
 usually
 fall
 asleep


in
 it
 depends
 you
 know
 s
 eight
 minutes


okay
 so
 so
 7
 eight
 minutes
 let's
 say


it's
 8
 minutes
 that
 means
 I
 have
 and


then
 my
 I
 set
 my
 alarm
 and
 it
 goes
 off


25
 minutes
 later
 so
 let's
 say
 that
 means


I
 have
 a
 17
 minute
 if
 I
 sleep
 if
 I
 takes


me
 eight
 minutes
 to
 fall
 asleep
 that's
 a


17-minute
 nap
 Perfect
 all
 right
 right
 in


that
 10
 to
 20
 minute
 window
 but
 here's


the
 key
 so
 I've
 already
 won
 right
 there


but
 it
 takes
 about
 25
 minutes
 for


caffeine
 to
 enter
 your
 bloodstream
 and


and
 so
 when
 I
 wake
 up
 not
 only
 do
 I
 have


the
 restorative
 smoke
 power
 of
 the
 nap


but
 I
 have
 the
 added
 caffeine
 then
 two


things
 at
 the
 end
 here
 first
 thing
 how


do
 you
 get
 a
 pay
 Rise
 um
 I
 mean
 it
 there


are
 all
 kinds
 of
 ways
 I
 mean
 one
 of
 them


what
 we
 know
 from
 economics
 is
 switch


jobs
 quit
 your
 job
 and
 get
 a
 new
 job
 and


you
 and
 on
 average
 you
 get
 a
 you
 get
 a


you
 get
 a
 a
 hike
 in
 salary
 um
 I
 think
 if


you're
 going
 to
 go
 ask
 for
 it
 uh
 the
 key


is
 to
 especi
 and
 I
 think
 this
 is
 true


from
 some
 of
 the
 persuasion
 research
 is


that
 if
 you're
 going
 to
 ask
 for
 a
 higher


salary


um
 always
 put
 it
 in
 your
 boss's


interests
 not
 in
 your
 own
 interest
 but


always
 in
 in
 the
 boss's
 interest
 and
 how


do
 you
 do
 that
 why
 is
 it
 in
 his
 interest


that
 you
 should
 get
 a
 pay
 rise
 uh


because
 um
 you're
 going
 to
 be
 less


likely
 to
 look
 for
 another
 job
 you're


going
 to
 be
 happier
 where
 you
 are
 uh


you're
 going
 to
 have
 a
 the
 boss
 is
 going


to
 have
 a
 reputation
 for
 the
 boss
 is


going
 to
 have
 a
 reputation
 for
 fairness


and
 lastly
 we
 got
 tens
 of
 thousands
 of


young
 people
 listening
 to
 this
 what
 is


your
 advice
 to
 young
 people
 all
 kinds
 of


advice
 but
 I
 think
 the
 first
 one
 is
 is


that
 we
 there's
 this
 notion
 among
 many


young
 people
 particularly
 kind
 of
 high


teaming
 young
 people
 that
 they
 need
 to


have
 a
 very
 distinct
 plan
 that
 the
 way


to
 navigate
 a
 career
 the
 way
 to
 get


navigate
 a
 life
 is
 almost
 to
 move
 from


this
 move
 this
 piece
 here
 which
 will


lead
 to
 this
 thing
 here
 which
 will
 lead


to
 this
 thing
 here
 which
 will
 lead
 to


this
 thing
 here
 this
 sort
 of
 this
 very


meticulous
 kind
 of
 planning
 and
 I
 think


that's
 a
 big
 mistake
 I
 always
 tell


people
 find
 somebody
 you
 you
 admire
 and


ask
 them
 how
 they
 got
 to
 where
 they
 are


and


invariably
 95
 times
 out
 of
 100
 100
 the


answer
 to
 that
 question
 will


be
 it's
 a
 long
 story
 because
 the
 path


was
 not
 linear
 it
 was
 not
 it
 was
 chaotic


it
 was
 backward
 and
 forward
 and
 up
 and


down
 and
 so
 forth
 it
 wasn't
 this


carefully
 created
 set
 of
 moves
 and
 so


that's
 the
 thing
 that
 I
 would
 that's
 the


thing
 that
 I
 would
 tell
 them
 is
 is
 is


make
 your
 make
 your
 make
 your
 decisions


for
 fundamental
 reasons
 more
 than
 for


instrumental
 reasons
 make
 your
 decisions


like
 I
 I
 I
 see
 so
 many
 young
 people


particularly
 High
 achieving
 young
 people


who
 take
 a
 job
 and
 the
 reason
 they
 take


the
 job
 is
 they
 think
 it's
 going
 to
 lead


to
 another
 job
 and
 when
 in
 fact
 you
 have


no
 idea
 what
 it's
 going
 to
 lead
 to
 and


like
 do
 you
 enjoy
 the
 job
 are
 you


contributing
 in
 the
 job
 is
 it
 a
 good
 use


of
 your
 skills
 and
 your
 talents
 that's


the
 thing
 are
 you
 and
 are
 you
 working


with
 great
 people
 and
 you
 do
 that
 you're


better
 off
 with
 the
 uncertainty
 of


knowing
 not
 knowing
 what's
 next
 than
 you


are
 with
 the
 false
 certainty
 of
 saying


this
 job
 will
 lead
 to
 that
 job
 and
 this


job
 will
 lead
 to
 that
 job
 it
 doesn't


work
 that
 way
 well
 now
 this
 has
 been


tremendous
 uh
 love
 your
 books
 and
 very


interested
 in
 where
 you
 will
 take
 us


next
 um
 you
 don't
 have
 to
 tell
 us
 now


but
 we
 cannot
 wait
 to
 see
 it
 oh
 I'll
 I


you'll
 be
 the
 first
 I
 tell
 fantastic


thank
 you
 so
 much
