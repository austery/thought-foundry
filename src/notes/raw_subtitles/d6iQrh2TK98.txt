- Let me show you something unbelievable.
Name a random number between 1 and 100.
- 61.
- Okay, that's pretty random.
- [Emily] Just name a random
number from 1 to 100, random.
- 43.
- 43, thank you so much.
- 56.
- 7.
- I want the most random
number between 1 and 100,
like totally random.
- 11.
- 37.
- [Interviewee] 79.
- 79, thank you so much.
- 91.
- 7.
- 3.
- 37.
- [Derek] 37.
- 37, yeah.
- [Derek] Why 37?
- I dunno, it's the first number
that came to my mind.
- 44.
- 27.
- 37.
- 72.
- 4.
- 13.
- 7.
- 37.
- [Emily] Really?
(Derek speaking in foreign language)
- 13.
- 7.
- 37.
- 37?
- 73.
- 37.
- 35.
- 37.
- [Emily] 37, no way!
- 43.
- 2.
- 37.
(Derek gasping)
- I knew you were gonna do it.
He just "37-ed" and walked away.
- Between 1 and 100.
- Ah, no thanks.
- [Emily] Okay.
- 37.
- [Emily] Oh, perfect. Thank you so much.
- 83.
- 37.
- 37.
- 87.
- 55.
- 37.
- 37.
(Emily gasping)
Can I shake your hand?
- [Derek] I love the thought
you're putting into this.
- 37?
- No, you are kidding me!
Are you real?
- Yeah why?
- Did we ask you this already?
- No.
- Random number between 1 to 100.
- 37.
- 37. Oh, my gosh, yes.
- [Derek] Name a random
number between 1 and 100.
- 37.
- Are you kidding me?
Why?
- It's a good number, I guess, any number.
- [Derek] Where did that come from?
- Imagination, I suppose.
- So, what's going on?
Well, people are actually really bad
at selecting things randomly.
In fact, when asked to
pick a color and a number,
people reliably select blue and 7 the most
across dozens of different cultures.
Psychologists have a
name for this pattern.
The blue-seven phenomenon.
And when picking a random
number between 1 and 100,
it has long been suggested
that the equivalent of
the blue-seven phenomenon
is the number 37.
My producer, Emily, and I
spoke to hundreds of people
to test this theory.
The most common answer was 7,
but maybe that's because
people just expected
that we'd ask them for
numbers between 1 and 10.
The most common two-digit
number really was 37,
much to our surprise.
(Derek and Emily gasping)
So we decided to embark on
the biggest investigation ever
on the number 37.
And it took us to some unexpected places.
- I think 37 is a fascinating number.
It's just really interesting
because it turns up so much.
How many objects are there
here in the room with us
that have a 37 on them?
I'm sure there's more than 1,000 here.
I built the 37 Website in 1994.
I started getting email from
strangers, it's everywhere.
I'm trying to collect them all.
We're tireless.
The tireless cabal of 37 people, yeah.
- Apparently, people choose 37 so reliably
that there's even a widespread
professional magic trick
that relies entirely on
getting an audience member
to just pick 37 out of thin air.
It's called The 37 Force.
- I'm gonna ask you to think
of a number in a moment, okay?
It's a two-digit number, less than 50.
Both numbers are odd, but different.
You could have 19, 17, or 15, but not 11.
Because you see both numbers are the same,
1 and 1 next to one another.
You ready?
One, two, and three.
What number did you think of?
- [Audience] 37.
- 37.
Fascinating.
In the famous Stanford MIT Jargon File,
the origin of hacker slang,
37 is given as the random number of choice
for computer programmers.
â€œWhen groups of people are polled
to pick a random number between 1 and 100,
the most commonly chosen number is 37."
(graphic buzzing)
The thing is, no formal
polls on this actually exist.
The best we found was a
Reddit poll of 1,380 people
from four years ago,
and the most popular number was...
69.
But after that, the winning number was 37.
But we can do better than a sample size
of just 1,000 people.
So we conducted the largest
random number survey ever.
In a community post 3 weeks ago,
we asked people to pick a
random number between 1 and 100.
We received 200,000 responses.
Here are the results as they came in.
It's fascinating to watch
how consistent these
supposedly random numbers are,
from 10,000, to 100,000,
all the way up to 200,000 respondents.
The distribution barely changes,
suggesting that people
from all around the world
think about random numbers
in a particular way,
and it is decidedly not random.
Ignoring the extremes of the scale
because people were primed
by the numbers 1 and 100
in the question itself,
and ignoring 42 and 69
because they're not random,
there are a few numbers that stand out,
which we seem to regard as
more random than the rest.
7,
73,
77,
and 37.
(pensive music)
Then we asked people to pick the number
they thought the fewest others would pick.
The goal was to get rid of
favorite or lucky numbers
and give truly random selections.
And here, the results were even clearer.
Again, ignoring the very
extremes and 50 in the middle,
the most selected numbers
were, far and away, 73 and 37,
which were nearly tied.
The actual least-picked number
in the first question was 90,
followed by 30, 40, 70, 80, and 60.
Multiples of 10 apparently
don't seem that random.
The most picked overall
numbers ignoring the outliers
were 73 and 37.
(pensive music)
Ironically, all this evidence points to 37
and its inversion, 73,
as not being random at all.
So why does everyone pick them?
Well, one argument
is that this is just how
people perceive randomness.
37, does that feel random to you?
- Yeah. Yeah, it does.
- [Derek] Yeah, 50 wouldn't be random?
- No.
- [Derek] No.
- It would be too contrived.
- [Derek] Yeah.
- Yeah, it's too central
- I think people think that even numbers
are less random than odd numbers.
- 5 feels not random, 9
and 1 feel too extreme,
so people tend towards 3 and 7.
- This is backed up by the fact
that every one of the
top numbers in our survey
consisted of 3s and 7s.
In fact, 3 and 7 were
the most selected digits
on both questions.
But there's also a mathematical case
for humanity's number of choice
because it's not just odd numbers,
but specifically primes,
which feel like the most random numbers.
Notice how we ignore odds ending in 5s
or how something like 39
still feels a little less random than 37?
Primes feel random for
at least two reasons.
First, they don't appear
as much in our lives.
I mean, pixel counts, fruit
boxes, square footage.
We live in a composite world
with multiple dimensions
that multiply together,
so we just don't see primes
much past the single digits.
Second, we don't have
a formula for primes.
If you have a prime number
and you want to find the next one,
you have no choice but
to check every number
until you find a prime.
The closest thing we have to a formula
is the prime number theorem,
which gives the approximation
that the nth prime number occurs around n
times natural log of n.
For example, the 1,000th prime number
should be around 6,908.
And it's close, but certainly not exact.
So primes essentially occur at random,
but of all the primes, 37
has reason to stand out.
(pensive music)
If we were to find the prime
factors of every number,
we would see that 2 is
the smallest prime factor
for exactly 1/2 of them,
all of the even numbers.
And 3 is the smallest prime factor
for 1/6 of all numbers,
anything that's divisible
by 3 but not by 2 and so on.
As we pick larger and larger primes,
they form the smallest prime factor
for fewer and fewer integers.
But, what if we track the
second smallest prime factor
of each number?
Well, first, we have 3,
which is the second
prime factor of a number.
Only when the number is
divisible by both 2 and 3
or divisible by 6.
So 1/6 of all numbers have
a second prime factor of 3.
And as we keep going,
which number will end up
at the balancing point?
This is the median second
prime factor of all numbers,
all numbers from 1 all
the way up to a googol
and off to infinity.
Would you believe that that number is 37?
(pensive music)
Let's take a look at 5.
5 is the second prime factor
only when a number is
divisible by 5 and 3,
but not 2.
Or 5 and 2, but not 3.
In the first case, a
number divisible by 5 and 3
means it's divisible by 15,
so that's 1/15 of all numbers.
But it also can't be divisible by 2.
So 1/2 of 1/15 is 1/30 of all numbers.
In the second case,
a number divisible by 5 and 2
means it's divisible by 10,
but it cannot be divisible by 3.
So we're left with 1/10 times 2/3
equals 1/15 of all numbers.
Adding up these two cases,
we get that 1/10 of all numbers
have 5 as their second prime factor.
And we can repeat this
for the next prime, 7.
Just take each of these cases
and add them up to get
that 1/15 of all integers
have a second prime factor of 7.
And so on.
Keeping a running total,
we quickly approach a balancing point
for the second prime
factor across all integers.
And then we reach it.
So the median second prime
factor of all numbers is 37.
Half of numbers have a second
prime factor of 37 or less.
There are other remarkable
qualities about 37 as a prime.
It's an irregular prime, a
Cuban prime, a lucky prime,
a sexy prime, a permutable
prime, a Padovan prime.
And at this point,
mathematicians might just be
making up types of primes.
- 37's identity as a
prime number is so strong
that the same day I first
learned the number 37,
I learned it was prime.
This was one of my first
books as a toddler.
It teaches you every number from 1 to 100
with a short story or fun fact for each.
So for 26, that's how many
letters in the alphabet.
Or for 30, they give
the days of September.
Or for 52, that's how
many cards are in a deck.
Except 37.
(pages rustling)
(jaunty music)
It's a prime number.
Nothing goes into it.
Someday, you'll understand.
I did not like that.
I understood every other number,
so I also wanted to understand 37.
So, that number has nagged me ever since,
and now this video is being
made some 20 years later.
- [Derek] Not convinced yet?
- If you take a number that
is a multiple of 37 already,
like 1, 3, 6, 9, that's 37 squared,
and then you reverse it,
and then you stick a 0
in between every digit,
then that number is a multiple of 37.
And I literally spent
the next month on the bus
trying to prove that
fact, which I finally did.
Just rattle off a six-digit number.
Tell me any six-digit number.
- 413,625.
- And it's not divisible by 37.
So how did I figure that out?
There's a trick for that.
- Is this your like party
trick that you can bring out?
- Surprisingly,
it doesn't impress as many
people as you would think.
I think it should impress everybody.
- But there's also a practical reason
37 is an important number for humanity.
Say you are faced with a choice
that is both immediate and final,
like whether to rent the
apartment you've just toured
or whether to accept a
job offer you received.
Or it can be as small
as whether to stop the next
gas station on a road trip.
These are all problems
where you can't assess
all the options at once
and then decide.
With each option you encounter,
you need to decide whether to
accept it or reject it forever
and see what comes next.
In these scenarios,
it feels impossible to
make the best choice.
If you select too early,
you'll probably never
even see the best option.
But if you select too late,
well, then you've probably
rejected the best option already.
So your best bet is
somewhere in the middle.
There, you know at least some information
from the options you've seen,
and you have some choice,
to select or pass.
But how do you know
exactly when to decide?
The optimal strategy looks like this.
First, you need to see some options
and reject them automatically
just to learn what's out there.
And then at a certain stopping point, S,
you need to stop rejecting them
and start evaluating whether an option
is the best you've seen so far.
If it is, then select it.
But when should that stopping point be?
We need to work out which stopping point
maximizes our chances of
picking the best option.
We can calculate these chances.
For each spot, find the probability
that the best option is located there
times the probability we get
there from stopping point S.
Then, add these probabilities
up across every spot.
Now, the chance of the best
option being in any spot
is just random.
If there are N options in total, it's 1/N,
but it's a little harder
to find the chances of
getting to each spot.
Say the best option is in
the next spot after S, S + 1.
What are the chances we get there?
Well, since this is the next spot over
from the stopping point,
we have 100% chance of getting there.
So we are guaranteed to
visit it and select it.
But if the true best
option is in spot S + 2,
well, there's a small
chance we'll miss it.
If the best of all the previous options
is sitting in spot S + 1,
we would just pick that and stop looking
before reaching S + 2.
There's a one in S + 1
chance of this happening.
So the chances we do get to spot S + 2
to pick the true best
option is 1 minus that,
or S over S + 1.
This same calculation continues
up until the last spot N.
We only get here
if we've been passing
on every option so far,
which means that one
of the first S options
must have been the best
of the total N - 1 options we've seen.
In total, this gives us the expression 1/N
times 1, + S over S + 1, plus
S over S + 2, and so on,
all the way up to S over N - 1.
Factoring out the S,
the sum inside the parentheses
approximates the function
1/x going from S to N.
(pensive music)
Taking that integral, we get
the natural log of N over S.
So the probability we
select the best option
is S over N times the
natural log of N over S.
To maximize this probability,
we can find the peak of this function
by setting its derivative to 0,
and this gives the natural
log of S over N equals -1.
So S over N equals 1 over e,
or about 37%.
So explore
and reject 37% of options
just to get a sense of what's out there,
and then pick the first
option to come along
that's better than all of
the ones you've seen so far.
And your chances of success
using this method
are also 37%.
(pensive music)
This math question is known
as the secretary problem
or the marriage problem,
as it also applies to
hiring the best employees
or even deciding on the best life partner.
Now, it can be impractical
to check 37% of the options
because you don't always know
how many candidates are out there,
but the 37% rule also works for time.
So if you want to get
married, say, in 10 years,
then spend the first 3.7
years seeing what's out there
and then select the next person
who's better than anyone you've seen.
(pensive music)
So 37 is actually important to our lives,
and people seem to
subconsciously recognize this.
We gravitate towards
the number everywhere.
(pensive music)

And you already know who it is.
- It's just fun, right?
The whole thing is just fun.
How many objects are there
here in the room with us
that have a 37 on them?
This is probably on the order
of four digits, I'd say.
There's probably not 10,000,
but I'm sure there's more than 1,000 here.

that has 37 on the head.
I don't even know what that means.
One time, my mom gave
me $37 for my birthday.

- Was your 37th birthday like
the greatest birthday ever?
- I had a big party and I
invited everybody I knew.
The Texas state lottery was $37 million.
So I had two different friends

I must have gotten that in
Germany, but I don't know...
But I don't remember what it was.
Was it like a locker number?
I wouldn't steal a locker number.
I've never stolen for 37.
(speaker 1 laughing)
- Look at that.
Stolen from the highway
when I was on a road trip,
- [Speaker 1] I heard you say,
you never stole anything.
- I have committed a crime.
- [Speaker 1] Yes.
- There was a bookstore on campus
when I was an undergrad at KU,
and there were 37 steps in that staircase.
Useful facts, these are useful facts.
- Do you feel like everyone
gets 37 this much in their lives
or do you feel like
you're just attracting it?
- That's a good question.
You know, the reason I started
was because it seemed
like it turned up a lot.
I started back in the '80s.
There was a comedy routine
by Charles Fleischer,
and he went through this sort
of litany of coincidences
about the number 37,
like there are 37 holes in the
speaker part of a telephone.
(jaunty music)
Shakespeare wrote 37 plays.
There's 37 movements in
Beethoven's Nine Symphonies.
There are all these amazing coincidences
that he rattled off.
I was amazed and I've been
collecting them since like 1981.
Yeah, so 43?
43 years, probably.
(jaunty music)
I built the 37 Website for
the first time in 1994.
I don't know how the
website got out there,
but somehow it got out there.
I started getting email from strangers.
I've got...
Oh, maybe a half a dozen
people from around the world,
who, every week or month,
will post their latest batch of 37s
that they've seen out and about.
- And they've been
doing this for how long?
- 18 years.
- Wow.
- We're tireless.
The tireless cabal of 37 people, yeah.
- Do you have anything to say
to anyone who might be like,
"37, that's just a base-10
representation of that number."
- I am also interested the number 37
in all of its various other forms:
Roman numerals;
binary numbers 100101, by the way;
numbers in any other base.
Yeah, 25 in hexadecimal.
45 in octal.
- And do you think you're
gonna keep looking for a 37
and collecting 37 for your whole life?
- Yeah, yeah, I can't
see any reason to stop.
Yeah, for sure.
- So maybe there's even something innately
universally special about this number.
(pensive music)
We can argue special
coincidences for many numbers,
but we need to finally address
the elephant in the room.
The sheer amount of brain power
37 secretly takes up in
our collective minds.
It's humanity's go-to random number,
one of our most prominent prime numbers,
and most of all, our ideal
number for making decisions.
Maybe that's why we're
inclined to it naturally.
It feels right to us as where
to settle and what to pick.
Though with this video,
we may have ruined
randomness even further.
I mean, the next time anyone asks people
to pick a random number between 1 and 100,
more people than ever
might be saying, "37."
(pensive music)
- It's been the story of my life
that I intend to take
everything that I have here
and turn them all into
individual facts on that website.
But the website's been
there untouched for 27 years
and it hasn't happened.
It doesn't look like
it's ever gonna happen.
- Maybe on the 37th anniversary,
we can get it all done.
- That's a good idea.
That's a good idea.
Because I have time to do
it between now and then,
and that would be...
That's a great idea.
- Once our video comes out,
do you want people to write you
with any instances they see of 37?
You might get swamped, for a little bit.
- 37 is out there, it's everywhere.
I'm trying to collect them all.
Bring it.
Yes, bring it.
(graphic beeping)
