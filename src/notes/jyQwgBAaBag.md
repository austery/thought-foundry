### 引言：一场反直觉的物理辩论

这辆**螺旋桨飞行器**（Propeller Craft: 一种利用螺旋桨提供动力的交通工具）的建造，是为了解决一场物理学辩论，因为其创造者声称它能做到的事情是如此反直觉，以至于它似乎违反了**能量守恒定律**（Law of Conservation of Energy: 物理学基本定律，指在一个孤立系统中，能量总量保持不变）。因此，我来到这里亲自驾驶它，看看它是否真的有效。它安全吗？感觉有点临时拼凑，说实话。我需要一些风。给我一阵风。它有点不平衡，不是吗？

<p class="english-text">This propeller craft was built to settle a physics debate because what its creators claim it can do is so counterintuitive that it seems to violate the law of conservation of energy. So I've come here to drive it myself and see if it really works. And is it safe? It feels makeshift. I'm not gonna lie. I need some wind. Give me a gust. It's a little unbalanced. Isn't it?</p>

### “黑鸟”挑战传统认知

我来到了距离洛杉矶几小时车程的埃尔米拉日（El Mirage）干涸湖床，准备驾驶一辆独一无二的螺旋桨飞行器进行比赛。它叫做**黑鸟**（Blackbird）。我和它的发明者里克（Rick）——“你好！”——以及现任所有者尼尔（Neil）在一起。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I've come to El Mirage, a dry lakebed, a couple hours from Los Angeles to race a one of a kind propeller craft. It's called Blackbird. And I'm here with its inventor, Rick - Howdy! And the current owner, Neil.</p>
</details>

这都始于一个脑筋急转弯：任何风力驱动的车辆能否**顺风行驶速度超过风速**（Downwind Faster Than the Wind, DFTTW: 指车辆在顺风方向上，其对地速度超过了风速）？如果你有一艘**帆船**（Sailboat: 利用风力驱动的船只），并且你正顺风直行。——是的。一旦帆船的速度与风速相同，那么就不再有风了。没错。你无法再推动帆船。所以帆船不能直接顺风行驶速度超过风速。不能直接顺风。——不能直接顺风？不能直接顺风。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It all started with a brain teaser: Can any wind-powered vehicle go directly downwind faster than the wind itself? If you've got a sail boat and you're sailing it straight down, wind. - Yeah. As soon as that sailboat is going the same speed as the wind, then there is no more wind. That is correct. You can't push the sailboat. So sailboats can't just go downwind faster than the wind. Not straight downwind. -Not straight downwind? Not direct downwind.</p>
</details>

想象一艘船漂浮在水面上。随着风力增强，它推动船帆，使船加速。船的速度越来越快，直到其速度与风速完全匹配。但此时，风已无法再推动船帆。我的意思是，如果你从船的参考系来看，就不再有**迎面风**（Apparent Wind: 船只或车辆相对于其所处介质（如空气或水）的相对速度所产生的风）了。没有空气流过船只，因为空气和船只正以相同的速度一起移动。因此，一艘直接顺风行驶的帆船只能达到风速，永远无法超越它，即使没有阻力。但“黑鸟”声称可以做到。它可以直接顺风行驶，速度超过推动它的空气。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Imagine a boat floating in the water. As the wind picks up, it pushes the sail, accelerating the boat. The boat gets faster and faster until its speed exactly matches the wind. But at this point, the wind can't push the sail anymore. I mean, if you imagine it from the frame of reference of the boat, there's no longer any apparent wind. There's no air moving over the boat because the air and the boat are moving together at the same speed. So a sailboat going directly downwind can only match the speed of the wind, never exceed it, even if there's no drag. But the claim is Blackbird can do it. It can go straight downwind faster than the air that is pushing it.</p>
</details>

### 埃尔米拉日的等待与准备

天气预报仍然保持不变。好的，不错。我们现在感觉风速大约是一级。是的。但埃尔米拉日以其风力增强时的状况而闻名……是的，这种情况时有发生。这种情况会发生。我想我们从中间某个地方开始。好的。那么，我们过去吧。我们正前往一个能提供长而直的顺风路径且没有障碍物的地方。我们现在只需要风力增强并保持方向。但我们已经在炎热的沙漠中待了好几个小时，仍然没有风。

<p class="english-text">Well the weather forecast is still holding. Okay, good. We can feel it's at like one now. Yeah. But El Mirage has a reputation of like when it fills in... Yeah, it happens. It happens. I think we start somewhere in the middle. All right. Well, let's, let's move over. We're moving to a spot that will give us a long, straight path downwind with no obstacles. All we need now is for the wind to pick up and maintain its direction. But we've been out here in the hot desert for hours and there is still no wind.</p>

这是吉恩（Gene）。他运营着YouTube频道“Potato Jet”。本视频中所有精彩的无人机镜头都出自他手。所以如果你喜欢相机、设备和令人惊叹的无人机镜头，去看看他的频道吧。这，这大概就是典型的一天。事情就是这样发展的。Derek，我想风已经选择了它的方向。我想把我们移到另一边。我们会设置好。我们会朝这个方向顺风而行。我们会让你进去。让我们开始吧！是的。我想做！
<details>

<p class="english-text">This is Gene. He runs the YouTube channel Potato Jet. All the awesome drone shots in this video are his. So if you like cameras and gear and amazing drone shots, go check out his channel. This is, this is about a typical day. How it goes. Derek, I think the wind is just chosen its direction. I want to move us to the other side. We'll set up. We'll point downwind over in this direction. We'll put you in. Let's make it happen! Yes. I want to do it!</p>
</details>

你的脚需要伸得很远。所以会感觉非常斜躺。所以也许我需要……继续。我身后需要放点什么吗？是的！我很后仰。是的。让我看看我能找到什么。有点吓人，呃，不能完全踩下刹车。所以你差不多正好在尺寸的极限。是的。你不会想再小一点。呃，那么转向是……——向左推，——向左推。——向右拉。——向右拉。
<details>

<p class="english-text">Your feet need to go a long way down. So it'll feel really recumbant. So maybe I need to... Keep going. Should I get something behind me? Yup! I'm very reclined. Yeah. Let me see what I can find. It's slightly terrifying to, uh, not be able to push the brake all the way. So you're kind of right at the limit of size. Yeah. You wouldn't want to be any smaller. Uh, so steering is I... - Push to go left, -Push to go left. -Pull to go right. -Pull to go right.</p>
</details>

我用右手转向，同时必须用左手控制螺旋桨叶片的**桨距**（Pitch: 螺旋桨叶片相对于其旋转平面的角度，影响推力）。然后，比如当我快到终点或需要真正减速时，正确的操作是向后拉吗？你是说正确的操作是向前推？我很高兴这里的两位专家在紧急情况下，比如我只想停车时，意见不一。
<details>

<p class="english-text">While steering with my right hand, I have to control the pitch of the propeller blades with my left hand. And then in terms of like, when I'm getting to the end or something where I really want to slow down, the right move is pull back? You're saying the right move is push forward? I'm glad that the two experts here are disagreeing on what to do in the emergency case of like, I just want to stop the vehicle.</p>
</details>

Rick: 感受哪个能让你减速，就那样做。

[紧张的笑声] 没有一个通用的规则真是太可怕了。嗯，呃，这很紧张。我从未尝试过驾驶一辆仅靠屁股下面的网状吊床支撑的车辆，顺风行驶速度超过风速。感觉就像在一个滚动的棺材里。它只是，呃，粗制滥造地拼凑起来的，但我很兴奋能尝试它。我也很兴奋能活下来。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">[nervous laughter] It's just terrifying not to have a, a blanket rule. Well, uh, this is intense. I have never tried to go faster than the wind downwind in a vehicle where I'm just supported by this mesh hammock under my butt. It feels like being in a rolling coffin. It's just been uh shoddily put together, but I'm excited to try it. And I'm excited to survive.</p>
</details>

### 第一次尝试：风力不足的遗憾

你可以看看那根橙色的绳子。它显示风正在我身后增强。这正是我需要的。“黑鸟”的前部有一个**风向标**（Telltale: 一小块绳子或布条，用于指示风向），它显示风吹向哪个方向。要直接顺风行驶，我只需要跟着风向标。所以它应该笔直地指向前方。现在，如果我达到**风速**（Wind Speed: 空气流动的速度），风向标应该会垂直下垂，因为实际上我将处于静止的空气中。我将以与风完全相同的速度移动。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You can look at that orange string right there. It's showing that the wind is picking up behind me. This is what I need. On the front of Blackbird, there's a, telltale, a little piece of string, which shows which way the wind is blowing. To drive straight downwind. I just need to follow the telltale. So it should be pointing straight out in front. Now, if I get up to wind speed, the telltale should drop straight down because effectively I'll be in still air. I'll be moving exactly the same speed as the wind.</p>
</details>

好的，祝你好运，Derek！

<p class="english-text">- Thank you.</p>
</details>

我希望我能活下来。加油，加油。我需要一些风。给我一阵风。现在，如果我真的能跑得比风快，风向标就应该翻转过来，直指着我，表明我正经历着**表观逆风**（Apparent Headwind: 车辆相对于空气的相对运动方向与车头方向相反，即使实际风向是顺风），尽管站在地面上感受到的真实风是从后面吹来的。我们正直接顺风行驶。我跑了多少？六英里每小时。绳子只是悬着。你看到绳子悬在那里了吗？哦，我只需要一阵风。我只需要一点风。这就是我所需要的。我会，呃，在这里踩刹车。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I hope I survive this. Come on, come on. I need some wind. Give me a gust. Now, if I can actually go faster than the wind, the telltale should flip around and point straight at me, indicating that I have an apparent headwind, even though the true wind, standing on the ground, is coming from behind. We're going straight downwind. What have I got? Six miles an hour. The string is just dangling. You see the string dangling there? Oh, I just need a gust right here. I just need a bit of wind. That's all I need. I will, uh, hop on the brakes here.</p>
</details>

伙计，我们太接近了。我的意思是，我看到那根绳子垂下来。我当时想，好吧，就是这样了。我们继续。然后不幸的是。有一次它垂着，我问：“我们速度是多少？”他说：“我们是五六英里每小时。”我心想：“该死。”因为他几乎正好是风速。是的。五六英里每小时。只是不足以让你——对——超过那里。我只需要那额外的几英里每小时。英里每小时。八英里每小时是绝对最低速度，十英里每小时就相当不错了。是的。是的。嗯，我等不及了。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Man, we were so close. I mean, I saw that string dangling down. I was like, okay, this is it. Let's keep going. And then unfortunately. At one point it was dangling and I asked, what speed are we? And he said, we're five or six miles an hour. And I'm like damn. Cause he's almost exactly wind speed. Yep. Five or six miles an hour. Just not enough to get you - right - past there. I needed just like that extra few. Miles an hour. 8's kinda the absolute minimum, 10 is pretty healthy. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I can't wait.</p>

### 帆船如何超越风速？

现在你可能想知道，这辆车理论上怎么可能跑得比风快。嗯，帆船就能做到。只要它们以某个角度逆风行驶。在这种情况下，船帆的作用就像机翼，空气在外侧弯曲表面上的流速快于内侧，从而产生**升力**（Lift: 垂直于迎面风方向的力）。这种升力的一部分是向前的。因此，当这种向前的力等于船上所有向后推动的阻力时，就达到了最大速度。有些船可以达到风速的三到四倍。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now you might be wondering how it's even theoretically possible for this vehicle to go faster than the wind will. Well sailboats can do it. As long as they're traveling at some angle to the wind. In this case, the sail acts like a wing air flows faster over the outer curved surface than the inner side, which generates lift a force perpendicular to the apparent wind. A component of this lift force is in the forward direction. So maximum speed is reached when this forward force is equal to all the drag forces on the boat, pushing it backwards. Some boats can go three or four times wind speed.</p>
</details>

有人曾问过一个问题。如果一艘帆船正在**迎风转向**（Tacking: 帆船逆风Z字形航行以获得前进动力）顺风行驶，它能否实现**有效对地速度**（Velocity Made Good, VMG: 船只在特定方向上（例如直接顺风或逆风）的实际前进速度）直接顺风？它能打败——如果我，如果我在空中放一个气球，帆船能否通过迎风转向的方式，比气球更快到达目的地？我当时不知道答案。结果是，帆船以某个角度逆风航行时，其速度可以足够快，以至于其最终直接顺风的速度比风本身还要快。换句话说，它可以比一个随风漂流的气球更快。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Somebody had asked the question. If a sailboat is tacking down, wind, can it do a VMG velocity made good directly downwind? Can it beat - if I, if I release a balloon in the air, can the sailboat tack its way down and beat the balloon to its destination? And I didn't know the answer. It turns out that sailing at some angle to the wind, a sailboat can go enough faster that it's resulting velocity directly downwind is faster than the wind itself. In other words, it can beat a balloon that is just drifting on the wind.</p>
</details>

我喜欢脑筋急转弯。我就是喜欢玩脑筋急转弯。所以我觉得这非常接近一个好的脑筋急转弯，但现在。这只是一个问题。如果我们让它直接顺风行驶，那么人们肯定会说不行。如果地球是一个圆柱体而不是球体，我就可以让一艘帆船持续地顺风迎风转向。风沿着地球，这个圆柱形的地球吹拂。帆船只是螺旋式地向下航行。——嗯。如果我把两艘帆船，一艘放在一边，它们都可以这样做……嗯。那是一个螺旋桨。实际上，它们的帆构成了一个螺旋桨，一个在这片土地上行驶速度比风本身还快的螺旋桨。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I love brainteasers. I just love doing brainteaser. So I thought this is really close to a good brain teaser, but it's right now. It's just a question though. If we make it go straight downwind and then people were definitely going to say no. If the earth were a cylinder, instead of a sphere, I can have a sailboat on a continuous downwind tack. The wind is going along the earth, this cylindrical earth. And the sailboat is just spiraling its way down. - Hmm. If I put two sailboats, one on either side, they can both do this... Well. That's a prop. Effectively their sales make a propeller, a propeller that is traveling down this earth faster than the wind itself.</p>

### 在线辩论与模型验证

我当时在我上的两个论坛上发了帖子。对。我以为人们一开始会说：“不，永远不会成功。”然后我说：“好吧，它是这样运作的。”他们就会说：“哦，[脏话]你骗了我们。”天哪，我不可能错得更离谱了。这显然很愚蠢。风不是某种魔法。我们都想相信永动机，但我目前还不明白这个论点的逻辑。好的。这显然是假的。任何有点头绪的人都应该看到这里的问题。一旦你达到风速，什么能让它超越那个速度呢？我不是一个笨人，但我无法理解。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It was, I posted on two forums that I was on. Right. And I thought people are initially going to go, no, never work. And then I say, okay, here's how it works. And they go oh, [bleep] you got us. Boy, I couldn't have possibly been more wrong. This is, obviously, stupid. Wind isn't some kind of magic. We all want to believe in perpetual motion, but I just don't see the logic of this argument as yet. Okay. This is clearly fake. Anyone with a clue should see the problem here. Once you reach wind speed, what powers it past that? I am not a stupid person, but I cannot understand.</p>
</details>

最终我们说：“好吧，如果我们建造一个小型模型，把它放在跑步机上，那就能一劳永逸了。对吧。”它运行得非常好。现在你，你用这个勺叉把它挡住？否则它会直接爬到跑步机的顶部。是的，我阻止它前进，但互联网上的人就是不相信他。他们认为这是假的。甚至物理学教授也争辩说，跑步机不是现实世界的好类比。我当时想，从字面上看，物理学的第一天就是**惯性参考系**（Inertial Frames: 在其中牛顿第一定律成立的参考系），对吧？你移动还是空气移动，这都无关紧要。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Ultimately we said, okay, if we build a little model of one and put it on a treadmill that just puts it to bed. Right. And it worked really well. Now you, you're holding it back with this spork? otherwise it'll climb right up the top of the treadmill. Yeah I'm keeping it from coming forward, But people on the internet just wouldn't believe him. They thought it was fake. And even physics professors were arguing that the treadmill wasn't a good analog of the real world. And I'm like literally day one, physics is inertial frames, right? It doesn't matter if you're moving or the air is moving.</p>
</details>

其他人则说有磁铁，有电线。你会说有看不见的风扇。所以我们做了一个演示，你知道，——没有风扇——窗帘没有动等等。最后他说，我们必须建造实物。好的。我们正在加速。我看到我们正以七、七英里每小时，八英里每小时的速度前进。加油。你可以的。加油。哦哦。我对这个螺旋桨感到非常难过。所以我猜这意味着链条掉了。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The others were saying there's magnets, there's wires. And you go there's fans out of view. So then we do one showing, you know, - no fans - the curtains aren't moving and stuff. And finally he says, we got to build the real thing. Okay. We are cooking. I see we're going seven, seven miles an hour, eight miles an hour. Come on. You got it. Come on. Uh oh. I'm very sad about this propeller. So I'm guessing this means the chain has come off.</p>
</details>

感觉如何？很有趣。我能感觉到我们正在加速。我能看到它在旋转。我看到我们达到了大约八英里每小时，九英里每小时的速度。我当时想，哦，我们就要成功了。你知道吗？然后突然间，我仍然感觉自己在前进，但我注意到螺旋桨没有旋转，我心想，哦，那是一个糟糕的迹象。所以，呃，是的。然后我们不得不停下来修理，修理链条。拿不准时就用大扳手。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How did it feel? It was a lot of fun. I could feel us picking up speed. I could see it spinning. I could see that we got up to like eight miles an hour, nine miles an hour. And I was like, oh, we're just going to do it. You know? And then all of a sudden I still felt like I was going, but I noticed that the prop wasn't spinning, and I thought, oh, that's a terrible sign. So, uh, yeah. Then we had to stop and fix the, fix the chain. When in doubt use a bigger wrench.</p>

### “黑鸟”的独特工作原理

那么关于这辆车，事情是这样的。它不像你想象的那样。我敢打赌，你想象的是当风吹到那个螺旋桨上时，它会顺着风推动的方向旋转。然后驱动车轮。但实际上它不是这样工作的。它的工作方式是风从后面推动它。而且因为它是一个钝体，它只是一个放在沙漠中的物体。它开始向前滚动一点点。现在，这导致车轮转动，并且它们以一种与风推动方向相反的方式与螺旋桨齿轮连接，使其反向旋转。所以，这个螺旋桨不是像风车那样运作，而是像风扇一样向后推动空气。这就是推动飞行器前进的原因。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So here's the thing about this vehicle. It's not what it looks like. What you imagine. I bet is that when the wind blows on that propeller, it spins the way the wind is pushing it. And that drives the wheels. But that's actually not how this works. The way it works is the wind pushes it from behind. And just because it's a bluff body, it's just an object sitting out in the desert. It starts to roll forwards a little bit. Now that causes the wheels to turn and they're geared to the propeller in such a way that they turn it opposite the direction the wind is pushing it. So rather than this propeller operating like a windmill, it spins like a fan pushing air backwards. And that's what drives the craft forwards.</p>
</details>

所以，就像你从未想过会做的一件疯狂事情，在干涸的湖床上驾驶一辆疯狂的螺旋桨飞行器，一些物理学教授认为它违反了科学定律。是的。那很酷。

### 风险评估与再次尝试

Derek，准备好了吗？如果你觉得可以，我就准备好了。好的。我们希望能赶上其中一阵风。风很大，螺旋桨也在转动，但肯定有什么地方不对劲。看看那个螺旋桨。它有点不平衡，不是吗？拉桨距！好。那么计划是什么？如果你感觉到过度震动。我想我们得停止它。是的。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Derek, ready to rock.? If you think so, I'm ready. All right. We're hoping we can catch one of these puffs. The wind is strong and the prop is turning, but something is definitely wrong. Just look at that propelorl. It' a little unbalanced, isn't it? Pull the pitch! Good. So what's the game plan? If you feel excessive vibration. I think we got to pull the trigger on it. Yeah.</p>
</details>

我想直接说：我不认为我会在这种风中驾驶它。如果你希望我开，我会开。我的意思是，如果有机会，我会开，但我非常乐意……我来这里不是为了开车。所以你来开吧。如果你想做的话。如果你要决定是否进去，比如那里有一个。有没有一个点你会说那太多了？嗯，就今天和目前的情况而言？大约15。好的。所以大约15是我们之前测量的。你现在看到什么？呃……感觉像。对我来说是15。是的。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I want to go right out and say: I don't think I would drive it in this wind. I will, if you would like me to. I mean, I will, I will given the opportunity, but I'm more than hap... I didn't come here to drive. So you drive it. If you want to do it. If you were going to decide about getting in like it there a. Is there a point where you say that's too much? Um, for today and the way things are? 15 ish. Okay. So 15ish is what we were measuring like earlier. What are you seeing now? Ehh... That feels like. 15 To me. Yeah.</p>
</details>

我已经在外面待了好几个小时，一开始只是等着出发。现在它好像坏了，然后我想，我们可以走，但它可能会自己散架。而且风速很高。这肯定很危险。哦天哪。我们拍到了吗？你拍到了吗？我拍到了，哦不！呃，现在的情况是，他们对看到的晃动和摇摆感到非常不安。他们担心整个结构部件会断成两截，整个螺旋桨会掉到驾驶员身上。所以他们有点，嗯，不情愿让我继续驾驶。所以那个基本上建造它的人，他将亲自冒险坐在驾驶座上。然后如果它没有散架，那么也许我之后还有一次机会。所以，这就是现在的情况。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I've been out there for several hours and first it was just waiting to go. And now it's like, it's broken and now I was like, we can go, but it might shake itself apart. And the wind is on the high end. This is sketchy for sure. Oh God. Did We get that on camera? Did you? I did, Oh no! Uh, what's happening is they're getting pretty uncomfortable with what they saw in terms of the shake, the wobble. And they're worried that it's gonna like break in half the whole structural component and the whole propeller is going to come down on whoever's driving. So they're a little bit, um, reticent to let me keep driving. So the guy who basically built it, he's going to risk himself in the driver's seat. And then if it's not shaking itself apart, then maybe I get another shot after. So that's a, that's the word right now.</p>
</details>

在里克（Rick）的驾驶中，它似乎没有晃动得很厉害。所以他们认为我跳进去是安全的。你不认为这风比……大很多。我认为。我真的认为。但这意味着你几乎肯定会成功，但你必须管理好你的极限。你认为你需要比风快多少？是的。——你要做吗？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In Rick's run, it didn't seem to shake very much. So they think it's safe for me to jump in. You don't think this wind is much more than. I do. I really do. But it means that you will have nearly a guaranteed success, but you just got to manage your limit. How much faster than the wind do you think you need to go? Yeah. -You doing it?</p>
</details>

伙计，感觉赌注越来越高了。比如他们之前不想让我开，因为风太大了。但现在风更大了，他们却觉得我可以驾驶它了。所以我不知道该说什么。这很吓人，但我也为此而来。我想做。让我上场吧，教练。如果这东西不散架，也许这次我能跑得比风快。我要上那辆车，以最快的速度朝那个方向冲过去。

<p class="english-text">Man, It feels like just the stakes keep getting higher. Like they didn't want me to run it before 'cause it was too windy. But like now it's windier, but they're comfortable with me piloting it. So I don't know what to say. This is frightening, but also I came here for this. I want to do it. Put me in coach. If this thing doesn't fall apart, maybe I'll be able. To go faster than the wind this time. I'm getting in that vehicle and I'm headed that way as fast as I can.</p>

### 最终的胜利：超越风速的瞬间

夕阳西下，我们准备冲刺。这是我最后一次机会，能顺风行驶速度超过风速。伙计们，就是这次了。后退，稍微向左一点，这样我就可以直冲**风向袋**（Windsock: 用于指示风向和风速的锥形布袋）了。看起来我们快达到风速了。“黑鸟”越来越快。我只是希望它能超越风速。加油，加油，加油。加速，和我一起加速。加油，耶！呜呼！

<p class="english-text">The sun is setting and we're going for it. This is the last chance for me to go faster than the wind downwind. This is the one guys. Back, a little left so that I can make a straight shot down at the windsock. It looks like we're coming up on wind speed here. Blackbird is getting faster and faster. I'm just willing it to go past the wind speed. Come on, come on, come on. Speed up, speed up with me. Come on, yeah. Wooooo!</p>

是的……看吧。风向标直指着我，显示出表观逆风，而风向袋则显示真实风向是相反的。我跑得比风快。减速，Derek。迎风转向，迎风转向！哦，那真是……天哪，我的心跳加速了。

<p class="english-text">Yeah.... And there you have it. The telltale is pointing straight back at me showing an apparent headwind while the windsock shows the true wind is in the opposite direction. I'm going faster than the wind. Slow it down Derek. Pull tack, pull tack! Oooh, that was... God damn that got my heart rate up.</p>

Rick: Derek，吓死我们了。——看起来很吓人吗？因为感觉没那么糟。

### 深入解析：能量从何而来？

那么它到底是如何运作的呢？嗯，我为这个视频工作了好几个星期，但一直没有真正理解它是如何运作的。所以我想和大家分享一下我的理解方式。那么，如果这辆车以风速行驶，那么车上就没有相对的空气运动。那么它如何能继续加速呢？如果它像一个需要空气流过才能转动的风车，那么它就不会再加速了，但它不是这样运作的。
<details>

<p class="english-text">So how does it actually work? Well, I worked on this video for weeks without really understanding how it works. So I want to share with you the way that I understand it. So if this vehicle is moving at the speed of the wind well, then there's no relative air motion over the cart. So how can it keep accelerating? If this were like a windmill that required air to flow over it in order to turn well, then it wouldn't accelerate anymore, but that's not how this operates.</p>
</details>

这个螺旋桨是作为**风扇**（Fan: 一种通过旋转叶片推动空气的装置）运作的，这意味着如果你想象这是静止的空气，螺旋桨可以向下击打一些空气分子，将它们向后推，从而获得**推力**（Thrust: 推动物体前进的力）。这就像你的车上装了一个风扇。所以，即使在静止的空气中，车上装一个风扇也会把你向前吹。但这引出了一个想法，感觉我们好像凭空获得了能量。驱动风扇的能量来自哪里？如果它来自车轮，为什么它减慢我们的速度不会比风扇推动我们前进的速度更多呢？

<p class="english-text">This propeller operates as a fan, which means if you imagine this still air, the propeller can come down and hit some of these air molecules, pushing them backwards and therefore get thrust. It's like having a fan on your cart. So of course even in still air, having a fan on the cart will blow you forwards. But that brings up this idea of it feels like we're getting energy from nowhere. Where's the energy to power the fan coming from? If it's coming from the wheels, why doesn't that slow us down more than the fan manages to blow us back.</p>
</details>

答案是，你相对于地面移动的速度，与你相对于空气移动的速度不同，因为你有顺风。所以我喜欢这样想象：空气无处不在，都以每小时10公里的速度向那个方向移动。现在，即使我们以每小时10公里的速度前进，我们仍然可以向后推动空气。因此，如果你从一个静止的参考点观察空气的剖面图，你会看到螺旋桨后面的风会比其他地方的风顺风移动得更慢。那是因为这个螺旋桨从风中提取了一些能量，并将其转化为这辆车的**动能**（Kinetic Energy: 物体因运动而拥有的能量）。
<details>

<p class="english-text">And the answer to that is that you're moving at a different speed over the ground. than you're moving through the air because you have that tailwind. So the way I like to imagine it is like this: there's air everywhere going 10 kilometers per hour down that way. Now, even if we're going 10 kilometers per hour, we can still push air backwards. And so if you were to look at a profile of the air in a stationary reference point, you would see that the wind behind the propeller would be moving more slowly downwind than all the other wind. That's because this propeller has taken some of the energy out of that wind and converted it into the kinetic energy of this cart.</p>
</details>

所以在螺旋桨后面，风速会是，比如说，每小时八公里，而在其他地方，风速会是每小时十公里。因此，螺旋桨后面这股风的能量已经转化到车上，使其向前加速。所以它前进的速度比风快。即使这辆车前进的速度比风速快，螺旋桨仍然可以向后推动空气，减缓顺风，并从中获取部分风的能量，将其转化为这辆车的动能。现在，“黑鸟”的制造者们成功创造了一项纪录，他们达到了风速的2.8倍。所以对我来说，从所有的演示以及我亲自驾驶这辆车的经验来看，这在物理上是可能的。确实有一种方法可以驾驶一辆顺风行驶速度超过风速的车辆。但我知道这非常反直觉，所以我预计评论区会有很多反对意见。我唯一的请求是，请文明发言。

<p class="english-text">So behind the propeller, there would be, say, eight kilometer per hour, wind and everywhere else, there would be 10 kilometer per hour wind. So the energy from this wind behind the propeller has gone into the cart into accelerating it forwards. So it is moving forward faster than the wind. Even when this is moving forward, faster than wind speed, the propeller can still push the air backwards, slowing down that tailwind and taking some of that wind's energy, converting it into the kinetic energy of this vehicle. Now the people who made Blackbird managed to get a record, they got up to 2.8 times the wind speed. So it is obvious to me from all of the demonstrations and from riding in the vehicle myself, that this is physically possible. There is a way to drive a vehicle that goes downwind faster than the wind. But I know it is so counterintuitive that I expect a lot of pushback in the comments. My only request is please be civil.</p>
