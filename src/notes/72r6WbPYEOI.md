### 十月市场收官：坚韧中收涨

大家好，欢迎回到新一期的“市场收盘”节目。今天是十月的最后一天，我们即将结束十月份的行情。今年只剩下两个月了，看起来今天我们将以一个上涨的姿态收官。感谢大家的到来，我们有很多内容要讨论，自从早上市开盘直播以来，又出现了很多头条新闻。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right. Hello everybody. Welcome back to another episode of the market close. It is the last day of October and we are ending out the month of October. Two months left of the year and it looks like folks we are going to get a green close to the end of the day. Thank you everybody for being here. We got a lot to talk about. Lots of headlines since we were live on the market open.</p>
</details>

如果你看一下标普500指数，今天上涨了约0.5%，表现还不错。Palantir 看起来将收于200美元以上，还有13分钟收盘，希望我们能看到它收在200美元上方。它曾一度跌至197美元，所以能回升到200美元以上是非常好的迹象。Robin Hood 曾跌至43美元，现在回到147美元，也不错。Google 今天相对平稳，报281美元。AMD 上涨1%，SoFi 上涨1.5%。自开盘以来，今天整体行情相当平淡。Amazon 报246美元，虽然有所回落，但仍然保持了10%的涨幅，对于一个**超大规模云服务提供商**（Hyperscaler: 指提供大规模、可扩展云计算服务的公司，如亚马逊AWS、谷歌云等）来说，这相当惊人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If you take a look right here at the S&P 500 up about half a percent on the day which is not too bad. 68405. It looks like Palanteer will give us the $200 close. We got 13 minutes left. Hopefully we get that close above 200. We did dip all the way to 197. So the fact that it's coming back above 200 is very nice to see. Robin Hood dipped to 43, back to 147. Not too bad. Google relatively flat on the day at 281. AMD's up 1%. SoFi is up 1.5. I mean, it's been a pretty flat day since the market open. Amazon 246 did lose a little bit of love, but still holding that 10% move, which is incredible for a hyperscaler.</p>
</details>

然而，Meta 的股价确实遭受重创。我没有增持 Meta，今天股价下跌2.48%，报649美元。盘中一度跌至645美元。我本以为他们不会让它跌破650美元。看来市场对其**资本支出**（Capex: Capital Expenditure，指公司用于购买、维护或升级固定资产的资金）存在深层的结构性担忧。我们稍后会更深入地讨论 Meta，如果华尔街在一个上涨的日子，而且是本月最后一天，对 Meta 如此恐惧，那么担忧一定比表面看到的更深。当然，今天可能也有很多期权到期，所以可能只是算法交易在作祟，但 Meta 今天又下跌了2%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, Meta, they are absolutely taking to town. I did not buy more Meta. 649 down 2.48% on the day. They put it at 645 at one point. I didn't think they would let it break 650. It seems like there is a deep structural concern about capex and we'll talk more about Meta and it has to go deeper than the surface level concerns if the street is this scared on a green day on the last day of the month for Meta. Now you probably have a lot of options that are expiring today as well. So it could just be ALOS but uh Meta right here 649 that one is down another 2% of the day.</p>
</details>

比特币的十月可能会收跌。当然，今天还有大约九到十个小时，所以如果比特币出现一个5000美元的大阳线，或许还能撑住。但如果真的收跌，这将是六年来比特币首次在十月下跌。所以这是值得关注的一点。我们还有大约九个小时看比特币如何收盘。以太坊目前在3800美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Bitcoin will end red for October. I mean we do have um what nine 10 more hours in the day. So maybe Bitcoin, if it gets a $5,000 candle, will be able to hold up, but if it does go red, it will be the first red October, not really October for Bitcoin, uh, for the first time in six years. So, it's one thing to look out for. We do have about nine more hours to see how Bitcoin closes. Ethereum right there at 3,800.</p>
</details>

总的来说，这是一个令人难以置信的月份，也是一个疯狂的月份。这个月发生了很多不同的事情，整个星期都伴随着美联储降息、大型科技公司财报等等，有点疯狂。但我确实认为这对股市来说是一个强劲的月份。如果我们今天能收涨，而且看起来会的，这将是连续第六个月上涨。市场的韧性值得称赞。那些在十月十日或十月十七日等考验信念的日子里抄底的人，现在正获得回报。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, look, I mean, overall, it's been an incredible month. It's been a wild month. We had a lot of different things happen this month, this entire week with the Fed cuts, big tech earnings, etc. has been kind of crazy, but I do think it has been a strong month for the stock market, if we do end green today, which it looks like we will, it'll be six months of green in a row. The resiliency of the market is something to be commended. And those who bought the dip when it was time to buy the dip, whether it was October 10th or October 17th, variety of days this month that definitely test the conviction, uh, you are being rewarded.</p>

### 嘉宾连线：伊隆·马斯克与汤姆·李的市场洞察

万圣节我们还看到了伊隆·马斯克和乔·罗根的播客。这是伊隆在谈论飞行汽车。他提到未来本应有飞行汽车，但我们现在还没有。罗根问他是否正在积极考虑制造电动飞行汽车，伊隆则卖了个关子，说他不能在正式发布前透露细节，但他认为这有潜力成为有史以来最令人难忘的产品发布会。关于飞行汽车和 Roadster 的合作传闻已经很久了，伊隆这次算是旧事重提。谁知道呢，也许未来五年我们真的能看到它。

<details>

<p class="english-text">And we got an Elon and Rogan podcast for Halloween. Here's Elon talking about flying cars. of the the future was supposed to have flying cars, but we don't have flying cars. >> So, you're going to be able to fly? >> Well, I mean, uh, I think if Peter wants a flying car, we should should be able to buy one. >> He's talking about Peter Teal. >> So, you are you actively considering making an electric flying car? Is this like a real thing? >> Well, I have to see in the >> in the demo. So when you do this, like are are you going to have a retractable wing? Like what is the idea behind this? >> Don't be sly. Come on. >> I I I can't I can't uh do the unveil before the unveil. Um but um >> tell me off air then. I I I it h look I I think it has a shot at being the most memorable um product unveil ever. It has a shot. So there you go. Some uh nice threeh hour Halloween action with Mr. Joe Rogan and Elon Musk. I mean there's been rumors of this flying car roadster collaboration for a long time. So Elon kind of just bringing those back and who knows maybe we get that going into the next five years.</p>
</details>

另外，我们还看到了 Tom Lee 的评论。他整个星期都在中东旅行，所以我们没怎么听到他的消息。但就在大约30分钟前，他谈到了当前牛市的状况以及他为什么继续看好市场。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We did have Tom Leon. Uh he was in the Middle East traveling this entire week, which is why we didn't hear too much from him. But here is what he just said about 30 minutes ago on what is the state of this bull market and why he continues to be bullish on what we've got going on.</p>
</details>

主持人问他为什么仍然认为这是“最受憎恨的反弹”，因为他采访的人里几乎没有看空者了。Tom Lee 回应说，虽然一些空头可能躲起来了，但量化数据支持他的观点。他引用了**AAII**（American Association of Individual Investors: 美国个人投资者协会）的调查数据，这是一个衡量高净值散户投资者情绪的指标。今年该指数的平均值为-11.7。在其35年的历史中，只有另外三次（1990年、2002年和2022年）的年度平均值为负，而那些年份都与熊市有关。所以，今年的投资者情绪实际上与熊市时期相符。他认为，这确实是一场最受憎恨的V型反弹。也许有些人嘴上说不再看空，但他们的**损益表**（P&L: Profit and Loss）并未反映出这一点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Great to see you, Scott. I'm going to take issue like I did last time with an a comment that you gave to our producers. Tom, you think it's still the quote most hated rally? I I just don't know how that still holds water given where we are. I mean, I I I interview people all day every day. I've got no bears around. >> Well, um I mean, maybe some of the bears have gone to hiding, Scott, but because the last time we talked, I wanted to give you some quantitative stats. Um, if you take AAI, which I think is one of the best surveys of high netw worth retail investors, it's averaged - 11.7 this year, negative 11.7. There have only been three other times in that survey's 35-year history where the year-to- date average has been negative. It was 1990, 2002, and 2022. So um all those times have actually been associated with bare markets and and so sentiment has averaged this year what's consistent with a bare market. So it is the most hated V-shaped rally. Now there may be some people who say they're no longer bearish but their P&L doesn't reflect that.</p>
</details>

主持人接着说，这可能导致那些没有参与市场的投资者在年底前意识到风险而被迫追高。Tom Lee 同意，并指出今年有80%的基金经理表现落后于其基准，这是近25年来最差的情况。现在他们有两个有利因素：一是季节性上，十一月通常是上涨的月份；二是盈利方面，尽管有关税影响，但企业利润率一直在提高。他认为，这表明公司正在利用人工智能来扩大利润空间。这实际上是一个相当不错的顺风，因为关税的逆风正在减弱，而人工智能带来的利润增长效益仍在持续。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> No, that that that that may be fair. Um, which leads us to the potential of a chase into year end when they realize that what's at stake for them if they're not engaged. >> That's right. And we know 80% of fund managers are trailing their respective benchmark this year. It's the worst in almost 25 years. So, uh, and now they're given two things to work with. One is that seasonally November's a good month, so it should be a positive month. And as far as earnings go and and you guys had a conversation about it um earlier today, margins have been improving despite tariffs. And so it's showing you that companies, I think, using AI are able to expand profit margins. That's actually a a pretty good tailwind because the tariff headwinds are fading, but the benefits from AI margin benefits are still going to grow.</p>
</details>

关于美联储，Tom Lee 认为，尽管美联储主席鲍威尔表示十二月降息并非定局，但**联邦基金期货**（Fed fund futures: 一种金融衍生品，市场用它来预测美联储未来利率走向）仍然预测十二月会降息。鲍威尔承认关税对通胀的影响小于预期，而且通胀实际上正在急剧下降。九月份的**CPI**（Consumer Price Index: 消费者价格指数）报告显示，54%的组成部分处于彻底的通缩状态，这是历史最高比例。此外，鲍威尔也承认利率只是“限制性减弱”，而非“宽松”。因此，在通胀下降和就业市场疲软的情况下，降息的理由是充分的，这对股市是利好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. Um, one thing to keep in mind is that, you know, if you look at Fed fund futures, it's still projecting a cut in December. I think Fed Chair Powell in his statements did give you a window for why it's possible. One is he did acknowledge that inflation's effect from tariffs is less than they expected. And despite a lot of Fed governors talking about inflation widening, that's not the case. Um when you look at the the CPI report in September, it was the highest percentage of components, 54% that were in outright deflation. So it's it's in fact inflation is falling like a rock. And the second was he acknowledged that rates aren't accommodative. They're just less restrictive. And so in a case where there's falling inflation and if if jobs markets weakening, I think that that's a good reason for cuts to happen. And in a way that's good for equities.</p>
</details>

Tom Lee 还提到，持续的政府停摆正在导致航空交通等放缓，这期间通胀不会增强。如果美联储现在承认通胀正在减弱，那么到十二月，在劳动力市场受损的情况下，通胀只会更弱。因此，他认为数据支持与美联储言论相反的观点，即降息的可能性很大。他仍然认为年底前市场能达到7000点，但他也提醒，由于十月涨幅强劲，十一月上半月可能会出现盘整，未来几周走势会比较颠簸。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. Well, I'm going to do something that the Fed won't will not want to do, which is be a little forward-looking. But we have a government shutdown that's continuing that is causing even things like air traffic to slow and inflation isn't going to be gaining strength in a period like that. So, if the Fed was acknowledging inflation's weakening now, I think it's even weaker in December at a time when the labor market is is suffering. So, I I I think if those if someone thinks the odds have dropped because of what the Fed said, I just think the data would support a very opposite picture. >> And you still like 7,000 at least between now and the end of the year. I mean, we closed above 6,900 the other day. So, we're well on our way, it would appear. >> Yeah, that's right. And uh but it probably makes sense for people to be aware that because October was so strong, we we have to consolidate some of those gains in the first half of the of November. And Mark Newton, our technician, does think it's it that we're going to be entering a period of chop. So 7,000, yes, makes sense. And it's just going to be bumpy in the next couple of weeks.</p>
</details>

### 宏观视角：政府停摆、降息预期与投资者情绪

我认为 Tom Lee 的很多观点都很有道理。首先，美联储可能只是想让市场不要对十二月降息过于兴奋。但我完全同意 Tom 的观点，我们很可能会降息，首要原因就是政府停摆和疲软的劳动力市场。如果对十二月降息的担忧是关税导致通胀，那么劳动力市场放缓和政府停摆导致人们收入减少，消费能力自然会下降，这本身就是通缩性的。因此，除非宏观环境发生重大变化，否则我们不降息的可能性很小。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So look, a lot of things Tom said right there I think make a lot of sense. We got four minutes until the market closes. Number one, I think the Fed is trying to just get the market to not be over excited for a December rate cut. But the number one reason, which I 1,000% agree with on Tom, on why we would get that rate cut, uh, is that we have a government shutdown and we have a weak labor market. And naturally, if the fear on a December rate cut is that we have inflation because of tariffs, well, if we have a labor market slowdown and we have a government shutdown in which people aren't getting paid, guess what? If people aren't getting paid as much, they're not going to be able to consume, which will naturally be deflationary. So from that perspective, I think it is very unlikely that we don't get a December cut. I mean, something would have to change in the macro in a meaningful way uh for that to take place.</p>
</details>

其次，他提到的投资者调查数据是真实的。我看了他引用的统计数据，前三次投资者情绪如此偏向悲观时，我们都处于熊市中。显然我们现在不在熊市，但人们的行为却像在熊市一样。如果你不相信那个调查，看看 Michael Burry 昨天发的帖子，他基本上宣称这是一个泡沫。当你看到人们如此热衷于称市场见顶、有泡沫，而忽视了我们整个星期看到的盈利增长——比如亚马逊的 AWS 增长了20%——我认为这实际上对牛市非常有利。这意味着市场上有足够健康的怀疑情绪，可以支撑市场走得更高。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then number two, the AI investor survey that he talks about is legit. I mean, I looked at the stats he was looking at and the last three times we had uh the investor sentiment be as skewed as it is to the bearish side, we're in bare markets. We are obviously not in a bare market, but the fact that people are acting like we are through that investor survey and if you don't even want to look at that investor survey, just look at what Mr. Michael Bur posted yesterday essentially claiming that this is a bubble. And so when you've got that level of excitement on wanting to call that it's toppy, it's bubbish, etc. by ignoring the earnings growth that we have seen all week, Amazon just growing AWS at 20%. I think that's actually very productive for the bull case because it means there is enough healthy skepticism that's out there to go higher.</p>
</details>

关于政府停摆，特朗普表示愿意与民主党会面，只要他们重开政府。但一个重要问题是 **SNAP**（Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program: 补充营养援助计划）福利金。政府将不得不动用一些紧急资金来支付这些福利。目前，罗德岛和马萨诸塞州的两名法官都做出了裁决，倾向于要求政府必须找到资金来支付 SNAP 福利，不能切断这个项目。这使得停摆的局面更加复杂，因为特朗普政府原本可能想通过切断福利来向民主党施压。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">First of all, Trump was speaking with uh some reporters as he landed in Florida. A couple things he said he's willing to meet with the Democrats. All Democrats have to do is open the government as he was speaking to reporters when he arrived in Florida. So, you do have the president trying to get this shutdown to be done. Now, one thing that's really important about the shutdown and this is something that uh started getting alerted a couple of hours ago because we are getting to the point where you know it matters is uh SNAP benefits. So, we are getting to the point where the government's going to have to start tapping some emergency funds to to navigate benefits that the country is going to have to pay out to people that are on those benefits. There's an update on that... a federal judge is saying, "You need to go ahead and use that." A Massachusetts judge, on the other hand, also seems to be leaning in the direction that the government will need to provide SNAP benefits somehow, that they cannot cut off the program... Now, this is going to be really important because there are Americans that have those food benefits and the Trump administration by cutting off those food benefits obviously was going to get a lot of people angry at the Democrats, right? The whole point is like if you can get your constituents to get mad at the people that are shutting down the country from the Republicans's perspective, then you could possibly get them to come to the negotiating table. Well, you got federal judges saying you're not going to be allowed to do that because people need to eat and you have to find a way to fund the way for people to get the funding for them to eat via these SNAP benefits. And as a result, it continues to complicate the picture when it comes to the shutdown.</p>
</details>

### 企业动态：Coinbase增持以太坊，Grab拥抱AI

一个对比特币看涨的数据是，美国**M2货币供应量**（M2 money supply: 广义货币供应量，包括现金、存款等）在2025年9月同比增长4.5%，达到创纪录的22.2万亿美元。这是连续第19个月增长，与美国可能停止**量化紧缩**（Quantitative tightening: 中央银行减少其持有的金融资产，从而减少货币供应的政策）同步发生。这意味着你必须持有资产。市场上的钱越多，美元的实际价值就越低，所以你必须拥有能够保值的东西，比如股票、土地、房产、大宗商品或加密货币。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">One bullish stat for Bitcoin is this. US money supply rose 4.5% year-over-year in September 2025 to a record 22.2 trillion. This is a 19th consecutive monthly increase that happens in tandem with the United States likely um stopping quantitative tightening, which is what JPAL said a couple days ago... What does this mean? This means you have to own assets. The more money that is out there, the less the dollar actually matters. Which means you have to own something that preserves the value of the dollar in the first place, which has to either be a stock, a piece of land, piece of property, uh, or a commodity. You know, that's kind of the buckets you can put it into, or a cryptocurrency, and that's likely what you're seeing across the entire equity markets.</p>
</details>

另外，Coinbase 在其财报中披露，他们又购买了1亿美元的以太坊，现在他们的资产负债表上拥有6.17亿美元的以太坊。他们也购买了更多比特币。关于以太坊，另一个重要的事情是他们拥有 Base，这是以太坊下的**L2**（Layer 2: 二层网络，旨在提高区块链的可扩展性和效率）网络。所以 Coinbase 也在以太坊的区块链上扩展其架构。在我看来，这对以太坊长期来说也是非常看涨的，因为世界上最重要的金融公司，无论是 Robin Hood 还是 Coinbase，都在拥抱这个正在形成的新金融体系。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">By the way, speaking of protecting your money, take a look at this. I didn't even see this this morning, but Coinbase on their earnings disclosed that they bought another 100 million of Ethereum. So, they now have 617 million of Ethereum on their treasury. They also bought more Bitcoin. The other thing that's really important about Ethereum is that they have base, which is their L2 underneath Ethereum. So, Coinbase is scaling their architecture on an Ethereum's blockchain as well. And as a result, you know, to me, I think this is also very bullish Ethereum and BMR long term as the most important financial companies in the world. Whether it's Robin Hood or Coinbase are embracing that new financial system that is playing out which is also nice to see.</p>
</details>

接下来我们看看 Grab。这是公司首席运营官 Alex Hungate 关于 Grab 如何拥抱人工智能的访谈片段。好消息是 Grab 已经是一个相当大的 AI 玩家，我们已经运行着大约10,000个 AI 模型，这可能使我们成为该地区最大的 AI 公司之一。我们扮演的一个角色是，连接那些主要由美国生产的大型基础模型，并使它们更适用于东南亚。我们是 OpenAI 在该地区唯一的灯塔合作伙伴，这意味着我们可以在模型准备就绪但尚未正式发布时就获得它们，然后进行微调。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This was the CEO COO of the company, Chief Operating Officer, Alex Hungate. Here's what he had to say about how Grab is embracing AI... the good news is that Grab is already quite a big AI player. We run about 10,000 AI models already. Uh which makes us probably one of the bigger ones in the region. Um, and a function that we already play is we bridge between the large foundation models which are being produced largely out of the US at the moment and then we make them more relevant for Southeast Asia. We're the only lighthouse partner for OpenAI in the region which means we get access to foundational models as soon as they're ready but before the official releases and then we fine-tune them.</p>
</details>

他举例说，当他们最初拿到 GPT-4 模型并尝试用于语音识别时，在东南亚的英语识别准确率只有45%，因为口音和地名不同。这使得它不适用。通过收集了大约12万东南亚用户的语音样本进行训练后，现在的准确率达到了92%。他们还为司机开发了“副驾驶”功能，帮助他们优化位置以获得最大收入；为商家开发了聊天机器人，不仅提供商业建议，甚至还能提供情感支持，比如给商家打气说“别担心，姐妹，你做得很好”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">When we first got the um the 40 model, we tried to use it for speech recognition because we were targeting to help the visually impaired to be able to use the app better. It only worked 45% of the time for Southeast Asia and that was in English... So we we've had about 120,000 Southeast Asians have given us voice samples. So now it's 92% accuracy, which is not too bad actually... Another role is we're trying to improve the productivity of our drivers by giving them uh what we call co-pilot... for the merchants, we're trying to help them with a merchant chat, what we call merchant chatbot, which has been phenomenal... And the chat boys say, "Hey, don't worry sis, you're doing well. Keep it up." It was so endearing. It's like it's like AI with heart, you know.</p>
</details>

我认为这里有很多值得解读的地方，但核心是 Grab 正在进入各种不同的人工智能垂直领域，特别是针对那些依赖该平台的人们。他们没有首席营销官或首席财务官来帮助他们发展业务。从这个角度看，当你将一个大型语言模型进行微调，使其适应 Grab 应该发挥作用的特定场景时，这就是关键。这就是公司正在长期发展的更广泛的网络效应。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I think there's a lot to unpack there but at its core you know there are a variety of different AI verticals that grab is stepping into particularly from the use cases of people that quite frankly depend on a platform like that. They don't have a CMO or a CFO or a entire team to help them grow a business. And from that perspective, when you take a large language model and fine-tune it to the context specific arenas of what Grab should be making it useful for, which is the whole point, right? How can we get a use case for these models that make sense? ...that's what I think is the broader network effect that the company is developing over the long term.</p>

### 圆桌讨论：深入解析科技巨头与投资哲学

*在节目的后半段，主持人邀请了嘉宾 Matt 和 Steve 进行讨论。*

**主持人:** Matt，我们从一个我们共同关注了很久的话题开始：Palantir 股价达到200美元。你对这个价位的股票有什么看法？

**Matt:** 我今天或者昨天又买了一些。不是大量买入，只是我一直以来的每月定投。每次拿到薪水我都会买一点。我认为公司还有很多潜力尚未释放，比如 AI、FTE 等许多很棒的产品还没有完全推出。当这些产品真正落地时，我认为我们会在很多公司看到效率的大幅提升。Palantir 的运营利润率持续向好，我预计这个季度也会有好的表现。但我更关心的是我们能获得多少小合同。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Matt, what's up, sir? ... All right. Well, I think I'll get started with uh my first question right here which is a journey we have been part of for a long time. Palunteer at 200o. I mean just how are you thinking of uh of this stock at this level? >> Uh I either bought more today or yesterday I think. Um yeah. So, I mean, not buying a lot, right? Just the monthly buys that I always have. Every time I get a paycheck, I just... I just think that there's a lot to to be released still, like AI, FTE, a lot of a lot of great products that I don't think have been fully rolled out as of yet. And when that does actually come through, I think we're going to see a lot of efficiency gains in a lot of different companies. Um, I mean, the the ops margins for Palanteer are continuing to do well. I anticipate and and I think Arie had a really good post earlier talking about how he thinks that that's going to be a good story coming up this this uh this quarter as well, but I'm more so concerned about how many more small contracts we can get, right?</p>

**主持人:** 很有趣，我们都曾觉得随着股价上涨，估值变得激进。但我们几乎所有人都被其强劲的执行力所折服。现在感觉就是，如果你想拥有更多，就得在某个时候买入。

**Matt:** 是的，我看待它的方式不同了。昨天有人问我是否应该在这里卖出。首先，如果你和我们一样长期持有，成本在6、7、8美元，现在在200美元卖出，你需要支付15%到20%的长期资本利得税。这意味着在你重新入场之前，股价需要跌到至少160美元才能回本。人们往往没考虑到这一点。对我来说，这家公司的执行力让我不断提高对它的估值，从最初的1500-2000亿美元，到后来的1万亿，最近我把它提高到了1.5万亿。从这个角度看，现在5000亿的市值还只是个开始。当你面对这样的确定性时，为什么要赌它会下跌呢？

<p class="english-text">>> I think the cool thing about it is you and I both as the company started rising and its price felt the valuation was getting aggressive and we were pretty transparent about that... But it's it's almost all of us have been humbled by the fact that the execution is so strong and now it's like oh at some point you got to buy if you want more of it, right? >> Yeah. I mean I look at it in a different way, right? I was talking to somebody about this yesterday. They're like are you like what do you think? Like should I sell here? Whatever. And first and foremost I think when people think about this, right? If they've been in it like you and I have and they have shares, let's say at the $67 8 range and then they sell here at 200, they're going to have to pay, you know, pretty much uh 15 to 20% depending on what tax bracket uh for federal tax um on long-term capital gains. So before they enter even back in, the stock is going to have to go down to uh to at least $160 before they even make an entry back in... But so anyway, going back into the real the real aspect of it, I I just the the the the execution that I continue to see out of the company, you know, five years ago, I thought it was going to be 150 to20 billion dollar company. And since then... it got to a trillion dollar valuation and and and more recently I've moved it to a trillion and a half... but if you think about in that respect, it's like we're only at a 500 billion compared to that 1.5. Yeah. And then there's going to be buybacks and and so many other things along the way, it's like when you have opportunities like this of certainty, right? Why bet against certainty?</p>

**主持人:** 那么对于大型科技公司的财报，你有什么看法？你是否也认为它们只会变得越来越大，投资者应该继续**定期定额投资**（DCA: Dollar-Cost Averaging，一种投资策略，无论市场价格如何，都定期投入固定金额的资金）到这些世界上最好的公司？

**Matt:** 我认为2026年将是好年份，但我感觉我们正在进入这个极端牛市、轻松赚钱阶段的后半段。当然，它也可能延续到2027年。这些公司都在投入巨额资本，亚马逊的投资超过1250亿美元，Meta 也在投入大量资金。但我认为我们会开始遇到瓶颈。我不是看空，也不是说要卖掉这些股票，只是说当资本支出无法像过去那样从500亿增长到1000亿时，会产生一些反弹。未来两到三年，我们将看到谁拥有最好的管理层，谁能穿越周期进行投资。

<p class="english-text">>> I think that 26 will be a good year, but I think it'll be I think we're entering the the latter half of the this very extreme bullish easy money stage. Now, it could run into 27... Amazon's investing over 100 billion. They're going to invest over 125 billion before the year end. And and Meta is investing a lot of money as well. So, all these companies, but they keep talking about expanding the amount of capital that they're going to plow in... I don't think that we're in this, you know, unless that the income really starts to come through and the cash flow really starts to come through, I think we're going to start hitting a wall a bit. And I'm not, when I say wall, it makes it seem more extreme. I'm not bearish by any means. I'm not saying sell these things, but I'm just saying there's going to be some backlash associated with when we actually hit and we can't grow capital expenditure... I think that we're going to see who has the best management in the next two to three years and and who to really stick to.</p>

**主持人:** 亚马逊的表现让市场大吃一惊，你对此怎么看？你一直看好亚马逊。

**Matt:** 我认为亚马逊的逻辑很简单。首先，AWS 的增长在加速，这是必然的，因为你在过去12个月里将资本支出增加到超过1000亿美元。其次，亚马逊的估值一直在收缩，其市盈率甚至低于谷歌。在我看来，市场没有为亚马逊的未来增长定价。像亚马逊这样的优质企业，即使每年只增长5%到10%，也应该有20到25倍的市盈率。这是一个关于利润率的故事，CEO Andy Jassy 也在电话会议上强调了效率。他们最终的营收会达到1.5万亿美元，如果能实现25%的营业利润率，产生的运营现金流将是巨大的。这家公司没有理由不在未来几年达到6万亿美元的市值。

<p class="english-text">>> Why do you think Amazon was able to surprise the street as well as they did? Well, I think the the ease of Amazon was kind of easy to tell because, you know, I think first and foremost... you're seeing an acceleration AWS and I think it was inevitable, right? You're increasing capital expenditure to over hundred billion dollars in the trailing 12 months... but I think in other pieces is that the valuation for Amazon has continued to contract for quite some time. Like it's trading at a a price to earnings multiple similar to uh or less than Google... I think there there is no forward growth assumed for Amazon in my opinion. If they if you were to look at a quality business like Amazon, even if it's just growing at a at a decent pace of 5 to 10% a year, you should be giving it a uh you know, easily at 20x to 25x multiple... And to me, it's a margin story. And you heard Andy Jasse talk about it uh on the call himself... they're going to be at a trillion and a half dollars of revenue here pretty soon. If they get that to a 25% operating margin, I mean, the ops cash that's going to be flown off on that is is going to be monumental... there's no reason why this company should be trading at $6 trillion in the next couple years. Yeah.</p>

**主持人:** 那么现在 Meta 下跌了15%，你对它感兴趣吗？

**Matt:** 我现在成了一股的股东。是你激励了我。我最看好的是 Reality Labs 的未来。尽管它现在还在亏损，但我认为我们还没有完全理解它未来会做什么。我认为它将在未来的运作方式中扮演重要角色。

<p class="english-text">>> Are you at all interested in Meta now with a 15% dip? >> I am now a shareholder of one share. Um, you inspired me... The thing that I'm actually most bullish about and it's actually a video I made... I was very bullish when the company changed from Facebook to Meta. And I don't think that we fully grasp even though it's still losing a crap ton of money. I don't think that we fully grasp what Reality Labs will do in the future. And I um I think that that will play a huge piece into how things operate.</p>

*在讨论的最后，另一位嘉宾 Steve 加入。*

**主持人:** Steve，你对本周市场有什么总体看法？标普500连续第六个月收涨。

**Steve:** 我认为我们没理由到不了7000点。除非中国方面出什么问题，否则我看不出会有大的回调。英伟达的财报可能会很好。我没看到今天有什么负面消息。我认为 Meta 现在是一个巨大的机会，亚马逊也是。

<p class="english-text">>> Steve, you're kind of late, buddy... overall thoughts on uh this week, sixth month in a row green for the S&P 500. >> I mean, I don't think there's any way we're not getting to 7,000 at this point. >> I agree. >> Unless something happens with China. I mean, I just I don't see that we're going to get a big retracement or anything. And Nvidia is likely going to have great numbers... I think Meta, look, if you looked at my article, it's more of what I said last night. I think it's a huge opportunity right now. I think Amazon's a huge</p>

**Steve:** 我只是不认为我们能与这个国家最聪明的人作对。如果回购放缓一点，那又怎样？从长远来看，他们正在为未来5年、10年、15年进行建设。如果他们现在落后了，未来的盈利能力就无从谈起。所以我宁愿他们花掉资本支出，削减20%的回购，因为这是未来盈利能力的下一个增长点。作为股东，我愿意接受这一点。

<p class="english-text">>> I just don't know that we can go against the most brilliant minds in the country. >> I'm with you. >> That's Oh no. buyback slow down for a little bit. who freaking like in the grand scheme of things if this was shortterm money I would be like you know what maybe this isn't such a great idea but over the next f they're they're building this out for the next 5 10 15 years and when you think about how they're deploying capex if they fall behind and they're wrong you're their profitability is off the table in the future so I would rather them spend the capex and cut the buybacks by 20% or so because this is the next leg of future profitability and I would be willing to take that as a shareholder. So I'm just not willing to go against big tech right now.</p>

### 市场前瞻：十一月走势预测与关键看点

关于 Palantir，Jim Cramer 最近也改变了他的看法。他曾说 Alex Karp 不是真正的商人，Palantir 不是真正的企业。但现在他承认，这家公司“火了”。他提到，他打电话给所有雇佣了 Palantir 的大公司，得到的反馈都是“相当不错”。他承认 Palantir 正在“扼杀”**Rule of 80**（SaaS公司的一项衡量标准，即收入增长率与利润率之和应大于80%），并且像波音这样严肃的公司也选择了他们。这表明 Palantir 的业务是真实的。

<p class="english-text">Okay, this is this is what Mr. Kramer had to say about Palunteer. >> Palanteer, are you as impressed with Alex Karp as he is with himself? >> All right. So, >> I find him to be really interesting. I'm not long the stock... >> he's like a horrible guy, but I think he's real. I think that and I say that because like like all the companies that have hired him, the big ones, I've called them and I said, "How is it?" And they all to a person say, "Listen, it's pretty good." >> I mean, he's on fire. That business is on fire. >> It's on fire, >> but is it too expensive even given how on fire they are? >> Um, >> it seems crazy to me. >> It is rule of 80. Uh, I think I'm going to end up It's gonna go >> They're killing rule of 80. >> They're they're they're killing it.</p>
