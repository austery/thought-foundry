### 十月市场收官：连续六个月上涨

好了，大家好。欢迎回到新一期的《市场收盘》。今天是十月的最后一天，我们即将结束十月份的行情。今年只剩下两个月了，看起来我们今天会以一个上涨的收盘结束。感谢大家的到来，我们有很多内容要讨论，自从我们早上开盘直播以来，出现了很多头条新闻。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right. Hello everybody. Welcome back to another episode of the market close. It is the last day of October and we are ending out the month of October. Two months left of the year and it looks like folks we are going to get a green close to the end of the day. Thank you everybody for being here. We got a lot to talk about. Lots of headlines since we were live on the market open.</p>
</details>

如果你看一下标普500指数，今天上涨了约0.5%，表现还不错，报68405点。看起来Palantir将收在200美元以上。我们还有13分钟，希望它能收在200美元上方。它曾一度跌至197美元，所以能回升到200美元以上，这非常令人欣慰。Robin Hood曾跌至43美元，现在回到147美元，还不错。Google今天相对平稳，报281美元。AMD上涨1%，SoFi上涨1.5%。总的来说，自开盘以来，今天市场表现相当平淡。Amazon报246美元，失去了一些涨幅，但仍然保持了10%的涨势，对于一个**超大规模云服务提供商**（Hyperscaler: 指提供大规模云计算服务的公司，如亚马逊AWS、谷歌云等）来说，这相当惊人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If you take a look right here at the S&P 500 up about half a percent on the day which is not too bad. 68405. It looks like Palanteer will give us the $200 close. We got 13 minutes left. Hopefully we get that close above 200. We did dip all the way to 197. So the fact that it's coming back above 200 is very nice to see. Robin Hood dipped to 43, back to 147. Not too bad. Google relatively flat on the day at 281. AMD's up 1%. SoFi is up 1.5. I mean, it's been a pretty flat day since the market open. Amazon 246 did lose a little bit of love, but still holding that 10% move, which is incredible for a hyperscaler.</p>
</details>

### 深度解读：Meta为何下跌？

现在，Meta的股价确实遭受了重创。我没有买入更多Meta。今天股价下跌2.48%，报649美元。他们一度把股价打到645美元。我本以为他们不会让它跌破650美元。看来市场对**资本性支出**（Capex: Capital Expenditures，公司用于购买、维护或升级实物资产的资金）存在着深层次的结构性担忧。我们将更深入地讨论Meta，如果华尔街在一个上涨的日子，在月底的最后一天对Meta如此恐慌，那么这种担忧肯定比表面上的问题要深刻得多。当然，今天可能也有很多期权到期。所以可能只是算法交易的影响，但Meta现在报649美元，今天又下跌了2%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, Meta, they are absolutely taking to town. I did not buy more Meta. 649 down 2.48% on the day. They put it at 645 at one point. I didn't think they would let it break 650. It seems like there is a deep structural concern about capex and we'll talk more about Meta and it has to go deeper than the surface level concerns if the street is this scared on a green day on the last day of the month for Meta. Now you probably have a lot of options that are expiring today as well. So it could just be ALOS but uh Meta right here 649 that one is down another 2% of the day.</p>
</details>

比特币的十月将以红色收场。当然，今天还有大约九到十个小时，所以如果比特币出现一根5000美元的大阳线，或许还能撑住。但如果它真的收跌，这将是六年来比特币第一次在十月份下跌。所以，这是值得关注的一点。我们还有大约九个小时来看比特币如何收盘。以太坊目前在3800美元。然后是BMR，现在是4667美元，今天上涨了约4.7%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Bitcoin will end red for October. I mean we do have um what nine 10 more hours in the day. So maybe Bitcoin, if it gets a $5,000 candle, will be able to hold up, but if it does go red, it will be the first red October, not really October for Bitcoin, uh, for the first time in six years. So, it's one thing to look out for. We do have about nine more hours to see how Bitcoin closes. Ethereum right there at 3,800. And then you got BMR right now at 4667, up about 4.7% on the day.</p>
</details>

总的来说，这是一个不可思议的月份，也是一个疯狂的月份。这个月发生了很多不同的事情，整个星期都伴随着美联储降息、大型科技公司财报等等，有点疯狂。但我确实认为，对于股市来说，这是一个强劲的月份。如果我们今天能以绿色收盘，而且看起来会的，这将是连续第六个月上涨。市场的韧性值得称赞。那些在10月10日或10月17日等时机抄底的人，在那些考验信念的日子里，你们正在得到回报。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, look, I mean, overall, it's been an incredible month. It's been a wild month. We had a lot of different things happen this month, this entire week with the Fed cuts, big tech earnings, etc. has been kind of crazy, but I do think it has been a strong month for the stock market, if we do end green today, which it looks like we will, it'll be six months of green in a row. The resiliency of the market is something to be commended. And those who bought the dip when it was time to buy the dip, whether it was October 10th or October 17th, variety of days this month that definitely test the conviction, uh, you are being rewarded.</p>

### 万圣节特别：马斯克与罗根谈论飞行汽车

在万圣节，我们还看到了伊隆·马斯克和乔·罗根的播客。这是伊隆在谈论飞行汽车。未来本应有飞行汽车，但我们现在还没有。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And we got an Elon and Rogan podcast for Halloween. Here's Elon talking about flying cars. of the the future was supposed to have flying cars, but we don't have flying cars.</p>
</details>

> **罗根：** 所以，你将能够飞行？
>
> **马斯克：** 嗯，我的意思是，我想如果彼得想要一辆飞行汽车，我们应该能让他买到一辆。
>
> **主持人：** 他说的是彼得·蒂尔。
>
> **罗根：** 所以，你正在积极考虑制造一辆电动飞行汽车吗？这是真的吗？
>
> **马斯克：** 嗯，我得在演示中看看。所以当你做这个的时候，你会有可伸缩的翅膀吗？这背后的想法是什么？
>
> **罗根：** 别耍滑头了，说吧。
>
> **马斯克：** 我不能在正式发布前就揭晓。但是……
>
> **罗根：** 那私下告诉我。我觉得这有机会成为有史以来最令人难忘的产品发布会。它有这个潜力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So, you're going to be able to fly? >> Well, I mean, uh, I think if Peter wants a flying car, we should should be able to buy one. >> He's talking about Peter Teal. >> So, you are you actively considering making an electric flying car? Is this like a real thing? >> Well, I have to see in the >> in the demo. So when you do this, like are are you going to have a retractable wing? Like what is the idea behind this? >> Don't be sly. Come on. >> I I I can't I can't uh do the unveil before the unveil. Um but um >> tell me off air then. I I I it h look I I think it has a shot at being the most memorable um product unveil ever. It has a shot.</p>
</details>

就是这样。乔·罗根先生和伊隆·马斯克带来了一场长达三小时的精彩万圣节活动。关于飞行汽车与Roadster合作的传言已经流传很久了。所以伊隆只是再次把这些传言带了回来，谁知道呢，也许未来五年我们就能看到它实现。AMD上涨约1.28%。Rocket Lab在哪里？Rocket Lab在这里，62.99美元，上涨约3.37%。Coinbase报348美元。Coinbase今天也表现出色。Wells Fargo一度上涨9%，现在上涨6%。Cory上涨2.5%。Nebius我们还守住130美元吗？是的，131美元。Nebius表现不错，恭喜。很高兴看到这个。它一度跌至94美元，这尤其说明了数据中心概念股的韧性。这就是为什么Nebius受到青睐的原因。Delta报57美元。DLO今天下跌约2%。然后Cisco基本持平。标普500指数在62点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So there you go. Some uh nice threeh hour Halloween action with Mr. Joe Rogan and Elon Musk. I mean there's been rumors of this flying car roadster collaboration for a long time. So Elon kind of just bringing those back and who knows maybe we get that going into the next five years. AMD right there up about 1.28%. Where is the lab of rockets? Rocket Lab right here 62.99 that's up about 3.37%. Coinbase 348. Coinbase had a great day as well. Wells was up 9% now up 6%. Cory up 2.5. Nebius are we still holding 130? We are 131. Not bad on Nebus. Congratulations. Nice to see that. Went all the way down to 94. Speaks to the resiliency of that data center play in particular. And that's why NeAs is getting some love right there. Delta at 57. You got DLO down about 2% on the day. And then Cisco basically flat. S&P 500 at 62.</p>

### 嘉宾连线：Tom Lee解读“最受憎恨的反弹”

我们请到了汤姆·李。他整个星期都在中东出差，所以我们没怎么听到他的消息。但这是他大约30分钟前对当前牛市状况以及他为何继续看好后市的看法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We did have Tom Leon. Uh he was in the Middle East traveling this entire week, which is why we didn't hear too much from him. But here is what he just said about 30 minutes ago on what is the state of this bull market and why he continues to be bullish on what we've got going on.</p>
</details>

> **主持人 (Scott)：** 很高兴见到你，斯科特。我要像上次一样，对你给制片人的一条评论提出异议。汤姆，你认为这仍然是“最受憎恨的反弹”吗？我只是不知道在我们现在的位置，这个说法怎么还站得住脚。我每天都在采访人，我周围根本没有看空的人。
>
> **汤姆·李：** 嗯，斯科特，也许一些看空的人已经躲起来了。因为上次我们谈话时，我想给你一些量化数据。如果你看**AAII**（American Association of Individual Investors: 美国个人投资者协会）的数据，我认为这是衡量高净值散户投资者的最佳调查之一，今年的平均值为-11.7，负的11.7。在该调查35年的历史中，只有另外三次年初至今的平均值为负。分别是1990年、2002年和2022年。所以，所有这些时期实际上都与熊市有关，因此今年的市场情绪平均水平与熊市一致。所以，这是最受憎恨的V型反弹。现在可能有些人说他们不再看空了，但他们的损益表（P&L）并没有反映出这一点。
>
> **主持人 (Scott)：** 不，那可能是公平的。这让我们想到年底可能会出现追涨行情，当他们意识到如果不参与市场，他们将面临什么风险时。
>
> **汤姆·李：** 没错。我们知道今年80%的基金经理表现落后于各自的基准，这是近25年来最糟糕的情况。所以，现在他们有两个有利因素。一是季节性上十一月是个好月份，所以应该是一个上涨的月份。至于盈利，你们今天早些时候也讨论过，尽管有关税，但利润率一直在提高。这表明，我认为公司正在利用人工智能来扩大利润率。这实际上是一个相当不错的顺风因素，因为关税的逆风正在消退，但人工智能带来的利润率好处仍在增长。
>
> **主持人 (Scott)：** 现在，我有点惊讶，也许不是很多，但只是因为你在过去一年左右有喜欢小盘股的历史，但特别是在美联储会议之后，美联储主席特意表示十二月（降息）并非已成定局，并用“远非如此”来强调这一点，这显然意味着如果利率不会像你可能想的那样下降，那么小盘股可能也不会像你想象的那样表现。
>
> **汤姆·李：** 是的。嗯，需要记住的一件事是，如果你看**联邦基金期货**（Fed fund futures: 预测未来联邦基金利率的市场工具），它仍然预测十二月会降息。我认为美联储主席鲍威尔在他的声明中确实为你提供了一个窗口，说明为什么这是可能的。一是他确实承认关税对通胀的影响比他们预期的要小。尽管许多美联储理事谈论通胀扩大，但事实并非如此。当你看到九月份的**CPI**（Consumer Price Index: 消费者价格指数）报告时，处于直接通缩状态的成分百分比是最高的，达到54%。所以事实上，通胀正在像石头一样下落。第二点是他承认利率并非宽松，只是限制性较小。因此，在通胀下降和就业市场疲软的情况下，我认为这是降息的好理由。从某种程度上说，这对股市是好事。
>
> **主持人 (Scott)：** 是的。但我的意思是，汤姆，在会议之前我们谈论十二月降息的概率时，大概是100%。现在它们下降了，有些人，比如我前几天采访的杰弗里·冈拉克，在鲍威尔讲话后说可能是50/50。所以也许那个特定的交易在现在和下次会议之间会陷入瘫痪，因为我们只需要看看美联储会做什么，然后才能成为小盘股的坚定信徒。
>
> **汤姆·李：** 是的。嗯，我将做一些美联储不愿意做的事情，那就是稍微展望一下未来。我们有一个持续的政府关门，这甚至导致航空交通等放缓，在这样的时期，通胀不会增强。所以，如果美联储承认通胀现在正在减弱，我认为在十二月，当劳动力市场正在遭受痛苦时，通胀会更弱。所以，如果有人因为美联储的言论而认为降息的几率下降了，我只是认为数据会支持一个完全相反的画面。
>
> **主持人 (Scott)：** 你仍然认为在现在到年底之间至少会达到7000点。我的意思是，我们前几天收盘在6900点以上。所以，我们似乎正在稳步前进。
>
> **汤姆·李：** 是的，没错。但是人们可能需要意识到，因为十月非常强劲，我们必须在十一月上半月巩固部分涨幅。我们的技术分析师马克·牛顿确实认为我们将进入一个震荡期。所以7000点，是的，这是合理的。只是在接下来的几周会有些颠簸。
>
> **主持人 (Scott)：** 嘿，汤姆，祝你……

<p class="english-text">>> Great to see you, Scott. I'm going to take issue like I did last time with an a comment that you gave to our producers. Tom, you think it's still the quote most hated rally? I I just don't know how that still holds water given where we are. I mean, I I I interview people all day every day. I've got no bears around. >> Well, um I mean, maybe some of the bears have gone to hiding, Scott, but because the last time we talked, I wanted to give you some quantitative stats. Um, if you take AAI, which I think is one of the best surveys of high netw worth retail investors, it's averaged - 11.7 this year, negative 11.7. There have only been three other times in that survey's 35-year history where the year-to- date average has been negative. It was 1990, 2002, and 2022. So um all those times have actually been associated with bare markets and so sentiment has averaged this year what's consistent with a bare market. So it is the most hated V-shaped rally. Now there may be some people who say they're no longer bearish but their P&L doesn't reflect that. >> No, that that that that may be fair. Um, which leads us to the potential of a chase into year end when they realize that what's at stake for them if they're not engaged. >> That's right. And we know 80% of fund managers are trailing their respective benchmark this year. It's the worst in almost 25 years. So, uh, and now they're given two things to work with. One is that seasonally November's a good month, so it should be a positive month. And as far as earnings go and and you guys had a conversation about it um earlier today, margins have been improving despite tariffs. And so it's showing you that companies, I think, using AI are able to expand profit margins. That's actually a a pretty good tailwind because the tariff headwinds are fading, but the benefits from AI margin benefits are still going to grow. >> Now, I'm a little surprised, maybe not much, but just because you have a history of of liking small caps o over the last year or so, but particularly coming off the Fed meeting where the Fed chair went out of his way to say that December is not a foregone conclusion and then underscored that with far from it, which obviously if rates aren't going to go down in the trajectory that you probably thought they would, then small caps probably not going to perform the way you thought they might. >> Yeah. Um, one thing to keep in mind is that, you know, if you look at Fed fund futures, it's still projecting a cut in December. I think Fed Chair Powell in his statements did give you a window for why it's possible. One is he did acknowledge that inflation's effect from tariffs is less than they expected. And despite a lot of Fed governors talking about inflation widening, that's not the case. Um when you look at the the CPI report in September, it was the highest percentage of components, 54% that were in outright deflation. So it's it's in fact inflation is falling like a rock. And the second was he acknowledged that rates aren't accommodative. They're just less restrictive. And so in a case where there's falling inflation and if if jobs markets weakening, I think that that's a good reason for cuts to happen. And in a way that's good for equities. >> Yeah. But I mean, we were talking about December probabilities, Tom, before the meeting at like 100%. Now they're down and some like, you know, Jeffrey Gunlock, who I interviewed the other day post Powell was like could be 50/50. So maybe the that particular trade gets paralyzed, if you will, between now and the next meeting because we just need to see what the Fed's going to do before we become big believers in the small caps. >> Yeah. Well, I'm going to do something that the Fed won't will not want to do, which is be a little forward-looking. But we have a government shutdown that's continuing that is causing even things like air traffic to slow and inflation isn't going to be gaining strength in a period like that. So, if the Fed was acknowledging inflation's weakening now, I think it's even weaker in December at a time when the labor market is is suffering. So, I I I think if those if someone thinks the odds have dropped because of what the Fed said, I just think the data would support a very opposite picture. >> And you still like 7,000 at least between now and the end of the year. I mean, we closed above 6,900 the other day. So, we're well on our way, it would appear. >> Yeah, that's right. And uh but it probably makes sense for people to be aware that because October was so strong, we we have to consolidate some of those gains in the first half of the of November. And Mark Newton, our technician, does think it's it that we're going to be entering a period of chop. So 7,000, yes, makes sense. And it's just going to be bumpy in the next couple weeks. >> Hey Tom, have a</p>

### 宏观经济：政府关门与美联储降息预期

看，汤姆刚才说的很多话，我认为都很有道理。离市场收盘还有四分钟。第一，我认为美联储只是想让市场不要对十二月的降息过于兴奋。但我1000%同意汤姆的观点，我们之所以会降息，首要原因是我们有政府关门和疲软的劳动力市场。自然地，如果对十二月降息的担忧是关税导致的通胀，那么，如果我们有劳动力市场放缓和政府关门，人们拿不到工资，猜猜会发生什么？如果人们拿到的钱少了，他们就无法消费，这自然会产生通缩效应。所以从这个角度来看，我认为我们不降息的可能性非常小。我的意思是，宏观层面必须发生一些有意义的变化，才可能不降息。所以我认为我们会得到那次降息，这也是他看涨的原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So look, a lot of things Tom said right there I think make a lot of sense. We got four minutes until the market closes. Number one, I think the Fed is trying to just get the market to not be over excited for a December rate cut. But the number one reason, which I 1,000% agree with on Tom, on why we would get that rate cut, uh, is that we have a government shutdown and we have a weak labor market. And naturally, if the fear on a December rate cut is that we have inflation because of tariffs, well, if we have a labor market slowdown and we have a government shutdown in which people aren't getting paid, guess what? If people aren't getting paid as much, they're not going to be able to consume, which will naturally be deflationary. So from that perspective, I think it is very unlikely that a December cut. I mean, something would have to change in the macro in a meaningful way uh for that to take place. So I think we're going to get that rate cut, which is why he's bullish.</p>
</details>

第二，他谈到的投资者调查是真实存在的。我看了他所看的数据，过去三次投资者情绪像现在这样偏向悲观时，我们都处于熊市。我们现在显然不在熊市，但人们通过那个投资者调查表现得好像我们处于熊市一样。如果你甚至不想看那个调查，就看看迈克尔·贝瑞先生昨天发布的内容，他基本上声称这是一个泡沫。所以，当人们如此热衷于宣称市场见顶、泡沫化等等，而忽略了我们整个星期看到的盈利增长——亚马逊的AWS增长了20%——我认为这实际上对牛市非常有利，因为它意味着市场上有足够健康的怀疑情绪，可以让我们走得更高。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then number two, the AI investor survey that he talks about is legit. I mean, I looked at the stats he was looking at and the last three times we had uh the investor sentiment be as skewed as it is to the bearish side, we're in bare markets. We are obviously not in a bare market, but the fact that people are acting like we are through that investor survey and if you don't even want to look at that investor survey, just look at what Mr. Michael Bur posted yesterday essentially claiming that this is a bubble. And so when you've got that level of excitement on wanting to call that it's toppy, it's bubbish, etc. by ignoring the earnings growth that we have seen all week, Amazon just growing AWS at 20%. I think that's actually very productive for the bull case because it means there is enough healthy skepticism that's out there to go higher.</p>
</details>

所以我不认为谷歌、微软、Meta、亚马逊或苹果今天或过去一周说的任何话是看跌的，因此，这个牛市很可能有机会继续下去。谷歌目前报281美元。BMR在这里是4664美元，上涨约1.84%。微软下跌1.5%。微软今天确实受到了打击。他们确实承担了那30亿美元的OpenAI损失，华尔街可能因此惩罚他们，但整个季度的表现并不那么糟糕。MicroStrategy上涨5.86%，AS上涨4.6%，HIMS上涨3.2%，然后Uber今天基本上涨了2%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so I don't think anything Google, Microsoft Meta, Amazon or Apple said today was or said over the past week was bearish and as a result you likely have this bull market that has a chance to continue. Google right there at 281. BMR right here 4664. So that's up about 1.84%. Microsoft down 1.5. Microsoft did get hit today. Uh they did take that open AI $3 billion loss and the street likely is punishing them for that but the overall quarter was not that bad. Micro strategy right here up 5.86% as up 4.6. HIMS up 3.2 and then Uber basically up2% on the day.</p>
</details>

### 财报前瞻：Grab的AI雄心与Palantir的增长预期

离市场收盘还有大约两分钟。我们将看看Palantir能否收在200美元。我们还有一堆其他头条新闻要谈。Grab的财报在周一。实际上，Grab的首席运营官有一个新的采访出来了。我想分享其中一个片段，他谈到Grab是一家AI公司，我认为这是一个非常重要的思考点。所以我们会看看那个，然后我们会预览下周的情况，因为我们正式结束了十月份。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh we got about two minutes until this market closes. We're going to see if Palanteer can get that $200 close. We got a bunch of other headlines that we got to talk about. Grab earnings is on Monday. There's actually a new interview that came out with the COO of Grab. Uh, and I I just want to share one clip in a little bit where he talks about Grab as an AI company that I thought was a really important thing to think about. And so we'll take a look at that and then we'll preview what we've got going on into next week as we officially end out the month of October.</p>
</details>

这是疯狂的一周。英伟达稍微转跌。英伟达在十月份首次突破200美元，成为一家市值五万亿美元的公司。我们有很多不同的头条新闻，发生了很多不同的事情。我们有一堆关于中国的事情。我们算是达成了一项中国协议，又好像没有。Bassen今天对《金融时报》发表了一些评论，说：“嘿，我认为中国人对他们出口管制的全球反弹感到非常震惊，这就是为什么他们能够与我们谈判并达成某种有意义的协议。希望到年底，如果我们能确认中国和印度的协议，那将非常令人兴奋。也许这能让我们以一个相当不错的涨势结束这个牛市。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Been a wild week. Nvidia going a little red. Nvidia crossed 200 for the first time. Got to a five trillion dollar company in the month of October. We had a lot of different headlines, a lot of different things that happened. We had a bunch of different China stuff. I mean, we kind of got a China deal. Kind of don't. Bassen did give some comments today to the Financial Times and said, "Hey, I think the Chinese were very alarmed by the global backlash to their export controls, which is why they were able to negotiate with us and create some type of meaningful deal. Hopefully by the end of the year, if we get China and India confirmed, uh, that would be very exciting. And maybe that allows us to end out this bull market with a pretty decent run."</p>

好了，我们结束了。我们又熬过了一个月。标普指数在收盘时有所回落。Palantir历史上首次收于200美元以上。今天一度达到204美元。收盘价200.5美元。Grab收于六星级。谷歌报281美元。SoFi报2963美元。Hoodie收盘报14673美元。标普500指数略高于680点。AMD报256美元。Salesforce上涨1.4%，PayPal今天达到69美元，上涨1.3%。比特币报109美元，以太坊报38.884美元。BMR收盘报4668美元，还不错。昨晚曾冲到44美元。Circle上涨3.4%。AppLovin上涨2.6%。亚马逊收于245、244美元，略低于10%的涨幅，但在AWS业绩后能有这样的表现还是不错的。

<p class="english-text">All right, we're done. We survived another month. We survived another month. S&P selling off a bit into the close. Palunteer does get for the first time in history the $200 close. Got the 204 at one point today. 200.5 on pound here. Grab got the six-star close. Google at 281. SoFi at 2963. Hoodie 14673 on the close. S&P 500 just above 680. AMD at 256. Salesforce up 1.4, PayPal got to 69 today, up 1.3, Bitcoin at 109, Ethereum at 38.884, BMR on the close, we are at 4668, uh, which is not too bad. It was pushing 44 last night. Circle up 3.4%. App loaning up 2.6%. Amazon got the 245, 244, just below 10%, but nice to see it make that move after AWS.</p>

关于Meta，我们稍后会详细讨论。不幸的是，Meta没能拿出华尔街想看到的业绩指引，因为它在资本支出上过于激进。结果，Meta股价受挫。Meta收盘报648美元，然后苹果报271美元。微软也下跌了。实际上，本周几乎所有大型科技股都遭受了下跌。除了亚马逊和谷歌，它们是真正能够挺住的公司。苹果确实创下了历史新高，但在今天早些时候回落了。Cory上涨2%。Rocket Lab上涨3.2%。戴尔今天上涨0.58%。Irene报60.99美元，上涨4.6%。Nebius收盘价是否达到130美元？是的，收于130.5美元，还不错。Corweed再次报13370美元，非常不错。Archer上涨2.3%。Verizon上涨1.9%。然后戴尔报161美元。SMCI也出现了大幅反弹。任何在47.48美元抄底的人，今天都上涨了3%，收于5191美元。

<p class="english-text">Meta, we'll talk more about that. Unfortunately, Meta just really was not able to put up the numbers that or I shouldn't say put up the numbers, not able to put up the guidance that the street wanted to see because it was too aggressive on capex. And as a result, Meta got hit. Meta right there at 2 at 648 and then Apple at 271. Uh and then Microsoft also down. Actually, pretty much every big tech stock took a beating this week to the downside. Not a massive beating um outside of Amazon and Google. They were the ones that were actually able to hold on. Apple did get to those all-time highs, but gave it up earlier today. Cory right there 2%. Rocklab 3.2%. Dell up.58% on the day. Irene we got 60.99. That was up 4.6. Nebas did it get the 130 close. Nebas did get the 130.5 close. Not too bad. Corweed again right there at 13370 which is very nice to see. Archer right there up 2.3%. Verizon up 1.9. And then Dell 161. SMCI also great recovery. Anyone who bought that dip at 47.48. That one up 3% on the day. And that one right here at 5191.</p>

好了，我们来看看。特斯拉也上涨了3.5%，报455美元，即使在财报发布后，特斯拉也能守住。我的意思是，特斯拉在财报后跌至418美元，但它能够继续上涨。所以特斯拉在十月份以450美元收盘。好了，年度至今的收益率。我们来做一下。在聊天室里发出来。我知道我们周中做过一次，但我们通常每周五都做。让我们看看年度至今的收益率如何。

我的是173.9%。我想几周前我们还在120%。所以自从10月10日的低点以来，恢复得不错。当然，这一周也相当不错。如果你持有一些像Meta这样的股票，那可能会损害你这周的收益。如果你持有Palantir，那可能会帮助你。但很多不同的股票都恢复了，所以肯定对大多数投资组合有帮助。

Year to date 173.9 173.9 for me. 173.9 I think a couple weeks ago we were at 120. So decent recovery since the October 10th lows. Uh, but obviously this was also a pretty good week. I mean, if you were in some stocks like a Meta, that probably hurt your week. If you're in a pounder, that probably helped your week, but had a lot of different stocks recovered. So, definitely helping out the majority of portfolios.</p>

顺便说一下，标普500指数本月正式收官上涨2.38%。这是一个非常不错的月份。要获得2%的月度涨幅并不容易。它一度差点变成负4%的月份，但这个市场的韧性确实令人瞩目。年初至今，我们上涨了约17%，过去6个月上涨了23%，从4月份市场触底以来上涨了超过30%。

<p class="english-text">By the way, S&P 500 for the month to end it out officially is 2.38%. 2.38% on the S&P 500. It's a really nice month. I mean, it's not easy to get a 2% month. It almost went, you know, to a negative 4% month at one point, but the resiliency of this market is quite remarkable to see. Year to date, we're up about 17% over the past 6 months, 23 and well over 30% from the lows in April when things hit the fan.</p>

（读聊天室评论）Last说182%，感谢亚马逊。恭喜。Zoho 156%，Hans 300%，Abena 710%。这些数字真是太惊人了。而且你们有相当一部分人的收益率远超标普500指数的17%。不错，不错。是的，AMD仅本月就上涨了58%。我的意思是，当你持有像AMD这样的股票时……我忘了，十月份是AMD签署OpenAI协议的月份，对吧？博通也是一样。所以如果你重仓或者大量配置了这些股票，它们确实是表现出色的股票，这就是我们看到一些涨幅的原因。

I mean when you have names like AMD I dude I forgot October AMD is when they signed the uh this is the month where they signed the opening eye deal, right? Like same thing with Broadcom. So you got a lot of these names if you're leveraged into them or if you're just you know heavily allocated to them. these were the names that really did outperform and that's where we're seeing some move.</p>

### 展望十一月：波动中的机遇

话虽如此，汤姆·李在视频结尾确实说过，我们几天前谈到的技术分析师马克·牛顿说，十一月将会是震荡的。我有点同意这个观点。甚至不是从技术角度来看，而是我们已经有了很多涨幅，需要消化它们。而且，我们在10月10日回吐了那么多涨幅，然后又涨了回来甚至更多，消化一下是健康的，这意味着很多股票可能会盘整。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, having said that, Tom Lee did say at the end of that video that uh Mark Newton, which we talked about a couple days ago, the technical analyst said uh November's going to be choppy. And I kind of don't disagree with that. I mean, not even from a technical perspective, but just we've had a lot of gains. We got to digest them. And you know, we the fact that we gave up as many gains as we did back on October 10th and got them back and more, it would be healthy to digest them, which means a lot of these stocks probably consolidate.</p>
</details>

当然，其中一些股票有不同的催化剂，比如财报，可能会让它们的叙事重新评级。但像英伟达在202美元，下个月会涨到230美元吗？还是会盘整，可能在205到210美元之间稳定下来？这健康吗？我认为这将是我们必须看到的问题，即使年底的目标是7000点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, some of these stocks have different catalyst like earnings that could get them into a new rerating of their narrative. But like in Nvidia at 202, I mean, does this go to 230 next month or does this consolidate maybe settle in around 205, 210? Is that healthy? I think that's going to be the question that we have to see even with that 7,000 target towards the end of the year.</p>

我昨天告诉大家的关于加密货币的一个可怕数据是，上一次比特币在十月份收跌时——如果我们到不了115，这将是比特币的一个红色十月——我们在十一月份下跌了32%。当然，那是2018年，是周期的其中一年。那也是周期的最后一年。而且当时还发生了与中国的贸易战，美联储正在加息。我的意思是，你有很多不同的宏观因素需要考虑。所以我不认为这必然会在十一月发生，但这些是我们进入年底时必须注意的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The one scary stat I told everyone yesterday on crypto is that the last time Bitcoin finished red in October, which if we don't get to 115, it will be a red October for Bitcoin, we ended at 32% in November. Now granted, that was 2018. That was in one of the years of the cycle. That was also or that was the last year of the cycle. And um you were also having uh a trade war happened with China. The Fed was hiking rates. I mean, you had a lot of different macro things to consider. So, I don't think that's necessarily going to happen in November, but those are things that we have to watch out for as we get into the end of the year.</p>

对比特币的一个利好数据是这个：美国货币供应量在2025年9月同比增长4.5%，达到创纪录的22.2万亿美元。这是连续第19个月的增长，与美国可能停止量化紧缩同时发生，这是鲍威尔几天前说的。长期平均增长率约为6.3%。所以我们现在是4.5%，这相当惊人。经通胀调整后，M2供应量同比增长1.2%。这意味着什么？这意味着你必须拥有资产。市面上的钱越多，美元的实际价值就越低。这意味着你必须拥有能够保值的东西，无论是股票、一块土地、一处房产，还是一种商品。你可以把它归入这些类别，或者是一种加密货币，这可能就是你在整个股票市场看到的情况。

<details>

<p class="english-text">One bullish stat for Bitcoin is this. US money supply rose 4.5% year-over-year in in September 2025 to a record 22.2 trillion. This is a 19th consecutive monthly increase that happens in tandem with the United States likely um stopping quantitative tightening, which is what JPAL said a couple days ago. The long-term average growth has been about 6.3%. So, the fact that we're at 4.5% is pretty incredible. Adjusted for inflation, the M2 supply grew 1.2% year-over-year. What does this mean? This means you have to own assets. The more money that is out there, the less the dollar actually matters. Which means you have to own something that preserves the value of the dollar in the first place, which has to either be a stock, a piece of land, piece of property, uh, or a commodity. You know, that's kind of the buckets you can put it into, or a cryptocurrency, and that's likely what you're seeing across the entire equity markets.</p>

顺便说一下，美元本月实际上是上涨收官。我们在十月的大部分时间里都在97，最终收于9980，还不错。10年期国债收益率未能收于4%以下，但我们就在那之上，为4.095%。

<p class="english-text">The dollar, by the way, actually ended green for the month. We read 97 for the majority of October, ended out at 9980, which is not too bad. 10-year was not able to close below 4% but we are just above that at 4.095 and that's what we have right here.</p>

货币市场基金，我们昨天看了一下，增加了200亿美元，仍有7.42万亿美元在场外。这些钱还没有真正涌入资产市场，如果它选择在我们利率大幅下降时涌入，希望是在2026年下半年，那也可能成为市场的额外推动力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Money market funds yesterday we took a look at it they increased by 20 billion 7.42 trillion still on the sidelines that money still has not really flooded into the asset market and if it chooses to flood into the asset market when we do get rates to come down significantly hopefully towards the latter half of 2026 that could also be an additional tailwind for the market.</p>
</details>

我认为这场牛市的更广泛论据甚至不是根植于宏观经济，不是根植于利率、货币市场基金、场外资金、通货膨胀。我认为它真正根植于盈利。再说一次，我认为过去一个月我们关注的首要事情就是盈利。盈利好吗？我们看到的盈利是积极的吗？我们越看，就越觉得盈利在持续推动市场。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think the broader argument for this bull market is not even rooted in macro, not even rooted in rates, money, market funds, money on the sidelines, inflation. I think it's really genuinely rooted in earnings. And again, I I think the number one thing that we focused on over the past month is earnings. Are the earnings good? Are we seeing earnings in a way that's positive? The more and more we look at it, the more and more it seems that earnings are continuing to propel.</p>

顺便说一下，说到保护你的钱，看看这个。我今天早上甚至没看到这个，但Coinbase在他们的财报中披露，他们又买了1亿美元的以太坊。所以他们现在库里有6.17亿美元的以太坊。他们也买了更多的比特币。关于以太坊，另一件非常重要的事情是他们有Base，这是他们在以太坊下的**L2**（Layer 2: 第二层扩展解决方案，旨在提高区块链的可扩展性和效率）。所以，Coinbase正在以太坊的区块链上扩展他们的架构。因此，对我来说，我认为这对以太坊和BMR的长期发展也是非常利好的，因为世界上最重要的金融公司，无论是Robin Hood还是Coinbase，都在拥抱那个正在形成的新金融体系，这也很令人欣慰。

<details>

<p class="english-text">By the way, speaking of protecting your money, take a look at this. I didn't even see this this morning, but Coinbase on their earnings disclosed that they bought another 100 million of Ethereum. So, they now have 617 million of Ethereum on their treasury. They also bought more Bitcoin. The other thing that's really important about Ethereum is that they have base, which is their L2 underneath Ethereum. So, Coinbase is scaling their architecture on Ethereum's blockchain as well. And as a result, you know, to me, I think this is also very bullish Ethereum and BMR long term as the most important financial companies in the world. Whether it's Robin Hood or Coinbase are embracing that new financial system that is playing out which is also nice to see.</p>

SoFi在盘后交易中有所变动。SoFi真的在动吗，还是你们只是说说而已？这个百分比变动有多大？29.90美元。好吧，那是18美分的变动。我不知道这是否是天大的事，但有人在盘后买入SoFi，把它推高了18美分。看，SoFi是本周的失望之选。显然，人们对它在发布了重磅季度业绩后却没有真正上涨感到非常恼火。看，这可能发生在任何股票上。下周可能发生在Palantir上，可能发生在Grab上，可能发生在Robin Hood上。可能发生在任何这些股票上。这就是投资的本质。你不能对它的年初至今回报抱怨太多，因为SoFi的表现远超大盘。

<p class="english-text">SoFi is moving after hours. Is SoFi actually moving or are you guys just saying it's moving? How much of a percentage move is this? 29.90 SoFi. Okay, that's a 18 cent move. I I don't know if that's the biggest deal in the world, but someone's buying SoFi after hours to the tune of moving it up 18 cents. Dude, look, SoFi was the disappointment of this week. Obviously, people were super annoyed that it didn't really make the move even after it had a a blockbuster quarter. And look, that that that could happen to any stock. It might happen to Palantry next week, might happen to Grab, might happen to Robin. It might happen to any of these stocks. It's just the nature of investing. like you can't complain too much about its year-to-day return as SoFi has vastly outperformed the broader market.</p>

就今天的期权市场而言，看看交易量排名前20的股票。英伟达今天交易了320万份期权。特斯拉为320万份，亚马逊270万份，苹果160万份，Meta 150万份，Palantir 110万份，IBIT，MicroStrategy，AMD，微软，Hood，SoFi有50万份合约，谷歌，Coinbase，SMCI，英特尔，Rocket（财报不错），Beyond Meat，Open，然后是Regetti。不幸的是，Beyond Meat的股票今天再次遭到重创。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In terms of the options market today, take a look at the top 20 stocks that were traded. Nvidia 3.2 million options traded today. Tesla was at 3.2, Amazon 2.7, Apple at 1.6, Meta at 1.5, Pounder 1.1, IBIT, Micro Strategy, AMD, Microsoft Hood, SoFi at 500,000 contracts, Google, Coinbase, SMCI, Intel, Rocket, which had a great earnings, Beyond Meat, Open, and then Regetti. Unfortunately for Beyond Meat, that stock got clobbered again today.</p>
</details>

有些人深度投资于这只股票，比如这个人，他持有927,900股Beyond Meat，占他投资组合的62%，价值150万美元。他公开了这些信息。你知道，那是一大笔钱。我觉得有很多地方可以投资那笔钱，但无论如何，它被投在了Beyond Meat。现在，我确实认为Beyond Meat可能有更大的故事，因为它的**卖空股数占流通股数的比例**（short float）是161%，所以空头们实际上在借入不存在的股票。我只是觉得，押注于某种大规模的轧空行情的风险回报可能不是最有趣的。但市场上有那一部分，然后你有一家像亚马逊这样的公司，它实际上在公布真正重要的盈利。所以就是这样。

<p class="english-text">Um, again, there are people that are deeply in this name like this guy who has 927,900 shares of Beyond Meat, 62% of his portfolio, 1.5 million. He posted this publicly. And uh, you know, that's just a lot of money. I feel like there's a lot of places you could put that money, but nonetheless, it is uh in Beyond Meat. Now, again, I do think there might be a bigger story to Beyond Meat given that the uh given that the short float is 161% and so the shorts are literally borrowing shares that don't exist. I just feel like the riskreward on betting on some massive short squeeze, you know, might not be the most fun. But you got that part of the market and then you got a company like Amazon that's actually like putting up earnings that really matters. So there you go.</p>

《Palantir周报》将于今晚11点播出。我知道我们很久没做了，但我们会为《Palantir周报》直播，我们会讨论盈利预期和所有这些东西。看，我现在简单的预览是，我认为他们会……他们给出的指引是50%的增长，10.9亿美元。去年，他们做了7.25亿美元。所以他们需要达到11.5亿到12亿美元才能真正实现超过他们给出的50%指引的加速增长。这是我所期望的。我不知道我们是否能得到。也许我们能，也许不能。如果我们得不到，也许股票会大跌。如果我们得到了，也许股票会持平。如果我们真的超过了，也许股票会涨到220、210美元。现在是涨势已经发生了。记住，Palantir上周还在170美元。所以我的观点是，也许它会在185美元左右稳定下来，然后一个非常好的季度会让我们达到200美元。那个涨势已经发生了。所以现在它使盈利情况复杂化了。这就是为什么很难押注盈利。

<p class="english-text">Pounder Weekly will be tonight 11 p.m. I know we haven't done it in a long time, but we will be live for Pounder Weekly and uh we'll go through earnings expectations and all that stuff. So, uh look, my simple preview right now is I think they're going to they guided for 50% growth, 1.09 billion. Last year, they did 700 25 million. So, they're going to need to come in at like 1.15 1.2 to really have an accelerated beat above the 50% guidance that they gave. That's what I'm expecting. I don't know if we're going to get it. Maybe we do, maybe we don't. If we don't, maybe the stock tanks. If we do, maybe the stock is flat. If we really beat it, maybe the stock gets to 220, 2 to 210. It's now that the move has already happened. Remember, pounder was at 170 last week. So my perspective was maybe it settles around 185 and then a really good quarter gets us to 200. That move's happened. And so now it complicates the earnings picture. That's why it's so hard to to bet on earnings.</p>
</details>

同样的事情也适用于Hood。我的意思是，Hood在财报前已经有所回升，回到了历史高点。所以这些公司将不得不拿出非常惊人的数字。如果他们能拿出那些数字，那显然也会帮助他们的股价。Twilio，哇，看看那个。Twilio今天上涨了19%。它一度更高，在138美元。所以一些SaaS公司确实拿出了一些好数字。我们昨天谈过这个。Roku今天也上涨了7%，还不错。是的，Shift 4下周。AMD，SMCI，下周我们有很多公司要关注。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And same thing with Hood. I mean, Hood has kind of made a move back to alltime highs before earnings. So these companies are going to really have to put up amazing numbers. And if they can put up those numbers, then that's obviously going to help their share price as well. Twilio, wow, look at that. 19% day for Twilio. It was even higher at one point. It was at 138. So, some of these SAS companies really put up some good numbers. We talked about that yesterday. And Roku was up 7% as well on the day, which is not too bad. Yeah, Shift 4 is next week. AMD, SMCI, got a lot of companies next week that we are going to be going to be looking at.</p>

好了，这就是我们对一些盈利预期的看法。让我们来看几个更多的头条新闻。首先，特朗普在佛罗里达降落时与一些记者交谈。他说了几件事，他愿意与民主党人会面。所有民主党人需要做的就是开放政府，这是他在抵达佛罗里达时对记者说的。所以，总统正在努力结束这次关门。

<p class="english-text">All right, so that's what we got with some of those earnings expectations. Let's get into a few more of these headlines. First of all, Trump was speaking with uh some reporters as he landed in Florida. A couple things he said he's willing to meet with the Democrats. All Democrats have to do is open the government as he was speaking to reporters when he arrived in Florida. So, you do have the president trying to get this shutdown to be done.</p>
</details>

现在，关于这次关门，有一件非常重要的事情，这是几个小时前开始引起警报的事情，因为我们正在接近一个关键点，那就是**SNAP福利**（SNAP benefits: Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program，补充营养援助计划，即食品券）。我们正在接近政府将不得不开始动用一些应急基金来支付国家必须支付给那些享受这些福利的人的福利。

> **记者：** 我们一直在等待联邦法院今天就特朗普政府决定不在11月1日资助SNAP项目的裁决。我们现在实际上有两位不同的法官做出了两种不同的裁决。让我们从罗德岛的那个开始。那位法官基本上当庭裁决，告诉美国政府他们需要为SNAP项目找到资金。他们提到了应急基金。这是布鲁克·罗林斯部长刚才告诉我们他们不能使用的那个。现在，一位联邦法官说，“你们需要去用那个。” 另一方面，马萨诸塞州的一位法官似乎也倾向于政府需要以某种方式提供SNAP福利，他们不能切断这个项目，但他们说他们需要白宫实际书面说明他们计划不继续资助该项目，或者他们不打算寻找备用资金来源。所以，两位不同的法官，但观点大致相同。总的来说，这似乎是法院在告诉特朗普政府，他们将不得不找到一种方法为SNAP项目提供资金，他们不能像担心的那样明天就结束它。

<p class="english-text">>> is Emily Wilkins does and she joins us now from DC. >> Hey Brian. Well, we were waiting to see how federal courts would rule today on the Trump administration deciding to to not be funding the SNAP program on November 1st. We now actually have two different judges making two different rulings. Let's start with the one in Rhode Island. That judge basically ruled from the bench telling the US government that they need to find funding for that SNAP program. They mentioned the contingency fund. This is the one that Brooke Rollins, a secretary, just told us a little bit ago they couldn't use. Now, a federal judge is saying, "You need to go ahead and use that." A Massachusetts judge, on the other hand, also seems to be leaning in the direction that the government will need to provide SNAP benefits somehow, that they cannot cut off the program, but they're saying that they need the White House to actually put in writing that they plan to not continue to fund that program or that they're not planning on finding a backup source of funding. So, two different judges there. Kind of in the same vein, though. It sounds like the overall takeaway from this is that the courts are telling uh the Trump administration that they are going to have to find a way to get funds into the SNAP program and they're not just going to be able to end it tomorrow as was fear.</p>
</details>

这将非常重要，因为有些美国人依赖这些食品福利，而特朗普政府通过切断这些福利，显然会激怒很多人，让他们对民主党人不满，对吧？整个要点是，如果你能让你的选民对那些从共和党的角度来看关闭国家的人感到愤怒，那么你就有可能让他们坐到谈判桌前。嗯，现在有联邦法官说你不能这么做，因为人们需要吃饭，你必须找到一种方法来资助人们通过这些SNAP福利获得食物。结果，这继续使关门的情况复杂化。所以我认为这是我们在十一月将不得不应对的另一层问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Now, this is going to be really important because there are Americans that have those food benefits and the Trump administration by cutting off those food benefits obviously was going to get a lot of people angry at the Democrats, right? The whole point is like if you can get your constituents to get mad at the people that are shutting down the country from the Republicans's perspective, then you could possibly get them to come to the negotiating table. Well, you got federal judges saying you're not going to be allowed to do that because people need to eat and you have to find a way to fund the way for people to get the funding for them to eat via these SNAP benefits. And as a result, it continues to complicate the picture when it comes to the shutdown. So, I think that's another layer to November that we're going to have to navigate.</p>
</details>

鉴于十一月明天就要到了，我应该在这里做一个投票。问题很简单：十一月是涨是跌？我个人会选涨，因为从季节性来看，它通常平均上涨4%。所以我认为十一月会没问题。但我也确实认为，考虑到要应对政府关门和所有这些需要消化的财报，十一月会有一些波动。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I'm I should do a poll right here given that November is uh upon us tomorrow. Uh and here's the question. Very simple question. Green or red November? Green or red November? I mean, look, I'm going to go green because seasonally it ends up usually being green by an average of 4%. So, I think that November is going to be fine. But I also do think there's some choppiness to expect in November given navigating the shutdown and all this earnings that has to be digested.</p>
</details>

美联储理事沃勒表示，尽管政府关门，我们仍有大量数据。我们今天从PMI中获得了一些更多的数据，这很重要。然后Axios报道，根据议长迈克·约翰逊的计划，美国众议院下周将继续休会，在为期31天的关门期间继续无限期休会。哇，我们已经到了第31天。再过四天，这将正式成为历史上最长的政府关门。根据目前的策略，预计不会有投票。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Uh Fed Governor Waller says we have a lot of data despite the government shutdown. We did get a little bit more data today from the PMI which was important. And then Axio is reporting the US House will stay out of session next week under Speaker Mike Johnson's plan continuing the indefinite recess amid the 31-day shutdown. Wow, we are at day 31. Four more days and officially this is longest shutdown in history. No votes are expected per the current strategy.</p>
</details>

是的，这将是我们在进入十一月时必须应对的另一件事。亚马逊在盘后交易中又下跌了一点，报244美元，出现了一根小小的红色蜡烛。我的答案是橙色。看，十一月对比特币来说通常不差。所以我们得看看。十月通常很好，但很奇怪。即使有降息，即使M2供应增加，十月对比特币来说就是不够友好。这次不是。这真的让人不禁要问，十月到底发生了什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah, that is going to be another thing that we have to navigate going into November. Amazon right there down a little bit more after hours 244 as it has a little bit of a red candle. You know, my answer is orange. I mean, look, November tends to not be horrible for Bitcoin. So, we're going to have to see. October tends to be really good, but it is quite surprising. Even with rate cuts, even with M2 supply increasing, uh October just wasn't friendly enough for Bitcoin. Not this time. And it really begs the question, what exactly happened uh in October.</p>
</details>

现在，2024年和2023年，十一月都很棒。所以我们在2023年有8%的涨幅，2024年有37%的涨幅。然后在2020年，你有42%的涨幅。所以2021年和2022年对比特币来说不是最好的，但23年和24年一直相当不错。也许十月的一些盘整并不坏，因为我们准备迎接十一月，这也不会太糟。所以我们得看看那个最终会如何发展。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, 2024 and 2023, November was great. So, we had an 8% 2023 and a 37% move in 2024. And then in 2020, you had a 42% move. So, 2021 and 2022 were not the best for Bitcoin, but 23 and 24 have been pretty good. Maybe some consolidation in October is not horrible as we uh as we get ready for November, which wouldn't be too bad. So, we're going to have to see how that one also ends up playing out.</p>
</details>

好了，关于美联储和白宫的情况，有几点更新。让我拿出几件其他的事情，然后我们继续。首先，Coinbase收购了一家名为Deribit的期货衍生品公司，那是三个月前。据报道，他们正在分阶段收购另一家名为BBNK的公司。这里的想法是加强Coinbase的稳定币和支付基础设施。稳定币再次获得更多动力。此举与加密金融领域的更广泛整合和战略定位相一致。据报道，Coinbase正在接近一笔20亿美元的收购。再次，他们绝对是超出了盈利预期，但随着他们想要扩张，他们将会有越来越多的收购。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, all right. So, couple updates right there in terms of the Fed and in terms of what's going on with the White House. Let me pull up a couple other things right here and then we'll keep going from there. First of all, Coinbase uh they acquired a futures derivative firm called Derivit uh last what three months ago uh reportedly in stages to acquire another company called BBNK. And the idea here is to strengthen Coinbase's stablecoin and payments infrastructure. Once again, stable coins continuing to get more momentum. The move aligns with broader consolidation and strategic positioning in crypto finance. Coinbase is reportedly nearing a $2 billion acquisition. Again, they absolutely crushed earnings, but as they want to expand, they're going to have more and more acquisitions.</p>
</details>

我们还有另一条宏观新闻，美国银行存款从前一周的18.508万亿美元下降到18.5万亿美元。所以银行存款略有下降。没什么太大的，但不像……我忘了十月是如此疯狂。我们有这场区域性银行信贷危机，人们都非常害怕。结果那只持续了一天，然后就没人关心了。所以银行在十月初也以非常强劲的财报季开局。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Another piece of macro news that we have uh right here is that, let's pull this up. US bank deposits fell to 18.5 trillion from 18.508 trillion in the prior week. So, you have a little bit of a decline on bank deposits. Nothing too substantial, but nothing like the I forgot October was so crazy. We had this regional banking credit crisis that people were so scared about. And you know that ended up lasting for like a day and then no one cared. So the banks also started off October with a really strong earning session.</p>

我的意思是，杰米·戴蒙，Tanner几天前上节目时分享了杰米·戴蒙在中东会议上说他现在拥抱稳定币的片段，特别地，他说他在稳定币上错了，即使在称比特币为骗局之后。这是给那些没看过的人的片段。

### Grab的AI雄心

好了，Grab，让我播放这个视频。我知道很多人一直在问这个。感谢Mike拿到这个片段。这是公司的首席运营官亚历克斯·亨盖特。这是他对Grab如何拥抱AI的看法。我认为这是一个非常好的15分钟采访，但这个两分钟的片段突出了Grab在我们周一财报来临之际，越来越成为一家AI公司的本质。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, Grab, let me play this video. Uh, this is I know a lot of people have been asking for this. Shout out to Mike for getting this clip. This was the CEO COO of the company, Chief Operating Officer, Alex Hungate. Here's what he had to say about how Grab is embracing AI. I think it's a really good 15-minute interview, but this two-minute clip kind of highlights the nature of Grab becoming more of an AI company as we get into earnings on Monday that we have.</p>
</details>

> **亚历克斯·亨盖特：** 我们将如何做到这一点？好消息是，Grab已经是一个相当大的AI玩家了。我们已经运行了大约10000个AI模型，这可能使我们成为该地区最大的AI玩家之一。我们已经扮演的一个功能是，我们在大型基础模型（目前主要在美国生产）和东南亚之间架起桥梁，使它们更适用于东南亚。我们是OpenAI在该地区唯一的灯塔合作伙伴，这意味着我们可以在模型准备好后立即访问，但在正式发布之前，然后我们对它们进行微调。
>
> 我给你举个例子，说明这有多重要。当我们第一次拿到40模型时，我们试图用它进行语音识别，因为我们的目标是帮助视障人士更好地使用应用程序。它在东南亚只有45%的时间有效，而且还是用英语。所以一个说英语的人在东南亚尝试使用它，由于我们不同的口音、不同的地名等，它有45%的时间不起作用。这使得它不适合使用。所以我们有大约12万东南亚人给了我们语音样本。所以现在它的准确率是92%，这实际上还不错。
>
> 这是我们可以扮演的一个角色。另一个角色是，我们正试图通过给司机提供我们称之为“副驾驶”的东西来提高他们的生产力。它帮助他们在一天中定位自己，确保他们能获得尽可能多的收入。它会通知他们道路封闭。他们自己也可以用语音报告道路封闭，这样就不危险了。
>
> 对于商家，我们正试图用我们称之为“商家聊天机器人”的东西来帮助他们，这非常了不起。他们不仅得到了一个CFO和一个CMO，还得到了情感支持。一个生活教练，印尼的一个商家两周前实际上在给我看她和她的Grab聊天机器人的聊天记录，她一直在问，哦，你知道，我怎么提高销售额等等。然后就到了，哦，你能给我一些关于不同菜单项的建议吗？聊天机器人看了看该地区的其他餐馆，找出了人们在搜索什么，找出了差距，并提出了建议。
>
> 然后她说，“哦，我不会做那个。你知道，怎么做？” 聊天机器人给了烹饪建议。然后说，“哦，我应该放什么？” 并给了她下单的建议，根据销售预测，提前期应该多长。然后这还不是全部。最后一部分绝对是最好的部分。最后一部分是她实际上在一个聊天中说，“哦，你能给我一些鼓励吗？” 聊天机器人说，“嘿，别担心，姐们，你做得很好。继续加油。” 这太暖心了。就像，就像有心的AI。所以，我认为这是我们真正能提供帮助的方式。当然，我们能提供的贷款和保险类产品也应该随着AI变得越来越好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How are we going to do that? Uh the good news is that Grab is already quite a big AI player. We run about 10,000 AI models already. Uh which makes us probably one of the bigger ones in the region. Um, and a function that we already play is we bridge between the large foundation models which are being produced largely out of the US at the moment and then we make them more relevant for Southeast Asia. We're the only lighthouse partner for OpenAI in the region which means we get access to foundational models as soon as they're ready but before the official releases and then we fine-tune them. Um, and I give you example of how important that is. When we first got the um the 40 model, we tried to use it for speech recognition because we were targeting to help the visually impaired to be able to use the app better. It only worked 45% of the time for Southeast Asia and that was in English. That's in English. So 45% of the time an English speaker tried to use it in Southeast Asia and because of our different accents, different place names, etc., it didn't work. That makes it not fit for purpose. So we we've had about 120,000 Southeast Asians have given us voice samples. So now it's 92% accuracy, which is not too bad actually. Yeah. So that's one role that we can play. Another role is we're trying to improve the productivity of our drivers by giving them uh what we call co-pilot. It helps them to position themselves during the day, make sure that they get the the maximum possible earnings that they can get. Um it informs them of road closures. They themselves can report road closures, you know, using voice so it's not unsafe. Um for the merchants, we're trying to help them with a merchant chat, what we call merchant chatbot, which has been phenomenal. You know, not only they did they get the CFO and a CMO, but they also get like emotional support. A life coach, one of the merchants in Indonesia actually two weeks ago was showing me her chat with her her Grab chatbot and she'd been she'd been asking about, oh, you know, how do I get sales up, etc. And then it got to, oh, can you give me advice on different menu items? And the chatbot kind of looked at the different restaurants in the area, worked out what people were searching for, worked out what the gaps were and and suggested. And then she said, "Oh, I can't cook that. You know, how do you cook it?" Gives a cooking advice. Then says, "Oh, what shall I put in?" And given her advice for which orders to put in, um, how long the lead time should be based on the prediction and number of sales. And then that's not all. The last part which is absolutely the best part. The last part was she had actually said one of the chats she showed me said, "Oh, can you just give me some encouragement?" And the chat boys say, "Hey, don't worry sis, you're doing well. Keep it up." It was so endearing. It's like it's like AI with heart, you know. So, I think that's the way that uh you know, we can really help. And of course our lending um and insurance type products that we can provide also should get better and better with AI.</p>
</details>

我认为这里有很多可以解读的地方，但其核心是，Grab正在进入各种不同的AI垂直领域，特别是从那些坦率地说依赖于这样一个平台的人们的用例出发。他们没有CMO或CFO或整个团队来帮助他们发展业务。从这个角度来看，当你拿一个大型语言模型，并根据Grab应该使其有用的特定领域进行微调时——这才是重点，对吧？我们如何为这些模型找到有意义的用例？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Is anyone else kind? >> So I think there's a lot to unpack there but at its core you know there are a variety of different AI verticals that grab is stepping into particularly from the use cases of people that quite frankly depend on a platform like that. They don't have a CMO or a CFO or a entire team to help them grow a business. And from that perspective, when you take a large language model and fine-tune it to the context specific arenas of what Grab should be making it useful for, which is the whole point, right? How can we get a use case for these models that make sense?</p>
</details>

顺便说一句，QuantumScape今天上涨了16%。所以对于任何持有QS的人来说，这都相当惊人。这是一家电池公司，今天涨幅非常大，上涨了16%。这就是我认为该公司长期正在发展的更广泛的网络效应。我不知道周一会发生什么。我不知道股票会涨还是会跌。我只知道，他们之所以能获得整个地区近75%的市场份额，是因为他们正在拥抱并投资于研发，以便能够构建产品、产品套件和工具，这些产品基本上将使该地区许多人的生活变得更好。随着时间的推移，随之而来的是盈利能力、盈利增长等等，还有80亿美元的现金。所以我们将看看它最终会如何发展。但我认为那是一个很好的采访。如果有人想看，我会把链接放在聊天室里。

<p class="english-text">By the way, QuantumCape 16% day. So pretty incredible for QS for anyone who's in that. There's a battery company really big move today is that one's up 16%. Uh that's what I think is the broader network effect that the company is developing over the long term. I don't know what's going to happen on Monday. I don't know if the stock's going to go up or down. All I know is that the reason they're getting the market share of almost 75% of the entire region is because they're embracing and they're investing in R&D to be able to build products and suites and tools of products that essentially are going to make lives much better for a lot of people in the region. And with that over time comes profitability, comes earnings growth, etc. along with 8 billion cash. So we're going to see how it ultimately plays out. But I thought that was a good interview. If anyone wants to watch it, I'll put the link right here in the chat.</p>

### 嘉宾对谈：深入探讨投资哲学

> **主持人：** 好了，各位。让我们请一位嘉宾来到周五的《市场收盘》节目，听听他们对过去一周全球资本股票市场情况的看法。他名字里有两个词，但老实说，我们应该只叫他第二个词，因为没必要说第一个词。他是马特·钱，但我们应该就叫他钱。女士们，先生们。马特，你好吗，先生？
>
> **马特：** 谢谢你邀请我。很高兴来到这里。
>
> **主持人：** 谢谢你来，伙计。你好吗？你今天在家工作还是刚回来？
>
> **马特：** 我在家工作。说实话，希望公司的同事没在看，我没做太多工作，但就这样吧。
>
> **主持人：** 好了。我想我将从我的第一个问题开始，这是一个我们已经参与了很长时间的旅程。Palantir股价200美元。你对这只股票在这个水平上有什么看法？
>
> **马特：** 我今天或者昨天又买了一些。是的。我的意思是，买得不多，只是我一直以来的每月购买。每次我拿到薪水，我就会……
>
> **主持人：** 把你的麦克风音量调低一点。
>
> **马特：** 是不是有点太响了？
>
> **主持人：** 有点大。
>
> **马特：** 有点大。我想它已经调到最低了。也许我把它移开一点。
>
> **主持人：** 是的。
>
> **马特：** 告诉我这样是不是好一点。
>
> **主持人：** 完美。我觉得这样好多了。
>
> **马特：** 好的，完美。我正在调整麦克风，想让声音听起来更饱满。也许我调得太饱满了。但是，是的，我只是认为还有很多东西有待发布，比如AI、FTE，很多很棒的产品，我认为还没有完全推出。当这些真正实现时，我认为我们会在很多不同的公司看到效率的大幅提升。Palantir的运营利润率持续表现良好。我预计，而且我认为Arie早些时候有一篇很好的帖子，谈到他认为这将是本季度一个很好的故事。但我更关心的是我们能获得多少更多的小合同，对吧？我认为很多人一直非常……我认为他们现在唯一抱怨的是，哦，他们只有一千个客户之类的。我想说，嗯，我认为他们不久的将来推出的东西将使他们能够接触到那些较小的客户，这些客户实际上也能为底线增加很多，但他们不一定有运营足迹，也就是说，没有足够的现场部署工程师去到每一家公司，对吧？我认为这将非常有帮助。所以我很高兴看到公司的进步，我也期待着50%的同比增长。所以，这将是很有趣的观察。
>
> **主持人：** 我认为很酷的一点是，你和我都一样，随着公司股价上涨，我们都觉得估值变得激进，我们对此都非常坦诚，就像Arie和Amir一样。但我们几乎所有人都被这样一个事实所折服，那就是执行力太强了，现在就像，哦，在某个时候，如果你想要更多，你就得买，对吧？按照你的哲学，就是继续买入更多。你有点像是说，去他妈的10美元、15美元的漂亮平均成本，你就是买更多。
>
> **马特：** 是的。我的意思是，我从一个不同的角度看问题，对吧？我昨天和某人谈到这个。他们问，你觉得怎么样？我应该在这里卖掉吗？之类的。首先，我认为当人们考虑这个问题时，对吧？如果他们像你我一样一直持有，并且他们在6、7、8美元的范围内有股票，然后他们在这里以200美元卖掉，他们将不得不支付，你知道，差不多15%到20%的联邦税，取决于他们的税级，用于长期资本利得。所以在他们甚至重新入场之前，股票必须下跌到至少160美元，他们才能重新入场。所以在他们回本之前，对吧？除非是在一个有税收优惠的账户里，那样你就可以玩更多的游戏。但我不认为人们经常考虑这个问题。我认为他们会说，“哦，我多了5%的股票。” 但实际上，“你还锁定了20%的税，或者短期资本利得的30%，你必须支付的税率。”
>
> **马特：** 但无论如何，回到真正的问题上，我只是看到了公司持续的执行力。五年前，我以为它会是一家1500亿到2000亿美元的公司。从那时起，而且这几乎每周都有记录，当我有机会上《Palantir周报》时，我都会说，“不，它已经发展到了一个地步”，你知道，它达到了万亿美元的估值，最近我把它提高到了一万五千亿美元。有些人可能会说那仍然是看跌的，我同意。就像我认为那可能仍然低估了潜力，但我只是不想太超前。但是，如果你从那个角度考虑，我们现在只有5000亿美元，相比于那个1.5万亿。是的。然后还会有回购和许多其他事情。就像当你拥有这样确定的机会时，对吧？为什么要赌不确定性？
>
> **主持人：** 是的。
>
> **马特：** 我明白你会说，“哦，那笔钱本可以用在别处。我可以在别处赚5到10倍。” 但对我来说，Palantir是确定的，对吧？如果你看那些可能让你赚5到10倍的东西，它们可能不确定。所以对我来说，你知道，当我拥有那些确定的东西时，我不是在寻找……Palantir对我来说是确定的。Rocket Lab对我来说是确定的。我喜欢押注于确定性。所以，嗯，为什么要……同样的事情也适用于亚马逊，对吧？我们稍后会谈到。所以，就像，为什么要赌它输呢，你知道吗？这就是我当时的想法，我为什么不一直**成本平均法**（DCA: Dollar-Cost Averaging）加仓呢？这就是我重新开始购买的原因。
>
> **主持人：** 我同意。有时候你最好的想法就是你最初的想法，你第一个想法，你知道吗，就像市场中有很多机会，拥有更多某样东西绝对是……从长远来看，特别是如果你像你说的那样，你非常有信心，你知道它是一个赢家，而且他们已经证明了他们是赢家，即使它们很贵。你不是第一次以这个价格购买。所以加仓并不是世界上最糟糕的事情。在进入亚马逊之前，我只想更广泛地问你关于大型科技公司财报的问题。显然，几乎所有公司都表现出色，即使他们的一些股价没有反映出来。你是否和许多其他人一样，认为大型科技公司只会变得更大，人们应该考虑继续定投到世界上最好的公司？
>
> **马特：** 我认为26年将是好的一年，但我认为我们将进入这个非常极端看涨、轻松赚钱阶段的后半段。现在，它可能会持续到27年。你知道，我不认为……也许我会再次被证明是错的，我以前也被证明错过，因为你想想。亚马逊投资超过1000亿美元。他们将在年底前投资超过1250亿美元。Meta也在投资大量资金。所以所有这些公司，但他们一直在谈论扩大他们将投入的资本量。而真正拥有多余资本，可以不动用自己资金的只有微软和亚马逊。其他所有人都不得不动用他们的现金储备。或者在甲骨文的情况下发行债务，对吧？所以，你知道，我不认为我们处于……你知道，除非收入真正开始进来，现金流真正开始进来，否则我认为我们会开始碰壁。当我说“碰壁”时，听起来可能有点极端。我绝不是看跌。我不是说要卖掉这些东西，但我只是说，当我们真正碰到并且无法像亚马逊那样从500亿增长到1000亿甚至1250亿的资本支出时，会产生一些反弹，因为你想想英伟达获得了多高的估值，以及人们继续将此计入价格。你知道，如果你开始有回调，你要么必须削减回购、股息，要么削减资本支出，对吧？在这方面要变得更平衡。所以，我觉得那些能做得好的公司将是那些能够贯穿周期进行投资并尽其所能驾驭周期的公司。我认为我们将在未来两到三年内看到谁拥有最好的管理层，以及真正应该坚持谁。因为我认为时局会……我失去你了吗？
>
> **主持人：** 不，你很好。你很好。
>
> **马特：** 好的。
>
> **主持人：** 你说时局会变得更加动荡，最终最好的管理团队是你想押注的。
>
> **马特：** 是的。是的。100%。
>
> **主持人：** 我认为这很公平。我认为这些“七巨头”公司，并非所有都以最具吸引力的市盈率交易，但无论如何，这些是世界上最重要的公司，它们拥有的护城河坚不可摧。所以我一直在思考2026年会是什么样子，我越来越接近一个结论，那就是，是的，有些你想进入的高风险高回报的投资，比如Rocket Lab、Palantir、Robin Hood对我们来说就是这样。但为了晚上睡得更好，定投到微软，即使它不会疯狂上涨，也绝不是坏事。因此，更深入地思考这个问题并不是最糟糕的事情。亚马逊，所以我想在这里给你点赞。你宣扬亚马逊的论点已经很长时间了，尽管直到最近你得到了结果，才有人听。谷歌你也在宣扬。我认为更多人利用了那个机会。你认为亚马逊为什么能如此出人意料地给华尔街带来惊喜？

> **马特：** 我认为亚马逊的轻松之处在于，你知道，首先，我认为有些人指着账面上的Anthropic净收益说，“哦，你知道，他们不应该被奖励。” 但你看到了AWS的加速增长，我认为这是不可避免的，对吧？你在过去12个月里将资本支出增加到超过千亿美元。所以这显然应该会带来一些影响，考虑到我认为他们几年前只花了500亿美元。所以在资本支出方面，这应该会希望增加AWS的顶线收入增长。但另一方面，亚马逊的估值已经收缩了很长一段时间。它的市盈率与谷歌相似甚至更低。所以在这方面，我认为亚马逊没有被假定有任何未来的增长。如果你看一个像亚马逊这样的优质企业，即使它只是以每年5%到10%的稳健速度增长，你也应该给它一个20到25倍的市盈率，因为它是第一的优质企业。你在电子商务领域是第一，你在云服务领域是第一，你有一个不断增长的广告业务。他们还有什么没做的？他们有一个顶级的视频点播平台。所以对我来说，那是一个优质企业，对吧？如果可口可乐在历史基础上能以22倍的市盈率交易，为什么亚马逊不能？所以，你有点像有了一个底线，对我来说，就像，嗯，最终他们会从那个底线突破，因为他们有很好的现金流和AWS仍然拥有的巨大机会。对我来说，这是一个利润率的故事。你听到安迪·贾西在电话会议上亲自谈到。他说，看，因为文化，我们确保我们尽可能地提高效率，对吧？这就是为什么他们裁掉那些员工。这正表明利润率对他们来说是一个非常重要的部分。所以你开始做一些数学计算，你说，嗯，他们还没有停止增长。他们很快就会达到1.5万亿美元的收入。如果他们能把运营利润率提高到25%，我的意思是，那将产生的运营现金流将是巨大的。那将接近4000亿美元。你给它一个25倍的市盈率，这家公司没有理由在未来几年内不值6万亿美元。是的。然后你再给它一点发展空间。没有理由它不应该达到10万亿美元的市值。所以，对我来说，这几乎是一个无需思考的选择。在2022年到现在它一直在波动的那段时间里。
>
> **主持人：** 是的。你当时在85美元左右买入。
>
> **马特：** 是的。不幸的是，在22年底的那次下跌中，当其他人都买Meta时，我买了亚马逊。所以，你知道，我买了亚马逊和谷歌，谷歌给我带来了不错的回报，但亚马逊没那么好。但你知道，我并没有亏钱或什么的，但你知道，我本可以投资像Meta这样的东西赚更多钱。但对我来说，你知道，我只是认为亚马逊是进入2030年及以后的一个无需思考的股票。
>
> **主持人：** 现在Meta下跌了15%，你对它有兴趣吗？
>
> **马特：** 我现在是一股的股东。你启发了我。我看到你买了……我不知道你买了多少股。不重要，但我就想，你知道吗？我需要参与进来。我总是这样做。
>
> **主持人：** 你在Robin Hood上买的。是的，我记得。
>
> **马特：** 是的。是的。我最近开始这样做。那些让我感兴趣、我想继续关注的股票，我就会买一股。
>
> **主持人：** 是的。所以我很高兴看到它继续下跌，因为我担心它会直接回到700美元以上，我就再也没有机会了。所以我认为我实际上可能会开始一个小额的，你知道，每次发薪水几百块钱的那种定投。
>
> **主持人：** 暴富或者在尝试中死去。暴富或者在尝试中死去。
>
> **马特：** 不，但那确实是你人生的座右铭。暴富或者在尝试中死去。这更多是因为下跌，还是因为它是一个超大规模云服务提供商，你知道没人能复制Meta？
>
> **马特：** 我实际上最看好的是，我做过一个视频。我不知道是不是……我想我还在我旧公寓的时候，所以那一定是2022年。当公司从Facebook改名为Meta时，我非常看好。
>
> **马特：** 我不认为我们完全理解，尽管它仍然在亏损一大笔钱。我不认为我们完全理解Reality Labs未来会做什么。我认为那将在事物如何运作中扮演一个巨大的角色。我认为你开始看到它实现了。我认为人们最初说谷歌眼镜太超前了。但现在你看Meta眼镜，人们对它更接受了，即使有些人仍然取笑。但我认为他们抓住了一些东西。我认为，你知道，希望它能够实现，并且对他们来说会成功。目前，Reality Labs有点像一个创新的垃圾场，最终会有东西成功的，在我的想法中。但总的来说，我不知道。我持谨慎乐观态度。这是一个很棒的业务。它会继续做得很好。Threads比我想象的更受欢迎。你知道，它沉寂了一段时间。最初非常火爆，然后有点沉寂了，然后它又找到了自己的浪潮。所以，你知道，我认为马克，我不认为人们给了他足够的赞誉。他是一个战时CEO。你知道，尽管他受到了很多憎恨，他只是耸耸肩，继续建设。无论你爱他还是恨他，你都必须承认。我的意思是，他在过去20年里建立了一家非凡的公司。
>
> **主持人：** 事实上，Meta今年至今只上涨了8%，我刚看到这个，这太疯狂了，因为我的意思是，这就是很多人买亚马逊的原因，对吧？它年初至今几乎没涨，他们认为那不合理。所以，市场给予，市场也夺走，但随着我们接近年底，看起来市场肯定正在从Meta那里夺走一些收益。是的，货币化也即将到来，我的意思是，我用WhatsApp。你每天都用WhatsApp吗？
>
> **马特：** 每天都用。是的。在我移居国外之前，我从来没怎么用过WhatsApp，然后当我移居国外后，显然，你知道，你没有正常的美国信号塔之类的，他们会额外收费发短信之类的。所以我总是开始用Wi-Fi发短信和做所有事情，从WhatsApp。然后它就成了习惯，就像为了和一些国际朋友保持联系。现在我的生活和业务稍微更国际化了，这就有道理了。就像我正在和澳大利亚、新西兰、伦敦、特立尼达的人发短信，所以使用传统的短信方式就没有意义了。
>
> **主持人：** 你对Rocket Lab正在盘整感到高兴吗？我的意思是，我知道人们希望看到它涨到100美元，但我感觉它从70美元回调并在60多美元的区间内整理是相当健康的。你认为这有道理吗？你认为它能在财报后突破历史新高吗？
>
> **马特：** 我认为是这样。而且，你知道，我要做一个大胆的预测，因为我认为财报是下周。我得搞清楚我的财报时间，因为我会在英国，所以我可能得在深夜做这些事情。但是，我对此没问题。我没问题。我实际上刚刚滚动了我的一些85美元的备兑看涨期权。我把它们移到了下个月底，行权价是100美元，我赚了大约60美分或60美分的差价，正如你们可以想象的，我有一些可观的股份，对吧？所以最后赚了不少钱。所以我就把那笔钱收入囊中。我没有买更多股票，但我认为我会在周一或什么时候设定一个买入，因为我有我正常的，你知道，买入，但就像你说的，我认为我们现在的位置有点贵，对吧？就公司今天的估值与他们今天交付的成果相比，显然是高估的，但这又回到了我们如何看待Palantir的方式，对吧？如果你看Rocket Lab的潜力，你知道，我的思路是它最终会成为一家千亿美元的公司。我不认为我们已经听到了足够多关于他们将要发布的星座计划的消息。所以你有亚马逊的Kuiper发布一个星座。你有一个发布星座。你有Starlink，显然做得非常好。所以你开始思考每颗卫星能带来多少收入。如果Rocket Lab能够复制类似的东西并分发他们自己的卫星，那么他们将处于一个非常有利的位置，能够从中获得大量的毛利。所以，我不认为你已经听到了那个故事的结尾。但我个人希望股票能够盘整。甚至进一步回到40多、50多美元，但我知道不幸的是，人们会想，哦，马特有备兑看涨期权，他需要……或者什么的。就像，不，这是……我想拥有这家公司尽可能多的股份，而我拥有的还不够。所以在这方面，我只是，你知道，我认为这是一家伟大的公司，以200亿美元的市值购买它，让我能够在每次购买时买入公司更大比例的股份。
>
> **主持人：** 嗯，这就是信念的美妙之处。信念的美妙之处在于，当你真正知道你持有的是什么时，我不是说我进入的每一只股票我都完全有像你在Rocket Lab情况下的那种必要的信念，但一旦你有了，你就不在乎了。你就是不在乎，因为除非论点被打破，再说一次，如果这些是非凡的公司，它们会有糟糕的季度，它们甚至可能有糟糕的年份，但对它们来说，出现一个论点被打破的时刻将是艰难的，而且是可能的，但如果那没有发生，那么你就逢低买入，你知道，如果你能做到这一点，你往往会得到回报。你觉得今年对你来说总体上怎么样？不仅仅是股市投资组合的表现，我的意思是，这是非凡的一年。显然，股市上涨肯定有帮助，但你觉得2025年对你个人来说是如何收尾的？
>
> **马特：** 一切都进行得太顺利了，以至于我实际上正在经历成长的烦恼，你知道吗。就像，我没想到我会这么快达到这个金钱上的成功水平。所以我正在努力弄清楚，好吧，假设明天一半的钱没了，这总是可能的，对吧？你总可能遇到市场回调。我在想，嗯，我的下一步是什么？我正在努力弄清楚我下一步该做什么？我喜欢工作，但同时，似乎我可以做更多的事情来帮助社区里的人。我们这里有一个美好的社区。我觉得迈阿密真的让我大开眼界，看到有多少人通过我们每天的贡献和滋养这个社区而真正受益。所以，我有点像陷入了两难的境地，伙计。我真的是。而且这不是坏事。我绝不是因此而沮丧，但它确实会让你有点头脑混乱。就像，我在我的职业生涯中做得这么好，我前面有一个如此伟大的职业生涯。我抬头看，我就像，我可以继续。然后在另一端，你又会想，嗯，我还有这个……就像你看到了那个的尽头，对吧？你有点可以量化。抱歉，这变得超级存在主义了，但这是事实。就像你看到了那个的尽头，对吧？以及我可能去的地方，然后你看到另一边，就像我看到你如此出色，Tanner如此出色。我不想说按照自己的时间生活，因为你仍然有市场，市场每天开盘和收盘，但在那些时间之间，你可以阅读或做任何事情。这是一种我从未想过我能过的有趣的不同生活方式。我看到自己可能越来越接近那样的生活，看到史蒂夫开始，你知道，这真的在激励我。但总的来说，伙计，市场对我来说真的很好。它让我能更专注于我的健康。所以我正在努力把它理顺。显然，这将是一个漫长的旅程，我必须面对，但事情正在朝着正确的方向发展。但对我来说，更多的是关于优化，弄清楚下一步是什么，因为为了突破，数字是在你达到某种心态后才会出现的，对吧？所以，这是给任何正在听的人，你可以关掉我，如果你想的话，但我经常告诉人们，他们说，“啊，我想成为百万富翁。” 我就说，“嗯，你表现得像个百万富翁吗？” 就像，你必须表现得像个百万富翁，像个百万富翁一样思考，然后数字才会出现，对吧？你必须做出百万富翁的决定。就像你不能像你只有一百块钱那样管理钱。你必须以一种能让你达到那个点的方式来管理钱或思考。就像，你知道，为了在棒球上变得更好，对吧？或者在任何事情上变得更好，你不能只投入婴儿般的努力。你必须投入真正的努力，真正的时间，做出正确的决定，最终你的技能会赶上来。所以我正在努力思考，为了达到下一个层次，也就是，你知道，八位数以上，我就在想，我是否在做正确的决定？我是否在朝着正确的方向前进？我是否在拖自己的后腿？所以，无论如何，那可能有点太哲学了。
>
> **主持人：** 不，这就是为什么……看，这是十月的最后一天。这就是我问这个问题的原因。我的意思是，这很重要，我认为很多人……看，牛市年的好处是它给了你思考这些问题的特权，对吧？因为你显然需要有那种程度的财务独立和自由，或者至少接近它，才能让你思考生活的另一面是什么。按照自己的方式生活和所有这些东西，而且这并不容易，股市上涨并投资于世界上最好的公司确实有帮助，这又回到了经济分化的论点。但这也像，你只有一次生命，对吧？所以你为什么不开始有那些想法，特别是当你进入30多岁时，就开始思考……我很快就要进入30多岁了。所以，这些是我认为非常非常重要的事情，需要深入思考，你思考这些是有道理的。
>
> **主持人：** 有人说永远不要结婚。
>
> **马特：** 是的。我们得看看。如果你结婚了，我……我需要去参加婚礼。那是肯定的。
>
> **主持人：** 你可能会主持婚礼。你非常……你非常善于言辞。所以……
>
> **马特：** 就这样吧。伙计，我绝对……伙计，我应该研究一下主持婚礼的业务。就像……
>
> **主持人：** 我觉得你已经够忙的了。但我相信观众中会有人希望你主持他们的婚礼。
>
> **马特：** 我不可能不在婚礼上当司仪时表现出色。伙计，那会是精英级的。好了，我想我们最后用问答环节来结束。我不知道史蒂夫是否能来。他在开工作电话。他可能能来，也可能不能。但我们还有10到15分钟。如果有人对马蒂·钱有任何问题，请在聊天室里提出来。是的，坦纳。如果你结婚，我肯定会当你的司仪，坦纳。但是，是的。所以，聊天室里有任何问题，请在这里提出来。可以是股市相关的，也可以是生活相关的，任何问题都可以。可以问我，也可以问马特。
>
> **主持人：** 哇，十万美元的婚礼。是的，我没想到。你可能能赚十万美元的婚礼。就像，这是我的YouTube频道。然后说，我收费很高，你知道吗？他们会说，没关系。
>
> **马特：** 伙计，他们不可能付司仪十万美元。那就像……如果他们付了。我的意思是，看，也许如果有人很有趣，那场婚礼就会成功。
>
> **主持人：** 你的笑话很好。你的笑话很好。
>
> **马特：** 2026年的广泛策略。只是大型科技股吗，还是你有什么特别的想法？
>
> **马特：** 嗯，石油和天然气。我知道那是你的专长。
>
> **主持人：** 是的，我的意思是，我还在涉足那个领域。我想我有一些买入。只是因为……我不知道为什么今天是31号，所以我不知道为什么我所有的买入今天都没有执行。是的，所以我有一些正常的买入，我每两周一次，每次发薪水时都会投入一些到石油和天然气。今天有一些基于股票的薪酬进来，但它还没有到我的账户里，所以我对此很沮丧，但希望到周一它会进来。我不知道。我正在努力理解同样的事情。对。我不认为26年上半年会是糟糕的一年。我认为下半年可能会看到一些动荡，只是因为我认为我们会开始看到大型科技公司在资本支出增长等方面的跑道略微结束。但随之而来的是大量的收入，因为每个人都在投入大量的资金。所以我有点像陷入了两难的境地。就像，好吧，是的，他们可能会因为不得不重置他们的资本支出等而受到打击，但同时，他们将产生更多的收入。我很好奇它会如何发展，但对我来说，嗯，只是继续每隔一周，每次我拿到薪水就买入，我不知道，看看NextDecade和Venture Global在进入26年时会发生什么。我认为那将是一个有趣的。我正在继续购买。NextDecade，我昨天又买了一些。我昨天又买了一些Venture Global。或者也许是今天。随便哪个。我只是醒来后，正在仔细检查我的电子表格和我的账户，交叉核对所有东西，我看到我有了更多。是的，我对26年还不是100%确定。那很难。
>
> **主持人：** 我认为这很公平。我认为很多最好的想法可能还会继续表现良好，但需要更多地了解今年如何结束，才能弄清楚26年会发生什么。
>
> **马特：** 我会说，我确实在后台开始做的一件事，这回到了我关于亚马逊的谈话，也许我鼓励人们也这样做。事情在过去几年里朝着一个如此好的方向发展，以至于我的很多目标都更快地达到了。所以在听你说话并受到启发之前，我总是这样，我进入我的电子表格，我说，“好吧，我需要多少股这些公司中的每一家才能达到我的下一个目标？” 我为亚马逊做了这个，但我还有所有这些，你知道，我正在增加的其他六七个头寸。你知道，我需要达到什么数字？Rocket Lab相对来说已经填满了，如果它达到我的……嗯……我想到达的地方，但也许我应该建立一个安全边际。就像，哦，如果它只达到800亿而不是1000亿呢？你知道，我还能达到那个X数量的，你知道，美元价值吗？但我看了一遍，我就像，天哪，就像，例如，一个典型的例子，因为它就是我刚刚填写的，对于Palantir，我只完成了我总分配的76%。亚马逊，我只完成了63%。我持有633股。我希望接近一千股。我们谈到NextDecade，我只完成了一半不到。Venture Global，我只完成了……或者说我在33%左右。谷歌，我在33%左右，Rocket Lab，我在82%左右。我可能会为我的一些其他股票也这样做，但就像我基本上有我认为股票会达到的估值和我想要达到的目标。所以，例如，亚马逊，我说10万亿是我想要达到的目标。我希望它成为一个百万美元的头寸。你知道，我需要它达到每股1000美元，差不多。是的。所以我就想，“好吧，我有633股。除以1000，就是63%。我想要达到100%。” 这就是我看待事情的方式。就像我希望我的股票达到……所以如果它们真的达到了，就像我认为Next会达到200亿。假设我想要，你知道，价值一百万美元的Next或类似的东西。我需要这么多股才能达到那个目标。这就是我评估它的方式。所以一旦它完全估值为一百万美元，我需要这么多股。否则，我会错过它。而且这会是错的，对吧？人们会稀释股本。他们会回购股票，所以也许会更容易。但希望是至少你有一个可以实现和追求的目标。
>
> **主持人：** 我认为这是一个很好的思考方式。我们早上谈到这个，但只是有你自己的心理框架来指导你如何建立头寸，确定头寸大小。我的意思是，有人问，“嘿，我觉得我们快到顶了。我该怎么办？” 就像，嗯，如果你有那种感觉，那么在心理上，你如何达到一种平静感？最简单的方法之一就是获利了结。你知道，有很多不同的方法来处理你对当前市场和经济状况的看法。但是有你自己的主观看法，然后从别人那里借鉴，但对你自己的观点有信心，那就是亚马逊会达到1000美元，所以你需要那1000股，这让你更容易继续购买和持有。有人说，你说你必须在成为百万富翁之前像百万富翁一样思考。你有什么快速的想法来体现这个理念吗？
>
> **马特：** 是的，我的意思是，听很多聪明人说话，伙计。就像很多励志演讲。主要是你。不，我开玩笑的。但是，不，但是，嗯，说真的，这通常是史蒂夫。是的，通常是史蒂夫。但不，我的意思是，说真的，就像是通过学习东西，对吧？就像只是在市场中有经验。就像你不能期望成为某件事的大师，如果你不开始朝着某个方向前进，对吧？你真的必须把自己置于机会之中，让那些事情打开，你可能会很幸运，对吧？所以有机会让你很幸运，你找到了一列火车，它能够真正地筛选，让事情对你来说容易五倍。但我认为很多时候人们不把他们的生活看作一个企业。你知道，我觉得这很有趣。我经常引用Jay-Z。就像我是一个商人。就像这是事实，对吧？所以我认为很多人都像，“我有这一千块。我怎么把这一千块变成一百万？” 就像那不是正确的问题，对吧？就像你需要每个月都为你的投资组合注入资金，对吧？我总是谈论它。每隔一个薪水，或者像我得到的每一个薪水，我都在投资市场。我不是像等到我有一万块或其他什么。就像我有我的买入。幸运的是，Robin Hood让它变得比我刚开始时容易得多。富达让它变得容易得多。就像我字面上知道我的薪水有多少去向哪里，到最后，我的薪水字面上只够……或者我支票账户里的余额只够支付我的信用卡和我的抵押贷款。所以就像目标是，我从来不想在我的支票账户里有超过500到1000美元，因为我在我的支票账户里得不到报酬。所以为什么要在我的支票账户里有钱？所以，我有，你知道，罗伯特·清崎，你知道，所有这些聪明人。吉姆·罗恩，你知道，它不总是关于钱。有时是关于生活，只是听所有的事情，形成你自己的观点。了解你的目标和你想去的地方。所以，就像，这就是我工作的方式。我一路上学到了很多。嗯，以为我比我实际上更聪明。我敢肯定有人……抱歉我的洗衣机和烘干机在响，但我敢肯定有人在那里，比我有钱得多，比我有更多管理钱的经验，会说马特是个白痴。他们可能说得对，但对我来说，它奏效了，它让我到了一个我觉得我可以开始玩，你知道，高净值个人游戏的地方。现在我只有一个不错的净值，对吧？我想达到那个地方，就像如果我想起飞去摩纳哥看摩纳哥F1比赛，就像我可以做到，你知道，而不用担心。
>
> **主持人：** 是的。那正是财务自由赋予你的特权。我认为你说的那些励志的东西很有道理。我的意思是，每个人都有他们听什么、如何驾驭动机、如何思考它的不同阶段。但就像我确实认为，在你生命中的某个时刻，如果你想有成长心态或转型之旅，喂养你自己的内容饮食，我认为这被称为，是非常重要的，因为如果你用各种可怕的胡说八道和大脑腐烂来喂养它，真的很难保持理智，特别是每天有成千上万的不同事物以内容的形式向你袭来。但是用这些能帮助你理解如何在生活中前进的东西来喂养它，这是我们所有人都在努力做的，前进，成长，你知道，那些东西很重要，而且非常重要。我看到你昨天发布了关于MicroStrategy财报的帖子。17年前的今天，比特币白皮书问世。我想总的来说，你真的相信比特币吗？到你会称自己为比特币极端主义者的程度？
>
> **马特：** 我不会说极端主义者。我不知道。如果我是极端主义者，我觉得我就不会有任何股票了。也许不是那样的。我不知道。我不知道我是否……真的就是今天吗？
>
> **主持人：** 是的。17年前，10月30日。
>
> **马特：** 嗯，我不能是极端主义者。我甚至不知道。
>
> **主持人：** 但是你喜欢MicroStrategy。你喜欢它。
>
> **马特：** 我认为这是一个有趣的。对吧？我认为它是BMR将要发生的事情的一个代理。我最初认为他们有点疯狂。我在2020年有比特币，但我认为，好吧，整个公司都是围绕着……因为它在那之前并不是真正的公司。是的，他们有一些软件销售，他们仍然有收入销售和所有这些东西，但现在他们的大部分收入是基于他们购买比特币的价格和它今天的价值之间的差额。所以，我认为他们的平均成本是47,000美元左右。所以现在他们实际上能够写高他们拥有的价值。也许是70,000美元。我不记得每个比特币。但我的意思是，我喜欢它。这是我说它将是随着时间的推移一个不错的价值储存的东西。对我来说，现在，我认为很多人都看到我进入了这个世界，最初我像，你知道吗，我需要卖掉这些东西，把它们投入标普500，超级安全，但现在我正在寻找我知道未来会是良好增长 steward 的东西，比如Palantir, Rocket Lab, 比特币，我可以借贷。就像Robin Hood让它相对于银行来说容易得多。就像不，我完全没有意愿去银行说，“请给我承销。” 所以就像现在我只会说，“让我从Robin Hood借钱。” 就像他们让它变得如此容易。所以我只是在寻找像比特币这样的东西，我认为它将是一个很好的储存。对我来说，我认为这将是有趣的。就像我能看到周期。我能看到供需。这对我来说非常有趣。所以2%或3%，我忘了是多少。我得到的每一份薪水都用于购买更多的比特币，我对此的思路是，好吧，如果它最终涨了10倍，那么技术上我节省了30%的薪水。如果你从那个角度考虑。
>
> **主持人：** 是的。
>
> **马特：** 但是，我不知道，我看待它的方式是，我未来可以利用它进行杠杆。同样的事情也适用于Palantir，同样的事情也适用于Rocket Lab。最终那些东西会派发股息。所以我正在努力想办法，我也可以从我的比特币上赚钱。我的意思是，我希望我能在我持有的比特币上写备兑看涨期权。我可以在其中一些上做到，因为其中一些我用……我当时买了GBTC，灰度比特币信托。然后那分拆成了迷你信托，便宜得多。所以，我确实在那上面写备兑看涨期权，然后从中产生一些收入。但是，我持有的实际物理比特币，我不知道如何从中赚钱。那是我仍在努力弄清楚的事情。
>
> **主持人：** 布伦丹说，“谢谢你谈论利用你的投资组合借贷。我在现实生活中交谈的每个人都对此非常担心。如果做得对，这是一个改变游戏规则的事情。” 是的，我同意。马特刚才说的是，如果他想获得流动性来做某事，也许是买他的第85套房子，而你有一个数百万美元的股票投资组合，保证金利率，至少在Robin Hood上是4.5%，富达可能是6%，不管是多少。就像你不需要去银行，他们必须评估你的整个财务状况才能说，嘿，这是我们要给你的钱，这是我们要给你的利率。你的资产，无论是苹果、亚马逊、谷歌还是特斯拉，都会被认为足够有价值，可以提供保证金贷款，也就是说，他们会用股票作为抵押品给你贷款，或者如果你的100%都在Beyond Meat里，你就不会得到那么多保证金。但如果你投资于世界上最伟大的公司，比如谷歌和亚马逊，它们在持续执行，Robin Hood可能会借给你更多的钱。所以从这个角度来看，你可以利用你自己的投资组合，你过去几年有效分配到这些公司的决策，然后借钱，如果你拿那笔钱去玩零日期权，然后你错了，然后你必须还钱，卖掉你所有的股票来还，那可能是危险的。但如果你是高效地做，那不是世界上最糟糕的事情。
>
> **马特：** 是的。是的。我的意思是，我认为很多人不理解的是，当他们试图在一年内借贷他们投资组合的20%时。就像我不是那样，对吧？就像我在……我正在努力达到一个更好的地方，你知道，我可以……
>
> **主持人：** 得到一个几乎像底线的东西，对吧？就像你永远不应该借超过你整个投资组合的3%到4%。3%到4%的规则，如果你听说过，也许如果你没有，你知道，研究一下。但基本上思路是，平均来说，在通货膨胀等因素之后，你的投资组合会以一个速度增长，即使它这样波动，对吧，总的来说，而且已经经过了回测，如果你取出4%，你有大约80%的可能性永远不会花光钱。所以，如果你有一百万美元的投资组合，你每年取出4万美元，是的，会有起伏，但最终，你知道，随着时间的推移，如果你投资于正确的东西，它通常会向上向右发展。所以对我来说，就像，你知道，嗯，两三年前我在哪里，我就像，哦是的，我仍然需要工作或做类似的事情。现在，它正在达到一个程度，投资组合已经到了一个程度，就像，好吧，那更有意义了。就像我为什么要卖掉并支付……不得不向政府支付与之相关的税款，我就像我为什么要卖掉Rocket Lab，就像如果我能只是借贷，那么我仍然可以拥有它，而不是卖掉它，我也不必支付资本利得税，你想想，就像如果我要卖掉我的Rocket Lab，它全是……它全是资本利得，所以我卖掉的每一分钱都将是15%，实际上更像是20%给政府，所以……
>
> **主持人：** 就像为什么……为什么立即这样做，我几乎就像……我可以用其中的一部分，嗯，想想看，那也算在因素之内。就像我不再需要担心那方面的事情。现在，当然，如果Rocket Lab改变方向，那就是另一回事了。我会卖掉它，但现在，我只是认为他们正在朝着正确的方向前进，并且全速前进。所以，同样的事情也适用于Palantir。就像，我为什么要卖掉Palantir，当它还在不断产出时？所以……
>
> **主持人：** 坦率地说，这就像……这是秘密。我不知道它是否还是秘密，但就像投资界的大多数人都明白，这就是富人做的事情。他们……我的意思是，拉里·埃里森在过去50年里，我认为他卖掉的甲骨文股份不到他全部股份的1%。就像你借贷资产，你会得到……我的意思是，拉里·埃里森是另一个级别的，亿万富翁，但当你处于那个级别时，你会从私人贷款公司获得非常便宜的贷款，因为他们想和你做生意，当你能获得那么多资本时，你就不需要卖掉。所以我们……人们可以在这些水平上以更小的规模做到这一点，如果你是高效地做。但随着你变得更富有，你知道，这大概就是不必永远卖掉你的资产的诀窍。你知道，这又回到了经济分化的论点。如果你一直在借贷英伟达，你知道，聊天室里有人有像十万股英伟达。就像你为什么要卖掉？
>
> **马特：** 对吧？就像你为什么要卖掉那个？就像不，你可以再次借贷……除非英伟达归零或者英伟达大幅下跌，它确实在深度学习时刻下跌了。所以那些风险是存在的。但如果它不下跌，那么你可以支付很多账单而不用卖掉所有的股票。
>
> **主持人：** 是的。我的意思是，除非你认为它真的完全估值了，而且有风险。比如说，我以为Palantir只应该是一家2500亿美元的公司，我认为他们现在做的事情，他们就像一家2500亿美元的公司在运营，我认为他们的最终市值应该是2500亿美元。就像，嗯，我为什么要持有它，对吧？那没有意义。但对我来说，我仍然认为它会增长到1.5万亿到2万亿美元的市值。所以……
>
> **马特：** 是的，为什么卖掉它？支付资本利得。我不认为它会很容易回到160美元。如果它回去了，我手头会有钱能够买回来吗？你知道我的意思吗？那总是……你在玩那么多如果。你在一个接一个地堆叠假设，那根本行不通。所以，你知道，我也不是很聪明，所以我尽量让事情尽可能简单。但是，是的，我的意思是，有人在聊天室里问，我是否会透露？我的意思是，我说出的数字是多少并不重要。更重要的是我在说什么以及它如何与你相关，因为我在说的与你的生活或任何事情可能完全不同。所以……
>
> **主持人：** 我认为人们太执着于某人的净资产，或者他们在这方面有多少股份，或者头寸大小，或者所有这些东西，就像……问题是关于一个头寸的分析，而不是确切地有多少股份，或者某人的投资组合有多大，因为到那个时候，你是在从一个数字中寻求验证，而不是从实际的人和他们所说的话中。我认为这非常重要，因为Twitter上有很多年轻人，你知道，我看到他们刚从大学毕业，我看到他们对事物的分析。他们没有十万美元投入到Nebius，但他们发布的分析，即使他们只有一万美元，这对于一个20岁的人来说投入到Nebius已经很多了，那些东西很重要，而贬低它……我的意思是，当我刚开始在YouTube上做视频时，我的第一个视频是我把25,000美元投入到Palantir，我认为那差不多是我当时的净资产。我的意思是，也许我有35,000，也许我在某个其他银行账户里有10,000，但就是这样。分析才是真正重要的。而不是像我投入了250,000，因为我没有250,000。我不可能投入那么多，对吧。

> **马特：** 不，我认为这是正确的方式。我的意思是，也许你处于像阿米特那样的情况，对吧？你只有一次机会，那是你唯一拥有的钱。你的苏姨婆不幸去世了，然后也许就是这样。你把所有的钱都投入到一件事上。但对我来说，我认为更有意义的是做出审慎的投资决策，像经营企业一样经营你的生活，努力理解你得到的每一份薪水都应该以某种方式、形状或形式再投资于自己。我认为很多人都想，我怎么能把这1000美元变成一百万。就像那是一千倍，伙计。那很多。你知道，你知道有多难吗。实际上是再增加一千个投资组合。现在你只需要500倍。如果你每个月都这样做，你知道，我知道1000美元很多。假设是一百块，对吧？你想把100块变成一百万，对吧？这是同样的原则。在我看来，这是关于原则，以及它如何与你的目标、目的等相关。而不是隔壁的比尔，对吧？所以，这真的取决于你如何将事情应用到自己身上，你知道，我的净资产和你有任何关系吗？
>
> **主持人：** 毫无关系。
>
> **马特：** 而且，而且，你正在听什么。所以，你知道，我在2021年、2022年就停止分享了。如果你真的好奇我当时的情况，去看看那个频道。但是，你知道，我没有真正透露过。我私下向人们透露过，比如，你知道，但不是在X上或任何类似的地方。而且，我只是不认为这很重要，你知道。是的。而且，人们想要保持一定程度的隐私，你知道，就像，不告诉每个人你有多少钱是可以的，因为就像你有时不想告诉世界你有多少钱。那是可以做的。人们当时以为我在撒谎，所以，我的意思是，我现在说出来又有什么意义呢？
>
> **主持人：** 马特·钱的YouTube就在那里。顺便说一句，马特，我们那个正在变成新佩洛西的哥们，他在十月份又买了一些Palantir。
>
> **马特：** 我看到了。那太搞笑了。
>
> **主持人：** 我们的哥们克莱奥·菲尔兹，宝贝。在Palantir里投了五十万。现在他必须披露，因为他是一名民选官员，所以他不能逍遥法外，尽管他们总是晚45天披露。但是……
>
> **马特：** 是的，我的意思是，我认为那太搞笑了。
>
> **主持人：** 我们的哥们克莱奥，他继续买入。
>
> **马特：** 他知道，我的意思是，他可能看到了他们正在竞标的合同数量，你知道，他知道……他确信北约将完全依赖Palantir运行。我们今晚会谈论这个，但是就像……所以向今晚要看的人致敬。但是，你想想，你开始看到它，这是我2015年、2016年开始使用这个软件时的思路，就像每个公司都应该用这个运行。每个流程都应该用这个运行。政府应该用这个运行，而且它正在慢慢地……那个词是什么……渗透。谢谢。在整个经济中。这太疯狂了。
>
> **主持人：** 是的。
>
> **马特：** 有人问，抱歉，有人问我是否做401k。我做，但是我不供款。我做匹配的部分，但我不会把它存满，因为我喜欢能够灵活地移动我的钱，并且能够接触到它来购买房地产或投资其他东西，或者……所以在我看来，就像我说的，这取决于你是否打算在接下来的30年里都做你现在的工作。如果你打算在60岁退休，并且你需要那份工作，那么就做匹配。就像把它存满，对吧？就像尽可能多地获得税收优惠。但对我来说，我总是想要那种能够……如果我想换职业，我就能换的能力。如果你不经常卖出，你也不会交很多税。就像对我来说，就像我没有为Palantir交过一分钱的税，除了我卖出的备兑看涨期权。所以，同样的事情也适用于Rocket Lab。我没有为它交过一分钱的税，除了我卖出的备兑看涨期权。所以……
>
> **主持人：** 我同意。而且那种灵活性真的很重要，特别是如果你在管理一个退休账户。我们正准备离开。我正准备结束，但这家伙想加入。史蒂夫，你有点晚了，伙计。
>
> **史蒂夫：** 看，爸爸。
>
> **主持人：** 他可能甚至不在那里。看那个。如果你在那里，你被静音了。这也不是他的错，因为他有……看，他给我发短信说两分钟。伙计，这家伙，他太喜欢直播了。他就是……他正在进入状态。
>
> **马特：** 他嫁给了这个游戏。他嫁给了这个游戏，我喜欢。
>
> **主持人：** 他嫁给了这个游戏。好了，我们一会儿请他上来。马特，你看到克莱默关于Palantir的片段了吗？
>
> **马特：** 没有，是那个舞台上没人的那个吗？
>
> **主持人：** 是的。
>
> **马特：** 没有，我没看到那个。
>
> **主持人：** 好的，所以对于那些没看到的人，这是……这是那个片段，因为看到这个也相当惊人。顺便说一句，伊隆刚刚做了Olin。所以他做了罗根和Olen。所以对于那些是伊隆粉丝的人，你们周末有大约五个小时的伊隆内容可以消费。好的，这是……这是克莱默先生对Palantir的看法。
>
> **克莱默：** Palantir，你对亚历克斯·卡普的印象是否像他对自己的印象一样深刻？
>
> **嘉宾：** 好的。所以，我觉得他非常有趣。我没有做多这只股票。我很好奇书出来后会怎样。Axios说了一些关于它的事情。我……我不喜欢他。
>
> **克莱默：** 他不是费城人吗？他也是费城人。
>
> **嘉宾：** 是的。哦，我告诉过他。我说，“听着，你比我更令人反感的费城人。” 我有一次给他写了张纸条。我说，“我不是你的敌人。” 他说，“是啊。” 我说，“不，那是和平的表示。” 是啊。那太可怕了。他就像一个可怕的人，但我认为他是真实的。我说这个是因为，就像所有雇佣他的公司，那些大公司，我都给他们打过电话，我说，“怎么样？” 他们所有人都异口同声地说，“听着，还不错。”
>
> **主持人：** 我的意思是，他正当红。那个业务正当红。
>
> **嘉宾：** 它正当红，但是即使他们如此当红，它是否太贵了？
>
> **主持人：** 嗯，对我来说似乎很疯狂。
>
> **嘉宾：** 这是80法则。我想我最终会……它会……
>
> **主持人：** 他们正在打破80法则。
>
> **嘉宾：** 他们……他们正在打破它。而且，你知道，看，波音刚刚和他们合作了，奥特伯格是一个非常严肃的人。当我说严肃的人时，就像《继承之战》里的那个场景，对，是的，布莱恩，你们不是严肃的人。嗯，那是一句很棒的台词，因为我谈论的是严肃的人，比如奥特伯格不会去找他。我认识一个从沃顿商学院去那里的孩子，我认识他妈妈，他妈妈说，你知道，他们24/7工作。他们都……卡普对他们来说是英雄，因为他对他们一点也不专横，这就是我喜欢他的地方。现在我给那个家伙，沙亚姆，二号人物，发了信息。他上周有一篇关于军队的很好的文章。我给他发了封邮件，我知道他不会回复，但我说，看，你知道，我知道你们鄙视我，不管怎样。但然后我遇到了这个女人，温迪，她负责国防。她……
>
> **主持人：** 如果有人想继续看那个，你可以继续……你可以听。我会把链接放在……在频道里。但我的意思是，看，卡普……克莱默说过卡普不是一个真正的商人，Palantir不是一个真正的企业。所以显然，这就是为什么卡普不是他的最大粉丝。
>
> **马特：** 伙计，那些家伙是靠别的东西驱动的。他们是靠……就像我见过人们工作，但那是我在直接上市那天买入他们的原因。就像他们是靠别的东西。就像我不知道他们是否说，“嘿，你意识到当我们给你这个offer时，就像你将成为一个与地球上其他所有人都完全不同的人。” 他们……他们必须……就像你见过他们那么多员工。他们只是……他们都如此独特，如此不同，以一种好的方式，对吧？
>
> **主持人：** 是的。以一种好的方式。好了，史蒂夫。我想他在这里。我刚看到他，然后他消失了。送奶工。
>
> **史蒂夫：** 我在这里。
>
> **主持人：** 你去拿你的牛奶了吗？
>
> **史蒂夫：** 没有。他在这里。你……
>
> **主持人：** 拿新鲜牛奶给……是你在……
>
> **史蒂夫：** 不，我饿死了。抱歉对你们这样做，但我……我甚至还没吃午饭。就像……
>
> **主持人：** 伙计，你抱怨什么？你现在是全职主播了。这就是……我七个小时不吃饭。就是这样。就像……
>
> **史蒂夫：** 我在回家的路上在车里点了晚餐。
>
> **主持人：** 然后你把自己静音了。你……
>
> **史蒂夫：** 和史蒂夫在一起吗？你今天是个业余爱好者吗？怎么回事？
>
> **主持人：** 不，我刚到家。我从车里点了晚餐。他在门口等我。那真是完美的时机。吃了个不错的汉堡。五分熟。
>
> **马特：** 那红肉，宝贝。
>
> **史蒂夫：** 那红肉。
>
> **主持人：** 好了。看，我问你一个问题，然后我们今天就结束了，你可以去吃你的食物了。但就像……我们有点谈到……
>
> **史蒂夫：** 不，没关系。
>
> **主持人：** 不，不，我们得结束了。我们得让马特走。我也得走了。但我的意思是，总体上对这周的看法，标普500连续第六个月上涨。
>
> **史蒂夫：** 我的意思是，我认为我们不可能不到7000点。
>
> **主持人：** 我同意。
>
> **史蒂夫：** 除非中国发生什么事。我的意思是，我只是不认为我们会有一个大的回调或任何事情。而且英伟达很可能会有很好的数字。我真的没看到今天发生了什么，除了雪佛龙埃克森。雪佛龙有一个相当不错的季度，而且H交易似乎会很棒。所以我对现在的情况非常满意。我认为Meta，看，如果你看了我的文章，更多的是我昨晚说的。我认为现在是一个巨大的机会。我认为亚马逊是一个巨大的……
>
> **主持人：** 今天648美元。
>
> **史蒂夫：** 是的，这太疯狂了。这些人疯了。这太疯狂了。
>
> **马特：** 我想看右边的那个图表。我想看右边的那个图表。这家伙报道了多少次这个？
>
> **史蒂夫：** 什么图表？
>
> **马特：** 右边的那个图表，显示了有多少买入建议……
>
> **史蒂夫：** 一直都是。
>
> **马特：** 我们昨晚做过这个。去我的个人资料看看，马特。我写了大概30篇关于Meta的文章。全是买入。
>
> **史蒂夫：** 冠军。
>
> **马特：** 冠军。是的。
>
> **史蒂夫：** 全是买入，大概五年了。从2018年开始。
>
> **马特：** 是的。
>
> **史蒂夫：** 你什么时候开始写的？
>
> **马特：** 2018年。
>
> **史蒂夫：** 好的，就这样吧。
>
> **马特：** 我认为我们正处于一个机会周期，我认为它会继续上涨。我目前没有看到任何逆风。我讨厌这么说，但也许衰退在26年下半年的宾果卡上。如果失业率继续这样下去，谁知道呢？但现在，企业盈利非常强劲，那些不产生收入的公司不会影响标普或纳斯达克。所以我只是……我不担心。
>
> **史蒂夫：** 我仍然担心的是，史蒂夫，正是我前几天告诉你的，那就是在股息和股票回购之后的剩余自由现金流，我不认为它今年会显现出来。我认为每个人都能挺过去。但明年下半年，我认为它会开始显现。我认为你已经开始看到CNBC上的人们谈论它了。所以如果我在谈论它，然后他们开始谈论它，我觉得它最终会渗透……渗透，正如你亲切地纠正我的。
>
> **马特：** 抱歉，请继续。
>
> **史蒂夫：** 我只是不知道我们能否与这个国家最聪明的人对抗。
>
> **马特：** 我同意你的看法。
>
> **史蒂夫：** 哦不。回购放缓了一点。谁在乎呢，就像在宏大的计划中，如果这是短期资金，我会说，你知道吗，也许这不是一个好主意，但在接下来的……他们正在为接下来的5年、10年、15年建设这个。当你思考他们如何部署资本支出时，如果他们落后了，他们错了，他们的盈利能力在未来就没戏了。所以我宁愿他们花掉资本支出，把回购削减20%左右，因为这是未来盈利能力的下一个支柱，我愿意作为股东接受这一点。所以我只是不愿意现在与大型科技公司对抗。
>
> **马特：** 公平地说，那是我对一些石油公司的问题之一，他们太专注于回购和股息，而实际上，如果他们只是专注于收购更多和贯穿周期投资，那么他们的回购和股息最终会在几年后赶上来。所以对我来说，我希望他们能管理好。我早些时候告诉过你，有人会失败，有几家公司……有人会做得不好。他们会太专注于，哦，我们不能做回购，我们不能削减回购或任何类似的事情。我实际上会欢迎它。事实上，当很多石油公司在2020年削减股息时，我欢迎它。我就想，这是一个很好的重置点，因为当时，壳牌每年支付150亿，还有很多其他公司每年支付200亿的股息。所以，我就想，这是一个很好的重置。但是，是的，我有点好奇他们会如何驾驭它。你说得对。也许如果他们削减股票回购，只会产生5%到10%的影响，而他们最终会因为净收入增长而高出20%、30%、40%。
>
> **史蒂夫：** 抱歉。Alphabet回购700亿股。哦不，我们现在只回购550亿股。就像，这有那么大的事吗？那比公司在5到10年周期内产生的现金还要多。就像，我只是不知道这是否是我会真正大动干戈的事情，当我们看到云服务的积压订单数字，而AI仍处于起步阶段。所以对我来说，那笔现金最好用于部署到将成为公司未来增长引擎的东西上，以及将推动标普走高的东西上。
>
> **主持人：** 我同意。
>
> **马特：** 我会同意。马特·钱的YouTube，我把它放在聊天室里了。史蒂夫，你很快会直播吗？
>
> **史蒂夫：** 是的，我实际上可能会在6:30做点什么，做一会儿。处理一些事情。可能会做点什么，然后今晚大概9点、9:30左右也可能会做点什么。但是，阿米特，我想问你点事。你对周一感觉怎么样？
>
> **主持人：** 好的，很快，史蒂夫的YouTube就在那里。所以对于那些想订阅他的人，他大概一个小时后会直播，所以你可以在他的直播中看到他。我们其余的人会在11点回到《Palantir周报》。不，我对周一感觉很好。我没想到股票会在财报前上涨，尽管那确实会发生。发生过几次。所以是的，马特，我和阿米尔今晚会在周报上更深入地讨论，但我同意马特的观点。我更关心的是利润率。顶线收入增长，我认为会超过50%。我认为26年的指引现在是45。那可能会提高到48、50，但股票已经上涨了。所以有点像我完全不知道市场会如何反应，但我认为数字会相当不错。
>
> **马特：** 周一是什么，史蒂夫？
>
> **史蒂夫：** 超级碗，伙计。超级碗。
>
> **马特：** 超级碗帽子，宝贝。
>
> **史蒂夫：** 是什么？
>
> **马特：** 是……
>
> **史蒂夫：** 你戴着那顶帽子。
>
> **马特：** 我以为是周二。不是在周二吗？
>
> **史蒂夫：** 不，是在周一。我……我错了吗？不，是在周一。
>
> **马特：** 我以为是在周一。我可能错了。我以为是周一。
>
> **史蒂夫：** 肯定是11月3日。是的，伙计。是周一。
>
> **马特：** 好的，很好。是的，我周一晚上什么都不做。就这样吧。那将是周一3:30。
>
> **史蒂夫：** 是的。直播。
>
> **马特：** 我希望他们的收入增长数字前面有一个5。我不知道他们会怎么……
>
> **史蒂夫：** 那会发生的。会的，因为他们……他们给出的指引是50%。所以他们不可能不……
>
> **马特：** 我只是说我希望他们有一个5。如果他们……如果他们拿出6……
>
> **史蒂夫：** 哦，那我们就有乐子了，兄弟。就像我只想说，如果他们拿出6，那就要天下大乱了。
>
> **马特：** 如果他们显示60%的收入，甚至不是……
>
> **史蒂夫：** 是的，没有其他软件公司能接近。英伟达不再增长60%了。如果他们指引增长到60%以上。我的意思是，伙计……
>
> **马特：** 80法则……
>
> **史蒂夫：** 是的。我正要说我们要谈论80法则而不是40法则，但你知道。
>
> **马特：** 是的。我的意思是，那会相当惊人。他们已经有81法则了。所以……
>
> **史蒂夫：** 我应该能……是的，我应该能直播那个。因为那会是……什么？我不记得了。是提前五个小时，所以那会是……
>
> **马特：** 哦，你周一在英国。
>
> **史蒂夫：** 是的，周一我会……
>
> **马特：** 所以你明天飞出去？
>
> **史蒂夫：** 明天晚上飞出去。是的。
>
> **主持人：** 马特要去喝茶吃烤饼了。哦，一些饼干。
>
> **马特：** 我的意思是，听着，英式早餐茶是唯一好喝的茶。所以……
>
> **史蒂夫：** 我昨天喝了一些。
>
> **主持人：** 谢谢大家。感谢。史蒂夫的YouTube在聊天室里。他大概一个小时后会直播。马特……
>
> **史蒂夫：** 我大概6点左右会上线，各位。
>
> **主持人：** 我可能得去买些饼干来看那个。史蒂夫……
>
> **史蒂夫：** 我的意思是，你为什么不直接上来呢？
>
> **主持人：** 也许我会。也许我得去买些饼干才能上来。你们俩都有一个开放的邀请。我的意思是，我肯定米德有。你最喜欢什么饼干？
>
> **史蒂夫：** 巧克力曲奇。永远是巧克力曲奇。
>
> **主持人：** 虽然奥利奥也很不错，但还是巧克力曲奇。
>
> **史蒂夫：** 我确实得为今晚来的小家伙们买糖果，所以……
>
> **主持人：** 哦，是的。嗯，我在一个公寓大楼里，所以不是真的……
>
> **史蒂夫：** 是的，休斯顿有点奇怪。他们通常去富人区，而我不在那里。所以……
>
> **主持人：** 那有道理。那有道理。好了。谢谢大家。感谢。恭喜这周表现出色。标普连续第六个月上涨。Palantir突破200美元。美联储降息。大型科技公司表现出色。亚马逊表现出色。谷歌惊人。所以对大家来说都是非常强劲的一周。我们明天进入十一月。我和马特将在晚上11点直播《Palantir周报》。我周日晚上7:45会直播《未来秀》，我们会继续努力。谢谢。
>
> **嘉宾：** 谢谢。

> **主持人：** 谢谢大家。祝你们过得愉快。我们今晚晚些时候见。大家很快再见。再见。再见大家。

<p class="english-text">>> Matt, what's up, >> sir? Mr. Thank you for having me on. Happy to be here. >> Thank you for coming on, man. How are you? Did you work from home today or are you just back? >> Uh, I did. I didn't. Uh, to be very fair, hopefully nobody from work is watching. I don't do too much work but uh but uh but it is what it is. >> All right. Well, I think I'll get started with uh my first question right here which is a journey we have been part of for a long time. Palunteer at 200o. I mean just how are you thinking of uh of this stock at this level? >> Uh I either bought more today or yesterday I think. Um >> yeah. So, I mean, not buying a lot, right? Just the monthly buys that I always have. Every time I get a paycheck, I just >> just get your mic down a little bit on the gain. >> Uh, is it is it a little little crazy? >> Little hot. >> Little hot. I think it's all the way down. Maybe I'll just move it away a little bit. >> Yeah. >> Yeah. Uh, let me know if that's a little bit. >> That's perfect. I think that's way >> Okay, perfect. Perfect. Um, yeah, I'm trying to adjust the mic to make it a little bit more full sounding. So, maybe I made it too full. Um, but yeah, uh, I just think that there's a lot to to be released still, like AI, FTE, a lot of a lot of great products that I don't think have been fully rolled out as of yet. And when that does actually come through, I think we're going to see a lot of efficiency gains in a lot of different companies. Um, I mean, the the ops margins for Palanteer are continuing to do well. I anticipate and and I think Arie had a really good post earlier talking about how he thinks that that's going to be a good story coming up this this uh this quarter as well, but I'm more so concerned about how many more small contracts we can get, right? I think a lot of people have been very I think the only thing they're complaining about now is oh well they only have a thousand customers or whatever. It's like, well, I think with what they come out with in the near future will allow them to attack some of those smaller customers uh that could actually add a lot to the bottom line as well, but they don't have necessarily the the operational footprint, meaning the floor deployment engineers to be able to actually go to every single company, right? And I think that >> uh this this will really help. Um, so I'm very happy to see uh the progress of the company and I'm also anticipating a 50% growth handle uh year-over-year. So it'll be it'll be fun to watch. It'll be fun to watch. >> I think the cool thing about it is you and I both as the company started rising and its price felt the valuation was getting aggressive and we were pretty transparent about that similar you know to Arie and Amir as well. But it's it's almost all of us have been humbled by the fact that the execution is so strong and now it's like oh at some point you got to buy if you want more of it, right? And to your philosophy of just continuing to get more of it. You kind of say screw the the beautiful 10 $15 average and you just get more. >> Yeah. I mean I look at it in a different way, right? I was talking to somebody about this yesterday. They're like are you like what do you think? Like should I sell here? Whatever. And first and foremost I think when people think about this, right? If they've been in it like you and I have and they have shares, let's say at the $67 8 range and then they sell here at 200, they're going to have to pay, you know, pretty much uh 15 to 20% depending on what tax bracket uh for federal tax um on long-term capital gains. So before they enter even back in, the stock is going to have to go down to uh to at least $160 before they even make an entry back in. And so um before they break even, right? Unless it's in a tax advantage account, then you could play a little bit more games with that. But I don't think people think about that a lot. I think they say, "Oh, I got 5% more shares." It's like, "Well, you also just locked in a 20% or in short-term capital gains a 30%, you know, the tax rate that you had to pay." >> But so anyway, going back into the real the real aspect of it, I I just the the the execution that I continue to see out of the company, you know, five years ago, I thought it was going to be 150 to20 billion dollar company. And since then, and it's documented literally almost every week when when I had the opportunity to come on Palunteer weekly was like, "Nope, it it moved right to the point where, you know, it got to a trillion dollar valuation and and and more recently I've moved it to a trillion and a half." And some people might say that that's that's still bearish and I I can agree with that. Like I think that that's still potentially undervaluing the potential, but I just don't want to get too far ahead of myself. Um, but if you think about in that respect, it's like we're only at a 500 billion compared to that 1.5. Yeah. >> And then there's going to be buybacks and and so many other things along the way, it's like when you have opportunities like this of certainty, right? Why bet against certainty? >> Yep. >> Um, and I understand that you're like, "Oh, well that money could have used elsewhere. I can make a 5 10x elsewhere." But Palanteer to me is certain, right? If you look at those things that might get you 5 to 10x, they might not be certain. And so to me, you know, I'm not looking for when I have those things of certainty. Palunteer was a certainty for me. Rocket Lab was a certainty for me. I like to bet on certainty. And so, um, why like same thing with Amazon, right? We'll get into that, I'm sure. So, it's like, why bet against it, you know? Um, and that's kind of where I was just like, why have I not been averaging up? And that's why I restarted my buys. >> I agree. Sometimes your best ideas are your original ideas, your first ideas, you know, and like as there's plenty of opportunities in the market, owning more of something definitely is uh in the long term, especially if you're, as you said, you're so confident that you know it's a winner and they've proven they're a winner, even if they are expensive. You're not having to buy at this price for the first time. So, >> averaging up is not the worst thing in the world. Um, so before we get into Amazon, I just want to ask you more broadly about big tech earnings. Obviously, pretty much all of them crushed it across the board, even if some of their stock prices didn't reflect that. Are you kind of on the same page as a lot of other people, which is that and and I know you've you've been buying most of these for a long time, but big tech is just going to get bigger and 26 people should be thinking about just continuing to DCA into the best companies in the world. >> I think that 26 will be a good year, but I think it'll be I think we're entering the the latter half of the this very extreme bullish easy money stage. Now, it could run into 27. You know, I what I don't think is, you know, maybe I'll be humbled and I' I've been humbled before by because you think about it. Amazon's investing over 100 billion. They're going to invest over 125 billion before the year end. And and Meta is investing a lot of money as well. So, all these companies, but they keep talking about expanding the amount of capital that they're going to plow in. And the really the only ones that have excess capital that they can without dipping into their coffers is Microsoft and and Amazon. And everybody else is having to dip into their cash pile. And so I think a lot of people or Yeah. Or or or issue debt in the case of Oracle, right? So, you know, I don't think that we're in this, you know, unless that the income really starts to come through and the cash flow really starts to come through, I think we're going to start hitting a wall a bit. And I'm not, when I say wall, it makes it seem more extreme. I'm not bearish by any means. I'm not saying sell these things, but I'm just saying there's going to be some backlash associated with when we actually hit and we can't grow capital expenditure, you know, from 50 billion to 100 billion like we have been able to in the case of Amazon or even 125 billion in the case of Amazon in in as rapid of a pace because you think about how much of a a valuation that Nvidia has been able to get and how much people continue to price that in. you know, if you start to have pullbacks, you're going to either have to pull back on buybacks, dividends, or capex, right? And and get a little bit more balanced in terms of that. And so, I feel like the ones that are going to do well are the ones that are going to be able to invest through the cycle and navigate that to the best of their ability. I think that we're going to see who has the best management in the next two to three years and and who to really stick to. Uh because I think times will get Did I lose you? >> Yeah. No, you're good. You're good. >> Okay, good. >> You got me. Yeah. You said times will get a little bit more choppy and like the best management teams ultimately are the ones you want to bet on. >> Yeah. Yeah. 100%. >> Yeah. Look, I think that's fair. I I I think these these max seven companies, not all of them are turning at the most attractive multiples, but nonetheless, these are the most important companies in the world, and the modes that they have are just unbelievably strong. And so I've been thinking a lot about what 2026 looks like and I'm getting closer and closer to the conclusion that yes, there are some plays you want to get into that are high risk, high reward, which you know, Rock Lab Houndry Hood have been for for us. But to sleep better at night DCing into Microsoft, even if it doesn't move like crazy, is just not horrible. And as a result, that's not the worst thing to uh to think about more deeply. Uh Amazon, so I want to give you your flowers here. you have been preaching the Amazon thesis for a long time even though no one has listened as much as uh as recently now that you got the results. Google you were preaching as well. I think a lot more people took advantage of that. Why do you think Amazon was able to surprise the street as well as they did? Well, I think the the ease of Amazon was kind of easy to tell because, you know, I think first and foremost, I think some people are saying they're pointing to the anthropic net gain on paper and they're saying, "Oh, you know, they shouldn't have been warded." And but you're seeing an acceleration AWS and I think it was inevitable, right? You're increasing capital expenditure to over hundred billion dollars in the trailing 12 months. So that obviously should flow through a little bit considering I think they were only spending 50 billion you know just a few years ago. So in terms of capital expenditure that should hopefully increase the the acceleration of of AWS um revenue growth on a topline basis. So, but I think in other pieces is that the valuation for Amazon has continued to contract for quite some time. Like it's trading at a a price to earnings multiple similar to uh or less than Google and and so in that respect I think there there is no forward growth assumed for Amazon in my opinion. If they if you were to look at a quality business like Amazon, even if it's just growing at a at a decent pace of 5 to 10% a year, you should be giving it a uh you know, easily at 20x to 25x multiple because of the premium number one business. You're number one in e-commerce, you're number one in in cloud, you're growing advertising business. What else aren't they doing that's you know they have a premier uh video on demand platform. So to me that's a premium business, right? if if Coca-Cola can trade at 22x on a on a historical basis, why shouldn't Amazon? And so, you kind of have this floor and and to me it was just like, well, eventually they're going to break out from that floor because of the great cash flow and and the uh the great opportunity that they still have with AWS. And to me, it's a margin story. And you heard Andy Jasse talk about it uh on the call himself. He was like, look, because of culture, we're making sure that we're making things the most efficient as possible, right? and that's why they're laying off the employees that they are. And that just goes to show like that margins are a big important piece to them. And so you start doing some mathematics and you say, well, they're not done growing. They're going to be at a trillion and a half dollars of revenue here pretty soon. If they get that to a 25% operating margin, I mean, the ops cash that's going to be flown off on that is is going to be monumental. And uh that'll be, you know, close to to $400 billion. you throw a 25x multiple on that, there's no reason why this company should be trading at $6 trillion in the next couple years. Yeah. >> So, um, and then you give it a little bit more runway. There's no reason why it shouldn't be at a $10 trillion market cap valuation. >> So, to me, it it was just kind of a no-brainer. Um, that whole time it was oscillating between 2022 and now. >> Yeah. You were buying at like 85 basically 859. >> Yeah. unfor you know fortunately unfortunately during that dip um that we had in late 22 when everyone else bought Meta I bought I bought Amazon >> so um you know I bought Amazon and Google and Google turned out a good decent run for me but Amazon not as much but you know it's not that I lost money or anything but you know I could have made a lot more investing in something like Meta but to me you know I just think that Amazon's just a no-brainer of a stock going into into 2030 and beyond. >> Are you at all interested in Meta now with a 15% dip? >> I am now a shareholder of one share. Um, you inspired me. I saw you buy your I don't know how many shares you bought. Not important, but I was like, you know what? I need to be involved. And I always do that. >> You put you bought it on Robin Hood. Yeah, I remember. >> Yeah. Yeah. Um I I've started to do that more recently. Stocks that intrigue me that I want to keep following out of this buy a share of. >> Yeah. And so I'm excited to see it continue to drop because my fear was that it was just going to go back above 700 and I will never get an opportunity. And so I think I actually might start a small, you know, couple hundred bucks every paycheck sort of thing um on it. >> Get rich, get rich or die trying. Get rich or die trying. >> No, but that I mean that is the motto of uh definitely your life. Get rich or die trying. Is it more so because of the drop or is it because it's a hyperscaler and you know that no one's replicating meta? >> The thing that I'm actually most bullish about and it's actually a video I made. I don't know if it was I think it was when I was still in my old apartment so it must have been in 2022. I was very bullish when the company changed from Facebook to Meta. >> And I don't think that we fully grasp even though it's still losing a crap ton of money. I don't think that we fully grasp what Reality Labs will do in the future. And I um I think that that will play a huge piece into how things operate. And I think you're starting to see it come through. I think people originally were saying that Google Glass was too ahead of its time. But now you look at metag glasses and and people are a little bit more receptive to it, even though some people still poke fun. But I think that they're on to something. And I think that, you know, uh it hopefully it'll be able to um flow through and it'll work out for them. For now, Reality Labs has kind of just been a a dumpster fire of innovation and eventually something will stick in my thoughts. But overall, um I don't know. I'm I'm cautiously optimistic. It's a great business. It'll continue to do well. Threads has caught on more than I thought. Uh you know, it died out for a little bit. It got really hyped up initially and then it kind of died out and >> it kind of found its wave again. So, um you know, and I think Mark, I don't think people give him enough credit. He is a he's a wartime CEO. You know, as much hate as he gets, he just shrugs it off and keeps building. Love him or hate him, you have to admit. I mean, he's built a phenomenal company in the last 20 years. The fact that Met is only up 8% now year to date, I'm just seeing that is crazy because I mean, this is why a lot of people bought Amazon, right? It was barely up year to date and they thought that didn't make sense. So, uh the market giveth, the market taketh away, but as we get in towards the end of the year, it looks like the market definitely taking away some of those gains from Meta. Yes, monetization coming as well, which I mean I use WhatsApp. Do you use WhatsApp every day? >> Every day. Yeah. I mean I I never really used WhatsApp before I moved internationally and then when I moved internationally obviously um you know you don't have the normal US um sort of towers and everything and they charge you extra to text and stuff like that. So, I just always started doing texting and everything off Wi-Fi from from WhatsApp. And then it just kind of stuck like to keep in touch with some of my international friends. And um now that my life and business is slightly more international, it just makes sense. Like I'm texting with people from Australia, New Zealand, London, you know, Trinidad still, uh you know, so it just doesn't make sense to use typical typical means of of text messaging. Are you happy that Rock Lab is consolidating? I mean, I know people want to see this go to 100, but I feel like it's pretty healthy for it to pull back from 70 and make room in the 60s. Do you think that makes sense? And do you think it can get back above alltime highs on earnings? >> I think so. And, you know, I'm going to make a wild prediction um because I think earnings is next week. Uh I got to figure out my earnings times because I'll be in the UK, so I might be doing some of this stuff like late at night. Um, but uh the I'm okay with it. I I'm okay. Um, I actually just rolled I had some $85 covered calls. I moved them to the end of next month at $100 and I made like a $60 or 60 cent spread and as you guys can assume, I have some decent shares, right? So, it ended up being a lot of money. Um, so I'm just pocketing that. I'm not buying more shares, but I think I'll have a buy set for Monday or something because I have my normal, you know, buy, but like you stated, I I think we're a little bit rich in terms of where we are today, right? In terms of what the company is valued at today versus what they're delivering today is obviously overvalued, but it goes back to kind of like how we look at Palanteer, right? If you look at the potential Rocket Lab could be, you know, my thought process is is it'll eventually be a hundred billion dollar company. I don't think that we've heard enough about constellation that they're going to be releasing. So you have Amazon Kyper releasing a constellation. You have a releasing constellation. You have um Starlink obviously which has done extremely well. So you start to think how much revenue per satellite those things are bringing in. If Rocket Lab is able to replicate something like that and distribute their own satellites, then they're going to be in a phenomenal position to be able to make a lot of gross margin off of that. Um, so I don't think you've heard heard the end of that. But I personally would love the stock to consolidate. Um, even further back into the 40s, 50s, but I know unfortunately people think like, oh, Matt's got covered calls and he needs are underwater or something. It's like, no, this is like I want to own as much of this company as I can, and and I don't own enough. So in that respect, I just, you know, I think that this is a great company and and buying it at a $20 billion market cap valuation allows me to buy much more percentage of the the company on a on a buy basis. >> Well, that's the beautiful thing about conviction. Beautiful thing about conviction is that when you actually know what you're holding, which I'm not saying every stock I get into I like fully have the type of conviction that is necessary for like a a Rocket Lab situation like you, but once you do, you just don't care. You just don't because unless the thesis breaks which again if these are phenomenal companies they will have bad quarters they might even have bad years but for them to have a thesis breaking moment is is going to be tough and it's possible but if that doesn't happen then you buy the dip and you know you tend to be rewarded if you are able to do that. Um how do you feel the year has gone for you in general? Not just stock market portfolio performance but I mean it's been a hell of a year. Obviously the stock market going up definitely helps, but how do you feel 2025 is wrapping up for you as a person? >> Uh it's gone so well that I'm actually having growing pains, you know. Um it's like uh I didn't think I would get to this level of monetary uh success as fast as I have. And so I'm trying to figure out like, okay, say half of it goes away tomorrow, which is always possible, right? You could always have a market retracement. And um I'm wondering it's like well what what is my next path? Um and you know I'm trying to figure out what do I do next? I like working but at the same time it seems like I could be doing more to help people in the community. We have a beautiful community here. Um and and I feel like you know Miami really opened my eyes to that to see how many people have really been benefiting by us contributing and feeding that community you know on a on a on a daily basis. So, it's like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place, man. I really am. Like, and it's and it's not a bad thing. I'm not depressed by it in any means, but it it messes with your brain a little bit. It's like I'm doing so well in my career and I have such a great career ahead of me. I look up and I'm like, I could continue. Um, and then at the other end, you're just like, well, I have this also thing like you could see the end of that, right? You can kind of quantify. Sorry, this is getting super like existential, but it's the truth. It's like you can see where that ends, right? And and where I could potentially go and then you see this other side where it's like I see you ex excelling so much and Tanner excelling so much. And I don't want to say living on your own time because you still have a market and market close, market open and close every day, but in between those times, you can read or do whatever. It's it's just an interesting different lifestyle that I've never thought I could live. And I see myself potentially getting closer and closer to something like that and seeing Steve start, you know, it's really inspiring me. But overall, man, the the market is been really good for me. It's allowed me to focus a little bit more on my health. So, I'm trying to get that in order. Um, obviously, it's going to be a long journey um that I have to have to to face on that end, but um things are going in the right direction with that. Um, but yeah, the to me it's more about optimization of figuring out what what the next steps are because in order to break through the numbers show up after you've gotten to a certain mindset, right? So, and this is for anybody listening and you can shut me off and redirect me if you want, but I often tell people they're like, "Ah, I want to be a millionaire." And I'm like, "Well, are you are you acting like a millionaire?" Like, you have to act like a millionaire and think like a millionaire before the numbers show up, >> right? You have to make millionaire decisions. Like you can't be managing money like you have a hundred bucks. You have to be managing money or thinking in in a way that allows you to get to that point. Um just like you know to get better at baseball, right? Or like better at at at uh anything like you can't just put in baby amounts of time. Like you have to put in real effort, real time, make the right decisions, and eventually your skills will will catch up. And so I'm trying to think like in order to get to that next level, which is, you know, eight figures beyond, it's like, am I making the right decisions? Am I going in the right direction? Am I holding myself back? Um, so anyway, that might be too much of a philosophical. >> Well, no, that that's why look, it's the last day of October. That's why I asked the question. I mean, like it's important and I think a lot of people look, the good thing about a bull market year is it gives you the the privilege to even think like that, right? because you obviously need to have that level of financial independence and freedom or at least being close to it to get you to think of like what is on the other side of life. Um, and living on your own terms and all that stuff and like it's not easy to do stock market going up and being invested in the best companies in the world really helps which goes back to this bifurcation of the economy argument. Um, but it's also like you only have one life, right? So why wouldn't you why wouldn't you start having those thoughts especially as you get into your 30s and just start thinking of like and I'm getting into my 30s soon. So it's like these are things that are really really important I think to deeply think about and it makes sense that you're about them. >> Someone says never get married. >> Yeah. We're going to see if if you do get married I'm I'm I'm need to be at the wedding. That's for sure. >> You'll probably officiate it. You're very you're very articulate. So >> there you go. Dude, I definitely Dude, I I should look into that business of officiating weddings. Like >> I think you got enough on your plate. But I I'm sure some people in the audience would love you to officiate their wedding. >> There's no way I wouldn't crush being an MC at a wedding. Dude, like that would be elite elite elite to that. All right, so um I think let's end it out with just some Q&A for the past 10 minutes. I don't know if Steve will be able to be on. He's in a work call. He might be able to make it, might not. But uh we got 10 15 more minutes left. If anyone has any questions for Matty Money, put them in the chat. Yes, >> Tanner. I will definitely be mcing your wedding if you ever get married, Tanner. Um, but yes. So, any questions in the chat, put them here. Stock market related, could be life related, whatever it is. It could be for me, Matt, as well. And >> damn, 100K wedding. Yeah, I didn't think about that. You probably could make 100K wedding. Like, here's my YouTube channel. And be like, I I charge a lot, you know? And they'd be like, whatever. It's okay, >> dude. There's no way they pay the MC a h 100,000. That's like if they did. I mean, look, maybe if someone's funny, that one that one plays out. Um, >> jokes are good. Your jokes are good. >> Broad 2026 strategies. Is it just big tech or is there anything specific you're thinking of? >> Um, oil and gas. I know that's your expertise. >> Yeah, I mean, I'm I'm I'm still dabbling in that. Uh, I think I have some buys. Uh just because the I don't know why it's the 31st, so I don't know why all my buys aren't going in today. Um yeah, so I've have some normal buys that I have on a bi-weekly basis every time I get paid that go into some oil and gas. Um some sharebased compensation that's coming in today, which it hasn't in my account yet, so I'm pretty flustered with that, but hopefully by Monday it'll come in. Um I don't know. I I'm trying to understand exactly the same. Right. I don't I don't think that 26 will be a bad year in the first half. I think second half it might see some some turmoil just because I think that we'll start to see the runway end slightly for for big tech in terms of capex growth and everything like that. But with that's going to come a lot of income because everybody's been throwing so much money. So I'm like stuck between a rock and a hard place. is like, okay, yes, they might get their hand slapped for having to reset their capital expenditure, etc., but at the same time, they're going to be generating so much more income. It's I'm curious to see how it pans out, but to me, um, just continuing to buy every every other week, every time I get a paycheck, and um I don't know, looking to see what happens with next decade in Venture Global going into 26. I think that that'll be an interesting one. Um, I'm continuing to buy. Next decade, I bought some more yesterday. I bought some more Venture Global yesterday. Um, or maybe it was today. Either one. Um, I just woke up and I was just double-checking my spreadsheets and my accounts and cross-checking everything and I saw that I had more. Um, yeah, I don't I'm not 100% certain for 26 yet. That's tough. Um, >> yeah, >> I think that's fair. I think that I think a lot of the best ideas could still continue to do well, but there's gonna have to be a lot more understanding of how this year ends to figure out what happens in 26. >> I will say uh the the one thing that I did start to do in the background and it's it it goes back to the conversation I had about Amazon and maybe I encourage people to do this as well. >> Things have moved such a in such a good direction for me over the past few years that a lot of my targets have been hit faster. And so one of the things right before I was listening to you and I was being inspired as I always am when I listen to you, I went into my spreadsheet and I said, "Okay, how many shares of each of these companies do I need to get to to get to my next goal?" And so I did it for Amazon, but I have all these, you know, these other six or seven positions that I have that I'm adding to. You know, what what number do I need to get for that? Rocket Lab's relatively filled out if it gets to my uh um to my uh where I think it'll get to, but maybe I should build in a margin of safety. Like, oh, what if it only gets to 80 billion instead of 100? You know, do I still get to that X number of, you know, dollar value? But I went through and I was like, man, like so for example, um, prime example, because it's literally just filling this out, is for Palunteer, I'm only 76% filled on my total allocation for that. Amazon, I'm only 63% filled. Uh, so I have 633 shares of that. I would like to get um close to a thousand. We talked about next decade, I'm a little bit less than half. Uh, Venture Global, I'm a little less than or I'm I'm at like 33%. Google, I'm at like 33%, Rocket Lab, I'm at like 82%. Um, and I might do that for some of my other stocks, but it's like I basically have where I think the stocks will get to in terms of valuation and what I want to get to. So, for example, Amazon, I said 10 trillion is where I want to get to. I want it to be a million dollar position. You know, I needed to get to $1,000 a share pretty much. Yeah. So I was like, "Okay, well I have 633. Divide that by a th00and that's 63%. I want to get to 100%." And that's kind of how I'm looking at things. Like I would like to get my stocks up to So if they do hit that, like I think Next is going to hit 20 billion. Let's say I want, you know, a million dollars worth of Next or something like that. I need this many shares to get to that. Um that's that's how I'm evaluating it. So once it's fully valued at a million dollars, I need this many shares. Otherwise, I'll I'll miss it. And it it's going to be wrong, right? People are going to dilute share count. They'll buy back shares, so maybe it'll even be easier. But the hope is is at least you have some sort of goal that you can achieve and and look after. >> I think that's a great way to think about it. We were talking about this in the morning, but just having your own mental framework on how you navigate position building, position sizing. I mean, someone asked like, "Hey, I feel like we're getting toppy. What should I It's like, well, if you feel that way, then mentally, how can you come to a sense of peace? One of the easiest ways is take some profits. You know, there there's a lot of different ways to navigate how you think about the current state of the markets and the economy. But having your own subjective view of the world and then taking from other people, but having conviction in your opinion, which is that Amazon will get to a thousand bucks, so you need those thousand shares, it makes it easier to just continue buying and holding. Um, someone said you said you have to think like a millionaire before you are a millionaire. any I guess quick ideas on how you manifested that idea? >> Yeah, I mean listen to a lot of smart people, man. Like a lot of motivational speeches. Mostly you. No, I'm just kidding. Uh but no, but um in all seriousness, >> it's usually Steve. >> Yeah, usually Steve. But no, I mean in all seriousness, it's like it's just through learning things, right? Like just having experience in the market. like you can't expect to become a master at something if you don't start to move in a certain direction, right? Um you really have to put yourself in the opportunities to to have those things open up and you can get lucky, right? So there is an opportunity where you get lucky and and you find a train and and it's able to literally siphon through and and make things five times easier for you. But I think so many times people don't think of their lives like a business. And you know, I think it's pretty funny. Like I quote Jay-Z a lot. Like I'm a businessman. Like it's the truth, right? Like so I think so many people are like, "I have this thousand. How do I get this thousand dollars to be a million?" It's like that's not the right question, right? Like you need to be feeding your portfolio every single month, right? I always talk about it. Every every other paycheck or like every paycheck that I get, I'm investing in the market. I'm not like waiting till I get to 10,000 or anything else. Like I have my buys. Luckily, Robin Hood makes it so much easier. Fidelity makes it so much easier than it did when I first started. It's like I literally know how much of my paycheck is going where and by the end of it, my paycheck is literally just enough or the remainder in my checking account is just enough to pay my credit card and my mortgage. >> And so like that's the goal is like I never I never want to have more than $500 to $1,000 in my checking because I don't get paid in my checking account. >> So why why have why have money in my checking account? So, I have, you know, Robert Kiyosaki, you know, all these smart people. Uh, Jim Rome, you know, it doesn't always have to be about money. Sometimes it's about life and and just listen to everything and formulate your own opinion. Understand your goals and objectives where you want to go. And so, like, that's just how I've worked it. And I've learned a lot along the way. Um, thinking that I was smarter than I am. And um I'm sure somebody sorry my washer and dryer are going off, but I'm sure somebody out there is like that has way much more money than I do that way more experience on hand manage money is um like Matt's an idiot. And they're probably right, but for me it's worked out and it's gotten me to a place where I feel like I can start to play, you know, the game where the high net worth individual game. Right now I just have a decent net worth, right? and and I want to get to that place where it's like if I want to take off and go to Monaco for Monaco F1 race, like I can do that, you know, and not worry about it. >> Yeah. And I that that is the privilege of what financial freedom affords you. And uh I think that the motivational stuff you're saying makes a lot of sense. I mean, everyone has their own phases of what they listen to and how they navigate motivation, how they think about it. But like I I do think it's important at some point in your life if you want to have like a growth mindset or a transformational journey. Feeding your own content diet, I think is what it's been called, is really important because if you feed it with just horrible forms of nonsense and brain rot, it really is hard to to to to be sane, especially with all the different thousands of things that are coming at you every single day in regards to content. But feeding it with this stuff that helps you understand how to move forward in life, which is what we're all trying to do, move forward, grow, you know, that stuff matters and it matters a lot. Um, I saw you posting about Micro Strategies earnings yesterday. 17 years ago on Today, the Bitcoin white paper came out. I guess just in general, do you truly believe in Bitcoin? Uh, to the extent that you would call yourself a Bitcoin maxi? >> I wouldn't say maxi. I don't know. If I was a Maxi, I feel like I wouldn't have any stocks. Um, maybe that's not the way it is. I don't know. I don't know if I'm Is it really to the day? >> Yeah. 17 years ago, October 30th. >> Well, I can't be a maxi. I don't even know. Um, so >> but uh >> but you like Micro Strategy. You like it. >> I think it's an interesting one, right? And I think it's a proxy for what's going to happen with BMR. And I originally thought they were a little bit crazy. I had Bitcoin back in 2020, but I thought, okay, the whole company being kind of formulated around because it wasn't really a company before then. Yes, they had some software sales and they still have revenue sales and everything like that, but now the majority of their income is operated off of the delta that they get between what they buy Bitcoin at and what it's valued at today. And so, um, I think their average is like 47,000 or something like that. So, now they're actually able to kind of write up the the amount of value that they have. Maybe it's 70,000. I don't remember per Bitcoin. But I mean, I like it. It's something where I say it's going to be a decent store of value throughout time. And to me now, I think a lot of people have seen me get into this world where originally I was like, you know what, I need to sell these things, put them into the S&P 500, super secure, and it's like at this point I'm looking for things that I know will be good stewards of growth in the future like Palanteer, Rocket Lab, Bitcoin that I could just borrow against it. Like Robin Hood makes it so easy comparatively to a bank. Like no, I have zero will to go to a bank and be like, "Please underwrite me." So like like now I'm just gonna be like, "Let me just borrow from Robin Hood." Like they make it so easy. Um so I'm just looking for things like Bitcoin that I think will be a great store. >> And um to me, I think it's going to be interesting. Like I can see the cycles. I can see the supply demand. It's it's very intriguing to me. And so 2% or 3%, I forget what it is. If every paycheck I get goes into buying more Bitcoin and my thought process with that is like, well, if it does eventually 10x, then technically I save 30% of my paycheck. Um, if you think about it in that respect. >> Yeah. >> But but, uh, but I don't know, the way I look at it is is like I I I could leverage against it in the future. Same thing with Palunteer, same thing with Rocket Lab. Um, eventually those things will pay dividends. So, I'm trying to figure out a way that I can make money off of my Bitcoin as well. Um, I mean, I uh I wish I could write covered calls on my Bitcoin. I I I can on some of it because some of it I used I bought GBTC, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust back in the day. Um, and then that split off into just the mini trust, which is a lot cheaper. And so, I do write covered calls on that and then generate some income off of that. But, um, the actual physical Bitcoin I hold, uh, I don't know how to make money off of that. That's something I'm still uh trying to figure out. >> Brendan says, "Thank you for talking about borrowing against your portfolio. Everyone I talk to in real life is so worried about it. It's a game changer when done right." Yeah, I agree. And what Matt's saying right there is like if he wants to get liquidity to do something, maybe buy his like 85th house, uh, and you have a multi-million dollar stock portfolio and margin rates are at, at least on Robin Hood, four and a half%, Fidelity maybe it's like 6%, whatever it is. Like you don't need to go to a bank and they have to evaluate your entire financial profile to say hey this is the money we're going to give you and this is the rate we're going to give you. Your assets whether it's Apple or Amazon or Google or Tesla are going to be deemed worthy enough to give a margin loan against aka they're going to use the stock as collateral to give you loans or they're not going to be if you have 100% and beyond meat you're not going to get that much margin. But if you're in the greatest companies in the world like a Google and Amazon that are continuing to execute, Robinet's probably going to lend you uh a lot more money. And so from that perspective, you can leverage your own portfolio, your own decision- making that you've had for the past few years effectively allocating into these companies to then borrow money against it, which can be dangerous if you take that money and you go put it into zero DTE and then you're wrong and then you have to pay back the money and sell all your stock to pay it back. But if you're doing it productively, then it's not the worst thing in the world. >> Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I I think where where it doesn't make sense to a lot of people is when they're trying to borrow like 20% of their portfolio in a year. It's like that's not where I'm at, right? Like I'm at and I'm trying to get to a better place where it's, you know, I can >> get almost like a floor, right? Like you should never borrow more than 3 to 4% of your entire portfolio. The 3 to 4% rule, if you've heard of it, maybe if you haven't, you know, look into it. But basically the thought process is is on an average after inflation everything like that your portfolio goes up at a rate where even if it does this right generally speaking over and it's been back tested if you pull out 4% you have like an 80% likelihood of never running out of money. So, if you have a million- dollar portfolio and you pull out 40 grand a year, it'll yeah, there'll be ups and downs, but eventually, you know, over time it generally goes up and to the right if you're invested in the right things. Um, so for me, it's like, you know, um, where I was two or three years ago, I was like, oh yeah, I still have to work or do something like that. Now, it's getting to the point where the portfolio is to an extent where it's like, okay, that makes more sense. like why would I sell and pay have to pay the government you know the taxes associated with it and I was like why would I want to sell Rocket Lab it's like if I could just borrow against it then I still get to own it and not sell it nor do I have to pay the capital gains tax you think about it it's like if I were to sell my Rocket Lab it's all it's all capital gains so everything that I sell off of it is going to be 15 and actually more like 20% to the government so >> it's like why why do that immediately I almost like a I can use part of that and um think about it that that plays into the factor as well. It's like I no longer have to worry about that aspect of it. Now, of course, if Rocket Lab switches directions, different story. I would sell it and but for right now, I just think they're moving in the right direction and firing on all cylinders. So, same thing with Palanteer. Like, why would I sell Pounder when it's still churning out? So, >> and quite frankly, this is like this is the the secret. I don't know if it's too much of a secret anymore, but like most people in the in the in the investing community understand this is what wealthy people do. They I mean like Larry Ellison has I think sold less than 1% of his entire stake of Oracle for the past 50 years. Like you borrow against the assets and you get I mean look Larry Ellson's in a different league, multiund billionaire, but you get very cheap loans from private lending companies when you're in that league because uh they want to do business with you and you don't need to be able to sell when you have access to that much capital. So we're people can do it on a much smaller stage at these levels if you do it productively. But it is something as you get wealthier. You know that is I guess the trick of not having to sell your assets ever. And you know this goes back to that bifurcation of the economy bargain. If you have been borrowing against Nvidia for you know there's people in the chat that have like 100,000 Nvidia shares. Like why would you sell >> right? Like why would you sell that? It's like no you can borrow again like unless Nvidia goes to zero or Nvidia substantially goes down which it did with the deepseek moment. So those risks are there. But if it doesn't, then you can pay off a lot of your bills without having to sell all the stock. >> Yeah. I mean, unless you think it's truly fully valued and it's at risk. Like say I thought Palanteer was only supposed to be $250 billion company and I think what they're doing right now they're they're running like a $250 billion company and I think their terminal market cap should be $250 billion. It's like, well, why am I holding it, right? It doesn't make sense. But to me, I still think it's going to grow to one and a half$2 trillion dollar market cap. So >> yeah, >> why why sell it? Pay the capital gains. I don't think it'll go back to 160 very easily. And if it does, will I have the money on hand to be able to buy back in? You know what I mean? That that's always you're playing so many ifs. You're stacking assumptions on top of each other, and it just doesn't work. Um, so I, you know, I'm not very smart either, so I try to make things as simple as possible. But yeah, I mean, somebody asked in the chat, will I ever disclose? I mean, it doesn't really matter what the number is that I say that comes out of my mouth. is more important is what I'm saying and how it pertains to you because what I'm saying is versus what your what your life is or whatever can be completely different. Um, and so does >> I I think I think people get too obsessed about someone's net worth or how many shares do they have in this or position size or all that stuff like >> the the question is about the analysis around a position, not exactly how many shares or how big someone's portfolio is because at that point like you're you're looking for validation from a number, not from the actual person and and and what they're saying. And I think that's really important because there's a lot of people on Twitter that are young and you know I'm seeing them fresh out of college and I'm I'm seeing their analysis on stuff. They don't have $100,000 to put into a Nebus but the analysis they're putting out even if they only have $10,000 which is a lot when you're 20 years old to put into Nebas that stuff matters and to discount it. I mean when I was starting out on YouTube my first video was I put $25,000 into Palunteer and I think that was pretty much my net worth at the time. I mean like maybe I had like 35 maybe I had 10,000 in some other bank account but that was it. The analysis is what really mattered. Not like I put 250,000 because I didn't have 250,000. I couldn't have put that into right. >> No, I think I think it's the right way. I mean maybe maybe you're in a situation like Amit was, right? That you only you have one shot and and that's the only money you'll ever have. Your great aunt Sue unfortunately passed away and then maybe that's it. You you pile it all into one thing. But to me, I think there's more to be said about making prudent investment decisions, running your life like a business, trying to understand that every paycheck you should go reinvest it in yourself in some sort of way, shape, or form. And I think so many people think I could turn this $1,000 into a million. And it's like that's a thousandx, man. Like that's a lot. >> You know, you know how you know how to have the amount of difficulty. It's literally add another thousand portfolio. Now you only have to 500x. And if you do that every month, you know, and I know $1,000 is a lot. say it's a hundred, right? You want to turn a 100 to a million, right? It's it's the same sort of principle. It's about principles in my opinion and how it pertains to your goals, objectives, etc. And not Bill next door, right? So, it really just depends upon how you can apply things to yourself and you know, what does my net worth have anything to do with you? >> Nothing. >> And and and and what and what you're listening to. And so, you know, I stopped sharing it back in 2021 2022. If you're really curious about where I was back then, go check out the channel. But, you know, I haven't really disclosed it. Um, I've disclosed it to people personally, like, you know, but not on X or anything like that. And, um, I just don't think it's important, you know. Um, yeah. Also, there's a level of privacy that people want to keep, you know, like it's it's okay to not tell everyone how much money you have because like you kind of don't want to tell the world sometimes how much money you have. >> That is okay to do. People thought I was lying back then, so I mean, what's the point of me saying it now? >> Matt Money's YouTube is right there. By the way, Matt, our our boy who's been turning into the new Pelosi, he bought some more Palunteer in October. >> I saw that. That was so funny. >> Our boy Cleo Fields, baby. Half a million in Palanteer. Now he has to disclose cuz he is an elected official so he doesn't get to get away with it even though they always disclose like 45 days late. But >> yeah, >> I mean >> I thought it was so funny. >> Our boy Cleo, he continues to buy. >> He knows I mean he probably sees the amount of contracts that they're bidding on and you know he knows the he knows for a fact that NATO is going to be running entirely off of Pal. We will talk about it tonight but like so shout out to the people that are going to watch tonight. Uh but it's you think about it, you start to see it and it's my thought process back when I started using the software 2015 2016 is like every company should be running off this. Every process should be running off this. The government should be running off this and it's it's slowly what's the word per not perforating partic >> permeating. Thank you. Um throughout the entire economy and it's insane. >> Yeah. >> Yeah. And >> somebody asked, sorry, somebody asked if I do 401k. I do, uh, but I don't contribute. I do the match, but I don't do I don't max it out because I like to have the ability to flexibly move my money around and have access to it to buy real estate or invest in other things or um, so in my opinion, it like I said, depends if you're going to be working your job for the next 30 years. If you're going to retire at say 60 and you need that job, then do the match. like max it out, right? Like get it that as much of that tax advantage as you can. But for me, I always wanted that ability to to to switch careers if I if I wanted to. And if you're not selling a lot, you're not going to pay a lot of taxes anyway. Like for me, like I haven't paid a single tax dollar on on Palunteer other than the covered calls that I've sold. So, and same thing with Rocket Lab. I haven't paid a single dollar on tax other than the covered calls that I've sold. So, >> I agree. And uh the flexibility of that stuff is really important, especially if you're managing a retirement account. We were about to leave. I was about to end it, but then this guy wants to join. Steve, you're kind of late, buddy. >> Look, daddy. >> He's probably not even there. Look at that. You're muted if you are there. It's also not his fault because he had Look, he text me two minutes. Dude, this guy, he loves streaming so much. He's just like getting into it. >> He's married to the game. He's married to the game and I love it. >> He's married to the game. All right, we'll get him on in a second. Uh, Matt, did you see the Kramer clip on Palunteer? >> No, the one nobody was on stage or >> Yeah. >> No, I didn't end up getting to that. >> Okay, so for those that didn't see it, here's uh here's the clip because this was pretty incredible as well to see. By the way, Elon just did Olin. So, he did Rogan and Olen. So, for those who are Elon fans, you've got like five hours of Elon content over the weekend to uh to be able to consume. Okay, this is this is what Mr. Kramer had to say about Palunteer. >> Palanteer, are you as impressed with Alex Karp as he is with himself? >> All right. So, >> I find him to be really interesting. I'm not long the stock. I'm curious books who come out. Axio says some stuff about it. Uh I I don't like him. Uh >> isn't he a Philly? He's a Philly guy, too. >> Yeah. Oh, I I told him that. I said, "Listen, like you're like a more repulsive Philly guy than I am." I gave him a note once. I said, "I'm not your enemy." And he goes, "Yeah." I said, "No, that's a peace offering." Yeah. It was like horrible. He's like a horrible guy, but I think he's real. I think that and I say that because like like all the companies that have hired him, the big ones, I've called them and I said, "How is it?" And they all to a person say, "Listen, it's pretty good." >> I mean, he's on fire. That business is on fire. >> It's on fire, >> but is it too expensive even given how on fire they are? >> Um, >> it seems crazy to me. >> It is rule of 80. Uh, I think I'm going to end up It's gonna go >> They're killing rule of 80. >> They're they're they're killing it. And the you know look Boeing just went with them and Ortberg was a very serious guy. When I say the serious guys it's like the uh scene in in Succession when right yeah right Brian you you are not serious people. Well it's like a great line because I'm talking about people who are serious like Orber would not be going to him. I know a kid who who went there from uh from Wharton and I know his mom and his mom was saying you know they work 247. Uh they're all Karp to them is a hero because he's really not imperious at all to them and that's what makes me like him. Now I sent that guy Shyam the number two guy. He had a really good piece about the military last week. I sent him an email and I and I knew he wasn't going to return but I said look that you know I know you guys despise me whatever. But then I meet this woman Wendy who's in charge of defense. She's >> So if anyone wants to keep watching that you can keep you can uh hear it. I'll put the link in the in the channel. But I mean, look, Karp uh Kramer said that Karp was not a real businessman and that Paliner was not a real business. And so obviously, you know, that's why Karp is not the biggest fan of it. >> Dude, those guys run on something different. They run on like I I I've seen people work, but that's been the reason why I bought them on direct listing day. Like they are on something else. Like I don't know if they say, "Hey, you realize when we give you this offer, like you you're going to be a completely different kind of human being than everybody else on the goddamn planet." They they have to like you've met so many of their employees. They're just they're all so unique and so different in a good way, right? >> Yeah. >> In a good way. All right, Steve. I think he's here. I just saw him and then he disappeared. Milkman, >> I'm here. >> Did you go and get your milk? >> No. There he is. You >> get them fresh milk for like, is that what you're >> No, I'm freaking starving. Sorry to do this to you guys, but I I haven't even had lunch yet. Like, >> dude, why are you complaining? You're You're a full-time streamer now. This is I don't eat for seven hours. That's how it is. Like, >> I ordered diner in the car on the way home >> and you just muted yourself. Are you >> with Steve? Are you an amateur today? What's going on? >> No, I just got home. I ordered diner from the car. He met me at the door. It was freaking perfect timing. Got a nice burger. Medium. >> That red meat, baby. >> That red meat. >> All right. So, look, I'll ask you one question, then we'll end it out for for the day and you can get to eat your food. But just like and we kind of talk about >> No, it's fine. >> No, no, we gotta end it. We gotta let Matt go. I gotta go as well. But I mean, overall thoughts on uh this week, sixth month in a row green for the S&P 500. >> I mean, I don't think there's any way we're not getting to 7,000 at this point. >> I agree. >> Unless something happens with China. I mean, I just I don't see that we're going to get a big retracement or anything. And Nvidia is likely going to have great numbers. I I didn't really see anything that happened today other than Chevron Exon. Chevron had a pretty good quarter and the H deal seems like it's going to be amazing. So, I'm really happy with where things are right now. I think Meta, look, if you looked at my article, it's more of what I said last night. I think it's a huge opportunity right now. I think Amazon's a huge >> 648 today. >> Yeah, it's crazy. These people are crazy. It's crazy. >> I want to see that chart to the right. I want to see that chart to the right. How many times has this guy covered this? >> What chart? >> The chart to the right that shows like how many buy recommendations >> all the way. >> We did this last night. Go on my profile and look, Matt. I've done like 30 articles on Meta. All buys. >> Champion. >> Champion. Yeah. >> All buys for like five years. since 2018. >> Yeah. >> When did you start writing? >> 2018. >> Okay, there you go. >> I think that we're in an opportunity cycle and I think it's going to keep going up. I don't see any headwinds at the moment. I hate saying that, but maybe a recession is in the bingo card to the back half of 26. If unemployment keeps going like this, who knows? But right now, corporate earnings are really strong and the companies that are not producing revenue are not going to impact the S&P or the NASDAQ. So, I'm just I'm not worried about it. >> The thing I'm the thing that still concerns me, Steve, is exactly what I was telling you the other day is is that that remaining free cash flow after after dividends and and share buybacks, I don't think it's going to rear its head at all this year. I think everyone's going to be able to power through it. But the second half of next year, I think it's going to start to to come to fruition. I think you already started to see people on CNBC talk about it. Um, so if I'm talking about it and then they start talking about it, I feel like it's eventually going to perforate through permeate as a kindly corrected me. The >> Sorry, go ahead. >> I just don't know that we can go against the most brilliant minds in the country. >> I'm with you. >> That's Oh no. buyback slow down for a little bit. who freaking like in the grand scheme of things if this was shortterm money I would be like you know what maybe this isn't such a great idea but over the next f they're they're building this out for the next 5 10 15 years and when you think about how they're deploying capex if they fall behind and they're wrong you're their profitability is off the table in the future so I would rather them spend the capex and cut the buybacks by 20% or so because this is the next leg of future profitability and I would be willing to take that as a shareholder. So I'm just not willing to go against big tech right now. That's to be fair that that's one of the problems that I have with some oil companies is they focused too much on buybacks and dividends and in reality if they just focused on acquiring more and investing through the cycle then their buybacks and dividends would eventually catch up in a couple years. So to me I'm I'm hoping that they manage it well. I was telling a bit earlier that somebody will fail a couple like somebody will not do well. They'll be too focused like oh we can't do the buy we can't cut on buybacks or anything like that. I would actually welcome it. In fact, I welcomed it when a lot of oil companies cut their dividends back in 2020. And I was like, this is a good resetting point because at the time, Shell was paying 15 a year and however many other companies were paying 20 billion a year in dividends. So, I was like, this is a good reset. But, yeah, I'm kind of curious to see how they navigate it. You're right. Maybe it's only a 5 10% impact if they cut share buybacks versus where they'll end up being, which is 20 30% 40% higher because of the net income growth. ground. >> [ __ ] Sorry. Alphabet buying back 70 billion in shares. Oh no, we're only going to buy back 55 billion now. Like, is it that big of a deal? That's more cash than companies generate in a 5 to 10 year cycle. Like, I just don't know if that's something I'm going to really get up in arms about when we see the backlog numbers on cloud and AI is still in its infancy. So to me, that cash is better used being deployed into what's going to be the growth engine of the company going forward and what's going to propel the S&P higher. >> I agree. >> I would agree. Matt Money's YouTube, I'm putting that in the chat. Steve, are you going to stream anytime soon? >> Yeah, I'm actually probably gonna do a do something at 6:30 for a while. Get caught up on a few things. probably going to do something and then uh probably going to do something tonight too around 9 9:30. But um admit I wanted to ask you something. How you feeling for Monday? >> Well, real quick, Steve's YouTube is right there. So for those that want to subscribe to him, he'll be streaming in like an hour, so you can check him out on his stream. And um yeah, the rest of us will be back on Pounder Weekly at 11. No, I'm feeling good for Monday. I didn't expect the stock to move before the earnings, although that happens. It's happened a couple times. So yeah, Matt, me and Amir will get deeper into it tonight on the weekly, but I agree with Matt. Margins are what I care about more. Topline revenue growth, I think it'll break 50%. I think guidance for 26 right now is at 45. That might bump up to like 4850, but the stocks already made a move. So it's kind of like I have no idea how the market's going to react, but the numbers I think are going to be pretty damn good. >> What's Monday, Steve? [Laughter] Super Bowl, dude. Super Bowl. >> Super Bowl hat, baby. >> What is it? >> It's >> You're wearing the hat. >> Thought it was Tuesday. Isn't it on Tuesdays? >> No, it's on Monday. Am I Am I wrong? No, it's on Monday. >> I thought it was on Monday. I could be wrong. I thought it was Monday. >> It's definitely November 3rd. Yeah, dude. It's Monday. >> Okay, good. Yeah, I ain't >> doing nothing Monday night. There you go. That'll be Monday >> at 3:30. >> Yeah. Live. >> I am hoping that they have a five in front of the number for revenue growth. I don't know how they go. >> That's going to happen. It is because they they guided for 50%. So there's no way they don't. >> I'm just saying I I hope that they have a five. If they if they come out with a six >> Oh, that then we are gonna have some fun, bro. Like all I'm saying is if they come out with a six, all hell is breaking loose. >> If they show 60% revenue, not even inviding loose. >> Yeah, there's no other software name close. Nvidia is not growing 60% anymore. And if they guide upwards of 60%. I mean, dude, >> the rule of >> Yeah. I was going to say we're going to talk about the rule of 80 instead of the rule of 40, but you know. >> Yeah. I mean, that would be quite incredible. They already have rule of 81. So, >> I should be able to Yeah, I should be able to stream that. Uh cuz it'll be what? I don't remember. Was it five hours ahead, so that'll be >> Oh, you're the UK on Monday. >> Yeah, Monday I'll be >> So, you're flying out tomorrow? >> Flying out tomorrow night. Yeah. >> Matt's gonna have some tea and crumpets. Oh, some biscuits. >> I mean, listen, English breakfast tea is the only good tea. So, >> I had some yesterday. >> Thank you everybody. Appreciate it. Steve's YouTube in the chat. He's going to stream in about an hour. Matt, >> I'll be on around 600, guys. >> I might have to go get some cookies to watch that. Steve, >> I mean, why don't you just come on? >> Maybe I will. Maybe I'll have to go get some cookies to come on. You both of you have an open invite. I mean, I'm sure Mid has. What's your favorite cookie? >> Chocolate chip. It's always chocolate chip. >> Although Oreo is up there, but it's chocolate chip. >> I do have to get candy for the little ones coming tonight, so >> Oh, yeah. Well, I'm in an apartment complex, so it's not really >> Yeah, Houston's a little weird. They normally go to the rich neighborhoods, and I'm not in there. So, >> that makes sense. That makes sense. All right. Thank you, everybody. Appreciate it. Congrats on a great week. Uh, sixth month in the row. Green for the S&P. Pounder above 200. Fed cut rates. Big tech crushed it. Amazon crushed it. Google amazing. So, pretty strong week for everybody. We are entering November tomorrow. Me and Matt will be live at 11 PM for Pounder Weekly. I'll be live Sunday for the future show at 7:45 and we'll keep going from there. Thank you. >> Thank you. >> Thank you everybody. Have a good one. We'll see you guys later tonight. See you everybody soon. See you later. Bye everyone.</p>
