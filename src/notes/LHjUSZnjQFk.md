### 饮料行业的当前趋势与挑战

Nicola Tangan: 黛布拉，目前饮料行业正在发生什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Deborah what's happening in this Bears industry just now</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 首先，我们看到饮料酒类，尤其是烈酒，有着非常长的增长跑道。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">first of all we see a really long runway for growth in beverage alcohol and particularly in spirits</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 过去20多年来，整个饮料酒类一直在持续增长。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and you know and it's it's Total Beverage alcohol has been growing consistently for 20 plus years</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 酒精在可支配支出和消费者可支配钱包中的占比相当适中，不到2%，而且长期以来一直非常稳定。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and alcohol is a percent of discretionary spending and percent of consumer kind of discretionary wallets is quite modest it's less than 2% and that's been very consistent over time</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 毫无疑问，目前行业面临相当大的挑战，这是由于周期性的经济压力、通胀以及消费者不得不应对的长期通胀所致。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">uh no doubt right now the the industry is quite challenged and it's challenged because of the the cyclical kind of economic uh pressures the uh inflationary the prolonged inflation that that consumers are having to navigate um has compressed that kind of discretionary wallet and that's really impacting the volumes of the industry</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 这压缩了可支配消费，并严重影响了行业的销量。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">that being said people forget just how resilient the industry is</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 话虽如此，人们往往会忘记这个行业的韧性有多强。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and so you know we do see this it's cyclical it's going to come back and this resilience can really be explained because of the kind of underlying structural drivers of demand um that really give us Tailwinds are if we look at some of the uh some of the things which are happening just now uh are young people drinking less than before</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 所以，我们确实认为这是周期性的，它会恢复过来，这种韧性可以归因于潜在的结构性需求驱动因素，这些因素为我们带来了顺风。

### Z世代的饮酒习惯：适度与多样化

Nicola Tangan: 现在的年轻人饮酒量比以前少了吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">are young people drinking less than before</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 我们看到**Z世代**（Gen Z: 指在1990年代中期至2000年代后期出生的一代人）正在表达他们更倾向于适度饮酒。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so what we're seeing is um so gen Z are expressing um and and that they prefer to moderate</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 话虽如此，实际行为上，我们看到更多的是我们称之为“斑马纹”现象。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">that being said the actual behavior um we what we're seeing in Behavior is more of what we would call zebra striping which is um you know I go into a bar um I order a Guinness first I'm still out with my friends and so uh the next thing I'm going to order is a Guinness z00 that's how I'm moderating um but at the same time I'm staying very much within Guinness I'm staying in the moment I still feel like I'm part of it</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 比如，我走进酒吧，先点一杯**Guinness**（健力士啤酒），我仍然和朋友们在一起，然后我可能会点一杯**Guinness 0.0**（健力士零度啤酒），这就是我适度饮酒的方式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and so we're actually seeing that Jin Z behavior um you know they're not moderating as much as what um uh you know people think um and so they drink like every other alcoholic non-alcoholic drink yeah and and they're clearly my friends are not gen Z though well and they're also they're coming into Spirits faster</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 但同时，我仍然非常忠于健力士品牌，我活在当下，仍然感觉自己是群体的一部分。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so the other thing that we're really experiencing is that while maybe overall they are um you know moderating through some behaviors they are they're actually coming into Spirits faster um and that's because of drinks like rtds they're coming into tequila faster uh because they're drinking Spirits with food</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 所以我们实际上看到Z世代的行为，他们并没有像人们想象的那样适度饮酒，他们会像喝其他含酒精和不含酒精的饮料一样饮用。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um so there's you know it's one of those that we see it as much of an opportunity as we see it as um a headwind</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 另外，他们进入烈酒市场的速度更快。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">the other thing going on is lifestyle so that's what what you're kind of getting at is this moderation area</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 这是因为像**RTDs**（Ready-To-Drink: 即饮饮品，预调酒或预包装饮料）这样的饮品，他们更快地接受龙舌兰酒，因为他们会搭配食物饮用烈酒。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so but I'll start by saying first of all social socializing and kind of that uh the social dynamics that unite us and the local nuances of that socializing is a big part of how how much of your sales would be in you know in restaurants bars and how much would be at home</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 所以，我们认为这既是机遇，也是挑战。

### 社交场合的演变与“第三空间”

Debra Crew: 另一个趋势是生活方式，这正是您所指的适度饮酒领域。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so that's one of the trends we we should talk about because what we're seeing is actually more occasions we're seeing an expansion of these socializing occasions coming it like and they're quite Diversified now</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 但我想首先说的是，社交活动以及将我们团结在一起的社会动态，以及社交活动的当地细微差别，在我们的销售中占很大一部分，无论是餐厅、酒吧还是家中消费。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">it used to be a lot of restaurants and bars but now you see more and more socializing occurring at home they're smaller it's kind of a smaller setting there's maybe fewer you know it's more informal setting but we are seeing more occasions coming home um and that's not just a CO Trend we were seeing we've been seeing this trend for a long time</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 这是我们应该讨论的一个趋势，因为我们实际上看到了更多的场合，这些社交场合正在扩大并变得多样化。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Co clearly kind of made home as Fortress but that is a big part of what we're also seeing a rise of what we call the third spaces</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 过去，大部分社交活动发生在餐厅和酒吧，但现在，越来越多的社交活动在家中进行，规模更小，环境更非正式，但我们看到了更多的居家场合。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so what that is is you're not in a bar you're not at home but maybe you're out at a sports kind of Arena or you're at a festival um this is big for kind of ginz they're out and about when they are consuming alcohol they're often out in these third spaces</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 这不仅仅是疫情期间的趋势，我们长期以来一直在观察这一趋势。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and so what we're seeing in the industry is there's more formats and Siz and you know this is like Rise of rtds and some of this that you're seeing is all uh the industry really capturing those occasions and that's another big kind of Tailwind for us</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 疫情显然让家成为了“堡垒”，但我们还看到了“第三空间”的兴起。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but just if we take these two two things so one uh young people drink less how how how significant is that</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 所谓的“第三空间”是指你不在酒吧，也不在家，而是在体育场馆或音乐节等场所。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yeah so let's talk about moderation for a second because it's not just we've we've been tracking this trend for quite some time we call it mindful consumption</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 这对Z世代来说很重要，当他们饮酒时，通常是在这些“第三空间”里。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um so I talked about how value has been consistently growing beverage alcohol for a long time within that though and by the way popularity has not waned it's actually been quite strong 70% of households participate in that's been a pretty steady Trend as well</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 因此，我们看到行业中出现了更多的产品形式和尺寸，例如**RTDs**的兴起，这都表明行业正在抓住这些消费场合，这对我们来说是另一个重要的顺风。

### 适度饮酒与高端化策略

Nicola Tangan: 如果我们只看这两点，年轻人饮酒量减少，这有多重要？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but volume per caps actually peaked in 2012 and then they've been slightly but steadily kind of declining really since 2012</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 好的，我们来谈谈适度饮酒，因为我们追踪这一趋势已有一段时间了，我们称之为“**有意识消费**”（Mindful consumption: 消费者在购买和使用产品时，更加关注其对健康、环境和社会的影响）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">now what I mean by slight it would be like from 2012 till now it's like a bottle of wine so it is slight but it is coming down and we've seen that moderating trend for a long time time</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 我之前提到，饮料酒类的价值长期以来一直在持续增长，而且其受欢迎程度并未减弱，实际上相当强劲，70%的家庭参与其中，这也是一个相当稳定的趋势。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so we drink less but more expensive stuff yeah and actually that's exactly what we say we say people want to drink better not more and we've set our whole growth strategy really around that</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 但人均消费量实际上在2012年达到顶峰，之后便开始略微但稳定地下降，从2012年至今，下降量大约相当于一瓶葡萄酒，所以虽然轻微，但确实在下降，我们长期以来一直看到这种适度饮酒的趋势。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">about and by the way Spirits underneath of that per caps have held in quite quite good because Spirits is gaining from beer and wine we're gaining in like food occasions and some of this that you wouldn't have seen before that's kind of been a space for wine and beer</p>
</details>

Nicola Tangan: 所以我们喝得少了，但喝得更贵了？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">what about some of the health Trends and the anti-obesity drugs and so on how is that impacting you</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 是的，这正是我们所说的，人们想要“喝得更好，而不是更多”，我们整个增长战略都围绕着这一点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yeah you know we're not seeing that as separate and distinct from those moderating trends that we've been seeing you know</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 顺便说一句，烈酒的人均消费量保持得相当好，因为烈酒正在从啤酒和葡萄酒中获得市场份额，我们在餐饮场合等以前葡萄酒和啤酒占据的领域也获得了增长。

### 健康趋势与大麻合法化的影响

Nicola Tangan: 那么，一些健康趋势和抗肥胖药物等对你们有什么影响？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so look supposedly 15 million Americans at any given time are are now on these or at least trying you know these type of weight loss drugs and and perhaps they're on for other reasons as well other health reasons um but we're not seeing a that trend line break so while people are being more mindful about what they're consuming we're we're not seeing that as as kind of this separate kind of break in that in the overall trend</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 我们不认为这与我们一直在观察的适度饮酒趋势是分开的、截然不同的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">are you seeing big differences between geographies is the trend in Europe very different from Asia</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 看看，据说任何时候都有1500万美国人正在服用或至少尝试这些减肥药物，或许他们服用这些药物还有其他健康原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean not really I would say this is more of a developed Market phenomenon um and and so that is where we're you know where we're seeing that you know we do see these Trends do tend to go around the world and I would say in general we are seeing kind of premiumize and people thinking more about you know what they're what they're consuming</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 但我们没有看到趋势线因此而中断，所以尽管人们对消费更加有意识，但我们不认为这在整体趋势中造成了单独的、显著的断裂。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">talking of which um is the legalization of Mariana having an impact on drink cons</p>
</details>

Nicola Tangan: 你们是否看到不同地区之间存在巨大差异？欧洲的趋势与亚洲非常不同吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">well you know we're not really seeing that either it's kind of a different occasion you know this comes back to our occasions are more these social occasions that we talked about where you tend to be like so socializing 86% of the time when you're having a drink you're having it in the company of others so those are bigger occasions for us really than um quite often uh cannabis and some of this which has been legal now for some quite some time in in several states in the US and we're not really seeing once again A distinct you know break in sort of the trends that we've been seeing for quite some time now</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 其实并没有。我认为这更多是发达市场的一种现象，我们确实看到这些趋势往往会蔓延到全球。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">now how does this impact the way you market and brand your products</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 总的来说，我们看到**高端化**（Premiumization: 品牌通过提升产品质量、包装、营销等方式，提高产品定位和价格的策略）趋势，人们对所消费的产品考虑得更多。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yeah so we like I said we have grounded all of our uh strategy and growth strategies really within the spirits gaining occasions from beer and wine so expanding our Spirits occasions and premiumize</p>
</details>

Nicola Tangan: 谈到这个，大麻合法化对酒精消费有影响吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so our portfolio um is oriented more more toward premium now so almost I don't know 62% of our portfolio is sort of Premium Plus and that compares to the industry average of kind of being like 35%</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 嗯，我们也没有真正看到这种影响。这是一种不同的场合。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so over time we've actually divested um kind of some of our more value Brands and we've actually invested in things like you mentioned our our tequila brands earlier those are kind of Ultra Premium priced so we've reoriented our portfolio to more premiumization</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 这又回到了我们之前谈到的社交场合，86%的饮酒时间你都是在与他人社交，所以这些对我们来说是比大麻等更大的场合。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and then from a marketing standpoint there's there's six trends that we are that that we've kind of said we want to lead in shape</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 大麻在美国几个州合法化已有一段时间了，但我们再次没有看到我们长期以来观察到的趋势有明显的断裂。

### 品牌营销与产品组合调整

Nicola Tangan: 这如何影响你们营销和品牌产品的方式？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so not surprisingly moderation one so we've gone out we've acquired some non- out kind of spirit Brands so ritual in the US is one of those um convenience so this is sort of these rtds and you know if you're out in these third spaces what are you doing it's luxury so we're still seeing luxury as being um you know we're going to see by 2028 almost a quarter um of the category we think will be in these kind of more Super Premium Plus priced uh products so luxury is a part with food so you may go what is this you know I'm a Texan so um the best thing with Mexican food is a margarita it's not beer wine so those are the types of things we're going after what do you have with your steak um I would have whiskey for sure okay good a good Smoky like Isa whiskey</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 是的，正如我所说，我们所有的策略和增长战略都立足于烈酒从啤酒和葡萄酒中获得市场份额，从而扩大我们的烈酒消费场合并实现高端化。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">by the way what is your favorite drink</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 我们的产品组合现在更加倾向于高端，大约62%的产品属于“高端+”类别，而行业平均水平约为35%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so you know I love all of the children um I you know so but not in the same glass at the same time yeah no no no no um I'm a big tequila fan I'm a Texan so you know so Don Julio I'm 1942 but I'm I'm also a big I like a pety scotch so I like our Johnny Walker black I like our lagavulin um you know in the summer I like a good genen and tonic I like a good Tanger tonic so pretty FX pretty flexible um now um I should ask you what your favorite drink is</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 随着时间的推移，我们实际上剥离了一些价值品牌，并投资于您之前提到的龙舌兰酒品牌，这些都是超高端定价的产品。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">well I'm I'm I'm actually uh a bit more of a wine drinker but if I were to hit one of your products it would probably be uh the Gonic does it matter if you're like traveling or no mainly that would be summer but but not very often that's your summer but not very often okay well we got to work on you totally totally anytime</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 所以我们已经将产品组合重新定位到更高端的方向。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">uh tariffs</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 从营销角度来看，我们有六个我们希望引领和塑造的趋势。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yes well I mean look we're in 180 countries and we're a big importer and exporter and so clearly we love free trade um you know however honestly over time we have dealt with a lot of Duties and tariffs and you know disruptions so we take a long view of these things and we look at it and say you know we've we certainly can navigate through the any of these things you know and I mean look there's been tariffs and and high duties on Scotch for years is an example going from uh Scotland into India um they're short-term disruptive no doubt um and it's probably the uncertainty that's the hardest thing to plan for is when you don't you know it's hard to mitigate those until you know exactly what those are going to look like so you know we're clearly staying very close on all of it and um you know but we see that from a long run we can absolutely mitigate those things we know what to do you know it's just really more of just navigating through the short run and you know how do we how do we mitigate that</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 毫不意外，适度饮酒是其中之一，所以我们收购了一些非酒精烈酒品牌，比如美国的**Ritual**就是其中之一。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">when you buy Brands I mean you bought for instance uh tequila brand from George Clooney I think you paid a billion dollars so yes well done him uh when when do you when do you buy well done us it's been a great brand for us win-win um but when do you when do you buy a brand and when do you build it and how um you know what are what are the considerations here</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 其次是便利性，这指的是**RTDs**等产品，当你身处“第三空间”时，你会选择什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yeah I mean you know look we do have a you know we've got 13 billion do Brands we're number one or number two in many of our of these categories so um I really love our portfolio you know that being said um you you know we do look for spaces where we don't have uh maybe a strong of a brand or a brand because we also are across price tiers as well um you know so that can be important as well where sometimes we don't feel like you know we have a premium enough brand or um like in the non-al space our most recent acquisition in ritual in the US uh we had seed lip that we took it was a big brand for us in the UK that was non out um but in you know in the US this ritual um seed lip is kind of more in the Gin space I would say and you know ritual uh had a brand that kind of spanned across as a tequila alternative a Jin alternative a whiskey alternative Etc and so that has been the number one we felt like we didn't have anything that could go there so we went out um and acquired that</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 还有奢华，我们仍然认为奢华是一个重要的趋势，预计到2028年，我们认为将近四分之一的品类会是超高端定价的产品。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">likewise we we dispose of Brands um you know some of our disposals that we've done in India we disposed of kind of our value and popular kind of price point because we just see a long-term premiumization there and that part of the portfolio represented a lot of volume but it wasn't necessarily set to drive growth for the future</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 奢华是其中一部分，与食物搭配也是。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so acquisition wise we kind of look for where we don't have but but quite honestly most spaces we can really go after With Our Brands and and we've got a consumer Choice framework that helps us it actually looks at these socializing Trends it looks at um across we've got 37 markets that we track like 220 million occasions that we're taking a look at what they're drinking uh who they're with how they're drinking because it's look at socializing as well as what they're what they're doing</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 我是德克萨斯人，墨西哥菜最好的搭配是玛格丽塔，而不是啤酒或葡萄酒。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and how do you use that analytics so you have all this incredible data and we probably should inject here that you have your background from the intelligence service so you are really into Data</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 这些都是我们追求的类型，比如你吃牛排时会喝什么？我肯定会喝威士忌，比如像**Islay**（艾雷岛）那样烟熏味的威士忌。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I do I I am into Data I love data and and and I love it because it really helps us do you know Precision marketing and when you get when you get that right when you get the right brand at the right time you know to the right person I mean that that experience it elevates the whole experience and that's what we're trying to do we're trying to elevate these moments for</p>
</details>

Nicola Tangan: 顺便问一下，您最喜欢喝什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so you have 220 million data points I mean what do you what do you what do we do with that</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 我喜欢所有的“孩子”，但不是在同一个杯子里同时喝。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">that helps us in deploying for for one it helps us see the best opportunities we marry that up with the Best Brands we make sure that we are you know marketing within that occasion and we serve up the best serve options for for people it you know it just helps us be much more precise about where to go and especially in these type of moments where it's quite volatile and you do have consumers Under Pressure being able um you know when we get this right consumers are willing to spend money because they see value and that they're getting great quality exactly what they want</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 我是龙舌兰酒的忠实粉丝，我是德克萨斯人，所以喜欢**Don Julio 1942**（唐·胡里奥1942龙舌兰）。

<p class="english-text">um so let so let's take an example here so jny Johnny Walker yeah you have different types of Johnny Walker at different price points so how does is architecture work how do you think about it I mean Johnny Walker so the most expensive Johnny Walker what is that</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 但我也很喜欢泥煤味的**Scotch**（苏格兰威士忌），比如我们的**Johnny Walker Black**（尊尼获加黑牌）和**Lagavulin**（乐加维林）。

<details>

<p class="english-text">yeah well we just launched the Vault did you see this so this we launched a um this is going to be a customized Johnny Walker blend for you it's 50,000 pounds for that privilege so it is at the tippy top of but it is a personalized experience around Johnny Walker and you get to go to to Princess Street in Edinburgh and we will craft this for you and so we you know this is a very special experience in and of itself</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 夏天我喜欢一杯好的金汤力，比如**Tanqueray**（添加利金酒）金汤力，所以我的口味相当灵活。

<details>

<p class="english-text">so we have all the way of that all the way to you know a Johnny Walker red which depending upon the market that you're in and in between you got blue and black we've got black we've got blue we've got green and gold we've got double black we it really spans and and I have to say I've been around marketing for a long time probably one of the most unique brands in the world how much because we span all of that credibly</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 现在，我应该问您最喜欢喝什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">how much more profitable is the expensive version versus the cheap version</p>
</details>

Nicola Tangan: 我其实更喜欢喝葡萄酒，但如果选择你们的产品，那可能是金汤力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">we have great margins across scotch and part of it is um you know look you know it's how you make Scotch so remember for Johnny Walker black um if you want to be selling that uh 10 years from now you better have barreled it and put it in a barrel two years ago so it's a 12-year-old scotch and you know we have a a you know quite a competitive mode around that because of you know we're very good at blending and Distilling we're very good at maturing we're very good at bottling we're very good at getting this out around the world so our margins across Scotch are you know are very good whether we're selling it because remember if you're this like Johnny Walker red is not in a barrel for 12 years it's in a barrel for much less time so therefore all of these prices kind of correspond to you know what we've put into the product</p>
</details>

Nicola Tangan: 旅行时会有影响吗？不，主要是夏天，但不常喝。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so I think that's so uh interesting so when uh in the past when I studied this industry uh you kind of differentiate between white spirits and brown Spirits</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 您的夏天，但不常喝。好吧，我们得努力让您多尝试。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">White Spirit you go from a potato to cash in one week right right you can go I mean you can make V guy in one week right although you can from nothing well the brown the brown Spirits you need to seller and age and you have no sales whilst you do this so you it's you need to have pretty Deep Pockets right</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 完全可以，随时都可以。

### 关税与品牌收购策略

Nicola Tangan: 关税呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yeah and it's a very you know and these are very different businesses but you take something like tequila which is both both a white and a dark spirit M but in Tequila you know you're spending seven years with the the the blue agave plant and then you age it so Reposado is one of our uh fastest growing kind of Don Julios right now and that's actually aged you know at least six months so that process if you think about from the from the seed all the way to you know that's so even in within white Spirits now you've got uh a range of things going on around aging um particularly on on tequila if you think about it that way although Reposado does start to get into more the the dark Spirits it's one of the reasons we're excited about tequila is because it goes from white to dark it goes across occasions Daytime Nighttime you know because his dark Spirits you tend to uh consume those in certain occasions so whiskies rums you tend to consume those in certain occasions and then likewise you know for white Spirits you know those are daytime occasions a lot although you have a good nightclub cocktails too so it you know it is quite interesting this expansion of occasions and where we're seeing drinks and how versatile Spirits is is one of the things</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 是的，我们业务遍及180个国家，是重要的进口商和出口商，所以我们显然热爱自由贸易。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">how loyal are we to Our Brands how loyal yeah we're very loyal you mean what kind of loyalty we see from consumers or yeah I mean like let's say now I'm I'm into one type of drink do I always drink the same thing</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 然而，坦白说，长期以来我们一直在应对各种关税、税费和贸易中断。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I consumers drink in repertoire for sure so and particularly you know I I I was listing some of the Trends we go after there's a whole Trend around exploration and experiences that we see people wanting to try new things and so quite often it's the reason um on trade in the industry is so important often people go with what bartenders recommend or what they see on a menu often people will go in and not really know what they're going to to purchase until they get sort of inspired by by something and that's you know like I said the versatility of spirits is one of the things that gives us a great long runway for growth</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 我们对此持长远眼光，并认为我们肯定能够应对这些挑战。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">what's the brand what's the one brand you would love to have which you haven't got</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 例如，苏格兰威士忌从苏格兰出口到印度多年来一直面临关税和高额税费。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">oh I don't know if I'm going to answer that because you're going to buy it soon right I was going to say you don't want to you don't want to prepare anyone</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 毫无疑问，它们会造成短期干扰，而最难规划的可能是这种不确定性，因为在你确切知道它们会是什么样子之前，很难缓解这些影响。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">do you think uh do you think about it like a portfolio like we think about the portfolio of companies we own do you think about your Brands like that</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 所以，我们显然对此保持密切关注，但从长远来看，我们完全能够缓解这些影响，我们知道该怎么做。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">well we do I mean you know because this comes back to you want to be quite precise in your marketing so we have kind of the consumer Choice framework to where we see um like as we're expanding tequila around the world we see certain markets that we think are ready more or less ready for that right um but we also have a market growth framework as well that we look at markets that same way of just in general taking a look at the market and the you know the tax the regulatory uh the profitability that we can get out of the market and and we make those type of strategic allocations upfront as well to say um you know look there's certain bets you're placing for 10 years from now you know you look at we just opened up uh un 12 which is our Chinese whiskey Distillery um you know these are these are 10year bets that you're doing in something like that compared to you know we know that in the next you know couple of years we're seeing a lot more opportunity in some of the developed markets um because we're seeing kind of faster recovery um potentially coming out of some of of some of those markets in some of those areas</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 这更多的是关于如何应对短期挑战，以及如何缓解这些影响。

Nicola Tangan: 当你们收购品牌时，比如你们从乔治·克鲁尼（George Clooney）那里收购了一个龙舌兰酒品牌，我想你们支付了10亿美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yeah so if I if I came in I start to work what kind of things I would I would observe</p>
</details>

Nicola Tangan: 是的，他做得很好。你们什么时候收购品牌？什么时候建立品牌？如何决定？有哪些考量因素？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yeah well we always say you know we've got 30,000 brand builders whether you're in Supply marketing Finance HR everyone is quite focused on Our Brands and building our brands</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 是的，我们做得很好，这对我们来说是一个很棒的品牌，双赢。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">people love the history um we have a lot of passion around Our Brands and so if you look at our you kind of got a bar on each floor here right Nell we do we have and a shop in it's not on each floor but we do have more than one bar in the office so yeah so I mean people love it and it's but we've got four values we that that are very much I think help describe our culture we're passionate about consumers and customers value each other we're very collaborative culture uh proud of what we do I think we're very proud not only of Our Brands but also things that we do in the community you know around sustainability you know Etc</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 我们拥有130亿美元的品牌，在许多品类中都位居第一或第二，所以我非常喜欢我们的产品组合。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and then there is one value that so actually when I came in as um a COO and then uh was announced I would be CEO I actually went out to a bunch of our senior leaders not the executive team but a couple layers down and asked them to help me sort of assess our culture and values in various markets and across functions around the world in an effort to kind of reignite and sort of strengthen the culture</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 话虽如此，我们确实会寻找那些我们可能没有足够强大品牌或没有品牌的领域，因为我们也覆盖了不同的价格区间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and there was one value that as they looked at we had a value called be the best which sounds great on the surface um and there's many great things about it but it was creating a bit of a culture of perfection um if it wasn't the best you know bad news didn't travel as fast um when you think about wanting to you know consumers move fast today it's kind of a volatile World needing Speed and Agility in the culture we felt like be the best was undermining us so we actually changed that to be better and subsequently rolled out behind some behaviors that would help us uh so we called them behavioral dialup how would we be better as a you know from a cultural standpoint it was about being externally focused collaborating but we put the word efficiently behind it so continuing to collaborate but having the right only the right people in the room instead of having kind of to get gain agreement from a cast of thousands before you would do something um act decisively was part of it as well um experimenting and learning</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 有时我们觉得没有足够高端的品牌，或者像在非酒精领域，我们最近收购了美国的**Ritual**。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">have you seen changes on the back of this</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 我们在英国有一个重要的非酒精品牌**Seedlip**，但在美国，**Ritual**品牌涵盖了龙舌兰酒替代品、金酒替代品、威士忌替代品等。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">we have um it's it's difficult it's difficult to change corpor culture is um but we've changed you know what was great about it though I will say is this didn't come from me pushing this out or the executive team this actually came from across our organization this is what they wanted to change and that it's taking some of the best of be the best but also injecting kind of learning and continuous Improvement in it</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 所以，我们觉得我们没有能够覆盖这个领域的产品，因此我们出去收购了它。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so like we've changed some of our Global processes like Innovation where you know we had kind of the classic five kind of stage Innovation that particularly for things that are less risk we've gotten that down to two it's only two stages and it's we've really cut down on the number of people that have to weigh in it's helping us get Innovation out faster</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 同样，我们也剥离了一些品牌，比如我们在印度剥离了一些价值和大众价格点的品牌，因为我们看到了长期的**高端化**趋势，而这部分产品组合虽然销量很大，但并不一定能推动未来的增长。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so how much F how much how much faster do you launch new products now do you think that</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 所以在收购方面，我们寻找我们没有的领域，但坦白说，大多数领域我们都可以用自己的品牌去争取。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">well in that compared to the old we we were able to take out almost a year from some of our processes I mean that tells you something because some of these take longer you know when you're doing a big kind of breakthrough Innovation it's one thing but if you're doing we had that same process for almost everything and so therefore you know that's allowed us to take that out we're also failing faster and learning because this comes back to you don't have to be not everything will work and if we can fail fast and sort of learn from it and adapt um and actually we celebrate some of those now you know it's like this isn't working and here's what we learned from it and we're moving on</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 我们有一个消费者选择框架来帮助我们，它会关注这些社交趋势，我们追踪37个市场，查看大约2.2亿个消费场合，了解人们在喝什么、和谁一起喝、如何喝，因为它既关注社交活动，也关注人们正在做什么。

### 数据驱动的营销与消费者洞察

Nicola Tangan: 你们如何利用这些分析？你们拥有如此惊人的数据，我们可能需要在这里提一下，您有情报部门的背景，所以您非常擅长处理数据。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">tell me something that didn't work a launch that didn't work which we supp total Fiasco we just had because we just had a a meeting on this um and we we celebrated it much like if you've heard of uh you know Dia deos muos The Day of the Dead you celebrate those things that you've killed um and so you know we've got a um a a ready to to drink Margarita that we had a brand on it um a straw that it was just kind of it just didn't work and so it was you know there was a poem read out about it what went wrong and then we all thanked it for what it had done for us and we were moving on you you know and we had you know there was kind of a a scroll of these that we have but it's you know it was quite a great way um this was at our senior leader meeting that we could sort of celebrate that we're out there experimenting and learning and moving on and by the way we've got a great we're launching KAS Amigos ready to drink in a can we've learned a lot from the prior launch and you know it enables you to just move on</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 是的，我确实喜欢数据，我热爱数据，我喜欢它因为它能帮助我们进行精准营销。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">have you had any big surprises on the upside um and the reason why I'm ask you I read this book about this drink which scored unbelievably badly on taste and it was then launched at a very high price per you know with small cans and is now one of the biggest sellers in the world is Red Bull</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 当你做得正确时，在正确的时间将正确的品牌呈现给正确的人，那种体验会提升整个消费体验，这正是我们努力的目标，我们试图提升这些时刻。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yeah I mean uh the tasting notes were just unbelievably bad yeah and so it's kind of shocking that it's taking taken the world right</p>
</details>

Nicola Tangan: 你们有2.2亿个数据点，你们如何利用这些数据？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">have you had any like big surprises where you thought this is not going to particularly work and then suddenly Bang</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 首先，它帮助我们发现最佳机会，我们将这些机会与最佳品牌结合起来，确保我们在特定场合进行营销，并为人们提供最佳的服务选择。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah I mean look I think um you know it's you know it's interesting because what you do have is a lot of times um you know there are things that when we launch it I think will do better or worse and so you do get surprised sometimes something that you think is going to do really well and then it just doesn't get you know it doesn't get the upt and then you know vice versa</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 它帮助我们更精确地知道该往哪里去，尤其是在当前这种波动较大、消费者面临压力的时刻。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um I'm trying to think if there's anything in you know that I've kind of seen lately that has really surprised me I you know I think you know quite often one of the most important things is to get things right kind of end to end and so sometimes you know it is about getting the system behind it it's about getting great brand work out to explain what what it what it is</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 当我们做得正确时，消费者愿意花钱，因为他们看到了价值，并且他们得到了他们想要的优质产品。

### 尊尼获加的产品架构与盈利能力

Nicola Tangan: 那么，我们举个例子，**Johnny Walker**（尊尼获加威士忌），你们有不同价格点的尊尼获加产品，它的产品架构是怎样的？你们如何考虑它？最贵的尊尼获加是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um you know I think I've been surprised by just how well um things like you know Reposado is doing not that Reposado tequila isn't great but it's just it's been amazing how this is all of a sudden taken over kind of the world even more so than like AO which actually is aged a little bit longer and kind of has you know what in my opinion is a little bit smoother tasting note but you know but that seems to be the one that's really hitting it for consumers so I think sometimes you can't you just can't judge what is what is going to be really amazing although there will be people that will say I know exactly why and so you know a lot of times you have brand Champions within this the system that kind of you know keep plugging through</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 是的，我们刚刚推出了**The Vault**（金库），您看到了吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um you know we're launching right now we've got a a a Captain Morgan um sweet chili lime oh you know so that's quite an aggressive kind of different taste um but we developed it with Jen Z's and so you know I don't even in many ways I'm thinking I don't even know how to think about that right I'm possibly too old to to judge</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 这是一款为您定制的尊尼获加调和威士忌，享有这项特权的费用是5万英镑，所以它处于顶端，但它是一种围绕尊尼获加的个性化体验。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um smof Tamarindo is another good one where we um this is actually taken over the world and this is one that the Mexico team launched a long time ago I remember when it was coming into the US the US was kind of going well we'll do it as a limited time offer we'll see and then over time that that ended up being a a real favorite it's one of the you know best flavors on smernoff so you do get surprised for sure</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 您可以前往爱丁堡的**Princess Street**（公主街），我们会为您精心调制。

<details>

<p class="english-text">now some people um are kind of Old-Timers in their companies you have experiences from a lot of other consumer goods companies right you've been in craft nesle PepsiCo yeah right absolutely</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 所以，这本身就是一种非常特别的体验。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">how do you weigh the the positives and negatives of having a lot of experience versus being in one company the whole time</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 我们有从**The Vault**一直到**Johnny Walker Red**（尊尼获加红牌）的产品，这取决于您所在的市场，介于两者之间还有蓝牌和黑牌。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yeah I mean think you know we always look and I you know this is a unique industry and so it is it is very important that you have kind of deep industry knowledge in many ways it's also a very local industry so it's very important like it used to be when we would go around the world expanding our Brands it was like kind of expats on the move over time we're seeing you know if great Brands get built with local activation and you know resonating within culture and so having local knowledge is important and so over time we always want to make sure that we've injected enough local kind of experience as well even if they've had to come from outside the industry to kind of build that</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 我们有黑牌、蓝牌、绿牌和金牌，还有双黑牌，产品线非常广泛。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um so we kind of have like a combination of deep Spirits experience local knowledge and then also bringing in new capability</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 我必须说，我从事营销行业很久了，这可能是世界上最独特的品牌之一，因为它能够如此可信地涵盖所有这些产品。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I do think you know as you come in from sometimes other companies there's things that other companies are doing that you can kind of inject into the culture here</p>
</details>

Nicola Tangan: 昂贵版本比便宜版本利润高多少？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">tell me something that you have brought from your your past history inia</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 我们在**Scotch**（苏格兰威士忌）领域拥有丰厚的利润，部分原因在于苏格兰威士忌的制作方式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yeah I think look um you know from working at places like Pepsi and you know um you know our our new CFO is is from Coke you know one of the things that's really popular right now are smaller sizes</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 记住，对于**Johnny Walker Black**，如果你想在十年后销售它，你最好在两年前就已经将其装桶，所以它是一款12年陈酿的苏格兰威士忌。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">smaller sizes in the industry used to be thought of is kind of only you know these are like think about things like the airline bottles you know these 50 MLS or like a 375 so kind of half the size of a normal bottle of of spirits those are those are driving the growth in the US right now in fact you know and and and they're being driven on premium Brands</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 我们在这方面拥有相当强的竞争优势，因为我们非常擅长调和、蒸馏、陈酿、装瓶以及将其分销到世界各地。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so because the industry used to think about this as a value size we didn't put our premium brands in this now we've got 1942 Don Julio and these little 50 MLS these are so popular I mean they have to they have to put them behind the usually behind the cash register yeah that's because they're easy to steal right well but but still they're not stealing the other 50 MLS you know there it is just and it's not and these are not inexpensive</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 所以我们在苏格兰威士忌上的利润非常可观，无论我们销售的是什么，因为**Johnny Walker Red**不会在桶中陈酿12年，它陈酿的时间要短得多。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but but they've captured you know for one it's capturing this moment of it's a pressured wallet right and sometimes you only have a certain amount of cash um but it's also you know look you you may pay 15 even up up to almost $20 for this but you know but people look at that and go hey it's it's got some cache it's you know it's cute you can dip it over in a in a bottle so everybody knows what you're drinking you know that you so some of these type of things but of course Pepsi and Coke have been doing these various sizes for a long time and I think you know it's those types of things that you know sometimes having those injection of other ideas you need to understand of course the norms and sort of what's Happening underneath of it but you know we have found if you do it well you don't want to take you know you don't want to cheapen these brands in any way but if you still merchandise them well if they're in a nice glass bottle um it's actually meeting consumer needs right now</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 因此，所有这些价格都与我们投入到产品中的成本相对应。

### 烈酒生产的差异化：白烈酒与棕烈酒

Nicola Tangan: 这太有趣了。过去我研究这个行业时，你们会区分**白烈酒**（White Spirits）和**棕烈酒**（Brown Spirits）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">what's your leadership style like</p>
</details>

Nicola Tangan: 白烈酒可以在一周内从土豆变成现金，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yeah I mean um I always think it's hard to describe your own leadership style but if if I ask your colleagues</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 是的，你可以，你可以一周内制作伏特加。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yeah I think look I you know one of the things that I learned so I my first kind of job out of college I was I was in the Army and so very different environment um but I think it has in kind of frankly informed a lot about how I think about leadership</p>
</details>

Nicola Tangan: 而棕烈酒则需要窖藏和陈酿，在此期间没有销售，所以你需要有相当雄厚的资金，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you know when when I took my first job in the Army um you know you walk in you're a you're a brand new lieutenant everybody knows more about everything than what you do and all of a sudden you you figure out really quickly that it's about it's really not about you at all it's actually about making the team better</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 是的，这些是非常不同的业务。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and so um you know it's about how do you get people at their best how do you get the team really working you know in the business world when you come in you tend to get promoted because you do something really well and then all of a sudden you're supervising people now that are doing that same thing so you kind of get functional expertise first</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 但以龙舌兰酒为例，它既是白烈酒也是深色烈酒。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I do think I do always think about kind of leadership first and making sure that what am I doing to get the best out of the team and to maximize the team and so I am you know quite focused on that and it's it's just always been part of you know how I think it should be done</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 在龙舌兰酒方面，你需要花七年时间种植**蓝色龙舌兰**（Blue Agave: 制作龙舌兰酒的主要植物原料），然后进行陈酿。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and so you know that's why you know when you ask me the question about uh what do we look you know uh as as we're hiring people or you know all of those types of things I I try to think about that team Dynamic it's not just one individual you know it is about the team</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 所以，**Reposado**（陈酿龙舌兰酒: 龙舌兰酒的一种，通常在橡木桶中陈酿2个月到1年）是我们目前增长最快的**Don Julio**（唐·胡里奥）系列之一，它至少陈酿了六个月。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">do you think there's a difference between American leadership style and European leadership style</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 如果你从种子开始考虑整个过程，即使在白烈酒中，现在也有很多关于陈酿的事情，尤其是在龙舌兰酒方面。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean yes and no I mean you know there are some Universal truths I think about what people are looking for in a leader you know I think you know people want you know what I'm seeing is more generational differences than I'm seeing sort of geographic differences</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 尽管**Reposado**确实开始进入深色烈酒的范畴，但我们对龙舌兰酒感到兴奋的原因之一是它涵盖了从白到深色，以及白天到夜晚的各种场合。

Debra Crew: 因为深色烈酒，比如威士忌和朗姆酒，你倾向于在某些场合消费，而白烈酒则多用于白天场合，尽管夜店鸡尾酒也很受欢迎。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">do people dare to give you proper feedback</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 这种场合的扩展以及烈酒的多功能性非常有趣，这是我们发展的重要因素之一。

### 消费者品牌忠诚度与探索欲

Nicola Tangan: 我们对品牌有多忠诚？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">oh yeah I always look at feedback as being you know like look they're just trying to help you you know so you go into a meeting you go into an investor meeting as an example and they're like uh you know I would have said it this way versus that or you know so quite kind of that more in the moment kind of feedback or that was really good I think next time if you hear you know people are always nice about how they say it to the boss you know you might want to say this or or that but you know a lot of times as a leader you have to ask for it sure you know some people don't feel as comfortable just kind of putting it out there but I I do always try to ask for it and I try to um you know when I come out of something or you know even I'll tell you last week before our senior leader meeting um you know I always try to test some of the messages to go is this what people are thinking about um just to make sure you know you land your message right</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 是的，我们非常忠诚。您是指我们从消费者那里看到的忠诚度吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">when you look back at your career what are some of the moments which were kind of like changing for you</p>
</details>

Nicola Tangan: 是的，我的意思是，如果我现在喜欢一种饮料，我总是喝同样的东西吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you know probably the most recent one was even uh to kind of come back in you know so I I'd been CEO at rynolds Amer in British American Tobacco bodas and so I had I had left kind of being an executive and I was doing non-ex kind of board work I was doing PE work and um and then I got on the diio board and uh through various conversations you know I now in hindsight I I recognize you know Ivan and jav are both were trying to prod me into perhaps coming back as an exact it was a big decision I had to unwind a lot of things that I you know you set up board workor and you you're involved in various you know PE type of um uh you know roles and and so backing out from that and then uh you know coming back into to an exec and and really kind of taking a step back right because I had been a CEO and so then you know coming in uh you know as president of North America and uh so really kind of backing up but I I felt it was important because you this is a different industry and you got to get to learn the industry right</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 消费者肯定会根据自己的喜好选择饮品。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and so um did you have any did you have any mentors who helped you absolutely what's the key to good mentorship</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 特别是，我列举了一些我们追求的趋势，其中有一个关于探索和体验的完整趋势，我们看到人们渴望尝试新事物。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yeah I think and I've had a lot of different mentors through my through my life that I've used at various times um The MENTOR that I'm using a lot right now so Susan Cameron who I was who I followed at Reynolds um was an incredibly successful CEO and um and helped me make that CEO transition and then you know um unfortunately because I you know I didn't get a transition um with Ivan really um it was great to have her to kind of lean on a bit um you know as I was navigating through you know that kind of CEO transition</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 所以，行业内的“在场消费”（on-trade: 指在餐厅、酒吧等场所的消费）非常重要，人们常常会听从调酒师的推荐，或者看菜单上的内容。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think in a mentor it's been helpful to have somebody who really knows me and kind of knows you know so to your point if people don't often get feedback you know or to have someone who will you know who will give you messages that maybe others won't give you um is really important</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 人们常常走进酒吧时并不知道自己要买什么，直到受到某种启发。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and then I you know I I love people with experience you know um uh you know Javier our our our chairman our ex-chairman now um you know knows the industry really well and so you know he is one that you know no doubt I'm going to go to lunch with and continue to you know pick his brain on things</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 正如我所说，烈酒的多功能性是给我们带来巨大增长潜力的因素之一。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so I think when they can provide you sort of um things that you don't know or make you think about things and in a new way but also know you well enough to know how you need to hear it and receive it I think is important</p>
</details>

Nicola Tangan: 有没有哪个品牌是你们很想拥有但还没有的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">when do you wake up in the morning</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 哦，我不知道我是否会回答这个问题，因为你们很快就会去收购它了，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">when do I wake up depends on what time I I travel a lot so sometimes the hours are ridiculous um I'm still uh I like to work out first thing in the morning so I tend to kind of get up early to be able to do that before I go unless I'm taking a really early plane and then I don't work out</p>
</details>

Nicola Tangan: 我本来想说，你不想让任何人有所准备。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">do do do you work out most days</p>
</details>

Nicola Tangan: 你们会像我们考虑公司投资组合一样，考虑你们的品牌组合吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I try to do it at least four times a week I think it's a great way to you know manage kind of stress and I I tend to it's good thinking time actually I'm I'm I like you know I run so it's quite solitary and you're kind of in your own head</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 是的，我们会。我的意思是，这又回到了你希望在营销上非常精准。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and and how do you relax</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 所以我们有消费者选择框架，可以看到，比如当我们把龙舌兰酒推广到世界各地时，我们认为某些市场或多或少已经准备好了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I like to read and I read for fun I don't read terribly sophisticated books this is fiction this is fun um you know it really is more of an escape almost</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 但我们也有一个市场增长框架，我们以同样的方式看待市场，总体上考察市场、税收、监管以及我们能从市场中获得的盈利能力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um so and then you know I like I mean look I you know I do like to sort of travel and and see things it's hard when you're traveling for work you know sometimes you go into a market and you're like I could have been anywhere you know I was just in a hotel so I do try to see things along the way that you know um if I can you know when I was in China I went to go see you know the panda Reserve you know like I like to you know take a moment to really enjoy uh you know the world and what's out there</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 我们也会提前进行这类战略性分配，比如，有些投资是针对十年后的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">what kind of advice would you give to young people</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 比如，我们刚刚开设了**UN 12**，这是我们的中国威士忌酿酒厂，这些都是十年期的投资。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yeah you know I've been I recognize I'm really fortunate in that I uh my mom and dad you know I was raised to kind of think I could do anything I mean it was like all possibilities were open and I know a lot of people don't have that you know so I feel quite privileged in that</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 相比之下，我们知道在未来几年，一些发达市场会有更多机会，因为我们看到这些市场的一些领域可能会更快复苏。

### 公司文化与价值观重塑

Nicola Tangan: 换个话题，帝亚吉欧的企业文化是怎样的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">that being said I know when I you know I think as as a kid and growing up and you know I always gravitated towards things I was just sort of naturally good at um um and then when I went into the army all of a sudden I was asked to do a lot of things I didn't know how to do and quite frankly I was terrible at it at first um I wasn't very athletic at the time I certainly didn't know how to shoot anything I didn't you know like these were very different tasks</p>
</details>

Nicola Tangan: 如果我来这里工作，我会观察到哪些事情？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and um but on the other side of that you know ultimately I learned I got you know I got pretty decent at it and and so that gives you an incredible amount of confidence and sort of resilience</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 是的，我们总是说，我们有3万名品牌建设者，无论您在供应链、营销、财务还是人力资源部门，每个人都非常专注于我们的品牌和品牌建设。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so you're not a good shooter</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 人们热爱历史，我们对品牌充满热情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I I actually am a really good shot it's a surprise but I am</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 如果您看看我们的办公室，这里每层楼都有一个酒吧，对吧，尼尔？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but it is one of those things that I think the the amount of resilience and confidence that that has given me later in life of like and so I you know I always tell people try new things try things that kind of scare you a little bit because you might you're going to surprise yourself more often than not and get beyond that and I think that can be an incredible source of confidence and grit which I think you know is really important in this world</p>
</details>

Nicola Tangan: 是的，我们有，而且还有一个商店。不是每层楼都有，但办公室里确实不止一个酒吧。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">well deah it's been great having you on should we um hit the bar and try out some new thanks</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 是的，人们很喜欢。我们有四个价值观，我认为它们很好地描述了我们的文化：我们对消费者和客户充满热情，彼此珍视，我们是非常协作的文化，为我们所做的一切感到自豪。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">absolutely I need to get you to try something Beyond wine wonderful thank you so much thanks</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 我认为我们不仅为自己的品牌感到自豪，也为我们在社区中，比如在可持续发展等方面所做的事情感到自豪。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">[Music]</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 还有一个价值观。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 当我担任首席运营官（COO）并被宣布将成为首席执行官（CEO）时，我实际上召集了许多高级领导，而不是执行团队，而是下两级的人员，请他们帮助我评估我们在全球不同市场和职能部门的文化和价值观，以期重新激发和加强文化。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 他们审视后发现，我们有一个名为“**Be the best**”（做到最好）的价值观，表面上听起来很棒，也有很多优点，但它却在某种程度上造成了一种追求完美的文化。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 如果不是最好的，坏消息就不会传播得那么快。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 当你想到消费者今天行动迅速，世界充满变数，文化需要速度和敏捷性时，我们觉得“**Be the best**”正在削弱我们。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 所以我们实际上将其改为“**Be better**”（变得更好），并随后推出了一些有助于我们的行为，我们称之为“行为拨号”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 从文化角度来看，我们如何变得更好？这关乎以外部为导向，进行协作，但我们在协作后面加上了“高效”一词。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 所以是持续协作，但会议室里只有合适的人，而不是在做任何事情之前需要征得成千上万人的同意。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 果断行动也是其中一部分，还有实验和学习。

### 产品创新与从失败中学习

Nicola Tangan: 你们是否看到了这些改变带来的变化？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 是的，我们看到了。改变企业文化是困难的，但我们确实改变了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 但我要说，最棒的是，这并不是我或执行团队推动的，而是来自我们整个组织内部，这是他们想要改变的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 它汲取了“**Be the best**”的优点，同时也注入了学习和持续改进的理念。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 例如，我们改变了一些全球流程，比如创新流程，我们曾经有经典的五阶段创新流程，特别是对于风险较低的项目，我们现在将其缩减到两个阶段。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 只有两个阶段，我们大大减少了需要参与决策的人数，这有助于我们更快地推出创新产品。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Nicola Tangan: 那么，你们现在推出新产品的速度快了多少？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 与过去相比，我们能够从一些流程中节省出将近一年的时间，这说明了一些问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 因为有些创新需要更长时间，当你进行一项重大的突破性创新时是一回事，但如果我们对几乎所有事情都采用相同的流程，那么我们就能够缩短时间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 我们也在更快地失败和学习，因为这又回到了并非所有事情都会成功，如果我们能够快速失败并从中学习和适应，我们现在甚至会庆祝一些失败。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 比如，这个行不通，我们从中吸取了教训，然后继续前进。

### 意外的成功与多元化经验

Nicola Tangan: 告诉我一个失败的案例，一个完全失败的发布。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 我们刚刚开了一个关于这个的会议，我们庆祝了它，就像您听说过的**Dia de los Muertos**（亡灵节: 墨西哥的传统节日，用于纪念逝去的亲人）一样，你会庆祝那些你已经“杀死”的东西。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 我们有一款即饮的玛格丽塔酒，上面有一个品牌，还有一根吸管，但它就是行不通。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 所以，我们为此朗读了一首诗，讲述了哪里出了问题，然后我们都感谢它为我们所做的一切，然后继续前进。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 我们有一个这样的清单，但这是一个很好的方式，在我们的高级领导会议上，我们可以庆祝我们正在进行实验、学习并继续前进。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 顺便说一句，我们正在推出**Casamigos**（卡萨米戈斯）罐装即饮产品，我们从之前的发布中学到了很多，这让你可以继续前进。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Nicola Tangan: 你们有没有什么意外的惊喜？我读过一本书，讲到一种饮料在口味测试中表现极差，但后来以高价小罐装上市，现在是全球最大的畅销品之一，那就是**Red Bull**（红牛）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 是的，它的口味评价简直糟透了，所以它能风靡全球真是令人震惊。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Nicola Tangan: 你们有没有遇到过这种大惊喜，就是你觉得这东西不会特别成功，然后突然就爆发了？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 是的，我的意思是，很多时候，有些产品我们在推出时，会认为它会表现得更好或更差，所以有时你会感到惊讶。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 有些你认为会做得很好的产品，结果却没有得到认可，反之亦然。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 我在想最近有没有什么真正让我感到惊讶的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 我认为，最重要的事情之一是把事情从头到尾都做好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 所以有时，这关乎建立背后的系统，关乎做好品牌工作来解释产品是什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 我认为，像**Reposado**（陈酿龙舌兰酒）这样的产品表现得如此出色，让我感到惊讶。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 并不是说**Reposado**龙舌兰酒不好，只是它突然间风靡全球，甚至比**Añejo**（特级陈酿龙舌兰酒: 龙舌兰酒的一种，通常在橡木桶中陈酿1年以上）更受欢迎，后者陈酿时间更长，在我看来口感更顺滑。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 但**Reposado**似乎才是真正打动消费者的产品。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 所以，我认为有时你无法判断什么会真正令人惊艳，尽管总会有人说他们确切知道原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 很多时候，系统内部有品牌拥护者会坚持不懈地努力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 我们现在正在推出一款**Captain Morgan Sweet Chili Lime**（摩根船长甜辣青柠朗姆酒），这是一种相当大胆、与众不同的口味，但我们是与Z世代共同开发的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 所以，在很多方面，我甚至不知道该如何看待它，我可能太老了，无法评判。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: **Smirnoff Tamarindo**（斯米诺罗望子伏特加）是另一个很好的例子，它实际上已经风靡全球。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 这是墨西哥团队很久以前推出的产品。我记得它进入美国市场时，美国团队还在想“好吧，我们先作为限时优惠试试看”，然后随着时间的推移，它最终成为了真正的热门产品。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 它是**Smirnoff**（斯米诺伏特加）最好的口味之一。所以你肯定会感到惊讶。

### 经验与本地化洞察

Nicola Tangan: 有些人是公司里的“老员工”，而您在许多其他消费品公司都有经验，比如**Kraft**（卡夫）、**Nestle**（雀巢）、**PepsiCo**（百事公司），对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 没错，绝对是。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Nicola Tangan: 拥有丰富经验和一直待在一家公司，这两者之间的利弊您如何权衡？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 是的，我认为这是一个独特的行业，拥有深厚的行业知识在很多方面都非常重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 它也是一个非常本地化的行业，所以本地知识非常重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 过去，当我们走向世界拓展品牌时，就像是外籍员工在各地流动，但随着时间的推移，我们看到优秀的品牌是通过本地化活动和与当地文化产生共鸣来建立的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 所以拥有本地知识很重要，随着时间的推移，我们总是希望确保我们注入了足够的本地经验，即使他们必须来自行业之外来建立这种经验。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 所以我们结合了深厚的烈酒经验、本地知识，同时引入了新的能力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 我确实认为，当你从其他公司加入时，有些公司正在做的事情可以注入到这里的文化中。

### 从过往经验中汲取灵感：小尺寸包装的成功

Nicola Tangan: 告诉我一些您从过去经历中带到帝亚吉欧的东西。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 是的，我认为，从在百事公司等地工作的经验来看，我们的新首席财务官（CFO）来自可口可乐，现在非常流行的一种趋势是小尺寸包装。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 行业过去认为小尺寸包装只是一种价值尺寸，比如航空公司的50毫升小瓶，或者375毫升（正常烈酒瓶的一半大小）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 这些小尺寸包装现在正在推动美国市场的增长，而且它们是由高端品牌驱动的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 因为行业过去认为这是价值尺寸，我们没有将高端品牌放入其中。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 现在我们有**Don Julio 1942**（唐·胡里奥1942龙舌兰）的50毫升小瓶，它们非常受欢迎，甚至不得不放在收银台后面。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Nicola Tangan: 那是因为它们容易被偷，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 是的，但他们不会偷其他50毫升的酒，而且这些并不便宜。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 但它们抓住了这个时刻，即钱包受压，有时你只有一定数量的现金。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 但它也很有魅力，你知道，你可以花15甚至将近20美元购买，但人们会觉得它很有格调，很可爱，你可以把它倒进瓶子里，这样每个人都知道你在喝什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 当然，百事和可口可乐长期以来一直在做这些各种尺寸的产品。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 我认为，正是这些类型的想法，有时注入其他公司的想法，你需要了解其背后的规范和正在发生的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 但我们发现，如果你做得好，你不想以任何方式贬低这些品牌，但如果你仍然很好地销售它们，如果它们装在漂亮的玻璃瓶中，它实际上正在满足当前的消费者需求。

### 领导力风格与团队建设

Nicola Tangan: 您的领导风格是怎样的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 我总是觉得很难描述自己的领导风格，但如果我问您的同事呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 是的，我认为，我学到的一件事是，我大学毕业后的第一份工作是在军队，那是一个非常不同的环境。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 但坦白说，它在很大程度上影响了我对领导力的看法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 当我第一次在军队工作时，你作为一名全新的中尉走进去，每个人都比你更了解一切。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 然后你很快就会发现，这真的不是关于你，而是关于如何让团队变得更好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 所以，这关乎如何让人们发挥出最佳水平，如何让团队真正发挥作用。

Debra Crew: 在商业世界中，你之所以获得晋升，往往是因为你做得非常好，然后突然间你开始管理那些做同样事情的人，所以你首先获得的是职能专长。

<details>

<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 我确实总是首先考虑领导力，并确保我正在做些什么来最大化团队的潜力，所以我非常专注于此，这始终是我认为应该做的事情的一部分。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 所以，当你问我关于我们招聘人才时会看重什么，或者所有这些事情时，我都会努力思考团队的动态，这不仅仅是关于个人，而是关于团队。

### 领导力中的代际差异

Nicola Tangan: 您认为美国领导风格和欧洲领导风格之间有区别吗？

<details>

<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 我的意思是，有也有没有。我认为关于人们在领导者身上寻找什么，有一些普遍的真理。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 我认为我看到的更多是代际差异，而不是地域差异。

<details>

<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 我发现年轻人更希望与你共度更多时间，他们真的希望，就像我成长过程中，我有点希望我的老板能让我一个人待着。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 但现在你看到更多的是，总是我们的年轻同事在会议中提出第一个问题，他们希望更深入、更亲密地了解你。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 我认为这是社交媒体的影响，他们习惯于消费和了解一个人的很多信息。

<details>

<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 所以，这可能是我看到的更大的差异，而不是地域差异。

### 反馈、职业生涯转折点与导师

Nicola Tangan: 人们敢于给您适当的反馈吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 哦，是的，我总是把反馈看作是，他们只是想帮助你。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 比如，你参加一个会议，或者一个投资者会议，他们会说：“嗯，我可能会这样说，而不是那样说”，或者“那真的很好，我想下次如果你听到，人们总是很客气地对老板说，你可能想说这个或那个。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 但很多时候，作为领导者，你必须主动寻求反馈。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 当然，有些人不太愿意直接提出来，但我总是努力寻求反馈，并且，当我完成某项工作后，或者甚至上周在我们的高级领导会议之前，我总是会尝试测试一些信息，看看这是否是人们正在思考的问题，只是为了确保你的信息传达正确。

<details>

Nicola Tangan: 回顾您的职业生涯，有哪些时刻对您来说是转折点？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 最近的一个可能就是重新回到这个行业。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 我曾在**Reynolds American**（雷诺美国）和**British American Tobacco**（英美烟草）担任首席执行官，然后我离开了高管职位，从事非执行董事会工作和私募股权（PE）工作。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 后来我加入了帝亚吉欧董事会，通过各种对话，现在回想起来，我意识到**Ivan**（伊万）和**Javier**（哈维尔）都在试图促使我重新担任高管。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 这是一个重大的决定，我不得不解除很多事情，比如你已经安排好的董事会工作，以及参与各种私募股权类型的角色。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 所以，退出这些，然后重新担任高管，并且实际上是退后一步，因为我曾经是首席执行官。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 然后，作为北美区总裁加入，确实是退后了一步，但我认为这很重要，因为这是一个不同的行业，你必须学习这个行业。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Nicola Tangan: 那么，您有没有导师帮助过您？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 绝对有。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Nicola Tangan: 良好导师制的关键是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 是的，我认为我一生中有很多不同的导师，在不同时期都曾向他们请教。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 我现在经常请教的导师是**Susan Cameron**（苏珊·卡梅隆），我曾在雷诺美国接替她的职位，她是一位非常成功的首席执行官，帮助我完成了首席执行官的过渡。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 然后，不幸的是，因为我没有真正与伊万进行过渡，所以能有她作为依靠，在我应对首席执行官过渡时，非常有帮助。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 我认为在导师方面，有一个真正了解我的人，并且了解，就像您说的，如果人们不经常得到反馈，或者有一个人会给你别人可能不会给你的信息，这真的非常重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 然后，我喜欢有经验的人，比如我们的前董事长**Javier Ferrán**（哈维尔·费兰），他非常了解这个行业。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 所以，毫无疑问，我还会和他共进午餐，继续向他请教一些事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 所以我认为，当他们能够为你提供你不知道的东西，或者让你以新的方式思考问题，同时又足够了解你，知道你需要如何听到和接受这些信息时，这很重要。

### 个人习惯与给年轻人的建议

Nicola Tangan: 您早上什么时候起床？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 我什么时候起床取决于我旅行的时间，有时时间很荒谬。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 我仍然喜欢早上第一件事就是锻炼，所以我倾向于早起完成锻炼，除非我赶很早的飞机，那样我就不锻炼了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Nicola Tangan: 您大部分时间都锻炼吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 我尽量每周至少锻炼四次，我认为这是管理压力很好的方式，而且我倾向于认为这是很好的思考时间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 我喜欢跑步，所以这很孤独，你独自一人沉浸在自己的思绪中。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Nicola Tangan: 您如何放松？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 我喜欢阅读，我为乐趣而阅读，我不读那些非常复杂的书，这是小说，很有趣。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 它更像是一种逃避。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 然后，我喜欢旅行和看东西。当你因工作出差时，这很难，有时你进入一个市场，你会觉得“我可能去过任何地方”，你知道，我只是在一个酒店里。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 所以我确实会尝试沿途看看东西，如果可以的话，比如我在中国的时候，我去了熊猫保护区。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 我喜欢花点时间真正享受世界和外面的一切。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Nicola Tangan: 您会给年轻人什么建议？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 是的，我意识到我很幸运，我的父母让我觉得我什么都能做，所有的可能性都敞开着。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 我知道很多人没有这样的条件，所以我对此感到非常荣幸。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 话虽如此，我知道当我还是个孩子，在成长过程中，我总是倾向于那些我天生擅长的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 然后当我参军时，突然间我被要求做很多我不知道如何做的事情，坦白说，一开始我做得一塌糊涂。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 那时我不太擅长运动，我当然不知道如何射击，我不知道，这些都是非常不同的任务。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 但另一方面，我最终学会了，我做得相当不错，这给了我难以置信的自信和韧性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Nicola Tangan: 所以您不是一个好射手？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 我实际上是一个非常好的射手，这很令人惊讶，但我确实是。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 但我认为，这种韧性和自信在我后来的生活中给予了我巨大的帮助。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 所以我总是告诉人们，尝试新事物，尝试那些让你有点害怕的事情，因为你往往会给自己带来惊喜，并超越自己。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 我认为这可以成为自信和毅力的巨大来源，我认为这在这个世界上非常重要。

<details>

<p class="english-text"></p>

Nicola Tangan: 黛布拉，很高兴能邀请到您。我们要不要去酒吧尝试一些新东西？

<details>

<p class="english-text"></p>
</details>

Debra Crew: 绝对要！我需要让您尝试一些葡萄酒以外的东西。
