title: 接纳人性的复杂性：超越“容忍”，拥抱内在的阴暗面
summary: 本文深入探讨了如何真正接纳人性的复杂性，包括其光明面与阴暗面。作者指出，真正的接纳并非传统文化中基于实用利益的“容忍”，而是一种纯粹的、无条件的精神理解。文章分析了人们为何害怕体验负面情绪，以及将内心想法等同于实际行为的心理误区。通过区分内在世界与外部现实，鼓励个体勇敢探索自我，实现精神整合，并将其视为一种高级审美体验和自我成长的过程。

### 引言：接纳人性的复杂性

大家好，我是Anthony。欢迎来到我的频道。今天的视频，我们继续来聊聊如何接纳人性的复杂性。在4月19日的视频中，我们讨论了**无条件之爱**（Unconditional Love: 一种不基于特定品质或能力的爱，而是接纳对方的整体复杂性和可能性）是如何可能的。我们当时说，无条件之爱不仅仅是爱对方特定的品质或能力，我们应该爱这种品质背后蕴含的复杂性和可能性，并鼓励这种可能性。当然，你能看到并爱上另一个人的复杂性，首先是因为你已经接纳了自己的复杂性。这种建立在复杂性之上的爱，超越了我们对爱的普遍理解。

<p class="english-text">Hello everyone, I am Anthony. Welcome to my channel. Today's video, let’s continue to talk about how to accept the complexity of people. In the video on April 19th, we discussed how unconditional love is possible. We said at that time, unconditional love is not just about loving the specific qualities or abilities of the other person. We should love this quality, the complexity and possibilities behind it, and encourage this possibility. Certainly, you can see and love the complexity of another person, firstly, because you have accepted your complexity. This love built on complexity is beyond our general understanding of love.</p>
</details>

普遍意义上的爱，通常是建立在特定的道德品质或能力之上的。例如，我爱她的善良和富有同情心，我钦佩她深刻的思想和价值观等等。这些当然都是有价值的品质，然而，这些都是**现象**（Phenomenal: 指外在可观察的、具体的特质或能力）层面的。在这些现象之上，人类还拥有一种**本体论道德**（Ontological Morality: 指一种持续的自我探索过程，而非基于特定现象或外在行为的道德评判），它是一个持续的自我探索过程。这种探索可能会让一个人变得越来越复杂，甚至否定自己原有的想法，使得当事人更加困惑。但这种变化和复杂性，才是一个人最深层、最内在的部分。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">General understanding of love is often based on specific moral qualities or abilities. For example, I love her kindness and compassion; I admire her for her profound thoughts and values, etc. These are certainly valuable qualities. However, these are phenomenal. On top of these phenomena, humans also have a kind of ontological morality, which is a continuous process of self-exploration. This exploration may make a person more and more complicated, even denying your own ideas, making the parties more confused. But this change and complexity is the deepest and innermost part of a person.</p>
</details>

然而，那期视频我们只是讨论了一个框架，其中还有许多问题值得详细讨论。例如，有位网友在评论区留言说：“你说要对经验保持开放友善和接纳的态度，但如果经验本身是不道德的呢？比如欺骗、谎言、背叛等。”确实，当我们说我们需要接纳人性的复杂性时，我们绝不能只接纳人性的光明面，而必须包括其阴暗面。甚至可以说，这阴暗面才是复杂性的真正含义。所以我们使用“接纳”这个词，也是为了避免在心理上对好坏、对错做出潜意识的道德判断。那么，可能有人会问，这种接纳会不会毫无底线地纵容人们的阴暗面呢？在这期视频中，我们将详细讨论这些话题。在视频开始前，我想说，如果你有任何想与我讨论和咨询的话题，可以通过我的邮箱预约。

<details>

<p class="english-text">But that video, we just discussed a framework. There are many issues worth discussing in detail. For example, one netizen said in the comment section, "You said to be open and friendly to experience and an attitude of acceptance, but what if the experience itself is immoral? Such as cheating, lies, betrayal, etc." Indeed, when we say we need to accept the complexity of people, we must not just accept the bright side of people, and it must include the shadow side. Even this side of the shadow, this is the true meaning of complexity. So we use the word "acceptance" to avoid making subconscious moral judgments about good and bad, right and wrong in psychology. Then someone might ask, will this acceptance indulge people's dark side without any bottom line? In this video we will discuss these topics in detail. Before the video starts, let me say, if you have anything you want to discuss with me and consulting topics, you can contact my email to make an appointment.</p>

### 区分“容忍”与“接纳”：超越实用主义

那么，让我们回到今天的话题。实际上，这个话题并不容易理解，因为它不是一个纯粹通过逻辑和推理就能理解的问题，它需要大量的内在体验。当然，还有另一个原因，我们日常生活中使用的语言很容易混淆问题，比如“爱”、“容忍”和“理解”这些词在我们的生活中出现得过于频繁，很容易导致一种空洞感。例如，“你得学会接纳和容忍自己的不完美。”这句话中的“容忍”和“接纳”，实际上与我所说的含义恰恰相反。我们这里所说的爱、理解和接纳，与普遍意义上的容忍和理解是不同的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So let's get back to today's topic. In fact, this topic is not easy to understand, because it is not a matter of pure logic and reasoning that can be understood. It requires a lot of inner experience. Of course there is another reason: the language we use in daily life, it's easy to confuse the issue. Like love, tolerance and understanding, these words appear too frequently in our lives. It can easily lead to a feeling of emptiness and hollowness. For example, "You have to learn to accept and tolerate your imperfections." The tolerance and acceptance in this sentence, in fact, it is the exact opposite of what I meant. What we mean here is love, understanding and acceptance, it is different from the general sense of tolerance and understanding.</p>
</details>

普遍意义上的理解和容忍，通常是将容忍作为一种实现实际利益的手段。传统中国文化中所理解的宽恕和容忍，基本上就是如此。例如，在**《论语》**（Analects of Confucius: 儒家经典，记录了孔子及其弟子的言行）中，有弟子问孔子什么是**仁**（Benevolence: 孔子思想中的核心概念，指人与人之间相互关爱、和谐相处的道德原则），孔子说如果你能做到这五点，即**恭、宽、信、敏、惠**（Gong, Kuan, Xin, Min, Hui: 孔子在《论语》中提出的五种品德，分别指庄重、宽厚、诚信、勤敏和仁惠），也就是所谓的“恭则不侮，宽则得众，信则人任，敏则有功，惠则足以使人”。孔子的意思是，宽厚可以赢得人心、广受欢迎，施惠于人是为了能够利用他们。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">General understanding and tolerance is usually tolerance as a means to achieve practical benefits. Forgiveness and tolerance as understood in traditional Chinese culture, it's basically like this. For example, in the Analects of Confucius, a disciple asked Confucius what is benevolence. Confucius said that if you can do these five things: Gong, Kuan, Xin, Min, Hui. The so-called "respect does not insult, widespread wins the crowd, trustworthy people, being sensitive leads to success, benefits are enough to make people." Confucius meant generosity can win people's hearts, popularity, do favors to others so that you can use them.</p>
</details>

因此，中国文化中的容忍，并非源于一种超验的、无条件的精神理解，而是深深植根于伦理等级和关系网络之中，在实用利益的语境下，更多是一种策略性的“容忍”，其目的是为了维护秩序、获取忠诚，或避免破坏人际和谐。例如，在**《贞观政要》**（Zhenguan Zhengyao: 一部记载唐太宗李世民及其臣子言行的政论性史书）中，经常提到**李世民**（Li Shimin: 唐朝第二位皇帝，开创“贞观之治”）如何“以德服人”、“宽容纳谏”。又如在**《三国演义》**（Romance of the Three Kingdoms: 中国古典四大名著之一，讲述了三国时期的历史故事）中，无论是**刘备**（Liu Bei: 三国时期蜀汉的开国皇帝）还是**曹操**（Cao Cao: 三国时期曹魏政权的奠基者），都有过大量对敌人的“容忍”行为，但这种容忍纯粹是为了收买人心，本质上是帝王之术的一部分，是一种情感投资，它不具备对个体深层的共情和对精神复杂性的认可。儒家的**恕道**（Way of Loyalty and Forgiveness: 儒家伦理中的重要原则，即“己所不欲，勿施于人”，强调推己及人、宽恕待人），所谓“己所不欲，勿施于人”，其出发点仍然是约束自己的外在行为，而不是进入他人的内在体验，最终目的是维护群体秩序的稳定与和谐。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Therefore, tolerance in Chinese culture is not from a transcendent, unconditional spiritual understanding. Rather, it is deeply embedded in ethical hierarchies and networks of relationships. In the context of practical benefits, it is more of a strategic "tolerance." The purpose is to maintain order and gain loyalty or avoid destroying interpersonal harmony. For example, in "Zhenguan Zhengyao," it is often mentioned how Li Shimin "conquered people with virtue," "tolerance and tolerance of criticism." For example, in Romance of the Three Kingdoms, whether it is Liu Bei or Cao Cao, there have been a lot of acts of tolerance towards the enemy. But this kind of tolerance is purely to buy people's hearts. It is essentially part of the art of ruling. It’s an emotional investment. It does not have any deep empathy for individuals and recognition of spiritual complexity. The Confucian Way of Loyalty and Forgiveness, as the saying goes, "Do not do to others what you do not want others to do to you." The starting point is still to restrain your external behavior, rather than entering into the inner experience of others. The ultimate goal is to maintain stability and harmony of group order.</p>
</details>

### 内在理解与现实责任：康德的洞见

另一种常见的对容忍和理解的混淆，是将其导向特定的行为。例如，一个孩子有一个脾气不好的父亲，他向母亲抱怨，母亲告诉他：“你得理解你父亲的难处。”这里的“理解”并不是一种心理上的理解，它意味着你在行为层面要更听话、更顺从，不要抱怨。又或者，另一个人伤害了你，他说：“你得理解我的难处，原谅我。”这同样是让你在现实层面做出妥协和牺牲。只要你在现实中做到了，他并不关心你如何理解。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Another common confusion between tolerance and understanding, it is directed towards specific behavior. For example, a child has a father with a bad temper. He complained to his mother. Mom told him, "You have to understand your father's difficulties." The understanding here, it is not a psychological understanding. It means that you are at the behavioral level, be more obedient and submissive, don't complain. Another person hurts you. He said, "You have to understand my difficulties, to forgive me." This is also to make you compromise and sacrifice on a practical level. As long as you do this in reality, he doesn't care how you understand it.</p>
</details>

我们这里所说的理解和接纳，是一种纯粹的精神理解和看见，它不能作为伦理或法律的基础，也不是一种义务。我理解为什么有人会犯罪，但这种心理上的理解，不能作为对方逃脱罪责的理由或证据。这只是我个人的洞察，一种不必然触及或改变现实的伦理。这类似于**康德**（Kant: 德国著名哲学家，启蒙运动时期最重要的思想家之一）在《什么是启蒙？》（What is Enlightenment?: 康德于1784年发表的著名哲学文章）中所说的两种运用理性的方式。康德认为，在现实中，我们常常需要以特定的社会身份，保持“**私人运用理性**”（Private Use of Reason: 康德哲学概念，指个体在特定社会角色中，为维护秩序而必须遵循规则和妥协的行为），也就是说，有时你需要在行为上服从和妥协，不得不执行一些我们自己并不认同的制度和规则。但与此同时，作为一个人，一个世界公民，我们应该拥有追求真理和自由的权利，即“**公共运用理性**”（Public Use of Reason: 康德哲学概念，指个体作为世界公民，拥有无条件表达思想和追求真理的权利，不立即改变现实但保留精神启蒙空间）的权利。你可以服从命令，但你有权无条件地表达你的思想。这种权利，并不是要立即改变社会制度和规则，它只是为启蒙本身保留了一个精神领地。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What we mean here is understanding and acceptance, it is a purely spiritual understanding and seeing. It cannot be used as an ethical or legal basis. It's not an obligation. I understand why someone commits a crime, but this psychological understanding, it cannot be used as a reason or evidence for the other party to escape guilt. This is just my personal insight, ethics that do not necessarily touch or change reality. This is similar to what Kant said in What is Enlightenment? about two ways of using reason. Kant believes that in reality, we often need to be in a specific social identity, maintain "private use of rationality," that is, sometimes you need to obey and compromise in your behavior, have to implement some systems and rules that we ourselves do not agree with. But at the same time, as a person, a world citizen, we should have the right to truth and freedom, the right to public use of reason. You can obey orders, but you have the right to express your thoughts unconditionally. This right is not to change the social system and rules immediately. It is just to reserve a spiritual territory for enlightenment itself.</p>
</details>

### 接纳的理想状态：罗杰斯的视角

同样，我们所说的这种纯粹的精神理解，指的是一个人可以拥有这样一个空间，他可以在这个空间里表达任何情绪和思想，而不是被道德评判或被心理诊断。他只需要为了自己的目的去表达，而无需感到恐惧。即使这些想法是矛盾的，即使当事人明天就否定了今天的想法，也没有关系。在这个空间里，无论他如何揭示自己的经验，都能得到对方无条件的理解和关注。他拥有这个空间的完全主权。这正是**卡尔·罗杰斯**（Carl Rogers: 美国著名心理学家，人本主义心理学的主要代表人物之一，提出了“以人为中心疗法”和“无条件积极关注”等概念）所说的，当事人每时每刻都成为他自己的一切丰富性和复杂性，不隐藏自己，在自己内在无所畏惧。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Same, this pure spiritual understanding we are talking about refers to a person who can have such a space. He is in this space, you can express any emotion and thought, rather than being judged by morality or diagnosed by psychology. He just needs to express it for his own purpose, no need to feel fear. Even if these ideas are contradictory, even if the person concerned denies today's idea tomorrow, it doesn't matter. In this space, no matter how he reveals his experience, both can get each other's unconditional understanding and attention. He has complete sovereignty in this space. That's exactly what Rogers said, "The person concerned becomes his or her own everything at every moment, all the richness and complexity, no hiding of oneself, be fearless within yourself."</p>
</details>

当然，这是一种理想状态，也非常难以实现。首先，拥有这种能力的人非常少；其次，这样的人不可能在任何时空都能对任何人做到这一点。所以我们说，这种纯粹的精神理解和容忍，并不是亲密关系中的一种义务。我不能要求我身边的每个人都做到这一点。但它可以作为一种值得追求的理想状态。如果你拥有这种能力，那么你将更有可能接纳自己，同时你也能影响你身边的人。这种纯粹的精神理解不与现实挂钩，不寻求立即改变现实，但也因此保留了精神的纯粹性，使得当事人能够完全专注于探索自己的经验，而无需承担现实行动的后果。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Certainly, this is an ideal state. It is also very difficult to achieve. First of all, there are very few people who have this ability. Secondly, such a person cannot exist in any time and space to do this to anyone. So we say, this kind of pure spiritual understanding and tolerance, it is not an obligation in a relationship. I can't ask everyone around me to do this. But it can be used as an ideal state worth pursuing. If you have this ability, then you will be more likely to accept yourself. At the same time, you can also affect the people around you. This purely spiritual understanding is not linked to reality. Do not seek to change reality immediately, but it also preserves the spiritual purity, making the parties able to focus completely on exploring one's own experience, without having to bear the consequences of real actions.</p>
</details>

### 自我整合：一种高级的审美体验

就是这样。有些人认为这种状态很美好，但有些人肯定会怀疑，这种接纳和容忍怎么可能呢？它真的不只是一种表演吗？为什么会有人欣赏这种复杂性呢？但我认为，这种欣赏和接纳是一种非常高级的审美体验。我所欣赏的，不是对方混乱的思想，而是当事人流动变化的过程。当一个人处于被接纳的氛围中，当他不断地表达自己时，尽管他的表达可能显得混乱、复杂、矛盾，但随着表达的深入，他的表达仍然趋向于有目的性和系统性。这个目的就是他真实的自我。这种走向真实自我的过程是可爱的。当事人逐渐发现，有些声音看似来自自我，却只是**人格面具**（Personality Mask: 心理学概念，指个体为了适应社会环境或隐藏真实自我而展现出的虚假或不完全的形象）和**防御机制**（Defense Mechanism: 心理学概念，指个体在面对焦虑、冲突或威胁时，无意识地用来保护自我、减轻痛苦的心理策略）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's it. Some people think this state is beautiful, but some people must be skeptical: How is this kind of acceptance and tolerance possible? Is it really not just an act? Why would anyone appreciate this complexity? But I think this appreciation and acceptance, it is a very advanced aesthetic experience. What I appreciate, it's not the other person's messy thoughts. It is the process of the flow of the parties involved. When a person is in an atmosphere of acceptance, when you keep expressing yourself, although his expression may seem chaotic, complex, conflicting, but as the expression deepens, his expression still tends to be purposeful and systematic. This purpose is his true self. This process of moving toward your true self is lovely. The parties gradually discovered, some voices seem to come from the self, it's just a personality mask and a defense mechanism.</p>
</details>

他逐渐能够区分哪些经验来自内心深处，哪些经验是外部植入的结果。最终，他的内心会变得更加有序和连贯，而不是混乱。这个过程对于观察者来说是显而易见的，它本身就可以是一种审美体验，是一种事物变得更纯粹、更符合其目的的过程。例如，原本杂乱无章的物品变得有层次、有秩序，会让人感到被疗愈。音乐与这种人的心理变化非常相似。例如，许多古典音乐的开头都非常压抑、焦虑和不安，它的节奏跳跃，仿佛在探索一些黑暗的情绪。随着音乐的推进，这种旋律变得越来越有层次感和方向性，越来越富有激情。在结尾处，作曲家重新引入了早先出现的旋律，让听众感受到一种归属感和深层的和谐与满足。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">He gradually became able to distinguish what experiences come from deep within, which experiences are the result of external implantation. Eventually his mind will become more orderly and coherent, rather than chaos. This process is obvious to the observer. It can be an aesthetic experience in itself. It's a thing that becomes purer, more in line with your purpose. For example, the originally messy items become layered and orderly, it will make people feel healed. Music is very similar to this psychological change of people. For example, the beginning of many classical music is very depressing, anxious and disturbing. Its rhythm jumps, as if exploring some dark emotions. As the music progresses, this melody becomes more and more layered and directional, more and more passionate. At the end, the composer reintroduced the melody that appeared earlier, make the listener feel a sense of belonging and deep harmony and satisfaction.</p>
</details>

当我们聆听音乐时，仿佛能看到一个人的精神如何一步步展开，经历了各种冲突和变化，最终回归自我，完成了整合。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">When we listen to music, as if I could see how a person's spirit unfolds step by step, experienced various conflicts and changes, finally back to oneself, completed integration.</p>
</details>

### 接纳的本质：双向过程与纯粹好奇

当然，接纳实际上是一个双向过程。一个人对另一个人的复杂性和丰富性的接纳，也指向了自身。当我看到对方生命的丰富性，当我拓宽对方的生命经验时，我也感到我与对方的精神连接更深了。结果就是，我通过这样做，重新确认了自身的独特性和丰富性，以及我与这个世界的深层连接。所以，这种对另一个人的接纳，本质上是平等的，不带有任何附加条件。在这种交流中，最重要的不是我能给对方多少专业知识和建议，而是首先需要一种氛围，即我的精神世界对对方抱有真正的**好奇心**和**兴趣**。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Certainly, acceptance is actually a two-way process. One person to another, acceptance of complexity and richness, it also points to itself. When I see the richness of the other person's life, when you broaden the other person's life experience, I also feel my spiritual connection with the other person is deeper. The result is that I have done this, reaffirmed my own uniqueness and richness, and my deep connection with this world. So this acceptance of another person, equal in nature, there are no additional conditions. In this exchange, the most important thing is not how much professional knowledge and advice can I give to the other party, but first of all, we need an atmosphere, it is my spiritual world towards the other person, have genuine curiosity and interest.</p>
</details>

许多人没有这种好奇心和兴趣，他们满足于用外部标签来预测他人的内心，满足于看到一个贫乏、单调且完全已知的世界。刻板印象常常是真实的，然而，人身上总有许多无法被外部标签预测的未知部分。这些部分往往最值得探索和关注。这种对他人的好奇心和兴趣，远远超越了普遍意义上的心理专业能力，它不是通过简单学习就能提升或改变的，但它却能创造出这种接纳的氛围，是最珍贵的东西。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Many people don’t have this curiosity and interest. They are content to use external labels to predict other people's hearts, content to see a poor, a monotonous and completely known world. Stereotypes are often true. However, there are always many things about people that cannot be predicted by external labels, unknown parts. These parts are often the most worthy of exploration and attention. This curiosity and interest in others, it is far beyond the general sense of psychological professional competence. It is not something that can be improved or changed simply by learning, but it actually creates this atmosphere of acceptance, the most precious thing.</p>
</details>

### 罗杰斯论无畏的自我表达

当我们拥有这种对他人独特性的敏感和兴趣时，我们就能更容易地为对方提供一个安全的氛围来表达自己。我们上面讨论了这种接纳是如何可能的。就是这样。有些人可能会怀疑，这种接纳真的不会让一个人变得更邪恶、更糟糕吗？罗杰斯所说的这种无所畏惧的自由表达，对许多人来说本身就是一件可怕的事情。罗杰斯也意识到了这一点，他也曾说：“我所描述的生命路径，一个更普遍的反应是：成为真实的自我，意味着他会变得坏、邪恶、放纵、具有破坏性，意味着释放某种怪物，在我们的世界中兴风作浪。‘如果我敢于让这些被压抑的情绪流露出来，如果我有机会真正体验那些情绪，这将会引发一场灾难。’”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">When we have this sensitivity and interest in the uniqueness of others, we can give each other more easily, provide a safe atmosphere to express yourself. We discussed above, how is this acceptance possible? That's it. Some people may doubt, this acceptance, it really doesn't make a person more evil, worse? What Rogers said, this fearless freedom of expression, for many people, it's scary in itself. Rogers also realized this. He also said, “The life path I described, a more common response: Becoming one's true self, it means he is bad, evil, unrestrained, destructive. It means to release some kind of monster, making waves in our world. 'If I dare let these suppressed emotions come out, if I had the chance to actually experience those emotions, this will cause a catastrophe.'"</p>
</details>

然而，罗杰斯认为，具有破坏性的并非负面情绪本身，而是对这种情绪的压抑和否认。如果一个人如实地接纳并体验自己的愤怒，那么这种被接纳和转化后的愤怒，将不再具有破坏性，也不会让他崩溃。他可以允许自己体验自己的性感受、懒惰情绪或对他人的敌意，同时他的世界也不会因此崩溃。当然，罗杰斯并没有试图去证明这一点，他只是根据自己的亲身经验告诉读者，接纳自己复杂的感受绝不是一个邪恶的过程。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">However, Rogers believes, it’s not the negative emotions themselves that are destructive. It is the repression and denial of this emotion. If a person accepts and experiences your anger as it is, then this anger that is accepted and transformed, no longer destructive, it won't make him collapse. He can allow himself to experience his sexual feelings, my lazy emotions, or hostility towards others, at the same time, your world will not collapse. Certainly, Rogers didn't try to prove it. He is just telling the readers based on his personal experience, accept your complex emotions, it is by no means an evil process.</p>
</details>

### 摆脱原始恐惧，探索内在自由

但我们为什么会如此害怕体验负面情绪呢？我认为主要原因之一是，许多人将内心产生的感受和想法直接等同于行为。之所以害怕自己的想法，是因为我联想到了将这个想法付诸实践的实际后果，我无法承受这种后果，于是会感到非常恐惧和害怕。确实，在现实世界中，我们需要为自己的行为负责，承担后果，害怕现实的后果是正常的。然而，在我的内在世界中，人无需对自己抱有恐惧或愧疚。我有一个想法，一种情绪，并不意味着我一定会将其付诸现实。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But why are we so afraid? What negative emotions do you experience? I think one of the main reasons is that many people take the emotions and ideas that arise in their hearts directly equivalent to behavior. The reason why I am afraid of my own thoughts, because I thought of the practical consequences of putting this idea into practice. I can't bear the consequences of this. I will be very scared and afraid. Indeed, we need to take responsibility for our actions in the real world, bear the consequences. It is normal to be afraid of the consequences of reality. However, in my inner world, people don't need to have fear or guilt about themselves. I had an idea, a mood, doesn't mean I'm going to make it a reality.</p>
</details>

很多时候，这些想法只是我探索深层需求的一种媒介，只是一种工具。但在那种恐惧中，我们实际上陷入了一种“**心理等同模式**”（Psychological Equivalence Mode: 指将内心产生的想法或情绪直接等同于实际行为或外部现实的心理状态），暂时丧失了内在世界与外部现实的区分，将自己的内在感受直接投射到外部世界，失去了这种边界感，也失去了这种重新诠释和重新解读经验的能力。这通常是由于我们成长过程中，缺乏对这些情绪的有效反馈和反思。我们可能经历过过于轻易地具有破坏性的外部情境，当我们仅仅表达一些负面情绪时，他人却产生了强烈的情绪反应，结果我们感觉仿佛自己有一个想法，就对他人和世界造成了直接的伤害。这是一种“**滑坡谬误**”（Slippery Slope Fallacy: 一种非形式谬误，认为某个初始行为必然会导致一系列负面后果，如同在湿滑的斜坡上无法停止）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Many times, these ideas are just a medium for me to explore my deep needs, just a tool. But in that fear, we are actually stuck in a psychological equivalence mode, just lost temporarily, distinction between inner world and external reality. Directly project your inner feelings onto the outside world, lost this sense of boundaries. I also lost this experience, the ability to reinterpret and reinterpret. This is usually due to the fact that we grow up, lack of effective feedback and reflection of these emotions. We may have experienced a too easy destructive external circumstances that amplify our emotions. When we simply express some negative emotions, others experience strong emotions. As a result, we feel as if we have a thought, it causes direct damage to others and the world. This is a slippery slope fallacy.</p>
</details>

例如，有些父母自己有未解决的心理冲突，无法容纳孩子，结果当孩子表达某些负面情绪时，父母自身的反应却比孩子强烈许多倍。孩子感受到的不是反馈，而是自己的感受对父母造成了巨大的伤害。又如，在中国许多学校，老师会将学生的每一个举动都与他的未来挂钩。也许学生只是有点疲惫，或者产生了叛逆情绪，却立刻产生愧疚和恐惧，认为自己未来可能一事无成，或者对不起父母等等。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">For example, some parents have unresolved mental conflicts of their own, unable to contain children. As a result, when children express certain negative emotions, the parents' own reactions are many times greater than their children's. Children do not feel feedback, it's your own feelings, it caused great harm to the parents. For example, in many schools in China, the teacher will monitor a student's every move, linked to his future. Maybe the student is a little tired, or rebellious feelings, guilt and fear immediately arise, thinking that I might achieve nothing in the future, or feel sorry for your parents, etc.</p>
</details>

这种状态，实际上类似于一种“**原始迷信**”（Primitive Superstition: 指人类早期对自然现象或未知力量的恐惧和盲目崇拜，认为思想或言语可能直接影响现实灾祸）。例如，古人对风、雨、雷、电等自然灾害非常恐惧，认为自己在这种自然现象面前只能保持敬畏和崇拜，不能思考。一旦你思考，仿佛就会招致不可言说的灾难。但我们现在知道，你在头脑中思考灾难，你对灾难的言语和讨论，并不会让灾难变得更严重。这首先不是因为我们掌握了许多科学知识，而是我们知道人的内在世界是独立的、无限的，超越自然的。因此，面对自然现象，人可以自由地诠释，制定假设，构建理论模型，无需感到恐惧。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This state, in fact, it is similar to a kind of primitive superstition. For example, the ancients were very concerned about natural disasters such as wind, rain, thunder and lightning, very scared. I think I am in front of this natural phenomenon, you can only keep in awe and worship, not think. Once you think, as if it would bring about an unspeakable disaster. But we now know, you think about disasters in your mind, your words and discussions on disasters, it will not make the disaster more severe. This first, not because we know a lot of scientific knowledge, but we know that people's inner world is independent, is infinite, above and beyond nature. Therefore, facing natural phenomena, people are free to interpret, formulate a hypothesis, building a theoretical model, no need to feel fear.</p>

因此，一个人积极体验自己的内在世界，追求自我整合，实际上与人类突破对自然的原始恐惧，勇敢探索世界的奥秘，都是关于将自己从未知中，从异己力量的恐惧中解放出来。

<p class="english-text">Therefore, a person actively experiences his inner world, pursuing self-integration, in fact, it has something to do with humans breaking through their primitive fear of nature, bravely explore the mysteries of the world. They are all about moving oneself from the unknown to the unknown, freed from the fear of alien power.</p>
