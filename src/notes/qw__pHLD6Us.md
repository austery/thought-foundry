title: 加拿大在全球舞台上的地位：从“撒玛利亚国家”到影响力重建
summary: 资深记者布莱恩·斯图尔特探讨了加拿大在全球舞台上的影响力变迁。他指出，加拿大护照曾象征着强大的外交影响力，尤其是在维和与对外援助方面被誉为“撒玛利亚国家”。然而，这种影响力在后期有所衰退，国际社会认为加拿大一度失去焦点。斯图尔特也观察到加拿大正努力重拾其在全球事务中的中心地位，并强调媒体在报道国际危机时应承担更多责任，不仅关注灾难，更要展现恢复与重建的希望。

### 加拿大护照的全球影响力今昔

布莱恩·斯图尔特提到，他曾撰文指出，拥有一本加拿大护照在过去意义非凡，仅仅看到“加拿大”这个词，就感觉其中蕴含着某种力量。他认为，在某些领域，加拿大护照至今仍具有一定影响力。

<p class="english-text">You write having a Canadian passport meant something looking just through your press passes. Just seeing the word Canada felt like there was some power to it. Do you think it holds the same sway. In some areas? It does.</p>
</details>

加拿大仍然是一个受人尊重的国家，尽管他认为其地位有所下降，但仍在“最受尊重国家”的前十名之列。这对于加拿大人和加拿大本身都非常有益，政府也希望在寻找新的贸易伙伴时，这种声誉能带来帮助。然而，加拿大不再拥有过去在**维和行动**（Peacekeeping: 联合国等国际组织为维护和平而进行的军事或非军事行动）和对外援助方面所具备的巨大影响力。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Canada is still a respected country, though. I think it's fallen. It's still in the top ten of most respected countries, and that can really be very, very helpful for Canadians and Canada. And certainly the government's hoping it will be very helpful as it looks for new trading partners. But it doesn't have that same that same clout that it used to have when it was very big in peacekeeping, very big in foreign aid.</p>
</details>

### “撒玛利亚国家”的兴衰

在20世纪80年代，加拿大曾被称为**撒玛利亚国家**（Samaritan state: 指乐于助人、富有同情心的国家），一个总是乐于帮助他人的国家，这可能让现在的加拿大人感到惊讶。这种形象让加拿大在国际上屡次获得进入现场的机会。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There was a period in the '80s. Canadians may be surprised by this now, but we were often referred to as the Samaritan state, the state that always wanted to be out there helping others. And that gave us a kind of a entrance over and over on the ground.</p>
</details>

斯图尔特回忆道，即使与美国人一起工作时，他也可以说：“我们去加拿大使馆吧。我想他们能让我们进去，而美国使馆可能不行，你知道，因为各种怀疑或其他原因。”因此，他有很多理由去感激加拿大以前的影响力。他认为加拿大在海外有许多优秀的人才，包括记者和外交官，但加拿大需要重建实力，例如设立更多的办事处和提供更多的后勤支持。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Even when I was working with the Americans, I could say, let's go the Canadian Embassy. I think they'll be able to get us in where the American Embassy couldn't, you know, because of various suspicions or what have you. So I had many reasons to really appreciate that Canadian clout before. I think we have wonderful people abroad. And I have to underscore that. I think our reporters that are abroad now are as good as any in history, and I think we still have some extremely good diplomats, but we have to rebuild the strength, you know, more better, more bureaus and more more logistical support all the way through.</p>
</details>

### 国际社会对加拿大的看法与影响力重建

斯图尔特认为，其他国家倾向于认为加拿大曾在某种非体育、非炫耀的方式上“占据了领奖台”，即以一种**外交**（Diplomatic: 涉及国家间关系和谈判的）友好的方式。然而，加拿大似乎从那个领奖台上走了下来，满足于再次争取铜牌。他将此比喻为加拿大体育曾经被称为“铜牌国家”的时期，而现在加拿大在体育上经常争夺金牌和银牌。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think other countries, from what I gather, you know, tend to feel that we, we, we own the podium in a kind of non-sports way, a non swaggering way, but in a kind of diplomatic, friendly way. And we sort of stepped down from that podium and were content to go for bronze again. You know, there was a time when Canadian Sports Canada was known as the bronze medal nation, right? Well, we're not anymore. We're up there often for gold and silvers and all that.</p>
</details>

在新闻和外交领域也是如此，加拿大在80年代和90年代确实曾登上领奖台，但后来放弃了很多。因此，国际社会认为加拿大有一段时间失去了焦点，成为一个难以捉摸的国家，常常没有**连贯的信息**（Coherent message: 逻辑清晰、前后一致的表达），或者只有口号式的标语。人们会问：“那到底意味着什么？你们实际会付出什么？会派什么样的人到海外？为什么你们以前有1200名维和人员，现在只有25名？”他认为，在某种程度上，这变得有些可笑。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, the same way with in our journalism and our diplomacy and the rest of it, we really were did manage to get on the podium in the '80s and '90s through that period and then gave a lot of it up. So they think that for a period we lost focus. We seem to be a hard country to read. We didn't seem to have a coherent message quite often, or we would have a bumper sticker slogan as a message and people say, well, what does that mean, really? What are you actually going to give? What kind of people are you going to send abroad? How come you used to have, you know, 1200 peacekeepers in the world? Now you've got 25, right? I mean, at some stage it becomes almost a little bit laughable.</p>
</details>

然而，斯图尔特认为在过去一年里，加拿大的情绪发生了巨大变化。加拿大人希望并知道他们必须重拾影响力。这不仅仅是希望受人喜爱，更是希望再次具有影响力，能够参与重要文件的签署。他注意到加拿大希望飞往埃及签署关于加沙的**停火协议**（Ceasefire Agreement: 冲突各方同意暂停敌对行动的协议），总理也致电表示希望出席。他认为这表明加拿大正在重新扮演“中心舞台”的角色，并对过去六个月加拿大获得的媒体关注度印象深刻。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, having said that, I think there's a big change in the Canadian mood that I feel in the last year. And I think Canada Canadians want to get back and know they have to get back. I really think is very important. It's not just a wish to be well-liked. It's a wish to be influential again, to be able to be. At the signing of documents. Notice Canada wanted to fly into Egypt for the signing of the cease fire agreement over Gaza. It you know, our Prime Minister phoned up and said, I want to come to be there. I'm not sure we would have done that before. So I think there's much more of Canada taking a we're in centre stage again role. And I'm very impressed by the amount of media coverage Canada tends to get now in the last six months or so. Over that before.</p>
</details>

### 媒体在国际危机报道中的责任

斯图尔特认为，首先，媒体网络必须被“愧疚”地唤醒，让他们意识到目前的做法是荒谬的。他举了一个可怕的例子：近年来埃塞俄比亚陷入**内战**（Civil war: 同一国家内部不同派别之间的武装冲突）约三年，估计有50万到60万人死亡。这比加沙和乌克兰死亡人数的总和还要多，但在媒体上几乎没有得到报道，除了英国、半岛电视台英语频道和法国媒体给予了更多关注。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think I think, first of all, networks have to be guilted back into realising, you know, what you're doing is ridiculous. I mean, I'll give you one horrible example that Ethiopia fell back into a civil war in recent years for about three year period when it's estimated that somewhere between half a million and 600,000 people died. That's more people than died in Gaza and Ukraine combined, yet got almost no coverage in the media. Very, very little coverage except in maybe the British and Al Jazeera and English and the French gave it more coverage.</p>
</details>

他指出，媒体基本上已经放弃了报道那些看起来复杂、成本高昂的故事，因为在战区支持团队的保险费用太高，导致他们不再像以前那样进行**前线报道**（Front line coverage: 记者在冲突或事件发生地最危险区域进行的报道）。例如，拉丁美洲的报道量远不如20年前。斯图尔特希望加拿大能意识到其重要性不仅限于与美国的关系，还包括与许多其他国家的联系，并加强对这些国家的了解和报道。他认为，目前对印度、印度尼西亚、拉丁美洲和非洲等地的了解少得可怜，甚至目前没有一个加拿大广播记者在非洲，这简直是“疯狂”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But basically we've turned we've just gone away from covering stories because they seem complex, more costly to go there. And how would you support a team in the field? We don't do front line coverage in wars like Ukraine anymore, because the insurance is so high, and so we were sort of backing off, covering a lot of areas of the world. We don't cover Latin America nearly as much as we were doing so 20 years ago. This needs to be explained more, but I think the networks have to be somewhat guilted back and guilt themselves back. And I'm hoping that this, this whole era we're going into now where Canada is really realising we're not just Canada, US in terms of importance, we're Canada and a lot of other countries that we better get to know about much more than we do and have been reporting on in recent years. And we're scandalously unaware, really. You know, the big picture in India or Indonesia, Latin America, Africa. I don't think there's a single Canadian broadcast correspondent in Africa at the moment, which is just crazy.</p>
</details>

他建议，解决这一问题的方法是投入资源进行高质量、有趣的报道，并配备经验丰富的人员来解读正在发生的事情，而不是总以危机模式来处理。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So that would help it. And then then putting the resources into the coverage, making the coverage good and interesting, which foreign news tends to be. And then at the base itself, you need experienced people able to interpret what's going on in a lesson. It's always a crisis mode.</p>
</details>

### 图像疲劳与“恢复故事”的重要性

斯图尔特认为，人们对看到大量**图像**（Images: 视觉画面，特指新闻报道中的冲击性画面）感到疲惫或不堪重负是一个巨大的问题。早在1984年，他就开始担心，人们何时会厌倦这些图像，渴望更和平的画面。他理解这种感受，因为有时他自己也会选择不看某些远方冲突的报道。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think that is a massive problem. I worried even back in 1984, all those years ago, that the images we were sending out, at what point would people just say, you know, I don't want to live with these kind of images, you know, I want a better peaceful images and I can't fault them, you know? I mean, there are certain times when I'm watching images of coverage from afar where I just I think I'll miss that tonight. I'll watch something else. It's understandable. It's human nature.</p>
</details>

他认为，解决方案是增加**报道**（Reporting: 记者对事件进行调查、采访并撰写新闻的过程），减少纯粹的视觉图像。例如，让经验丰富的记者在现场进行更长时间的站立报道，更多地进行口头解释，以及采访那些真正了解情况的人。他强调，世界各地总有优秀的专家，他们的讲述有时比无休止的问题图像更具吸引力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I don't know what. I don't know what the answer to that is, except to put more reporting and less of the image in, like, you know, I think longer stand ups by experienced reporters in the field that are less the vivid images, but more the verbal explanation, longer interviews with people who know what they's talking about. And there are so many of those, I mean, they're always good experts. Wherever you go in the world, those things can be more compelling at times than the endless images of problems.</p>
</details>

另一个至关重要的教训是，他在埃塞俄比亚遇到的一位老爱尔兰牧师告诉他，媒体在报道危机时非常出色，但通常只拍摄三天的素材就飞走，不再回来。这给世界留下了一个印象，即这是一个绝望的国家，那里的人民永远无法站起来，从而制造了完全毁灭的错误印象。媒体错过了邻里互助、学校重开、人们结盟互助的场景。因此，斯图尔特回到加拿大广播公司（CBC）后，强调了报道**恢复故事**（Recovery stories: 关注危机后重建、复苏和希望的新闻报道）的重要性。CBC采纳了他的建议，每两年派他回埃塞俄比亚，让他能够关注那些能给人带来鼓励的事情，让人们意识到，如果世界做出回应并给予机会，那些可怕的场景六个月后可能就不复存在。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the other thing that I think is critically important. One lesson I learned in Ethiopia was of a very old Irish priest, came up to me in a feeding centre and said, you know, you media are just wonderful at coming into crises. You run in, you do three days of footage and then you fly away again and you don't come back and we have to stay on afterwards, of course. And the world gets an image that this was a hopeless country of hopeless people who never managed to get off their knees. And you create this wrong impression of complete devastation. You're not around to see people NEIGHBOURS come back together. Schools reopen, people form alliances and start helping each other. You miss that. So I went back to CBC and said, you know, he has a real point, and I think CBC's duty must be to go back and do recovery stories a great deal. And they did. Said they started to send me back almost every two years to Ethiopia, where I could focus on the kind of things that gave people encouragement to realise, you know, these horrible scenes you're seeing. They need not be the same scenes six months from now. If the world responds and the country is given a chance.</p>

这就是为什么他现在虽然年迈，却期待看到加沙的重建。这不仅因为加沙是他所见过地球上最被摧毁的地方，更因为这是一个可以展示人们在适当帮助下能够恢复的地方，就像许多其他地方的人们一样。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's why, in a way, I have to say I'm rather old now. I look forward to seeing the rebuilding of Gaza, you know, not just because it's the most wrecked place I've ever seen on Earth, but it's a place that will show that people can, with the proper help, come back as they do come back from so many places.</p>
</details>

### 加沙停火与和平的希望

斯图尔特谈到加沙问题时表示，目前我们有一个停火协议，但还没有和平协议。他认为这可能只是一个小小的开始，但所有的和平条约都始于微小的步骤。这个小小的元素可以成为未来关键的基石。他努力保持希望，因为他见过许多美好的、充满希望的故事，不想给人留下他只见过苦难的印象。他见过许多美好的恢复和新的开始，甚至回想起自己童年时欧洲从第二次世界大战中恢复的情景，人们确实能够恢复。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I think we have a ceasefire. We don't have a peace agreement. We have a ceasefire agreement. You could say it's a small step, but, you know, all peace treaties begin. Small people say, oh, well, it's only a small element. Well, you have to start somewhere. And that small element can become the key building block down the road. So I try to be hopeful because I've seen wonderful, hopeful stories. I don't want to give people the impression I've only seen misery in life. I've seen a lot of wonderful recovery and new beginnings life. And, you know, I think back even to my childhood as a young child with Europe recovering from the Second World War, people do recover.</p>
</details>

他认为，现在进入下一阶段还有很多困难，例如**干预部队**（Intervention force: 为解决冲突或维持和平而部署的军事或非军事力量）将由什么组成？谁会自愿加入？如何让**巴勒斯坦权力机构**（Palestinian Authority: 负责管理约旦河西岸和加沙地带部分巴勒斯坦居民事务的自治政府）与干预部队合作？如何让**哈马斯**（Hamas: 巴勒斯坦逊尼派伊斯兰政治军事组织）解除武装？如何让以色列人完全撤退？所有这些都需要大量的推动和压力。他认为，好消息是，周围所有国家最终都表示“受够了，这必须停止”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I think there's a lot of difficulty now to go on to the next phase, the intervention force. What's it going to be made of? Who's going to volunteer to go into that? How are you going to bring a Palestinian Authority into work with that intervention force? How are you going to get Hamas to disarm? How are you going to get the Israelis to fully pull back all these stage by stage things that that need a lot of push and pressure? And the good thing I feel what I think is essential is that finally, all the countries around are saying, that's it, we've had it. This has to stop.</p>
</details>

他提到，在埃及举行的20国领导人会议非常重要，因为这将需要对以色列和哈马斯都施加压力，要求他们解除武装并离开政府。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And, you know, it was very interesting that session in Egypt when 20 leaders of nations got together, because I think that's going to be needed. Pressure can maintained on Israel, pressure maintained on Hamas as well, that you've got to disarm. You've got to leave government.</p>
</details>

### 记者生涯的终极慰藉：庇护所的意象

当被问及在报道了所有这些图像后，闭上眼睛时是否有某个画面挥之不去，斯图尔特回答说，他总是伴着一个**庇护所**（Shelter: 提供安全和保护的地方）的画面入睡。这个画面是人们或他自己进入一个温暖的庇护所，伴随着雨声（他的助眠器播放的雨声）。人们从可怕、多雨或动荡的环境中进来，在里面找到平静和庇护。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The image I always fall asleep to is the shelter people or myself coming to a warm shelter and my sound machine? I have rain outside so they're coming in from a scary situation, or a rainy situation or a turbulent situation, but they're finding peace and shelter inside.</p>
</details>

他认为，数百万人能够获得平静、庇护和安宁，从他们的**噩梦**（Nightmares: 令人恐惧或不安的经历）中解脱出来，这始终激励着他保持对世界的兴趣，否则他早就放弃了。他一生中见过许多邪恶的人，但也见过许多圣人，许多伟大而英勇的人。他喜欢伴着这种令人慰藉的画面入睡：世界上每个人都有一个庇护所。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I think the fact that millions of people can be brought to peace, shelter and calm can be brought out of their own nightmares is something that kind of inspires me all the time to maintain an interest in the world. Otherwise I would have given up. But boy, I've seen a lot of evil people in my life, but also a lot of saints. A lot of magnificent, heroic people I write about. And that's what I like to fall asleep to, is that comforting image of there's a shelter in the world for everybody, right?</p>
