</details>

主持人：这两家公司在瓦伦堡家族中都扮演着极其重要的角色。对于那些不熟悉瓦伦堡家族的人来说，他们控制并影响着诸如**Ericsson**（爱立信: 瑞典电信设备制造商）、**Atlas Copco**（阿特拉斯·科普柯: 瑞典工业设备制造商）、**Electrolux**（伊莱克斯: 瑞典家电制造商）、**AstraZeneca**（阿斯利康: 英国-瑞典跨国制药公司）和**ABB**（ABB集团: 瑞士-瑞典跨国自动化公司）等公司，而这一切始于1850年，真是令人难以置信。Marcus，非常高兴您能来到这里。

### 家族企业长青的秘诀：适应与创新

主持人：一个家族企业能存活175年，其秘诀是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What's the key to survive for have 175 years?</p>
</details>

Marcus Wallenberg：嗯，当然有很多方面，但也许最重要的一点，或者说其中一个最重要的方面，就是你必须准备好适应时代。我认为这是非常重要的一部分。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh I'm well there are many aspects of course uh with that but uh perhaps the most important thing or one of the most important things would be that you are ready to adapt with the times I think that is a very important part of it.</p>
</details>

主持人：您认为最重要的几次适应是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And what's been the most important adaptions you've done you think?</p>
</details>

Marcus Wallenberg：嗯，你知道，我认为如果回溯175年前，你很快就会想到戏剧性的技术变革。我们经历了蒸汽机时代、电气化时代，现在我们刚刚经历了互联网时代，现在我们正处于人工智能时代。因此，随时代而变的愿望和动力是一个非常非常重要的方面。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, you know, I I think that if you think about 175 years back, uh you will of course very quickly come to such things as dramatic technological change, uh gone through the times of the steam engine, the electrification, now we have the internet that we just passed, now we're in the age of AI, so the wish and the drive to change with the times is in very very important aspect.</p>
</details>

### 瓦伦堡家族的骄傲：团结与社会贡献

主持人：瓦伦堡家族的遗产中，您最引以为傲的是哪一部分？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What part of the wenberg Legacy are you the most proud of?</p>
</details>

Marcus Wallenberg：我们能够作为一个家族团结协作，这非常重要。我认为这可能是我们引以为傲的事情之一，我们能够世世代代地做到这一点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The fact uh that we are able to um be here as a family uh to work together in our family is very important um I think that is uh perhaps one of the uh things that we can be proud of that we've been able uh throughout the generations to do that.</p>
</details>

Marcus Wallenberg：我认为我们不仅能够与公司合作，还能够支持研究和教育，这也是我们所做工作的一个重要方面。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh I think also that we have the possibility uh to not only work with companies but also to support uh research and education uh is an important aspect of what has been done.</p>
</details>

### 北欧资本主义的独特模式与家族角色

主持人：北欧国家的资本主义模式非常不同。在丹麦，有基金会；在挪威，国家通过部分所有权扮演着非常重要的角色；而在瑞典，您和另外几个家族对长期所有权非常重要。那么，您如何看待自己？您是所有者，还是更像一位首相？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Capitalism looks very different in the Nordic countries so in Denmark you have foundations in Norway the state is very important uh with part ownerships and in Sweden of course you and a couple of other families are very important for long-term ownership so how do you how do you look at yourself are you uh you know are you an owner or do you feel like more like a prime minister uh just how do you how do you look at yourself uh I mean you're much more important than the prime minister.</p>
</details>

Marcus Wallenberg：不，我不会这么说。在当前时代，我要告诉您，民主是我们应该小心守护的极其重要的事物。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No I would not say so in these times I would tell you that democracy is an extremely important thing that we should be uh guarding carefully.</p>
</details>

Marcus Wallenberg：我将其视为两条并行轨道：从所有权方面来说，我们是企业管理者，我们努力与我们有经济利益的公司紧密合作，以期长期创造价值并发展它们，与它们保持紧密联系，确保它们在一个剧烈变化的世界中保持竞争力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think about it as two dual tracks from an ownership side uh being a steward of of corporations that we try to work very closely with uh where we have a financial interest uh in order to create value over time and develop them uh be close to them so we can see that they they stay competitive in a very in a dramatically changing world.</p>
</details>

Marcus Wallenberg：在第二条轨道上，正如您所说的关于基金会，我们支持这些基金会，它们主要向瑞典大学提供大量资金，以促进瑞典的发展，这反过来又帮助瑞典这个在广阔世界中非常小的国家，努力在某些领域保持竞争力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh on the second track uh doing what you're saying about the foundations U supporting um these foundations who are giving uh a substantial amount of money to Swedish universities primarily uh for the betterment of Sweden which is in turn I think helps uh Sweden as a very small country in in in the view of this large world uh to try to stay competitive in certain Fields.</p>
</details>

### 基金会的重要性与家族价值观

主持人：这些基金会对您个人以及在这些公司工作的人来说有多重要？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How important are these foundations for you personally and for and for the people who work in all these companies?</p>
</details>

Marcus Wallenberg：我认为许多同事实际上很高兴这些公司产生的股息能够回馈社会，用于一项有益的事业。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think there are many many uh of the um colleagues who actually are quite happy with that uh the dividends that come out of these companies actually go back uh for a good cause.</p>
</details>

Marcus Wallenberg：对我们家族来说，这非常重要，它帮助我们更贴近科学和技术的前沿，了解即将发生的事情，我认为这在您思考如何适应世界时，是这个等式中一个重要的输入。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh and uh for us and the family it's very important it helps us to stay uh a bit closer to what goes on in science and technology to see what is about to come uh which I think is in in when you think about it in that you're adapting with the world that is an important input to that equation.</p>
</details>

主持人：您曾说过，您希望做事而不被公众过多关注，不希望显得过于张扬。这种想法背后是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You have saying that you want to do things without being seen publicly too much to be not seem to be yeah what's the thinking behind this?</p>
</details>

Marcus Wallenberg：这是我的曾祖父所采纳的一句话。我认为他指出了我们认为非常重要的一点，那就是我们作为一个家族，应该真正努力去做那些能产生良好影响的事情，但最重要的也许不是你站在前线，而是你实际上支持这些事情的发生。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It was my great-grandfather who who uh adopted that saying uh I think he pointed to what is something we think is very important namely um we should uh really work as a family to do things that will have a good impact but the most important is perhaps not that you're standing in the front line but that you actually uh support that these things are happening.</p>
</details>

主持人：您现在就在这个播客的前线。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well you on the front line now in this podcast.</p>
</details>

Marcus Wallenberg：是的，我确实如此。我认为您正在做一些非常有趣的事情，因为您正在利用自己的时间来传播关于不同公司和个人的信息，这是您工作的一个有趣方面。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes uh I am and uh I think you are uh doing something quite interesting uh since you're using your time to spread the word about different companies and individuals that's an interesting aspect of your job.</p>
</details>

主持人：是的，我们非常渴望学习你们的做法，因为我确实认为我们需要延长规划的时间范围，我们需要更具长期性，更像所有者而非投资者，这就是我们来这里的原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah and we are very keen to learn from how you're doing things because I do think we need to extend the time Horizon for planning we need to be more long-term and act more like owners rather than than investors which is why we are here.</p>
</details>

### 瓦伦堡文化：长期主义、创新与人才

主持人：您会如何描述瓦伦堡文化？或者说，是否存在一种瓦伦堡文化？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How would you uh characterize the wenberg culture or is there such a thing as a Wallenberg culture?</p>
</details>

Marcus Wallenberg：我们希望存在。对我们家族来说，一套价值观非常重要。您刚才提到了长期性，即长期与公司在一起，努力长期支持它们，看到这些公司的变化，使其真正具有竞争力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We hope hope there is uh a set of values that is very important to us as a family you just mentioned the long-term aspect uh to stay with the companies try to be supportive uh of them for a long time see a change in these companies to be really competitive.</p>
</details>

Marcus Wallenberg：我们经常谈论公司的“未来验证”（future-proofing），这基本上意味着我们今天非常关注人才问题，我们认为这极其重要。我们关注公司及其创新能力，尤其还有可持续性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh we talk a lot about the uh future proofing of companies which basically means uh today we're we're looking very much at the people question we think that is extremely important we look at uh companies and their ability to innovate and not the least also with sustainability.</p>
</details>

Marcus Wallenberg：最后但同样重要的是，所有公司都需要理解它们的数据、人工智能和网络安全策略。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And uh last but not least I would say the demands on all companies to understand their data and Ai and cyber strategies.</p>
</details>

### 领导力培养与家族责任

主持人：您与您的堂兄一起管理着这一切。您是如何被培养来接管这项事业的？例如，我们之前采访过**Johan Allan**，他22岁左右就被告知要接管。您多大年纪时就知道自己将肩负这份重任？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now you run um this uh in a way together with your cousin um how were you groomed to take over this for instance we had John alen on uh while back he was told that he should take it over when he was like 22 or something right yeah now how old were you when you knew that you would have this incredible responsibility?</p>
</details>

Marcus Wallenberg：嗯，我认为我们这一代人，老一辈人总是告诉我们，仅仅因为你姓瓦伦堡，你并不能免费获得一切。所以，我们非常注重学习，注重在不同公司长期工作，努力工作，保持兴趣，把工作做好，这非常重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well I I think that uh we U uh in our generation we were always told by the older generation that just because your name is wenberg you don't get a free ride so uh a lot of focus for us was on learning uh on uh doing uh work within different companies over time uh work hard uh be interested um do a good job very important.</p>
</details>

主持人：谁告诉您的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Who told you this?</p>
</details>

Marcus Wallenberg：我认为我的祖父和叔叔在这方面都非常坚定。所以，这真的是关于学习，关于展现你的兴趣，以及关于表现。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think uh both uh my grandfather and uh my uh uncle was very strong in that so it's uh it's really about learning it's about uh showing that you have the interest and also to perform.</p>
</details>

主持人：这是一种负担吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Is it a burden?</p>
</details>

Marcus Wallenberg：如果你不喜欢它，它就会成为一种负担。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh if you don't like it it can be a burden.</p>
</details>

主持人：您最喜欢它什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What is it that you like?</p>
</details>

Marcus Wallenberg：当您看到公司正在发展，当您看到我们与大学合作的工作确实推动了事物向前发展，并且您能为这些公司和社会做出贡献时，会获得很多满足感。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Lot of satisfaction getting when you see that companies are developing uh then uh when we can see that actually uh the work we do with the universities is actually moving things forward and if you can add to both these companies and to society.</p>
</details>

### 瑞典企业成功的秘诀

主持人：我一直很欣赏瑞典公司，因为它们非常令人印象深刻。您认为瑞典的哪些特质解释了这种成功？或者说，这其中有什么瑞典特色吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No I always admired um Swedish companies because they are just very very impressive what do you think what is it with um Sweden which explains this success or or is there something Swedish in it?</p>
</details>

Marcus Wallenberg：我不知道这是否是瑞典的特质，但我认为作为一个国家，瑞典一直非常依赖贸易。如果你想进行贸易，你就必须有竞争力。如果你想作为一个小国保持竞争力，你就必须创新。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh I don't know if it's a Swedish trade but I I I think that as a country Sweden uh has always been very dependent on trade uh if you want to do trade you have to be competitive uh if you want to be competitive as a small country you have to innovate uh so this is something that I think Swedish companies have been forced to understand and to deal with over a long time.</p>
</details>

Marcus Wallenberg：我们是小国家，这意味着你不能指望获得所有你可能想要的关注，所以你真的必须建立信任，你必须具有成本效益，并且你必须创新。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We are small countries um that means that you cannot assume that you'll get all the attention that maybe you would like so you really have to build the trust you have to be cost uh effective and you have to innovate.</p>
</details>

主持人：但你们成功地在最初相对较小的利基市场中创造了一些世界领先者，然后他们扩大了这些利基市场，对吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But you managed to create some world leaders in initially in relatively small niches and then they have expanded the niches right um.</p>
</details>

Marcus Wallenberg：绝对地，他们扩大了技术，也进行了一些收购。这些公司大多数都非常国际化，它们在瑞典的业务不到10%。这意味着你必须真正了解国际市场，你必须依赖自由贸易，这在今天可能不是一个显而易见的问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Absolutely expanded their Technologies expanded you know some Acquisitions as well of course over time uh being very International most of these companies have less than 10% of their business in Sweden and uh that means that you really have to understand the International markets you have to rely on free trade which is a perhaps not an obvious question today.</p>
</details>

Marcus Wallenberg：是的，正如我之前所说，你必须保持竞争力，能够适应不同的市场和需求。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No uh and uh that you can as I said earlier stay uh competitive in the sense that you can adapt to the different markets and in needs over time.</p>
</details>

### 挪威工业基础与投资机会

主持人：当您审视挪威的工业基础时，您有什么看法？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">When you look at the Norwegian industrial base what Reflections do you have?</p>
</details>

Marcus Wallenberg：我认为国家倾向于越来越多地发展那些对其自然而言的事情。你们在自然资源和渔业方面拥有非常强大的产业。我确信挪威在其他领域也能并且将随着时间发展，例如，你知道，我参与了**EQT**（殷拓集团: 瑞典私募股权公司）的私募股权业务，他们在这里非常活跃。奥斯陆或挪威有许多非常有趣的新兴公司。所以，那里肯定有很多可能性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think that countries have a tendency to to uh work more and more with things that comes natural to them you have very strong Industries in terms of your natural resources and fishing for example uh I'm sure that uh there are areas other areas that Norway uh could and will develop over time such as for example you know I'm involved with the the private Equity business eqt they're quite active here there are number of startups in Oslo that or in in in the in Norway that are very interesting companies so it's there there are definitely possibilities.</p>
</details>

### 责任的边界与团队协作

主持人：Marcus，责任过于集中在少数人手中，是否会成为问题？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Marcus can there be such a thing as too much responsibility in too few hands?</p>
</details>

Marcus Wallenberg：是的，您触及了一个非常重要的问题，因为责任当然必须适应能够以良好方式完成的事情。所以这个问题很中肯。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes you you're touching something that is very very important uh because you you responsibility of course have to uh be adapted to what can be done in a in a in a good way uh so the question is relevant.</p>
</details>

Marcus Wallenberg：我想说，我们家族承担并一直承担着很多责任。但当您谈到我们家族是否存在一种文化或价值基础时，我想说，如果您回顾家族活跃的这些年，我至少可以发现的一个关键问题是，家族一直与杰出的人才合作。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um I would say that we in the family carry and have carried a lot of responsibility but when you talk about uh if there is a culture or a value base uh in our family coming back to that question uh I would say that if you look through the years that the family has been active one of the key uh questions that I can at least detect uh is that uh the family has worked with fantastic people.</p>
</details>

Marcus Wallenberg：这是一场团队合作，一项团队运动。一个人或几个人无法独自完成。你必须依靠那些与你拥有共同价值观的人，他们必须与你一起承担责任。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh and uh it is a team play it's a team sport uh one person a couple of persons can't do this yourself you have to rely on people that share your value base and uh they have to take their responsibility along your own responsibility and that in itself is is a responsibility to find these people and to work with them for a long time and uh really understand that you share these ideas and the values of what you're trying to create with the businesses.</p>
</details>

Marcus Wallenberg：而这本身就是一种责任，去找到这些人，与他们长期合作，并真正理解你们在通过企业创造什么时，是共享这些想法和价值观的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that in itself is is a responsibility to find these people and to work with them for a long time and uh really understand that you share these ideas and the values of what you're trying to create with the businesses.</p>
</details>

### 培养下一代所有者

主持人：你们如何培养下一代所有者？他们大约有30人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How do you work with the next generation of owners there are about 30 of them uh in the Next Generation and we have for a number of years uh more than 10 years uh worked with them in different ways uh introducing them slowly to each other and to the businesses and to uh the foundations and what the family uh wants to do.</p>
</details>

Marcus Wallenberg：我们多年来，超过十年，以不同的方式与他们合作，慢慢地让他们相互认识，了解企业，了解基金会以及家族想要做的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We have for a number of years uh more than 10 years uh worked with them in different ways uh introducing them slowly to each other and to the businesses and to uh the foundations and what the family uh wants to do.</p>
</details>

Marcus Wallenberg：他们中的一些人表示有兴趣在企业中工作，一些人表示希望在基金会工作，还有一些人说他们很乐意成为家族成员，这都很好。我认为这是一种非常好的方式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh some of them have said that they're interested to work in the business some of them said that they would like to work with the foundations some of them said that I'm a happy family member and that's fine uh and I think that is a very good way of doing it.</p>
</details>

Marcus Wallenberg：我们总是要平衡希望他们产生兴趣、理解作为所有者需要做的必要事情，但我们也非常清楚，如果你从事这些工作，你将不得不投入大量时间，对你的时间有很多要求等等。所以你真的必须喜欢你正在做的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um there is always a balance with hoping that they will get the interest understand the necessary things you need to do as an owner but I think we're also uh very mindful that uh this is something if you if you work with these things you will have to spend a lot of time at there's a lot of Demands on your time and so on so you really have to like what you're doing.</p>
</details>

Marcus Wallenberg：所以，我认为他们会逐渐承担更多责任，我们正与他们就此进行非常密切的对话。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So gradually I you know I think they will take more responsibility uh and uh that's something we're in very close dialogue with them about uh coming on.</p>
</details>

主持人：那将是令人兴奋的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well that's going to be exciting to follow.</p>
</details>

### 基金会所有权结构的重要性

主持人：不久前，瑞典经历了一段时期，财富税很高，许多杰出的瑞典人离开了这个国家，而你们家族却没有。您认为如果没有基金会作为所有权结构，情况会有所不同吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">A little while back um Sweden went through a period with uh you know a lot of wealth tax very high taxation and a lot of very prominent swedes left the country whilst you guys didn't do you think that it would have been different if you hadn't had the foundations as an ownership structure?</p>
</details>

Marcus Wallenberg：当然，你永远不知道那时会发生什么。但在最大的基金会**K.A. Wallenberg**（瓦伦堡家族的创始人之一）的案例中，我的曾叔祖父和他的妻子**Alise**（一位挪威歌剧演唱家）没有孩子。所以对他们来说，选择基金会是很自然的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You never know of course uh what would have happened then um but in the case of the largest Foundation K wenber my great uncle uh and his wife Alise a Norwegian opera singer uh they had no children so for them it was a natural thing to go for a foundation.</p>
</details>

Marcus Wallenberg：然后正如您所说，税收问题出现了，我们现在家族基金会接近15个，所以多年来许多人决定成立基金会。这里有一个重要的事情是，正如我们所知，北欧基金会的运作方式是，没有人拥有基金会。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Then came the tax question as you said which we're now I think we're close to 15 of the family foundations so many have now decided to start foundations over the years it one of the important things here is that as we all know the Nordic way of doing foundations nobody owns the foundation MH uh which means that uh when you go from one generation to another you're not quarreling about any money because the money will never belong to you.</p>
</details>

Marcus Wallenberg：这意味着，当你从一代传到另一代时，你不会为钱争吵，因为钱永远不属于你。所以你实际上是基于兴趣为基金会和公司服务，而不是为了争吵或大声讨论如何找到钱。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So you actually work for the good of the foundations and for the companies uh based on on your interest and it's not there to you know fight or have a a big discussion about how to find the money here.</p>
</details>

Marcus Wallenberg：我认为这对我们家族来说极其重要，因为我们这些决定为家族工作的人，都是因为我们对此有浓厚的兴趣。我们很幸运，世世代代都有非常合格的家族成员能够在那里发展业务。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think that has been extremely important for our family uh because those uh of us who decided to work with the family we have done that because we have a keen interest in doing so uh and uh we've been lucky that throughout the generations um there have been very qualified people in the family who's been able to be there and develop the business.</p>
</details>

### 投资理念：优秀企业的特质

主持人：转到一个话题，投资理念。如果您要概括一个优秀公司的特质，您会说什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Moving to a topic a bit here um investment philosophy if you were to kind of distill down what you think a great company is what characterizes a great company what would you say are some of the characteristics?</p>

Marcus Wallenberg：管理层、市场地位、创新能力、稳定的财务状况，这些都是一些重要的特质。

Marcus Wallenberg：我犹豫是否要提及具体名称，因为我认为所有公司都必须具有创新性，才能取得成功。

<p class="english-text">I hesitate to mention names because I I I think that um all of them have to be innovative if you are going to be successful.</p>
</details>

Marcus Wallenberg：如果你想在制药界取得成功，你必须极其创新，比如**AstraZeneca**。如果你想在电信界竞争，你必须极其创新才能保持领先。

<p class="english-text">In the Pharma world you have to be extremely Innovative such as astroica if you going to compete in the Telecom world you have to be extremely uh Innovative to to stay ahead.</p>
</details>

Marcus Wallenberg：但即使是像**Atlas Copco**这样的传统工程公司，它们也面临着巨大的创新压力。所以，我认为我们投资组合中的大多数公司都面临着这种压力，并且它们都非常清楚这一点，并且多年来一直在努力越来越重视创新。

<details>

### 基金会与基础研究

主持人：基金会资助的领域是基础性的、突破性的研究，在许多国家，这类研究通常由政府和公共资金负责。你们这样做是因为认为这些进展最终会惠及公司吗？或者说，你们选择这些领域背后的想法是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now the fundations fund research in in areas I mean really kind of basic groundbreaking uh research where which in many countries would be taken care of by you know governments and Public Funding do you do that because you think it will be beneficial for the companies eventually to have that type of progress or what's the thinking behind the fields you are choosing?</p>
</details>

Marcus Wallenberg：您说得对，我们主要资助基础研究，有时是高风险研究，结果非常不确定。你们支持的是人，而不是项目，对吗？50%是支持人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You're you're right that we are funding primarily basic research and sometimes high-risk research right with a very uncertain outcome you back uh people uh rather than projects right 50% is backing people.</p>
</details>

Marcus Wallenberg：是的，50%是一些大型项目，比如人工智能、量子计算，这些都是非常长期的项目。没有多少机构会这样思考。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Yeah 50% are some large projects like AI Quantum um yeah in in in in very long dur a project and there not that many institutions which think that way.</p>
</details>

Marcus Wallenberg：**Howard Hughes Foundation**（霍华德·休斯医学研究所: 美国一家大型慈善机构，资助生物医学研究）就是其中之一，他们也做这种二元结果的资助。我们努力专注于卓越，并真正推动所进行的研究是开放的，对所有人开放。瑞典的制度是研究人员拥有知识产权。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean Howard Hughes Foundation is one that comes to mind where they also do this kind of binary outcome backing people we're trying to focus on Excellence uh and we're really uh pushing that the the research that is being performed is open research it's for everybody the Swedish system is such that the researcher owns the IP uh so uh it it really is an open uh question.</p>
</details>

Marcus Wallenberg：当然，这与我之前试图描述的非常一致，即如果你认为自己必须不断创新和“未来验证”，同时又在一个研究和教育非常重要的国家，这在我们的理念中运作得非常好，有助于我们思考如何适应时代，展望未来，或预见即将发生的事情。

### 地缘政治与风险管理

主持人：地缘政治局势如何影响您的思考方式？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How does um uh the geopolitical situation influence the way you think?</p>
</details>

Marcus Wallenberg：很难说我们正生活在最困难的时代，所以不应该这么说，但我认为至少可以得出结论，我们正生活在极其复杂的时代。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean it's hard to say that we are living in in the most difficult times so that that that you should not do but I think one can at least conclude that we're living in extremely complex times yeah.</p>
</details>

Marcus Wallenberg：而且不仅仅是地缘政治，还有科学的进步、气候变化等等，我们这一代人必须考虑很多事情。我想我们都渴望给我们的孩子一个良好的世界。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh and it's not only GE politics it's also uh the advancement of science it's a climate change it's uh so many things that we have to think about in our generation and I guess we're all Keen to give something to our kids that is uh in a good shape um so that impacts our thinking a lot uh about the surrounding world.</p>
</details>

Marcus Wallenberg：从银行的角度来看，一直以来都围绕着信用风险、市场风险和流动性风险等资产负债表上的问题。但今天，如果你是一名银行家，你必须考虑许多额外的风险：网络风险、监管风险、政治风险、气候风险。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">When I take you know from a bank perspective it's always been around you know the credit risk and the market risk and the liquidity risk and so on that on the balance sheet things but today if you're a banker there are so many additional risks that you have to consider cyber regulatory political uh climate there's so many different risks that are now coming into the equation.</p>
</details>

Marcus Wallenberg：所以，从这个角度来看，我们生活在一个相当复杂的世界。因此，我们家族和与我们合作的人投入大量时间，尽最大努力去理解实际可能发生的事情以及它可能如何影响我们所做的一切。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So we are living in a quite complex World from that point of view so we spend a lot of time in the family and the people that we work with to try to understand to our best ability I should say uh what is actually about to happen and how it could impact what we do.</p>
</details>

### 投资策略与波动性

主持人：所以这些事情有时会造成很大的波动性。然而，你们并没有真正利用这种波动性来扩大你们在各种公司中的头寸。例如，在金融危机期间，你们是否做了很多大的积极变动？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So the these things cause a lot of volatility uh sometimes yes um yet you are not really utilizing that volatility to scale up your positions in various companies for instance what were the did you make a lot of big active changes during the financial crisis?</p>
</details>

Marcus Wallenberg：嗯，我认为我们……您是指购买更多股票吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh I think that we have uh you mean buying more shares in well.</p>

Marcus Wallenberg：我们在某些公司确实购买了股票。我认为我们一直采取非常循序渐进的方法。

主持人：您认为应该多做一些吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Do you think you should do more of this?</p>
</details>

Marcus Wallenberg：我认为，例如，如果您看看**Investor AB**的私人业务，它被称为**Patricia Industries**，我们在过去十年中在那里投资了很多。所以是的，我们参与其中。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh I think that if you look at uh for example the privately owned uh business of investor which is called petricia Industries uh we have been investing quite uh a lot there in the last 10 years so yes we are participating in that.</p>
</details>

Marcus Wallenberg：在其他控股公司中，如果您看看**EQT**，他们在过去十年中一直非常活跃，并创造了非常大的业务。所以，我认为我们一直相当活跃。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh so in the other holding companies if you look at eqt they have been extremely uh on their toes and have created a very big business in the past 10 years uh so I think that uh we have been quite quite uh active.</p>
</details>

Marcus Wallenberg：也许我们以处理一些非常大的上市公司而闻名，正如您所知，因为您也是投资者，如果您是主要股东，在这些时期改变您的所有权头寸并不那么容易。所以，我们多年来进行了许多投资，我认为我们对此感到非常满意。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Perhaps we have we're we're known to deal with some of the very large uh public corporations and as you know since you're an investor as well uh it's not that easy if you are a very major shareholder to move your ownership position uh in these times so uh we have made a number of Investments over time and and I think we're quite happy about that.</p>

### EQT的创立与私募股权的价值

主持人：您提到了**EQT**，对于那些不了解它的人来说，它是一家非常成功的私募股权公司，在某种程度上是你们创立的。它是如何产生的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You mentioned e which is uh for those of you who don't know a very very successful private Equity company which uh in a way you well which you started up how did that come about?</p>
</details>

Marcus Wallenberg：它的产生是这样的：我们通过在美国的联系人，认识了一个名为**AEA Investors**（AEA投资者: 一家美国私募股权公司）的团体。我们了解了他们，并明白他们拥有一个庞大的联系网络，与美国大型公司的首席执行官们有联系，这些首席执行官在离开公司时仍有很大的发展潜力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It came about that um we got through contacts in the United States uh there was a group called the aea investors uh and uh we got to know them and understood uh that they had a big contact network with the CEOs of large or us corporations who at the time when they were leaving their companies still had a lot of mileage left in them.</p>
</details>

Marcus Wallenberg：他们利用这些首席执行官从工业角度发展**AEA**投资组合中的公司。这也成为了我们创立**EQT**时的原则之一，当时**Conor Johnson**和**Claus Dobeck**以及他们的团队创立了**EQT**。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And uh they used them to develop the companies in the AA portfolio from industrial point of view and that beame also one of the principles uh when we started E when Conor Johnson and CLA dobeck uh and their the teams started eqt.</p>
</details>

Marcus Wallenberg：这也在他们的传承中延续了下来。我认为他们做得非常出色。当他们将**EQT**作为一家公司上市时，他们还能够通过股票进入新的业务领域，例如亚洲的**Bearing Partners**等，这实际上为他们在世界不同地区提供了一个更广阔、更大的平台。所以，这些年来他们做得非常好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh and that has also followed their legacy over time and and uh I think that they've done a fantastic job when they listed uh e as a company they've also been able to uh with shares to get into new businesses such as bearing Partners in Asia and so on which have actually given them a much broader uh and much bigger platform uh in different parts of the world so they have done uh really well over these years.</p>
</details>

### 私募股权与上市公司投资的协同效应

主持人：您如何看待，因为我们挪威的主权财富基金在某种程度上处于类似的情况，我们拥有大型上市公司持股，然后问题是我们是否应该进入非上市公司市场。您认为将两者结合起来的论据是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And how you see cuz we are um the the Norwegian so wealth fund is in a way in somewhat similar situation we have you know large listed Holdings and then the question is should we go into the should we be allowed to be go into the unlisted Market what do you think what do you think are the arguments for having the two in tandem?</p>
</details>

Marcus Wallenberg：我认为我们都从中吸取了教训。它们一直相当独立运作，但我们双方在沟通中总是将这种关系描述为非常良好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I I think that we have both learned uh from it uh they have been operating quite independently but we always have had in our communication from both sides we have always talked to the relationship as a very good one.</p>
</details>

Marcus Wallenberg：我认为我们从他们那里学到的是如何在私人环境中运作，以及那里有哪些重要的事情。我认为他们也采纳了我们在上市公司中作为所有者的方式的许多价值观，并坚持长期主义，努力推动创新等等。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh I think that operating I think what we have learned from them is how do you operate uh in a private setting and what are the important things there uh I think they have taken a lot of the values that the way we have been owners in the public companies with them as well uh and stand for the long-term nness and trying to really push Innovation etc etc in them.</p>
</details>

Marcus Wallenberg：所以，我认为是的，并驾齐驱是很好的。从我的角度来看，这真的很好。我认为学习的问题非常重要，因为你真的必须看到，**EQT**教会了我们一件事，那就是你可以用不同的方式做事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I think yes it has been good to be side by side uh from from my perspective it's been really good and uh I think that the question of learning is so important because you really have to see uh and what has taught us one thing with eqt is that you can do things in a different way.</p>
</details>

Marcus Wallenberg：在私人环境中，你也可以在与公司的关系中更加灵活，与它们保持更紧密的联系，而不是作为一个大型业务中的少数所有者。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And you can uh being in a private setting uh you can also be more Nimble in your relationship to the companies and stay much much closer to them uh than if you are a minority owner in a big business.</p>

### 瑞典皇家工程科学院的角色

主持人：您谈到了学习，我很好奇，您是**Royal Swedish Academy of Engineering Sciences**（瑞典皇家工程科学院: 瑞典最古老的工程科学院，致力于推动工程科学发展）的主席。您从中获得了什么并带入到这个体系中？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You talk about learning I'm just curious you are PR at the Royal Swedish Academy of engineering yes what uh what are you taking from that and bringing into the system here?</p>
</details>

Marcus Wallenberg：您可以说我们称之为**IVA**的这个组织，它是世界上最古老的工程科学院。他们拥有一个非常非常强大的成员群体，拥有巨大的知识。这个群体所做的一切都是无偿的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I take that you could say we call it Eva this IBA this organization has it's the oldest engineering Academy in uh the world they have a very very strong membership group uh with uh immense knowledge in it everything that is being done in that group is done on a pro bono basis.</p>
</details>

Marcus Wallenberg：通过这样做，这个组织有可能在瑞典社会面临关于未来的困难讨论时提供帮助。例如，我们应该如何思考我们的能源状况？我们需要采取哪些政策措施来确保瑞典保持竞争力？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh by doing this uh this organization has the possibility to uh help out uh in Sweden so society when difficult discussions are there about the future I mean for example how should we think about our energy uh situation uh what other policy measures do we need to do uh to make sure that Sweden stays uh competitive uh so questions like that.</p>
</details>

Marcus Wallenberg：所以我们参与不同的项目，我们的成员能够并且愿意贡献他们的空闲时间来提供帮助。然后我们有机会与政府进行讨论，并将我们的意见纳入政治辩论中。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So we we engage in different projects and our members uh can and will uh give their free time to help out in and doing that and then we have the possibility to have discussion with government and give our input into the political debate.</p>
</details>

Marcus Wallenberg：所以它确实……在瑞典，我们经常谈论**三螺旋模型**（Triple Helix: 指政府、企业和学术界之间为促进创新和经济发展而形成的合作关系），即政府、企业和学术界之间的关系。可以说，**IVA**这个组织正处于这场讨论的中心。

<details>

### 创建“三螺旋模型”的关键

主持人：创建政府、私营部门和学术界之间这种“三螺旋模型”的关键是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What's the key to creating this Helix between government private and Academia?</p>

Marcus Wallenberg：我认为关键之一是开放，对讨论开放，对努力引入围绕某些问题的能力开放，这些能力实际上有助于国家发展。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think uh one of the key aspects is to be open open to the discussion uh open to that uh you try to bring in competence uh around certain questions that can actually be helpful for the development of the country.</p>

Marcus Wallenberg：并保持这种开放性，倾听彼此的意见，并希望将一些建议纳入决策过程，例如在政治领域。

### 领导力与人脉网络

主持人：Marcus，谈到领导力，您被广泛认为是这个地区拥有最广泛人脉的人。许多听众可能不知道**Rolodex**（名片索引器: 一种用于存储和查找联系人名片的旋转式桌面设备，象征着广泛的人脉网络）是什么，但在过去，我们桌上都有一个，我们会把名片塞进去，以便轻松找到它们。所以，这基本上是形容拥有庞大网络的一个词。为什么人脉网络很重要？

Marcus Wallenberg：首先，当然是您可能接触到的机会。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Number one of course uh opportunities that you may be introduced to.</p>
</details>

Marcus Wallenberg：我认为人脉网络以及了解世界各地正在发生的事情，对我们来说至关重要，因为我们与全球性企业紧密相连。

</details>

Marcus Wallenberg：你必须有可以与之交谈的人，在世界各地征求建议，倾听他们的观点。通过Zoom通话很难做到这一点，你必须花时间去认识这些人，在你可能不需要他们帮助的时候去认识他们，因为总有一天你可能需要他们的帮助。那时拥有这个人脉网络就非常有用了。

Marcus Wallenberg：当然。我的意思是，投入、精力、知识、判断力、在困难时期坚持下去并带领人们度过困难时期的力量，以及在高速扩张时期带领人们的力量。

<p class="english-text">Sure I I mean uh the engagement the uh the energy the knowledge the Judgment strength to carry on also in difficult times and lead people through difficult times but also lead people in times of great expansion.</p>
</details>

Marcus Wallenberg：这就是为什么在领导岗位上拥有合适的人才如此重要，他们要在特定时期为特定公司服务。因为有时公司需要经历一个非常困难的时期，这可能需要一个与处于强劲扩张阶段的公司领导者非常不同的领导者。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>

<p class="english-text">Has good leadership changed you think of the last 10 years does it take something else to be a good leader now?</p>

Marcus Wallenberg：不，我的意思是，想想这些跨国公司。他们实际上可以做到，他们不必前往某些国家召开全体员工会议，他们可以通过Zoom召开三次全体员工会议，无需移动，然后他们就可以覆盖所有时区。所以，这有助于你以非常不同的方式运营公司。

<details>

### 领导者发展与跨公司经验

主持人：这需要强大的心态来保持这种态度。那么，您如何看待在瓦伦堡体系内培养领导者？将人们从一家公司调到另一家公司，这种跨公司轮岗非常重要吗？

<details>

<p class="english-text">It takes a strong mindset to to have that attitude um but what um how do you think about um developing leaders within the wck sphere uh moving people from uh you know one company to the other company is cross yeah is cross fer fation very important?</p>
</details>

Marcus Wallenberg：极其重要，如果我们可以做到的话。我认为一些伟大的领导者是那些能够看到不同事物的人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Extremely uh if we can do it uh I think some of the great leaders are those who have uh the ability to have seen different things.</p>
</details>

Marcus Wallenberg：例如，您可以看到现在管理**Ericsson**的**Börje Ekholm**在之前在**Investor AB**做得非常好。如果您回顾我们集团的历史，那些多年来对家族非常有帮助的人，他们都做过很多不同的事情。

<details>

<p class="english-text">You can see for example bu eom who's now running Ericson did a very good job at er at the investor before that uh and uh if you look historically into our group the people who have been very helpful in helping the family over the years they all did uh a multitude of things.</p>
</details>

主持人：**Atlas Copco**似乎是某种首席执行官工厂。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Atlas seems to be some kind of CEO Factory it uh yes.</p>
</details>

Marcus Wallenberg：是的，他们做得非常好。为什么？**Atlas Copco**的一个方面是，在他们的公司结构中，他们将如此多的责任下放到了集团的不同部门。他们非常坚定地要求人们，即使是小企业，也要承担全部责任，这在公司中培养了许多优秀的领导者。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">They've done they've done really really well and why what is it with Atlas uh one of the aspects I think with Atlas is that they in their corporate structure they have pushed so much responsibility into different parts of the group they they're really very firm on people even for small businesses to take full responsibility and that has created many good leaders in that company.</p>
</details>

主持人：对于那些没有听过的人，我们也与**Atlas Copco**的前首席执行官做过播客，我们谈论了这些事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And for those of you who haven't heard it we have also done a podcast with the ex CEO of Atlas where we talk about these kind of things M absolutely really really uh fascinating.</p>
</details>

Marcus Wallenberg：绝对如此，非常非常引人入胜。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Absolutely really really uh fascinating.</p>
</details>

主持人：然后你们过一段时间就把他们调去当董事长，这是怎么运作的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</p>
</details>

Marcus Wallenberg：这通常是非常好的事情，因为与一些首席执行官合作多年后，我们彼此了解，我们知道我们共享价值观，这在他们担任董事长时非常重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's been generally a very very good thing um because having worked with some of these CEOs over many years uh and uh then we gotten to know each other uh we know know that we share values uh which is very important when they take on chairs chair mes.</p>
</details>

### 有效董事长的特质

主持人：一个有效的董事长需要具备什么？您见过最好的董事长是谁？除了您自己之外。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What makes a chair effective what's the best chair you've seen apart from apart from yourself of [Laughter] course?</p>
</details>

Marcus Wallenberg：我见过许多杰出的董事长。是什么让他们有效？我认为是他们的存在感，你知道，他们运用自己的智慧和经验，真正地展望未来，无所不知，知道哪里可能会出错，并确保与管理层讨论这些问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I've seen I I've seen many Fantastic chairs what makes them effective uh I think the uh presence you know applying their wisdom and and experiences really forward looking uh all Al knowing where things can go wrong and see to you know to address those subjects with the management very when.</p>
</details>

主持人：您说“存在感”是什么意思？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You say presence what do you mean?</p>
</details>

Marcus Wallenberg：我相信，好的董事长通常会相当积极地参与公司事务，即使在特定环境中也是如此。当然，这取决于您在哪种司法管辖区工作，因为在许多资本市场中，董事长与公司关系更紧密，几乎是半执行型的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I I believe that uh good shairs usually engage themselves with the companies uh quite a bit uh even in the setting I mean this of course depends in which jurisdiction you're working because in in many many jurisdictions uh many capital markets chairs are much much closer they're almost half executive.</p>
</details>

Marcus Wallenberg：但在瑞典或北欧的模式中，我们当然有非执行董事长。但在我们这个地区，那些与公司和管理层保持非常紧密联系的董事长，我认为往往表现得非常好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</p>
</details>

主持人：我们把董事长和首席运营官的角色分开。这重要吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We split the the chair and the COO role yes is that important?</p>
</details>

Marcus Wallenberg：我认为这对我们来说运作得非常好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh I think uh that has worked out really well for us yeah.</p>
</details>

主持人：为什么？为什么在美国等地他们仍然保持另一种做法？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And why does it why do they still keep the other way of doing it in America for instance?</p>
</details>

Marcus Wallenberg：这是一个有趣的问题，因为他们似乎也做得很好。所以这里可能没有一个绝对的答案。但我认为，支持我们模式的理由是，首席执行官也需要有人可以交谈。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well it's interesting question because they seem to be doing quite well as well and and so there maybe not any colum egg here but I I I think that I think what speaks to our model uh which is is very good is that also CEO needs somebody to talk to.</p>
</details>

Marcus Wallenberg：我认为首席执行官和董事长之间存在这种关系，因为管理一家公司也可能相当孤独。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh and I think those relationships where CEOs and chairs have that relationship where uh because it running a company can also be quite lonely absolutely absolutely.</p>
</details>

Marcus Wallenberg：绝对如此。因此，我认为这种模式是有效的。它也有效，因为董事长在亲近公司时既可以挑战也可以支持。但这当然要求董事长有足够的时间与公司在一起，并真正了解正在发生的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And uh therefore I think that model Works uh it also works because uh chairs can both Challenge and support when they get close but that you know that of course demands that the chairs have enough time to spend with the companies and really understand what's going on.</p>
</details>

### 股权结构与投票权

主持人：在我们的基金中，我们认为一股一票，但您不完全认同这个观点。您介意解释一下您是如何看待这个问题的吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now in um uh in our fund we have the view that one share should have one vote uh but you don't quite share that view could you you mind just explaining how you how you look at it?</p>
</details>

Marcus Wallenberg：我这样看待它：它确实发生了。它的基础是一种契约权利。拥有这种权利的公司在某个时间点达成了协议，拥有这种权利。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh I look upon it this way that uh it happens I mean at at the base of it it's a contractual right uh these companies that have it have have made an agreement at one point in time yeah to uh have that.</p>
</details>

Marcus Wallenberg：这通常发生在公司由企业家发展起来，他们需要更多资本，并在此过程中发现他们的存在和影响力非常重要。当时的投资者也认为这是一个非常重要的想法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It has very often been situations where uh companies have been developed by by entrepreneurs who uh needed to go for more capital and uh doing so found that their presence and their possibility to influence was very very important uh and the U and the investors at the time uh thought that also that was a very important idea.</p>
</details>

Marcus Wallenberg：我认为在我们这个地区，我们有一个非常非常透明的制度。作为投资者，您可以自由选择购买您想要购买的股票类型。您可以决定是否要投资那家公司。我意识到有些人可能不想投资那种公司，但我认为这是一个非常大的契约权利问题，以及您如何看待它作为开展业务的一个重要因素。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh I think that in our part of the world uh we have a very very transparent system around this you are free as an investor to buy the type of share that you want to buy you can decide if you want to buy into that company or not I realize that some people may not want to invest in that kind of company but I I I think there is a very big question of contractual right uh and how you uh look upon that as as an important factor of doing business.</p>
</details>

主持人：我们通常会投票反对这类事情，但在瓦伦堡家族的公司中我们不会，因为在我们购买股票时，这种结构已经存在，我们是带着开放的心态进入的。所以我们不会在这里制造太多噪音。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well we typically vote against these kind of things right but in the case of the wenberg companies we don't because it was in place when we bought the shares and we went into it with open eyes and so so we are we are not making uh too much noise here.</p>
</details>

### 个人爱好与心智刷新

主持人：现在，我们有一些共同的放松方式——帆船和越野滑雪。请告诉我，因为我知道您脸上带着笑容。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now rounding off um we have a couple of uh uh ways of uh relaxing in common um sailing and CrossCountry skiing yes tell me about it because I know you have a see a smile on your face here so why not the first time uh uh no what is it it's it's about the vast expanse isn't it yeah yeah it's the vast expans yeah being on the ocean or being up in the the mountains and uh I find that to be uh very good for my mind at least so.</p>
</details>

Marcus Wallenberg：不，那是什么？是关于广阔的空间，不是吗？是的，是广阔的空间。在海上或在山中，我发现这对我的心智非常有益。

<details>

<p class="english-text">So why not the first time uh uh no what is it it's it's about the vast expanse isn't it yeah yeah it's the vast expans yeah being on the ocean or being up in the the mountains and uh I find that to be uh very good for my mind at least so.</p>
</details>

主持人：我读过一本关于建筑的书，好的建筑的关键在于重复和变化的结合。我认为帆船和越野滑雪都具备这一点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I read a book on architecture and uh one of the keys to good architecture is the combination of repetition and variation and I think both thec and cross country skiing area have that.</p>
</details>

Marcus Wallenberg：我同意。除此之外，我认为某些运动或活动实际上有助于你的心智，让你思考一些与平时不同的事情。我确实相信这可能是刷新大脑最重要的途径，就是让你的思绪专注于不同的事物。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I agree and I I in addition to that I think that uh some sports or some activities actually helps your mind yeah to think about something different uh than than what you usually do and I I I do believe that is maybe the most important way to refresh your brain is that you keep your mind on something different.</p>
</details>

主持人：您读什么书？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What do you read?</p>
</details>

Marcus Wallenberg：实际上读很多不同的东西，历史、时事。我现在正在读一本关于19世纪至今瑞典-芬兰关系的书，非常有趣，尤其是在我们现在所处的时代。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Many different things actually uh history current situations uh I'm actually reading right now a book on Swedish-Finnish relationship back uh from the 1800s to now very interesting especially in the time that we live in right now.</p>
