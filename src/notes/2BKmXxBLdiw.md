### 创伤迷恋：为何“道理都懂却难以改变”？

大家好，我是Anthony。欢迎来到我的频道。在本期视频中，我们将继续探讨**创伤迷恋**（Trauma Fascination: 一种长期被有毒关系吸引并受其伤害的心理模式），以及如何寻找到一段良好的亲密关系。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Hello everyone, I am Anthony. Welcome to my channel. In this video we continue to discuss trauma fascination. How to find a good relationship.</p>
</details>

在之前的视频中，我们探讨了几个创伤迷恋的案例，即一个人长期被有毒关系吸引并受其伤害。我们总结了创伤迷恋的几个特征。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Previous video. We explored several cases of trauma obsession. That is, a person. Chronically attracted to and hurt by toxic relationships. We have summarized several characteristics of trauma obsession.</p>
</details>

首先，在亲密关系中，当事双方常常会反复尝试修复过去的创伤，他们会想方设法改变对方，投入更多的情感资源，希望“这一次”能够弥补过去未完成的情感体验。然而，这种修复努力通常是徒劳的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">First of all, In intimate relationships, the parties often. Repeated attempts to repair past trauma. They will try every possible way to change each other. Invest more emotional resources. Hopefully "this time". Can make up for the emotional experience that was not completed in the past. However. Such repair efforts are usually in vain.</p>
</details>

其次，在创伤迷恋中，当事方常常会经历严重的**退行**（Regression: 心理防御机制，指个体在压力下回到早期发展阶段的行为模式），例如**非黑即白思维**（Black and White Thinking: 一种极端化的认知模式，将事物简单分为好或坏），以及一种原始的赎罪感或内疚感，认为只有通过极端的自我牺牲和忍受痛苦才能获得爱或认可。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Second is in trauma obsession. The parties involved often experience severe regression. For example, black and white thinking. and a primitive sense of atonement or guilt. think. Only through extreme self-sacrifice and endurance of suffering. To gain love or recognition.</p>
</details>

当然，更重要的是，有时当事方能够理解这段关系是有毒的，存在严重问题，但仍然感到一种强烈而不可抗拒的吸引力，持续深陷其中。而这个过程，似乎很难用言语表达和理解。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Of course, more importantly. Sometimes the parties involved can understand. This relationship is toxic. There are serious problems. But still feel a strong irresistible attraction. Keep getting involved. And this process. It seems difficult to express and understand with words.</p>
</details>

当有人问：“你为什么继续维持这段糟糕的关系？”时，当事方可能会给出自相矛盾、模棱两可的答案，或者用一些抽象空洞的词语来回避。或者他们会说：“你是对的，但我就是做不到。”这种“道理都懂，但就是做不到”的现象其实相当普遍。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">When someone asks. Why do you continue to maintain this bad relationship? The parties may give a self-contradictory answer. An inconclusive answer. Or use some abstract and empty words to avoid. Or they would say, you are right. But I just can't do it. This kind of truth is understood. But it is impossible to do. It's actually quite common.</p>
</details>

这也提醒我们，仅仅通过阅读和思考心理学知识，为何往往难以取得突破。那么本期视频，我们就来简单探讨一下这个话题。如果您对今天的视频感兴趣，或者有任何想与我讨论的话题，可以通过我的邮箱进行预约。现在，让我们回到今天的主题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It also reminds us. Simply by reading and thinking about psychology. Why breakthroughs are often so difficult to achieve. Then this video. Let’s briefly discuss this topic. If you are interested in today's video. or. Do you have any topic you want to discuss with me? You can contact my email to make an appointment. So let's get back to our topic today.</p>
</details>

### 显性知识与内隐记忆的差异

首先，当一个人说他“懂得道理，但就是做不到”时，他所说的“道理”指的是那些能够被意识提取和反思、能够被言语化和符号化的内容。我们通常所说的知识和记忆，都属于这一范畴。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">First of all, when a person says that he "understands the truth. But I just can't do it". What he said was "truth". refers to the ability to be consciously extracted and reflected upon. Content that can be verbalized and symbolized. What we usually call knowledge and memory. All belong to this category.</p>
</details>

例如，数学定理、历史事件、语言和语法规则、词语的含义、科学理论等，这些都是可以在意识层面被看到、用语言表达和讨论的事物，也可以通过语言和符号不断修正我们的理解。因此，在这些领域，如果我们获得了更准确的知识和记忆，就能够自动纠正和修改错误的知识。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">For example, mathematical theorems, historical events, Language and grammar rules, the meaning of words, Scientific theories, etc. They are all things that can be seen at the conscious level. Use language to express and discuss. It can also be achieved through language and symbols. To constantly correct your understanding. Therefore, in these areas. if. We gain more accurate knowledge and memory. Automatically correct and modify the wrong knowledge.</p>
</details>

然而，认知科学告诉我们，记忆并非单一，它可以分为**外显记忆**（Explicit Memory: 能够被有意识地回忆和表达的记忆，如事实和事件）和**内隐记忆**（Implicit Memory: 无意识的记忆，通过经验而非有意识的回忆来影响行为）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">However, cognitive science tells us. Memory is not singular. It can be divided into explicit memory and implicit memory.</p>
</details>

外显记忆就是我们日常生活中所说的记忆，而内隐记忆的主要特点是它非言语、无意识，难以通过直接的语言反思来捕捉。个体只是知道如何去做，但不知道具体是什么以及为什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Explicit memory is what we call memory in everyday life. The main characteristics of implicit memory are. It is non-verbal and unconscious. is difficult to capture through direct linguistic reflection. Individuals just know how to do it. But I don't know what and why.</p>
</details>

例如，如何跳舞、如何开车、如何骑自行车等。当你学会骑自行车后，即使多年不骑，也不会忘记，这就是通过内隐记忆获得的技能。但这种记忆主要依赖于重复的行为模式所创造的熟悉感，而非通过语言进行有意识的回忆。因此，当你骑自行车时，无需集中精力思考如何行动，就能自动化地完成任务。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">For example, how to dance, how to drive. How to ride a bike etc. When you learn to ride a bike. Even though I haven't ridden a bike for many years. I will never forget. This is the skill acquired through implicit memory. But this memory. Relies mainly on repeated behavior patterns. The familiar feeling created. Rather than conscious recall through language. So when you ride your bike. No need to concentrate on thinking about how to act. To automate tasks.</p>
</details>

如果你试图有意识地用语言思考骑自行车，将每个动作分解成具体步骤，例如“我应该先左转，把车把向左转，再调整重心保持平衡”，这反而会干扰本能的动作，让你无法再骑自行车。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If you try to think consciously. Cycling with language. Break down each action into specific steps. For example, I should turn left first. Turn the car to the left. Then adjust the center of gravity to maintain balance. This interferes with the instinctive action. I can't ride a bike anymore.</p>
</details>

### 内隐关系认知及其影响

最重要的内隐记忆，是人类如何与他人相处的知识，即**内隐关系认知**（Implicit Relational Knowing: 关于如何与他人互动和建立关系的无意识知识）。这种知识是个体在与他人建立亲密关系时逐渐形成的，关于如何与他人互动的知识。它并非以语言的形式存在，而是通过非言语、情感和互动的方式，潜移默化地影响着我们的行为和互动模式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The most important implicit memory. The knowledge of how humans get along with others. That is, implicit relational knowing. This knowledge. When an individual establishes a close relationship with another. Gradually formed. Knowledge about how to interact with others. This knowledge does not exist in the form of language. Rather, it is through non-verbal, emotional and interactive means. Subtly. Influencing our behavior and interaction patterns.</p>
</details>

例如，一个5岁的孩子偶然有了一个想法，开始在纸上画画，他的父母表扬了他，他感到很高兴。事后，他可能完全忘记了自己曾被表扬过，然而，他自发的探索行为与被表扬的愉快体验联系起来，并将其内化为一种与他人互动的方式。长大后，他可能对自己的自发探索行为持乐观态度，潜意识里倾向于认为别人会欣赏自己。事实上，他常常说不出这种乐观态度的证据和依据，即使收到一些负面反馈，他主观上仍倾向于相信自己的探索会有好结果。而另一些人，则必须看到非常现实的回报和反馈，才敢于探索一些事物。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">For example, a 5-year-old child. An idea came to me by chance. He began to draw on paper. His parents praised him. He is happy. afterwards. He may have completely forgotten that he was praised. However, his exploration of spontaneity. Connect with the pleasant experience of being praised. and internalize it as a way of interacting with others. After growing up. He may be interested in his own spontaneous exploratory behavior. The results are optimistic. Subconsciously tend to think that others will appreciate you. In fact, he often can't say it. Evidence and basis for this optimistic outlook. Even if you receive some negative feedback. But he tends to believe subjectively. Your own exploration will have good results. While others. is. You must see very realistic rewards and feedback. Dare to explore some things.</p>
</details>

我们可以这样打个比方：内隐关系认知就像一个心理账户或银行。一个人想做一些自发的事情，他没有看到明确的反馈，也未必能获得周围大多数人的支持和认可。如果他拥有更多积极的内隐关系认知，也就是说，当他认为自己最终会获得他人的支持时，他就可以从这个心理银行中提前支取一部分“资金”，作为自己行动的启动资金。他内隐地知道，未来能够获得回报。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We can make an analogy like this. Implicit relational knowledge. Like a psychological account or bank. A person wants to do something spontaneous. He doesn't see clear feedback. not necessarily. Gain support and recognition from most people around you. If he has more positive implicit relational knowledge. That is. When he thinks he will eventually gain the support of others. So. He can draw from this psychological bank. Advance part of capital. As start-up capital for your own business. He implicitly knew. You can get rewards in the future.</p>
</details>

由于这种“知道”是内隐的，当事人可能无法清晰地、有计划地表达出来，所以对外人看来，这似乎是一种非理性的行为。但从他内隐的关系认知来看，他是非常理性的，并且他可能会坚持下去，并取得成功。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Since this “knowing” is implicit. The parties involved may not be able to express themselves clearly and planfully. So to outsiders it seems. This seems like irrational behavior. But from his implicit relational knowledge. He is very rational. And he might stick with it. And achieved success.</p>
</details>

而另一些人，则需要看到非常现实和具体的回报才会行动，无法预测和想象暂时看不到结果的事情。这意味着他的心理账户更难获得资金支持，结果就是他的行动更加保守、谨慎和传统。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Others. You need to see very realistic and concrete returns. To act. There is no way to predict and imagine. Things that can't see results for the time being. This means that it is more difficult to finance his mental account. The result is. His actions are more conservative, cautious and traditional.</p>
</details>

即使他理性上知道，人要大胆尝试才能成功，不要过于害怕不确定性和变化，并且他阅读了大量从经济学、社会学、心理学等多个角度论证这一观点的书籍，深知其正确性。然而，他个人的行为和做事风格却依然可能非常保守。因为他的阅读和思考，仅仅纠正了外显记忆，但却可能无法纠正他消极的内隐关系认知。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Even if he knows rationally. People have to be bold to try in order to succeed. Don’t be too afraid of uncertainty and change. Then he read a lot of books. From many perspectives such as economics, sociology, psychology, etc. How correct is this argument? However, his personal behavior and style of doing things. But it can still be very conservative. Because of his reading and thinking. Just corrected the explicit memory. But it may not be able to correct his negative. Implicit relational knowledge.</p>
</details>

我相信大家还记得，在关于统计思维的视频中也曾提到，当我们仅仅依靠统计数据来指导生活时，我们可能会忽略自身那些无法被量化、预测和统计的特质。这些特质与我们的成长轨迹、生命中的关键时刻紧密相关，往往你甚至都没有意识到它们的存在。例如，我们今天提到的内隐关系认知，这些内隐的事物虽然无法被统计，但却极其重要，甚至是决定性的变量。这是每个人最独特的部分，它看起来像某种超越理性的东西，但从其内心世界和情感体验来看，其实是非常合理的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I believe everyone still remembers. In the video about statistical thinking. Also mentioned. When we rely solely on statistics. To guide your life. We may neglect our own. Those that cannot be quantified. Predicted and Statistical Features. These characteristics are related to our growth trajectory, The key moments in life are closely related. Often, you don’t even realize it. For example, the implicit relational knowledge we mentioned today. Although these implicit things cannot be counted. But it is extremely important. Even the decisive variable. This is the most unique part of every person. It looks like something beyond reason. But from his inner world and emotional experience. It's actually very reasonable.</p>
</details>

因此，我们说内隐关系认知常常是由非言语情境塑造的，这要求我们关注语言之下的体验和生活环境。例如，如果一个孩子经常看到父母之间温柔地交谈，表达亲密，那么这个孩子就会感到这种家庭氛围让他放松、舒适，他会觉得爱情和婚姻是美好的事物。他可能没有意识到自己从父母那里学会了如何相处，但在他未来与伴侣的关系中，这一切都会自动复制。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Therefore, we say. Implicit relational knowledge. Often shaped by non-verbal context. This requires us to pay attention to the experience beneath the language. and living environment. For example, if a child. I often see parents talking to each other tenderly. Express intimacy. Then the child will feel. This kind of family atmosphere makes him relax. Comfortable. He will feel that love and marriage are beautiful things. He may not realize. I learned how to get along with my parents. But in his future relationship with his partner. It will automatically replicate all of this.</p>
</details>

而如果一个孩子，拥有一个情感上疏离、冷漠的父亲，以及一个常常歇斯底里的母亲，他可能没有意识到父母婚姻中的不幸福，也不会与任何人谈论，因为他从小就预感到这是一个禁忌话题。结果，他会内隐地习得一种对亲密关系的悲观预期。当关系中出现冲突时，他倾向于通过冷漠、疏远，甚至直接切断联系来避免沟通。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And if a child. Having an emotionally withdrawn, cold father. and a mother who was often hysterical. He may not realize. Unhappiness in parents’ marriage. I won't talk to anyone. Because he had a premonition since he was a child. This is a taboo topic. As a result, he will implicitly. Acquire a pessimistic expectation of intimacy. When there is conflict in a relationship. He tends to avoid communication. Through indifference, alienation. Even directly cutting off contact.</p>
</details>

如果你问他如何评价自己的原生家庭，他可能会给出回避的答案，例如“还行”、“差不多”、“就这样”。但这些语言并不重要，因为他本身就是一种深度的防御，他倾向于隐藏自己的感受，担心流露真情会带来痛苦。接着，他可能会戴上理性的面具，来掩盖自己的回避。例如，他认为一个人对他人有情感需求是依赖的表现，而人的独立性才是最重要的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If you ask him how he evaluates his original family. He might give an evasive answer. For example, "It's OK". “Almost” “Just like that”. But the languages ​​are not important. Because he himself is a kind of deep defense. He tends to hide his feelings. Worried about revealing true feelings. It will bring pain. then. He may put on a mask of rationality. To cover up one's avoidance. for example. He believes that a person has an emotional need for others. It is a manifestation of dependence. Human independence is the most important.</p>
</details>

他也可能会借鉴大量的心理学概念，例如将自己的回避描述为有边界感、界限清晰的表现。当事人的这些言语，听起来相当理性、不带情感。然而，这些言语背后隐藏的，是深层的恐惧、不安和困惑。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">He may also draw on a lot of psychological concepts. for example. Describing one's avoidance as having a sense of boundaries, Clearly defined performance. These words of the parties involved. Seems quite rational. Emotionless. However, behind these words. Hidden is a deep fear, Feelings of uneasiness and confusion.</p>
</details>

### 体验与关系：疗愈创伤的关键

我遇到过一些这样的朋友，他们有一些人际创伤，感到痛苦，于是开始阅读大量关于心理学和关系理论的书籍，持续进行自我分析。他们的知识水平和自我分析的深度都相当深刻。然而，这一切却并没有显著地改善他们的状态，他们依然回避并害怕进入一段关系。因为阅读、思考和自我分析本身，难以重写和访问内隐记忆。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I have met some friends like this. They have some interpersonal trauma. Feeling pain. So they started. Read a lot about psychology and relationship theory. Continuous self-analysis. Their level of knowledge and depth of self-analysis. They're all quite profound. 然而这一切却并没有显著地改善. Their status. Still avoiding and afraid to enter into a relationship. Because reading, thinking and self-analysis itself. It is difficult to rewrite and access implicit memory.</p>
</details>

真正的关键在于新的关系和新的体验。我们应该明白，就修复创伤的目标而言，对创伤的理论分析永远无法替代一段真实而健康的关系。正如一位心理治疗师所说：“患者需要的是体验，而不是解释。”换句话说，患者更需要一段关系，而不是一个解释为何如此的理由。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The real key. New relationships and new experiences. We should understand. In terms of the goal of repairing trauma. Theoretical Analysis of Trauma. There is never a substitute for a real and healthy relationship. As one psychotherapist put it: Patients want experiences, not explanations. In other words, patients need a relationship. Better than needing a reason to explain why.</p>
</details>

那么，我们如何利用人际关系来重写我们的内隐关系认知呢？心理学家**Lyons-Ruth**（Lyons-Ruth: 著名心理学家，专注于依恋理论和主体间性研究）在一篇文章中指出：传统的精神分析强调解释的重要性，即通过解释使被压抑的冲动和幻想意识化。然而，仅仅解释不足以带来改变。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So how do we use interpersonal relationships? To rewrite our implicit relational knowledge? Psychologist Lyons-Ruth said in this article: Traditional psychoanalysis emphasizes the importance of interpretation. That is, by explaining. Make repressed impulses and fantasies conscious. However, explanations alone are not enough to bring about change.</p>
</details>

作者认为，在心理治疗中，真正重要的是那些特殊的时刻，即双方建立深度联结的瞬间。此时，治疗师不再是仅仅对患者潜意识冲动进行解释和分析的理论专家，也不是一块白板或镜子，而是也要投入到自己真实的存在中，投入自己的情感，并与患者进行情感互动。作者称之为**主体间会面**（Intersubjective Meeting: 心理治疗中治疗师与患者之间深层情感互动和相互影响的时刻），即主体间的沟通。这种情感互动和共鸣，往往比语言更能触及一个人的自我认同，整合并重写对方僵化、不健康的内隐关系认知。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The author believes. In psychotherapy. What really matters are those special moments. That is the moment when the two parties establish a deep link. at this time. The therapist is no longer a. Simply on the patient's subconscious impulse. Theoretical experts who interpret and analyze. Not a blank slate or mirror. But also into their own real existence. Invest your emotions. and interact emotionally with patients. The author calls it an intersubjective meeting. That is, inter-subjective communication. This kind of emotional interaction and resonance. Often more than language can touch a person's self-identity. Integrate and rewrite the other party's rigid, Unhealthy implicit relationship knowledge.</p>
</details>

这不仅限于心理治疗，它可以延伸到所有的人际关系。也就是说，真正有益的人际关系，都建立在双方能够感受彼此、承认彼此情绪，并通过互动实现情感协调和联结的基础上。任何促进情感共鸣和协调的关系，都能为我们的身心健康带来巨大的益处。例如，它能减少**皮质醇**（Cortisol: 一种由肾上腺分泌的应激激素，长期高水平可能对健康有害）等应激激素的分泌，增强个体的心理韧性等。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This is not limited to psychotherapy. It can be extended to all interpersonal relationships. That is, truly beneficial interpersonal relationships. All are built on. In which both parties can feel each other. Acknowledge each other's emotions. And through interaction. Achieving emotional coordination and connection based on. Any relationship that promotes emotional resonance and coordination. It can be beneficial to our physical and mental health. Brings great benefits. For example, it reduces the secretion of stress hormones such as cortisol. Enhance individual psychological resilience, etc.</p>
</details>

在这种情感协调的过程中，语言和符号表达并非唯一的方式。虽然语言很重要，但情感联结也高度依赖于非言语互动，例如眼神接触、身体触碰、亲吻等。这些非符号的互动往往更深刻，即使在言语交流中，语言之下的情感状态也同样值得关注。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In this process of emotional coordination. Language and symbolic expression. Not the only way. Although language is important. But emotional connection. It is also highly dependent on non-verbal interaction. Such as eye contact, body touching, kissing, etc. These non-symbolic interactions are often more profound. Even if you speak. Emotional states beneath language. It is also worth paying attention to the content of the language.</p>
</details>

### “废话”的治愈力量

例如，有些人认为良好的亲密关系就是两个人每天讨论严肃深刻的知识，互相分析，旁征博引。然而，我认为良好的亲密关系，双方应该能够说很多“废话”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">For example, some people think. Good intimate relationship. It's just two people discussing serious and profound knowledge every day. Mutual Analysis. Side game. However, I think. Good intimate relationship. Both sides should be able to talk a lot of nonsense.</p>
</details>

所谓“废话”，就是那些没有太多意义、时效性不高的信息。这些看似微不足道、甚至有些无聊的对话，恰恰能让我们在交流时，无需过度思考每句话的含义，不因过度的自我审查而产生情感负担。它还能创造大量的即时情感反馈和互动。例如，路过一家餐厅，我们可以吐槽这家店的装修很丑；又例如，在街上看到一只特别大的狗，开心地拉着彼此一起看。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So-called nonsense. Those without much meaning. Information with low timeliness. These seem insignificant. Even boring conversations. It just enables us to communicate. No need to overthink the meaning of every sentence. Not due to excessive self-censorship. The emotional burden. It can also create a large number of. Instant emotional feedback and interaction. For example, passing by a restaurant. Let's complain about this store's ugly decoration. Another example is seeing a particularly large dog on the street. Happy to pull each other to watch together.</p>
</details>

这种分享琐碎、无意义情感的方式，更容易创造一个可以自由表达感受的交流空间。在亲密关系中，这种对话的氛围，比对话的内容本身更具疗愈性。总而言之，和喜欢的人聊聊天，一起睡睡觉，很多心理问题都会好起来。这是保持身心健康的最好方式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Sharing trivial, meaningless emotions like this. It's easier. Create a communication space where people can express their feelings freely. In an intimate relationship. The atmosphere of this conversation. It is more healing than the content of the conversation. Overall. Chat with the people you like. Sleeping together. Many psychological problems will get better. This is the best way to stay healthy.</p>
</details>
