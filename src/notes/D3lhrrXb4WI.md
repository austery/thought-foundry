### 对国家现状的深切忧虑

**主持人：** 副总统女士，您好吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Host:** Madame Vice President, how are you doing?</p>
</details>

**哈里斯：** 我很好，我很好。总的来说，我很好，我的家人身体健康，所以我从这一点说起。但除此之外，你知道，这是一个令人不安的时期。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Harris:** I am well. I am well. I mean, all things considered, I am well. My family is in good health, so I start there. But otherwise, you know, it's a troubling time.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 当您说“总的来说”，这其中包含了哪些复杂的情绪？全貌是怎样的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Host:** What are the full range of emotions when you said, "all things considered"? What's the full picture there?</p>
</details>

**哈里斯：** 我的情绪包罗万象，从感恩和备受祝福，到对我们国家乃至整个世界的状况感到极度困扰、失望和担忧。就像许多看新闻、读新闻的人一样，内心充满焦虑，不知道接下来会发生什么。我常常发现自己对别人说，情况在好转之前可能会变得更糟。因此，对这一点的认知，或许还有预感，我想这让我和许多人都感到惴惴不安。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Harris:** Everything from grateful and feeling very blessed, to extremely troubled, disappointed, and concerned of the state of our country and, by extension, the world. Like a lot of people who are watching the news and reading the news, there's a state of anxiety about what will happen next. I often have found myself saying to people, it may get worse before it gets better. And so the knowledge of that, perhaps the anticipation of that, I think keeps me and many others on edge.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 您真的相信情况会先变得更糟吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Host:** Do you believe that? Do you believe it could get worse before it gets better?</p>
</details>

**哈里斯：** 我认为这很有可能。实际上，在我的新书巡回宣传期间，我每天都对观众这么说，结果在一个城市说完，第二天就真的发生了什么事。这届政府有很多事情都非常难以预测，尽管其中几乎所有事情我当初都预见到了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Harris:** I think it's very possible. Every day... because actually during the book tour, I've said it to audiences, and in one city, and then the next day something happens. There's a lot that's very unpredictable about this administration. Although, there is almost all of it that I did predict.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 我知道您只有107天的时间去潜在地干预历史的进程，但是当您看到这些您所提到的、引发您挫败感和些许焦虑的事情正在发生时，您是否会有一种奇怪的责任感？因为……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Host:** Now, I know you only had 107 days to potentially intervene in the course of history, but when you see these things playing out that you're referring to that incite those feelings you have of frustration, a little bit of anxiety, etc., do you feel a sense of like responsibility in a weird way? Because there was a percentage chance of sort of intervening in these things. This is a complex question to ask, but it's...</p>
</details>

**哈里斯：** 我确实会思考，如果当初结果不同，情况会有多大的不同。我从那些正遭受可怕影响的人们的角度思考这个问题。我想到现在有那么多人生活在彻底的恐惧之中，害怕被攻击，害怕成为仇恨的目标，更不用说面对各种虚假信息了。是的，我确实会想。而且我知道，我竞选美国总统的那场选举，其结果就是现在所发生的这一切。如果结果不同，情况会非常、非常不一样。不过我告诉你，我尽量不让自己过多地这样想，因为无论好坏，我真的喜欢专注于当下。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Harris:** I do think about how different it could have been. I do think about it in the context of the number of people who are being impacted in such a horrible way. I think of it in terms of the number of people who are existing and living in utter fear right now, afraid of being attacked or afraid of being targeted with hate, much less misinformation. Yeah, I do. And I know that the race that I ran for president of the United States, the outcome of that election is what has happened, and it would have been different. It would have been very different. I try not to allow myself to think too much this way, I will tell you that, because for better and worse, I really do like to be centered on the present.</p>

### 在民权运动中塑造的价值观

**主持人：** 那么，让我们回到起点。我想了解是怎样的环境塑造了像您这样的人，因为您是一个“异数”。您的职业生涯中有很多“第一”，但如果我们从头说起，是什么样的背景塑造了一个人在其职业生涯中成为如此与众不同的人？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Host:** So, let's go. I want to understand the set of circumstances that created someone like you because you're an anomaly. There's a lot of firsts that appear in your career, but if we start at the beginning, what is the context that shapes someone to become such an anomaly in their professional career?</p>
</details>

**哈里斯：** 我的父母以及抚养我长大的社区。我母亲19岁时独自一人从印度来到美国。在那个年轻的年纪，我母亲很自然地投身于加州伯克利和奥克兰的民权运动。在那里，她遇到了我的父亲，他曾是牙买加的一名国家级学者。他们相爱了，然后就有了我。我和妹妹出生在一个每个人都在为正义、自由和平等而奋斗的环境里。我们收到的每一个信息都是：你很重要，你有责任去思考你将如何参与其中。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Harris:** My parents and the community that raised me. My mother arrived from India in the United States at the age of 19 by herself. My mother naturally at that young age became aligned with the civil rights movement in Berkeley and Oakland, California. Met my father who had been a national scholar in Jamaica. They fell in love and here I am. My sister and I were born and we were born in an environment where everyone was fighting for justice and for freedom and for equality. Every message we got was you are important and you have a duty to figure out how you're going to participate.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 我在阅读您的故事时注意到，服务和帮助他人似乎已经深深地融入了您的基因。我们甚至和您的丈夫道格聊过，他告诉我一个关于你们第一次约会的故事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Host:** I noticed this as I was reading through your story, how service and helping others seems to be so interwoven into your DNA. And even we spoke to Doug, your husband, and he was telling me a story about your first date with him.</p>
</details>

**哈里斯：** 他告诉您什么了？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Harris:** What did he tell you?</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 显然，您在第一次约会时就说，您来这里是为了帮助人民、服务人民。他告诉了我很多事，我有很多页关于道格所说的笔记。非常有趣。顺便说一句，他非常爱您。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Host:** Well, apparently you made a remark on that first date that you're here to help people and to serve people. He told me many things. I have many pages of what Doug said. Very fascinating. He's very in love with you, by the way.</p>
</details>

**哈里斯：** 我也非常爱我的丈夫，而且他非常风趣。我希望您能感受到。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Harris:** I'm very in love with my husband and he's very funny. I hope you got a sense of...</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 他是个很搞笑的人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Host:** He was hilarious guy.</p>
</details>

**哈里斯：** 是的。我们俩的职业生涯截然不同，虽然都是律师。他一毕业就直接进入了私人执业领域。我从未想过要私人执业，对我来说，从来都与金钱无关，而总是关乎人民，以及我如何能从事保护人民、给予人民尊严的工作。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Harris:** Yeah. Well, he and I had such different careers, both of us being lawyers, right? He went immediately into private practice. I never wanted to be in private practice. It was never about money for me. It was always about people and how could I do the work that was about protecting people and giving people dignity.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 为什么是保护人民？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Host:** Why protecting people?</p>
</details>

**哈里斯：** 我想这很大程度上也与出生顺序有关。我是家里的长女。从我两岁起，我母亲就告诉我：“照顾好你的妹妹，看好你的妹妹。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Harris:** I think there's a lot that has to do also maybe with birth order. I'm the eldest. And from the age of 2 years old, my mother told me, "Take care of your sister. Look out for your sister."</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 您有各种各样的照片。我全都看过了。这是您的妹妹玛雅。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Host:** You've got all kinds of pictures. I've been through everything. Yeah. This is my sister Maya.</p>
</details>

**哈里斯：** 是的，那是我在保护她。此外，在成长过程中，我亲眼目睹了我母亲，一个身高5英尺、带着口音的棕色皮肤女性，会受到怎样的对待。她教会了我这一点，我的大家庭也教会了我。但后来我也亲身见证了确保所有人的尊严得到尊重和保护的重要性。因为我活到今天，看到了这种情况并非总是如此。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Harris:** And that's me protecting her. I grew up also, you know, seeing how my mother, who was a 5-ft tall brown woman with an accent, would be treated. She taught me this, my extended family taught me. But then I also witnessed the importance of making sure that all people, that their dignity is respected and protected. And I have lived a life to see where that doesn't always happen.</p>
</details>

### 从检察官到总检察长的职业生涯

**主持人：** 所以您决定专注于公共领域的法律工作。从那时起，您的职业生涯非常出色。您取得的成就确实非凡，我想这也是许多“第一”的由来。因为从24岁到51岁，您从地区副检察官一路晋升为加州总检察长，成为第一位担任这两个职位的女性和第一位黑人。在那段时间里，您领导了重大的改革，包括在2008年危机后为房主争取到250亿美元的救济金，发起了“重回正轨洛杉矶”康复计划，并使加州成为第一个强制要求司法人员佩戴随身摄像机的州，等等。到那时为止，您的职业生涯已经非常辉煌，本可以就此功成身退，庆祝一番。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Host:** So you decide to focus on law in public practice. You have a phenomenal career from that point onwards. It's really remarkable what you're able to accomplish and this is I guess where a lot of the firsts come in because from the age of 24 to 51 you rise from deputy district attorney to California's attorney general becoming the first woman and first black person to hold both roles. And you led major reforms in that time, including securing $25 billion in homeowner relief after the 2008 crisis, launching the back on track LA rehabilitation program, and making California the state the first state to mandate body cameras for justice agents and much more. An incredible career up until that point. That could have been it. You could have bowed out at that point and celebrated.</p>
</details>

**哈里斯：** 还有太多事情要做。我的一个优点也是缺点是，我喜欢解决问题，但这意味着一旦一个问题得到解决，我就会转向下一个，可能没有花时间给自己一些肯定，因为现在是时候处理下一个问题了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Harris:** There's so much more to be done. There's so much more to be done. I think one of my strengths and weaknesses is I like to solve problems, but that means that I tend to once a problem has been addressed, move on to the next one without maybe taking the time to pat myself on the back because now it's time to move on to the next issue.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 在您的职业生涯中，您见过一些可怕的事情。这是您工作的性质，您需要处理现实中最黑暗的部分。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Host:** During your career, you saw some horrific things. That's the nature of your job. You deal with the darkest parts of reality.</p>
</details>

**哈里斯：** 我见识过人性的行为和本质的某些部分。是的，您说得对。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Harris:** Parts of human behavior and nature I've seen. Yeah, you're right.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 能给我一些具体的例子吗？在现实中那意味着什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Host:** Give me some context there. What does that mean in reality?</p>
</details>

**哈里斯：** 有一段时间，我专门处理儿童性侵案件，这大概是所有虐待和犯罪中最可怕的一种，即成年人虐待儿童。这些案件处理起来非常困难，原因有很多。我记得有几个案子，孩子们太小了，无法出庭作证。其中一个是小学生小女孩。我记得我走进法院的洗手间哭了，因为我知道陪审团没有足够的证据来定罪。这让我心碎。多年以后，我仍然会想起那个小女孩。但这些案件，你知道，它们是人性中最坏的一面。我们作为一个社会，应该致力于保护儿童，保护他们的脆弱，让他们能够茁壮成长。我还起诉过凶杀案，起诉过欺诈案。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Harris:** Well, for a while I specialized in child sexual assault, which is about the most horrendous of abuse and crime, which is an adult abusing a child. And those cases were so difficult for so many reasons. I mean, there's a couple that I remember in particular where the children were so young that they wouldn't be able to testify. One was an elementary school little girl. And I remember going into the bathroom of the courthouse and crying because I knew a jury would not have enough to convict and it broke my heart. I have thought about that little girl, you know, years and years and years later. But those cases, you know, it's the worst of human behavior, which is we as a society should be in the business of protecting children and protecting their vulnerability so that they can thrive. I've prosecuted homicide cases. I've prosecuted fraud cases.</p>
</details>

### 应对高压的个人体系

**主持人：** 一个人如何应对所有这些压力和责任？我指的不仅仅是您担任总检察长期间，也包括之后竞选总统的起起落落，公众的反馈，潜在地管理自由世界、成为地球上最有权势的人的压力和责任，以及那些起伏、攻击和儿童虐待案件。一个人是如何学会应对的？您是否建立了一个框架？或者发展了什么理念或原则来应对如此巨大的压力？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Host:** How does one deal with all of this stress and responsibility? And I'm not just referring to your time as attorney general, but even thereafter with running for president and the ups and downs of that, the public feedback, the pressure, the responsibility of potentially running the free world basically and becoming the most powerful person on earth and the ups, the downs, the attacks, the child abuses. How does one learn? Is there a framework you've built? Is there are there ideas or principles that you've developed to deal with such pressure?</p>
</details>

**哈里斯：** 这可能听起来很老套，但我每天都锻炼。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Harris:** Well, this may sound trite, but I work out every day.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 真的吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Host:** Yeah.</p>
</details>

**哈里斯：** 我每天早上都锻炼，不管睡了多久。我发现这对我的思想、身体和灵魂都有好处。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Harris:** I work out every morning, no matter how little sleep I've had. I just find it to be just mind, body, and soul.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 您随着时间的推移改变了吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Host:** Have you changed over time?</p>
</details>

**哈里斯：** 哦，当然，我随着时间的推移改变了。压力的量级也变了。但我个人责任感方面的压力没有改变。我对自己要求很高，而且我倾向于成为一个完美主义者，尽管我远非完美。你知道，即使在那107天里，我每晚都睡不着，思考着在那一天里我还能多做些什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Harris:** Oh, for sure I've changed over time. The pressure has changed in magnitude. But the pressure that I feel in terms of my sense of personal responsibility has not changed. I put a lot of... I hold myself to a very high standard and I tend to be a perfectionist even though I am far from perfect. You know, I mean even during the 107 days every night I would stay awake thinking what more could I have done with that one day.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 如果我让24岁的卡玛拉·哈里斯，那个刚开始担任地区副检察官的她坐在这里，而您作为副总统坐在这里，她们在性格、心态和视角上会有哪些显著的不同？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Host:** 24-year-old Kamala Harris who starts as that sort of deputy district attorney. If I sat her there and you're sat there now as madame vice president, what would be the notable differences in personality, mentality, in perspective?</p>
</details>

**哈里斯：** 哦，这很有趣。嗯，我不知道这一点是否改变了，但那时的她无所畏惧。她不接受“不，这办不到”的说法。无论是我处理的第一个案子，当时我还是个年轻的检察官，我翻阅案卷，那是一个周五晚上，我意识到被捕的人家里有年幼的孩子，是个女人，而所有的法院都快关门了。我跑到法庭，请求法官再次开庭。“她有年幼的孩子，她不能在监狱里过周末。”书记员说：“不行，他今天已经下班了，他要走了。”但我就是不走。最后他们还是审理了那个案子。就是这种不接受“不”的精神。我……这可能是我一生的主线。我不会轻易接受某件事不可能的想法。至少，在没有尝试证明其可能性之前，我不会善罢甘休。这一点可能没有改变。我也开始更好地接受一个观点，那就是你无法改变每一个人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Harris:** Oh, that's interesting. Well, I mean, I don't know if that's changed, but she was fearless. She was fearless. She didn't hear "no, it can't be done." And whether it was the first case that I had and I was a young prosecutor and I was going through the files and it was a Friday evening and I realized that the person who had been arrested had young children at home, a woman, and all the courts were shutting down and I went to the courtroom and I asked the judge, "Please take the bench again. She has young children. She can't stay in over the weekend." And the clerk was like, "Nope, he's gone for the day. He's leaving for the day." And I would not leave. And they called the case, you know, but not hearing no. I just... that has been probably a throughline of my life. I don't rest easy with the idea that something is not possible. At least I don't rest easy with it without trying to show that it is possible. And that's probably not changed. I also have started to sit better with the idea that you can't change everyone.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 知道自己无法改变每个人，这对您的处事方式有何影响？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Host:** How does that change your approach knowing that you can't change everybody?</p>
</details>

**哈里斯：** 我能更好地评估一个情况，弄清楚其中的潜力所在。并且也许能更现实一些，而不会因此变得愤世嫉俗。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Harris:** I'm better able to assess a situation to figure out what is the potential there. And be perhaps a bit more realistic without being, I think, jaded about it.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 我想这就是智慧和经验。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Host:** And I guess that's wisdom and experiences.</p>
</details>

**哈里斯：** 是的，这来自于一些经验，它让你能更高效、更有效地做事。因为我就是这样理解的：精力最好用在别处。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Harris:** Yeah. It comes with a bit of experience which allows you to be more efficient and effective. That's exactly right. Because that is how I reconcile it, which is the effort is better placed somewhere else.</p>
</details>

### 从参议员到总统候选人

**主持人：** 在这段旅程中，您在哪个时刻意识到自己想成为美国总统？是有一次和道格共进午餐或晚餐时吗？这个决定是在您职业生涯的哪个阶段做出的？

<details>
<summary>V/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Host:** And at what point in this journey did you realize that you wanted to be president of the United States? Like was there a lunch or a dinner you had with Doug? When does that decision get made in your career?</p>
</details>

**哈里斯：** 那是在我担任参议员的时候。我遇到一位朋友，当时我和道格在一家当地餐厅的家庭餐桌上吃饭，他走过来说：“你应该竞选总统。”直到那时，我才有了这个念头。我从未想过要竞选总统。有些人天生就认为自己会成为总统，他们每天照镜子都能看到一个总统。我不是那样的人。但后来这个想法开始萌芽。当然，后来担任副总统，履行美国副总统的职责，我与超过150位世界领导人——总统、总理、首相和国王会面。我代表美国人民谈判了非常重要的协议和议题。我不仅在椭圆形办公室，还在战情室度过了无数个小时，并周游世界。因此，在那107天里，我完全意识到这份工作的重要性，也完全清楚自己有经验和知识能够有效地完成它。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Harris:** It was when I was in the Senate. I ran into a friend who came up, Doug and I were at a basically a family table in a local restaurant eating and he said to me, "You should run for president." And it had not occurred to me until then. It had not occurred to me to run for president. There are people who are born thinking they're going to be president. There are people who look in the mirror every day and see a president. I was not one of those people. But then the thought, it kind of germinated. And then of course being vice president and doing the work of vice president of the United States, I met with over 150 world leaders, presidents, prime ministers, chancellors and kings. I've negotiated very important deals and issues on behalf of the American people. I've spent countless hours not only in the Oval Office but the situation room and traveling around the world. And so in those 107 days, I was fully aware of not only the importance of the job, but fully aware that I had the experience and knowledge to be able to do it effectively.</p>
</details>

### “冒名顶替综合症”与权力的真相

**主持人：** 我在想，在您的职业生涯中，当您爬得越高，是否越发意识到，其实身居高位的人也和我一样，或者至少我和他们在同一水平上。您有过这样的经历吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Host:** I'm wondering if you've experienced that in your career where the higher you've climbed, you've realized that actually everybody up here is like... I'm like that, or I'm at least on their level. Have you had that experience in your career?</p>
</details>

**哈里斯：** 是的，我有过。但我也经历过**冒名顶替综合症**（Imposter Syndrome: 指成功人士怀疑自己的能力，感觉自己像个骗子的一种心理现象）。那是在我第一次当选地区检察官（DA）的时候，我挑战了当时的在任者。我在民意调查中以6个百分点起步，也就是百分之六。最近有人问我关于民调的事。嗯，你知道，如果我听信民调，我根本就不会竞选我的第一个公职，那样我们可能就不会有这次采访了。我赢了，这出乎意料，至少在我刚参选时是这样。然后我坐在办公室里，心想：“天哪，我现在是美国一个大城市的民选地区检察官了。”现在回想起来，也许我们称之为“冒名顶替综合症”是一个很沉重的词，因为我认为拥有一定程度的谦逊并没有错，而且我认为这其中有很多好处，特别是当人民赋予你巨大权力的时候。你要明白，这与你个人无关。我认为这是“冒名顶替综合症”的一部分，或者说拥有这种感觉的人，通常是因为他们明白这份代表他人的工作有多么严肃。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Harris:** Yes, I have. And but I've also had the imposter syndrome experience and that was when I was first elected DA and I challenged the incumbent. I started out at six points in the polls which is six out of 100. You know people recently asked me about polls. Well, you know, if I listened to polls, I would have never run for my first office and therefore we wouldn't be having this interview probably. And I won. And it was not expected that I would, at least when I jumped in the race. And there I was sitting in the office and I thought, "Oh my god, I'm now the elected DA of a major city in the United States." In hindsight, maybe we call it imposter syndrome. To your point, maybe it is a very loaded term because I think there is nothing wrong with having a certain level of humility and I think that there's a lot that is good with having a certain level of humility, in particular when the people have vested you with great power. To understand it's not about you. I think that is part and parcel of what we call imposter syndrome or who has it. I think often it is because they understand how serious the job is on behalf of others.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 我赞同那种谦逊，真诚的谦逊，而不是伪装的谦逊。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Host:** And I applaud a bit of humility, honest humility, not feigned humility.</p>
</details>

**哈里斯：** 是的，因为有很多人为了作秀而自嘲。但回到你的观点，你爬得越高，就越能接触到那些你原本觉得遥不可及的人，你就越明白他们并非遥不可及。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Harris:** Right. Cuz there are plenty of people that are, you know, self-deprecating for the sake of the shtick of it all. But yes, to your point, the higher you go, it does. It does because the more you're exposed to being in the rooms with the people who otherwise feel untouchable, the more you understand that they are not untouchable.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 这是个很礼貌的说法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Host:** It's a polite way of putting it.</p>
</details>

**哈里斯：** 你会越来越明白，每个人身上都有点灰尘，并非人人都光鲜亮丽。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Harris:** The more you understand everyone's got a little dust on them. And they're not... not everyone's shiny.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 但知道这一点是令人释然的，因为我们都会在自己头顶设置一个天花板，认为那就是我的极限，而所有在那之上的人都拥有我永远无法企及的天赋。所以我甚至不会去尝试打破那个天花板，因为我觉得我不配待在上面。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Host:** But it's liberating to know that that's the case because we all put a ceiling above us and we think that's my level and everyone above that has some gift that I will never be able to attain. So I won't even strive to break that ceiling because I don't deserve to be up there.</p>
</details>

**哈里斯：** 但也别低估了很多人收到的那种“你不属于那里”的信号。我尤其在指导别人的时候会经常对他们说，永远不要因为别人看你的能力有限，就限制了你自己。那是他们看待你和你能力的局限，不要把那些局限强加在自己身上。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Harris:** But also don't discount the signals that many people are sent that you don't belong there. And I, especially when I'm mentoring people, will often say to them, don't ever limit yourself based on other people's limited ability to see who you are. That's their limitations to see who you are and your capacity. Don't impose those limitations on yourself.</p>
</details>

### 打破天花板：应对偏见与歧视

**主持人：** 我在我们开始录制前给您看的那张勒布朗·詹姆斯发布的照片就是一个很好的例子。我会把它放在屏幕上，但它展示了在您之前的所有副总统，坦白说，他们看起来都一样。所以，人们可能会陷入一个思维陷阱，认为如果我长得不像这样，我就做不了这份工作。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Host:** Well, I mean, this that photo I showed you before we started recording that LeBron posted is a pretty iconic example. I'll put it on the screen, but it just goes to show all the vice presidents that came before you, and frankly, they all look the same. So, one might fall into the trap of thinking that if I don't look like this, then I can't do this job.</p>
</details>

**哈里斯：** 我给你补充一点。其他人也都认为这就是能胜任这份工作的人的形象。所以，额外的挑战不仅在于一个人给自己设定的限制，还在于你可能会遇到的、来自他人对“谁能做什么”的看法的限制。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Harris:** I'll see you and add one. And everyone else thinks that this is the image of who can do the job. So the added challenge is not only the limitations one puts on themselves but the limitations one might be met with around other people's perceptions about who can do what.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 您在职业生涯中有过这样的经历吗？有没有什么特别的例子总是浮现在您的脑海中，让您真切地感觉到，您所在的房间里，人们仅仅因为您的外表、性别或种族等因素而轻视您？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Host:** And have you had that through your career? Is there any particular examples that always sit at the front of your mind where you really really felt that the room you were in, people were discounting you purely based on appearance or gender or race or anything like that?</p>
</details>

**哈里斯：** 在我的职业生涯中，确实有过这样的时刻。当我走进一个房间，如果他们不认识我，不知道他们将要面对的是谁，会有人说出类似“他们在等我的老板”这样的话。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Harris:** I mean, there are times in my career when I walked in the room and someone said, you know, something along if they didn't know me, if they didn't know what they were walking into, you know, they were waiting for my boss.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 您是如何应对的？如何阻止那种感觉压垮您？因为人很容易感受到那种压力然后退缩。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Host:** And how did you deal with that? How do you stop that suppressing you? Because it's very easy to feel that and to shrink.</p>
</details>

**哈里斯：** 你很可能常常是唯一一个走进董事会、法庭、会议室的人，你的长相、你的生活经历都与众不同。但是当你走进那个房间时，要昂首挺胸，知道有那么多不在那个房间里的人，都为你走进那个房间而感到骄傲，并期望你会用你所代表的声音说话。当你意识到你可能在呈现一种不熟悉的面貌时，确实需要运用一些工具。但我也要提醒，不要带着“我的价值不会被认可”的假设走进那个房间。这又回到了我之前的观点，我们都必须权衡，哪些是自己加给自己的限制，哪些是外界传递给我们的限制。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Harris:** You will often be, you may often be the only one who walks into a boardroom, a courtroom, a meeting room, who looks like yourself or has had your life experiences. But when you walk in that room, walk in that room, chin up, shoulders back, knowing there are so many people who are not in that room, who are so proud of you walking in that room and expect that you will use the voice that you carry. You know, and there are tools that one has to employ when you otherwise are aware that you might be presenting the unfamiliar. But what I also would caution is don't walk in that room with the assumption that your value will not be recognized. Right? And so again, this gets back to my point about we all have to moderate what limitations are we putting on ourselves with what limitations are being sent our way.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 当您说“工具”时……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Host:** And when you say tools...</p>
</details>

**哈里斯：** 就像我刚才说的，当你走进那个房间时，看到所有的人。我有时会想起弗朗西斯·威尔逊夫人，她是我一年级的老师，还参加了我的法学院毕业典礼。我想起我的母亲，她会平静地对我说：“永远不要让任何人告诉你你是谁，你来告诉他们你是谁。”当你走进那些重要的房间时，你会想起这些人来提醒自己。这是我长期以来使用的一个工具，它对我很有帮助。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Harris:** Well, just like that, when you walk into that room, see all the people. I think sometimes of Mrs. Francis Wilson, who was my first grade teacher who attended my law school graduation. I think of my mother who would say to me calmly, "Don't you ever let anyone tell you who you are. You tell them who you are." Right? And you think of these people when you walk into these important rooms to remind you. It's a tool I have used over a period of time and it has served me well.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 是的，那是威尔逊夫人，在您的法学院毕业典礼上。那是您的母亲。完全正确。您从哪儿弄到所有这些照片的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Host:** Yes, there's Mrs. Wilson. That's at my law school graduation. And that's my mother. That's exactly right. How about that? Yeah. Where'd you get all these pictures?</p>
</details>

**哈里斯：** 是的，那就是威尔逊夫人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Harris:** Yeah. That's Mrs. Wilson.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 那么，当您走进那些房间时，为什么想起威尔逊夫人会对您有帮助？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Host:** And so, why is thinking of Mrs. Wilson helping you when you walk into those rooms?</p>
</details>

**哈里斯：** 因为我认为成功有一个关键，我们每个取得成功的人可能都共有这一点，那就是至少有一个人——可能是父母、老师、邻居或牧师——让你相信你是特别的。你可能并非特别出众，但他们告诉你你是，而你相信了他们。我知道这对我来说是真的。我可能并非特别出众，但有几个人告诉我我是，而我相信了他们。但随之而来的是一种责任感，因此不要做某件事，因为你很特别，你不应该做那件事。但要走进那个房间。我认为，当我们谈论指导、谈论社会向孩子们传递的信号时——我指的是我们所有的孩子，我们自己的孩子，以及我们应该视为自己孩子的社区里的孩子——向他们传递信号，告诉他们是特别的，然后用资源来支持这一点，将会使我们的社会变得更加强大。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Harris:** Because there is, I think, a key to success that each of us who has achieved success probably shares, which is there has been someone at least, and it could be a parent, it could be a teacher, it could be a neighbor, it could be a pastor, someone who convinced you you were special. You may not have been particularly special, but they told you you were and you believed them. I know that's true for me. I may not have been particularly special, but I had a few people who told me I was and I believed them. But with that came, "therefore don't do this thing." "Cuz you're special, you know you shouldn't be doing that thing." But go in that room. I think when we talk about mentorship, when we think about the signals that we as a society send to children, and I mean all of our children, our own children, the children of a community which we should think of as our children, to send them signals that tell them they are special and then back that up with giving them the resources would make us a much stronger society.</p>

### 成为副总统：一场谍战片式的面试

**主持人：** 在某个时刻，您接到了总统先生的电话。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Host:** And at some point you get a call from Mr. President.</p>
</details>

**哈里斯：** 我接到了时任民主党提名人乔·拜登的电话。我们通过FaceTime通话，那是在新冠疫情最严重的时候。他邀请我做他的竞选搭档。这是一个巨大的荣誉，我很荣幸地接受了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Harris:** I got a call from then nominee, Democratic nominee Joe Biden. We facetimed. It was during the height of COVID. And he asked me to be his running mate. And it was a great honor and I was honored to do it.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 在那一刻之前，您有任何预感他会邀请您吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Host:** Did you have any inclination before that moment that he was going to ask you?</p>
</details>

**哈里斯：** 没有。我参加了一次面试，那过程就像一部间谍电影。我的助手开车送我到一个地点，那是在华盛顿特区的一个购物中心。然后我从那辆车里出来，换乘另一辆车，因为媒体当时正密切关注着一切，想看看最终入围名单上的人是谁。所以我们必须进行这一系列秘密行动。然后我坐上另一辆车，由他的一位助手驾驶，我们走了一条非常曲折的路线到达一栋房子，然后从后门进去。窗户都关着，窗帘也拉着，我就这样完成了面试。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Harris:** So, no. I had an interview. I had an interview and it was like something out of a spy movie where I had my assistant drove me to one location. This was in DC. And then it was a mall. And then I got out of that car to get in another car that was because the press were watching everything to see who... there was a short list that was out... who was going to be. So we had to do this whole clandestine thing. And then I got into another car being driven by one of his assistants and then we went to this, you know, this very circuitous route to a house and then through the back door. The windows were closed, the shades were closed and I had my interview.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 我很好奇想知道，我一生中做过很多次面试，自己也参加过几次。一个人是如何被面试成为副总统的？会被问到什么样的问题？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Host:** I'm so intrigued to know. I've done many interviews in my life. I've been in a couple of interviews myself. How does someone get interviewed to be the vice president? Like what are the questions one is asked?</p>
</details>

**哈里斯：** 嗯，作为面试官和被面试者，我都经历过。这真的很大程度上取决于化学反应。因为到面试的时候，通常已经筛选到只剩三个人左右了。所有的背景审查都已完成。我在竞选总统时，背景审查过程非常短，只有几周，但我想乔·拜登花了大约九周时间才做出决定。所以在我被审查成为副总统候选人时，我和一位律师进行了长达九小时的面试，审查了一切，所有的一切。我的税务、我的职业记录，所有的一切。那简直就像一次虚拟的结肠镜检查。所以当所有这些都完成，并且一路绿灯通过后，就到了坐下来谈的阶段，最终决定……因为它将是一种伙伴关系，对吧？你必须感觉到可以信任对方，可以和他们共事，你们做这件事的理由是相同的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Harris:** Well, having been in the position of both being the interviewer and the interviewee, it really as much as anything comes down to chemistry. Because by the time that that interview is happening, it's usually narrowed down to about three people. So, all the vetting has been done. I mean, the vetting... I had such a truncated experience when I was running for president of just a couple of weeks, but I think Joe Biden took like nine weeks to make a decision. And so there's vetting when I was being vetted for vice president. I had a, I don't know, 9-hour interview with a lawyer going through everything, everything. My taxes, my professional record, everything that was everything, everything. I mean, talk about a colonoscopy. It was just virtually. That's kind of what it was. And so when all of that has been done and it's kind of green light, green light through that, then it's about sitting down and just deciding because it is going to be a partnership, right? And it has to be where you feel that you can trust someone. You could work with them. You are doing it for the same reasons.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 担任副总统和您想象的一样吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Host:** Was it what you thought it was going to be, being vice president?</p>
</details>

**哈里斯：** 我并不知道具体会是怎样，因为没有任何事可以与之相比。我是美国第49任副总统，在我之前只有48位。我认为没有任何事能真正让你为之做好准备，因为它是一个非常独特的职位，你是二号人物。这份责任的严肃性在于……我完全归功于已故总统吉米·卡特，他在担任总统时，经历了肯尼迪和尼克松等事件后，决定副总统应该被赋予比以往更大的责任，因为万一总统发生不测，应该有一个平稳的权力交接。所以，沃尔特·蒙代尔是他的副总统，也是第一位在白宫西翼拥有办公室的副总统。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Harris:** I didn't know exactly what it would be because there's nothing that can compare to it. I mean, I was the 49th vice president of the United States. There have only been 48 before me. Right. And I don't think anything can truly prepare you for what it is because it is a very unique position where you are number two in command. The seriousness of the responsibility is that... I give all credit to now the late President Jimmy Carter who decided when he was president, having come off of Kennedy and Nixon and everything, he decided that the vice president should be given greater responsibilities than had been the case because God forbid something happens to the president, there should be a smooth succession. And so Walter Mondale was his vice president and was the first to have an office in the West Wing.</p>
</details>

### 白宫内部的权力博弈

**主持人：** 当我读您的书《107天》时，一件非常令人惊讶但又符合人性的事情是，您谈到总统的一些工作人员在某种程度上压制您，压制您的成就，因为您对他们构成威胁。我想您很早就被告知，或者听说过，一位幕僚长说……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Host:** When I was reading your book 107 days, one of the really surprising things was, but also makes sense when I understand human nature, was that you talk about how some of the president's staff were basically suppressing you a little bit, suppressing your accomplishments because you're a threat to them. And I think you were told pretty early on or you had heard pretty early on from a chief of staff that...</p>
</details>

**哈里斯：** 副总统被视为对总统的威胁。传说，即将离任的总统幕僚长会告诉即将上任的总统的幕僚长，无论政党如何，第一条规则就是：盯紧副总统。传说如此。当然，我还曾与乔·拜登竞争过。我非常敏锐地意识到，我必须一次又一次地证明我的忠诚，这种忠诚不会被理所当然地假定。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Harris:** ...the vice president is kind of seen as a threat to the president. So, the lore has it that the outgoing chief of staff to the president will tell the incoming chief of staff to the incoming president regardless of political party. Rule number one, watch the vice president. Lore has it that that's the case. And then I had of course run against Joe Biden. I was very and acutely aware that I would have to over and over again prove my loyalty, that it wouldn't be assumed.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 您在书中说：“总统的幕僚们在为那些关于我的负面叙事火上浇油。”“总统的核心圈子似乎对此安之若素。事实上，他们似乎觉得我应该被再打压一下。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Host:** You say in the book the president's staff was adding fuel to negative narratives that sprung up about me. The president's inner circle seemed fine with it. Indeed, it seemed as if they decided I should be knocked down a little bit more.</p>
</details>

**哈里斯：** 坦白说，我很长一段时间都有这种感觉，但在选举之后，我才真正开始听到关于此事的种种说法。我的意思是，我能感觉到，在让他们提升我、为我辩护方面遇到的挑战，尤其是在面对不准确、不公平的攻击时，这一点很明显。之后我听到了更多的故事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Harris:** To be candid with you, I had a sense of it for quite some time, but it was after the election that I really started to hear the stories about it. I mean, I had a sense of it. It was clear to me in terms of just the challenges with getting them to uplift, getting them to defend, especially when there were inaccurate, unfair attacks. And then I started to hear more stories after.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 您的意思是，当媒体对您进行不公平的攻击，而这些攻击本可以轻易被反驳或揭穿时，他们却无意去这样做。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Host:** And what you mean by that is when there were unfair media attacks on you that could quite easily have been rebutted or debunked, there was no desire to debunk them.</p>
</details>

**哈里斯：** 总统手下的工作人员和资源与副总统相比是巨大的。在副总统受到攻击时，资源是可用的，但没有被用来以本可以的方式为副总统辩护，而这种辩护本可以使所有相关方受益。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Harris:** There was... the staff and the resources under the president as compared to the vice president are enormous. And to the extent that the vice president is being attacked, resources were available but not used to defend the vice president in the way that they could have that would have inured to the benefit of everyone involved.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 因为这正是我所想的。有一种观点认为，这符合他们的利益，因为如果您和乔·拜登都很强大，那么乔·拜登就更有可能赢得下一次选举。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Host:** Cuz that's what I think. There was an argument to say it was in their interests because if you and Joe Biden are strong, you're more likely... Joe Biden's more likely to then win the next election.</p>
</details>

**哈里斯：** 完全正确。这正是我的观点。我们荣辱与共。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Harris:** Exactly. That's my point. We rose and fell together.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 乔·拜登知道这些事吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Host:** And did Joe Biden know that that was happening?</p>
</details>

**哈里斯：** 我不知道他是否知道，但负责这些事的是他手下的工作人员。我认为那是其中一部分原因。我确实认为他们觉得，你知道，这个世界上有太多人，在职业生涯中，用一种**零和博弈**（Zero-sum game: 指一方的收益必然意味着另一方的损失，总和为零）的方式处理问题。如果我拥有更多，你就拥有更少。这是极其短视的。我认为，当你考虑到我们政府以及选举中所面临的利害关系时，这实际上是一种非常狭隘的思维。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Harris:** I don't know if he did, but it's the staff underneath him that are in charge of that. I think that that was part of it. I do. I think that they decided that, you know, there are far too many people in this world and in professional life who approach things with a zero-sum game. If I have more, you have less. And it is incredibly shortsighted. And I think it's actually quite provincial thinking when you're talking about the stakes that were at play in our administration and of course in the election.</p>

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Harris:** Yes, it's very complicated. It is. And as I write in the book, I have a great deal of affection for him. And there were times that I've been quite candid about where he greatly disappointed me and frankly, you know, angered me.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 能给我一些他让您失望和愤怒的具体例子吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Host:** Can you give me context on where he disappointed and angered you?</p>
</details>

**哈里斯：** 我在书中写到，在我与川普辩论的那天。你知道，参加总统辩论是一项极其紧张和密集的工程，包括我们历史上所谓的“辩论营”。你能想象吗？那根本不是什么营地，而是你基本上在辩论前的一段时间里被隔离起来。那是高强度的准备过程之后，辩论当天早上，我和我的团队开了个会。我以为会有更多的准备工作，但他们实际上非常棒，只是对我说：“你准备好了。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Harris:** So, I write... and I thought about this. Was I going to write about it or not? And I decided in writing this book, I was going to just be honest and these are the facts and the reader can take what they want from it. On the day of the debate, my debate with Trump. And you know, so going into a presidential debate is an incredibly intense and intensive project, including what has historically happened that we even called debate camp. Can you imagine? And it's no camp at all. It's going into where you basically are sequestered for a period of time immediately before the debate. So the day of the debate was after that intense period of preparation and then that morning I had a meeting with my team. I thought it was going to be more prep but they actually were wonderful and just basically said to me, "You're ready."</p>
</details>

**哈里斯：** 好了，然后作为一名竞选总统的女性，和许多身居高位的女性一样，需要做发型和化妆。这可能需要几个小时。发型和妆容都弄好了。我和我丈夫道格在酒店房间里，总统打来电话。我被告知他想给我打电话，所以我做好了准备。我非常确定他是来给我加油打气的，说“去吧，干掉他”。他一开始确实这么说了。但接着，他开始谈论宾夕法尼亚州的一群人，他们说我的坏话，因为他们听说我说了他的坏话。当我挂断电话时，我简直……难以置信。是的，我很生气，并且深感失望。这太没必要了。世界上除了我，只有两个人与这家伙辩论过，希拉里·克林顿和他。你知道那是什么感觉。参加一场利害关系如此之大的辩论，而且川普还没有同意进行另一场辩论。赌注太高了。这就是我所说的一个例子。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Harris:** So, okay then being a woman running for president and many women in various high level positions get their hair and makeup done. Back to your point about presentation and it can take hours. Hair and makeup got done. I'm in the hotel room with Doug, with my husband, and the president calls. I was told that he wanted to call me so that I'd be ready. And I was so sure it was to buck me up and go get him. And he did say that for the first beat. And then he went on to talk about a group of people in Pennsylvania who were saying bad things about me because they heard I was saying bad things about him. And when I hung up the phone, I was just... it was unbelievable. And I was... yes, I was angry and deeply disappointed. It just was so unnecessary. There are only two people in the world other than me that has debated this guy, Hillary Clinton and him. And you know what it's like? It's going into a debate with the stakes being that high and Trump hadn't agreed to another debate. The stakes were so high. So that's an example of what I mean.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 您从那件事中解读出了一些东西。您从中解读出了关于一个人意图的潜在信息。因为如果有人在辩论准备的关键时刻打电话给我，对我说那样的话，我会认为他们不希望我好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Host:** You took something from that. You took an underlying message about one's intentions from that. Cuz I would if someone called me in the leadup to debate prep and said something like that to me, I would assume that they don't want the best for me.</p>
</details>

**哈里斯：** 我的结论是，他的动机完全是出于他自己。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Harris:** My takeaway is his motivation was all about himself.</p>

### 2024年大选辩论复盘

**主持人：** 我关注所有这些辩论。我一直是美国政治的忠实粉丝。我观看了那场辩论。但在那之前，拜登和川普的辩论……情况显然非常糟糕。感觉整个民主党阵营都在假装一切正常。

**哈里斯：** 而且有趣的是，因为我当然非常密切地关注了那场辩论，原因有很多，包括我在他的辩论后马上有四个采访，要代表总统就辩论发表看法。那场辩论中有趣的一点是，看到唐纳德·川普实际上有所收敛，这是非常罕见的情况。那真是太有意思了。

<details>

<p class="english-text">**Harris:** And he, and he interestingly enough, because of course I watched that debate very closely for many, many reasons including I had four interviews right after his debate to speak on behalf of the president during the debate. And what was interesting in that debate was also to watch how... it's a very rare circumstance that you see Donald Trump actually moderate. It was fascinating.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 您当时一定知道情况不妙。您当时在洛杉矶，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Host:** You must have known. You sat there. You were in LA at the time, right?</p>
</details>

**哈里斯：** 我当时在洛杉矶的费尔蒙酒店观看，并且在奋力地做笔记。总统，拜登，从辩论营给我打了电话。我能感觉到有点不对劲。我担心……我只是觉得他不想辩论，这是我的观点。他不想参加那场辩论。你知道，这就像你参加任何比赛一样，无论是竞标什么，还是体育比赛，你必须要有求胜心。如果你不想参加比赛，那绝对会影响你的表现。我敢肯定他不想辩论。

<details>

<p class="english-text">**Harris:** I was in LA at the Fairmont Hotel watching and taking vigorous notes. The president did, Biden did, call me from debate camp. And I could tell something was a little off. And I was concerned about... I just... he... I don't think he wanted to debate is my point. He didn't want that debate. And you know, it's like any competition you go in, whether it's you're bidding for something, if it's sports, you got to want it. Right. If you don't want to be in the competition, it will absolutely have an impact on your performance. And I'm pretty sure he did not want to debate.</p>

<p class="english-text">**Host:** How do you know? What were the signs?</p>
</details>

**哈里斯：** 嗯，我们谈过这件事。我想他是被说服参加的。无论如何，我当时和我的核心团队一起观看辩论。我希望团队规模小一些，这样在辩论进行时我就可以坦率地发表意见，因为我知道之后马上有四个采访。你知道，在任何辩论中，我不管你是谁，总会有数据错误，或者你说错了国家名字。这种事总会发生，没有完美的辩论。所以总会有需要澄清的地方。我预料到了这一点。然后，你知道，我们都看到了我们所看到的。

<details>

<p class="english-text">**Harris:** Well, we had conversations about it. I think he got talked into it. And in any event, so I'm watching the debate with my tight team. I wanted it to be a small team so I could just be candid as it's happening because I know I have four interviews right after. And you know, in every debate, I don't care who you are, there will be a statistic wrong or you name this country, but it was that country. That always happens. There is no such thing as a perfect debate. So there will be something to clean up. I expected that. And then, you know, we saw what we all saw.</p>

### 竞选策略：如何应对川普的“荒诞剧”

**主持人：** 那么，与川普辩论的真正策略是什么？因为您也经历过那些时刻，比如“猫和狗”之类的难以置信的事情。在家里看的时候，我在想，“哦，她正试图激怒他，而且奏效了。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Host:** So what was the real strategy going into that debate with Trump? Because you had those same moments where the cats and the dogs and all that unbelievable stuff. And at home I was thinking, "Oh, she's trying to trigger him and it's working."</p>
</details>

**哈里斯：** 是的，因为他在这方面太容易预测了。首先，我们在讲台上有空白的便笺本。在辩论营里，以及后来我走上舞台，和他握手后回到我的讲台时，我画了一个笑脸。因为我决定要玩得开心。因为这类辩论，尤其特殊的一点是，谁玩得开心谁就赢。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Harris:** Yeah, because he's so predictable that way. Well, the first thing is that we had empty pads on our podium. And in the debate camp and then therefore when I walked on stage after I shook his hand, went back to my podium, I wrote a smiley face and cuz I just decided I was going to have fun because one of the things about these kinds of debates in particular is the person who's having fun wins.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 我们前几天回看了，您在微笑，看起来很享受，而他看起来很沮丧。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Host:** That's so true. We watched it back the other day and you're smiling and you look like you're enjoying it and he looks frustrated.</p>
</details>

**哈里斯：** 是的。所以那是故意的。如果你看起来玩得开心……嗯，是要真的玩得开心，而不仅仅是看起来，因为如果你不开心，我觉得很难装出开心的样子。你必须在其中找到乐趣。这是生活的真谛。你必须看到其中的幽默之处，否则它会把你击垮。尤其是当你处理沉重的事情时，你必须看到其中的幽默。当他拿出“猫和狗”那件事时，我简直不敢相信。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Harris:** Yeah. So, that was intentional was to if you look like you're having fun... well, have fun, but though not just look cuz I think it's very difficult to look like you're having fun if you're not, right? You've got to find... you have to... this is true for life. You got to see the humor in it. Otherwise, it's just going to undo you. Especially if you're dealing with heavy stuff, you've got to see the humor in it. And you know, like when he pulled out the cats and dogs thing, I couldn't even believe it.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 是的，给不知道的观众解释一下背景。据我所知，有一个疯狂的谣言，说海地移民在俄亥俄州吃他们的宠物，猫和狗。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Host:** Let's give context for anyone that doesn't know. Okay. Yes. From what I understand, it's faint in my memory, but there was this like crazy rumor that Haitian immigrants in Ohio were eating their pets, cats and dogs.</p>
</details>

**哈里斯：** 我当时甚至没听说过这件事，因为我正在辩论营里。然后我团队的两名成员看到他和他飞机上那个胡说八道的主要传播者一起下飞机。他们意识到，如果她在飞机上，他听到的最后一件事很可能就是这个。所以他们在最后一刻告诉我这件事。果然，它在辩论中出现了。但我想对你说，斯蒂芬，这也是我写这本书的原因之一，从那107天里可以学到很多教训，并应用于今天。我相信，这种方法的一部分就是，说出离谱的话，然后所有人都会关注那件离谱的事。与此同时，真正重要的事情正在发生。这就是**障眼法**（Misdirection: 一种分散注意力的技巧）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Harris:** So I hadn't even heard about it cuz I'm in debate camp, right? And then two members of my team see him get off his Trump plane with the main purveyor of this nonsense. And then they realize if she's on the plane with him, it is very possible the last thing he heard was this thing. So they last minute tell me. Sure enough, it did come up in the debate. But see, here's the thing that I would say to you, Stephen, that again, one of the reasons I wrote the book is also there are lessons to be learned from those 107 days to be applied today. I believe that part of what is the method is say the outrageous thing, then everyone is going to focus on that outrageous thing. And meanwhile this is happening, right? And so meanwhile... misdirection.</p>

### 情感 vs. 逻辑：民主党如何打赢信息战

**主持人：** 我过去十年在市场营销领域工作，得出了一个结论：无用的荒诞比有用的实用更能定义一个品牌。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Host:** Here's what I've come to learn in the last sort of 10 years working in marketing is I have this particular chapter in my last book where I say useless absurdity defines will define you more as a brand than useful practicality.</p>
</details>

**哈里斯：** 这话说得真漂亮。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Harris:** Right, that's beautifully said.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 我认为川普的策略就是，他是一个贴标签的大师。“瞌睡乔”。你不能低估这家伙在这方面的天赋。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Host:** I actually think to Trump's strategy is he leads with... he's a master labeler. Sleepy Joe. You can't discount the guy in terms of that.</p>

**哈里斯：** 他非常有天赋。

**主持人：** 你如何击败一个玩这种游戏的人？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Host:** How do you beat someone playing that game?</p>
</details>

**哈里斯：** 你必须坚持不懈地关注真正发生的事情。这也意味着要解构。例如，我最近一直在谈论的一个词，非常适用于他和这个时代，那就是**煤气灯效应**（Gaslighting: 一种心理操纵形式，旨在让受害者怀疑自己的理智、记忆或对现实的感知）。现在正在发生大量的煤气灯操纵，基本上就是歪曲事实、撒谎、找替罪羊、转移注意力，让你忽略真正发生的事情。他基本上是在对美国人民说，你拥有的更少，是因为那些比你拥有更少的人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Harris:** You have to be relentless on focusing on what's actually happening. And it means also deconstructing. So one of the things for example that I've been talking about recently is there's a word that applies so well to him in this era which is a phrase gaslighting. Right? So there's a whole lot of gaslighting happening which is basically misrepresenting, lying, scapegoating, distracting, right, from what's really occurring. He's basically saying to the American people, you have less because of people who have even less than you.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 反驳的观点是：这招管用。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Host:** Here's the counterpoint. It works.</p>
</details>

**哈里斯：** 是的，显然如此。但总有一天，那层伪装和转移注意力的把戏会失效。我不知道具体是什么时候。而且我认为，听着，关税开始生效，等到假日季节，人们意识到有多少玩具是中国制造的时候……加强这种做法的是大量虚假信息的迅速传播。它就像野火一样蔓延。试图用事实，更不用说你所说的实用信息和逻辑来应对，是一个真正的挑战。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Harris:** Yes, evidently. But there is, you know, but at some point the veneer and the deflection has to wear off. I don't know when exactly that is going to happen. And I think that, you know, listen, the tariffs taking hold and when we get around to the holiday season and people realize how many toys are made in China... what strengthens that approach is the rapid amount of disinformation that is spreading. It's so much and it just spreads like wildfire. And trying to stay in front of that with fact, much less, to your point, practical messaging and logic, it is a real challenge.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 我的问题是，当对手用情感和恐惧来战斗时，民主党如何在这场战争中获胜？你如何用逻辑和理性来取胜？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Host:** So, my question here is how does the Democratic Party win in such a war when you're being fought with emotion and fear? How do you win with logic and rationality?</p>
</details>

**哈里斯：** 我会直接回答你的问题，但我想补充一点，我认为问题的一部分必须是：媒体的责任是什么？企业控股媒体的角色是什么？天佑独立媒体。因为很多时候，这也关乎人们所依据的信息集是什么。我认为我们假设大家都在使用相同的信息，这是一个大错误。然后，当你把这一点与有目的的误导和虚假信息，以及有针对性的宣传结合起来时……我们知道某些人群是虚假信息的目标。所以当我们谈论民主党的角色时，我们有非常重要的角色要扮演，我们也有责任要求社交媒体公司、媒体公司等扮演他们的角色，因为信息来自所有这些地方，而挑战之大，关乎我们是否都在使用事实。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Harris:** I'll answer your question directly but I want to just add to the question that I think part of the question has to be what is the responsibility of media? What is the role of corporate-owned media? God bless independent media. Because a lot of it is also about what set of information are people working with. I think it's a big mistake for us to assume we're all working with the same information. And then when you compound that with, you know, intentional efforts to misinform and disinform and targeted... We know that certain demographics are targeted with miss and disinformation. So when we talk about the role of the Democratic party, there is a very big role to play and there is a role for us to require social media companies to play, media companies to play and so on because information is coming from all of these places and the challenge is as big as, are we all working with facts.</p>

### 独立媒体的崛起与Joe Rogan风波

**主持人：** 很多人会说，播客改变了选举的进程。关于您是否上乔·罗根的节目，有很多讨论。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Host:** Many would say that it changed the course of the election. Podcasting. There was lots of conversation around you going on Joe Rogan's show or not going on.</p>
</details>

**哈里斯：** 我想上乔·罗根的节目，但当时有很多博弈在进行。但我确实想上他的节目。我认为播客是人们获取信息的一个非常强大的媒介。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Harris:** I wanted to do Joe Rogan's show and there was a lot of games being played but I wanted to do Joe Rogan's show. I think podcasting is a very powerful medium for people to get information.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 回想起来，您是否希望当时就去他的工作室做那三个小时的节目？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Host:** In hindsight, do you wish you'd gone and done the show for 3 hours at his studio?</p>
</details>

**哈里斯：** 我想上他的节目，但很多人建议我不要去，因为他们认为他支持川普，而且事实也证明如此，那对我来说不会是一次有成效的访谈。但就像我上福克斯新闻布雷特·拜尔的节目一样，我的观点是，他们可能有他们的偏见，但听众中有人是思想开放的，我要去那里，给他们一个了解我的机会，也给我一个向他们陈述我的观点的机会。这就是我对乔·罗根的看法，就像我对福克斯新闻的看法一样。当时在日程安排上有很多博弈，最终没能成行。我绝对后悔我们没有做成。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Harris:** I wanted to do his show and a lot of people advised me not to do his show because they assumed, as it turned out to be correct, that he was supporting Trump and that it would not be a productive piece for me. But just like when I went on Fox News with Brett Baier, my perspective was they may have their bias, but there are people that listen who are open-minded, and I'm going to go there and give them a chance to get to know me and give me a chance to make my case to them. So, that was my perspective on Joe Rogan, just like it was my perspective on Fox. There was a lot of games being played around the scheduling and it didn't happen. I definitely regret that we didn't do it.</p>

### 败选之夜：震惊、悲痛与反思

<p class="english-text">**Host:** And so when did the proverbial penny drop?</p>
</details>

**哈里斯：** 当我接到竞选经理的电话，说看起来我们还需要20万张我们找不到的选票时。我的意思是，就是地图和数字摆在那里。我当时处于震惊状态，我一遍又一遍地说的话是：“我的天，我的天，我的天。”我无法停止。我已经很久没有感受到那种情绪了，除了我母亲去世时感受到的悲痛。我知道我们的国家将会发生什么。我知道将会对人民造成怎样的伤害。我知道。我知道将会发生什么。这不仅仅是赢或输的问题，我清楚那次选举结果的后果，那让我痛苦。

<details>

<p class="english-text">**Harris:** When I got a call from my campaign manager that it looks like we need 200,000 more votes that we can't find. Meaning, it's just the map, the numbers. I was in a state of shock. What I kept saying over and over again is, "My God, my God, my God." I couldn't stop. I haven't felt that emotion, anything similar to the emotion I felt that day for quite some time, other than the grief I felt when my mother died. I knew what was going to happen to our country. I knew the harm that was going to happen to people. I knew it. I knew what was going to happen. It's not like it's not about winning versus losing. It was... I knew the consequence of the outcome of that election and that pained me.</p>

You look at the weaponization of the Department of Justice against political enemies. How titans of industry are so afraid that the capitulation that we're seeing across the board, whether it be universities, law firms, media companies. What's happening around gutting the Department of Education, lunch programs for low-income children. IEPs, individual education placement for special needs kids. I've recently I'm hearing the stories from mothers in particular whose children have special needs and they can't get an IEP. These are babies, the children who are most in need. Meanwhile, you're building a gilded ballroom. So, the harm, it's extraordinary.</p>

### 民主党的未来：大胆的变革之路

**哈里斯：** 必须指出，民主党未来的失败将是忽视这样一个事实：这不仅仅是关于这一个人。这不仅仅是关于占据椭圆形办公室的这一个人。我们正在目睹的是一个酝酿了数十年的计划的迅速实施，一个高速发展的事件。应对这一时刻的策略必须包括对我们如何走到今天这一步有一些历史视角。那个**“2025计划”**（Project 2025: 由保守派智库“传统基金会”领导的一项政治倡议，旨在为下一届共和党总统政府提供执政蓝图和人事建议）不是凭空出现的。攻击公共教育的想法并不新鲜。**联邦主义者协会**（Federalist Society: 一个有影响力的美国保守派和自由意志主义法律组织）、**传统基金会**（Heritage Foundation: 美国一个重要的保守派公共政策研究机构）、选区划分的不公正、法院的填塞——这些事情。这是一个议程，它不会因一个人的开始或结束而开始或结束。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Harris:** It must be said the failure of the Democratic party will be going forward to overlook the fact that it is bigger than this one guy. It is not just about this one person who occupies the oval office. We are witnessing what is the swift implementation, a high velocity event that is the swift implementation of a plan that has been decades in the making. The strategy for dealing with this moment has to include having some historical perspective on how we got here. That project 2025 didn't just fall out of the sky. The idea of going after public education, that's not new. The Federalist Society, the Heritage Foundation, the gerrymandering of districts, the packing the court, this stuff. This is about an agenda that is not going to begin and end with one person.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 民主党需要承担责任。左派输了，他们下错了棋。从民主党的角度来看，他们正在为输掉这场棋局付出代价。所以我想，民主党需要振作起来，这样他们才不会再输掉比赛。

You say you thought it was grace to not basically mention that there was a problem and grace not to tell Joe Biden to pull out earlier, but actually in hindsight, you now think it was probably reckless not to tell him to pull out.</p>

**哈里斯：** 是的，就我而言。

</details>

**主持人：** 那么，民主党需要做什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Host:** So what does the Democratic Party need to do?</p>
</details>

**哈里斯：** 首先，如果我能重来一次，我们当时有基础设施法案，有**《芯片法案》**（Chips Act: 旨在促进美国半导体研究、开发和生产的联邦法律），所以我们在重建美国已有150年历史的基础设施。但如果重来，我会首先推行我们的家庭政策，即延长儿童税收抵免、平价托儿服务、带薪家庭假。我们需要解决影响美国人民的燃眉之急。我认为我们还需要更大胆一些。例如，我认为我们应该将投票年龄降低到16岁。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Harris:** First of all, you know, if I had done it over again, part of the reflection, we had the infrastructure deal. We had the Chips Act, so we're building back up America's infrastructure. It's 150 years old. Chips is about manufacturing chips, US manufacturing, both incredibly important. If I had to do it over again, I would have first gone with our family policy that was about extension of the child tax credit, affordable child care, paid family leave. We needed to deal with the immediate issues affecting the American people. For example, I think we should reduce voting age to 16.</p>
</details>

**哈里斯：** Z世代，他们年龄在13到27岁之间。他们只知道气候危机。他们因疫情错过了大部分教育。他们创造了“气候焦虑”这个词。他们的人数比婴儿潮一代还多。我认为我们必须投资于他们。如果他们现在16岁就能投票，他们会谈论气候的重要性，会谈论人工智能将如何影响未来的劳动力，会关注我们到底在为经济适用房做什么。在政治中，一个残酷的现实是：有两个权力中心往往会影响政治家的思维——投票最多的群体和开支票最多的人。我每天都会选择人民。思考我们如何加强人民去投票站投票。回到我的观点，2024年，三分之一的选民没有投票。让我们关注为什么，我们是否在与他们对话？我们是否为他们提供了大胆的解决方案？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Harris:** Gen Z, they're age about 13 through 27. They've only known the climate crisis. They missed substantial parts of their education because of the pandemic. They've coined the term climate anxiety. They are a larger number than boomers. I think we must invest in them. If they were able to vote because they know everything that's happening right now is going to impact them more than anybody older than them. If they're voting right now at 16 and up, they're going to be talking about the importance of climate. They're going to be talking about the importance of figuring out how AI is going to affect the future of the workforce. They're going to be focused on what are we really doing about affordable housing. And basically in politics, here's the hard truth about this. There are two centers of power that tend to influence how politicians think. Groups that vote the most and people who write the most checks. And I'm going to go every day with the people. And thinking about how do we strengthen people actually going to the polls and voting. Back to my point in 2024 one-third of the electorate didn't vote. Let's focus on why and are we talking with them? Are we offering them bold solutions?</p>

You know, anyone running for president should really take very seriously the decision cuz it is not for the faint of heart. You have to be able to take a punch and throw a punch, but you got to be able to take a punch.</p>

**主持人：** 您后悔在只有107天准备时间的情况下参选吗？您希望自己没有参选吗？

<p class="english-text">**Host:** Do you regret running with only 107 days notice? Do you wish you hadn't ran?</p>
</details>

**哈里斯：** 不，我不后悔参选。我希望我们有更多时间。我真的希望我们有更多时间。我不后悔参选。

<p class="english-text">**Harris:** No, I don't regret running. I wish we had more time. I truly wish we had more time. I don't regret running.</p>

**主持人：** 如果您知道结果，您还会参选吗？

<p class="english-text">**Host:** Had you known the outcome, would you have still ran?</p>
</details>

**哈里斯：** 可能会。因为你知道，发生的一件事是，直到今天，男人和女人，男孩和女孩都会走过来对我说，那次竞选活动中有某种东西激发了他们内心的某些东西。我无法告诉你多少人走过来对我说：“因为你参选，我决定竞选公职。”我绝对相信我们点燃了某种东西。我想换一种方式说，因为并不是说人们内心没有这种东西，他们本来就有，但那107天做了一些事，去欢迎、邀请、增长了人们确实携带的乐观，甚至敢说是喜悦。我现在希望用我的声音做的是提醒大家，请不要让你的精神被打败。我们可能没有赢得选举，但我们的精神不能被打败，因为那样他们就真的赢了。有时候，斗争需要一段时间。所以，尽管结果如此，我并不后悔参选。但我确实后悔我们没有更多的时间。

<p class="english-text">**Harris:** Probably. Because you know one of the things that happened and to this day men and women, girls and boys come up to me and say there was something about that campaign that excited something in them. I can't tell you the number of people who have come up to me and said, "I decided to run for office because you ran." I absolutely believe that we turned something on. In fact, I'm going to say this differently because it's not like people didn't have it in them. They had it in them, but there was something that those 107 days did to welcome, to invite, to grow the optimism and dare I say the joy that people do carry with them. And what I hope to do with my voice right now is to remind everyone, please don't let your spirit be defeated. We may not have won the election, but our spirit can't be defeated because then they really win. And sometimes the fight takes a while, right? So, I don't regret having run in spite of the outcome. But I do regret that we did not have more time.</p>

**主持人：** 在那种时刻，我想我可能会求助于我的伴侣。谈谈他扮演了什么角色。

<p class="english-text">**Host:** I think I'd probably be turning to my partner in those moments. Talk to me about that. What role did he play?</p>
</details>

**哈里斯：** 哦，我当然是。他……这听起来很老土，但他真的是我的基石。他是一个完全自我实现的人。他不会假装成他不是的样子。他是一个坚强的男人，关心他的家庭，关心努力工作。他忠诚，有幽默感，非常鼓励人，也非常诚实。

<p class="english-text">**Harris:** Oh, I definitely did. He is... it sounds so corny, but he truly is my rock. He is... my husband is just fully self-actualized. He's not pretending to be anything he's not. He is a strong man who cares about his family, cares about hard work. He is loyal. He has a sense of humor. He's very encouraging. He's very honest.</p>

**主持人：** 您还记得那天晚上他对您说了什么吗？

<p class="english-text">**Host:** Do you remember what he said to you that night?</p>
</details>

**哈里斯：** 嗯，他和我一样处于震惊状态。我得承认，那天晚上我们都语无伦次。

<details>

<p class="english-text">**Harris:** Well, he was in as much of a state of shock as I was. We didn't... I have to admit, we were not very articulate that night.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 那种状态持续了多久？

<details>

<p class="english-text">**Host:** How long did that last?</p>
</details>

**哈里斯：** 直到我开始写书，写到关于选举之夜的那一章。你知道吗，那是我和道格第一次谈论选举之夜。我们从未谈过选举之夜。从未。直到我写书的时候。那时他才告诉我一些我完全不知道的事。选举日那天，他和我的姐夫在密歇根州竞选。一切感觉都很好。然后，在他们返回华盛顿的路上，他们接到了我们一个朋友的电话，他是一位民主党人，但在福克斯新闻担任评论员。他打电话给道格和我的姐夫托尼说：“你们听到什么消息了？因为我听到的消息让我很担心。”我不知道发生了这件事。我只知道道格和托尼去竞选了。我当时在竞选。大家都在竞选。我家里挤满了家人。当他回到家时，事后看来，我知道有点不对劲。我不知道的是，他掌握了那个信息。他上楼去洗澡和祈祷了。

<p class="english-text">**Harris:** Well, not until I started writing the book and getting to the chapter on election night. Do you know that was the first time Doug and I talked about election night? We had never talked about election night. Never. Had never talked about election night. It was when I was writing the book. That's when he told me something I had no idea, which is he and my brother-in-law had been campaigning on election day in Michigan. All felt good. Then on their way back to DC, they got a call from a friend of ours who was a Democrat who but who was a pundit on Fox News and he was in their boiler room, their war room. And he calls Doug and my brother-in-law Tony to say, "What are you guys hearing? Cuz what I'm hearing concerns me." I didn't know that happened. All I knew was Doug went campaigning with Tony. I was campaigning. Everybody was campaigning. I had a house full of family. When he came back to the house, I knew something was like a little off in retrospect. What I didn't know is he had that information. And he had gone up the stairs to take a shower and pray.</p>
