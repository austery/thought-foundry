### 纳斯达克的财务表现与核心愿景

**主持人:** 艾德娜，很高兴今天能邀请到您。作为**纳斯达克**（Nasdaq: 全球领先的证券交易所集团）的首席执行官，您一定对公司有着非常独特而深刻的见解。没有压力，能来到这里真是太棒了。我们刚刚听到了关于如何打造最优秀公司的讨论。那么，您能先告诉我们，是什么让纳斯达克成为一家伟大的公司吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Hi, great to have you here today, Aduna. As the CEO of NASDAQ, you must have some really, really unique insights into companies. No pressure. No, it's great to be here. So, we've just heard about what makes the best companies. So, do you want to start by telling us what makes NASDAQ great company?</p>
</details>

**艾德娜·弗里德曼:** 谢谢您的提问。我总是从投资者的角度来思考这个问题，当然，这最终会体现在公司的财务业绩上。让我快速回顾一下我们去年的财务状况。去年我们的增长率约为10%。我们拥有57%的**EBITDA**（Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization: 息税折旧摊销前利润）利润率。如果我们将自己视为一家**SaaS**（Software as a Service: 软件即服务）公司，那我们的“67法则”表现将非常出色，这相当不错。我们的业务现金流转换率为102%，这意味着我们是一个现金流非常充沛的业务。所有这些都使我们能够有余地继续发展和扩张业务，因为我们正在提供卓越的业绩。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, thank you for that. Um, so, well, I always think about it from the eyes of the investor and of course that ultimately res, you know, results in the financial performance of the company. So just a quick recap of our finances over the last year. So we've grown about 10% in the last year. We have a 57% IBIDA margin. So that if we were a SAS company, we'd be a rule of 67, which is pretty good. And 102% cash flow conversion in our business. So it's a very cash flow generative business. And all of that, I think, allows um us to have the latitude to continue to grow and expand the business because we're delivering great performance.</p>
</details>

但是，当我们谈论支撑这一切的真正基础是什么，以及我们如何取得这些成果时，首先，我们真正专注于拥有一个非常强大的**北极星愿景**（Northstar: 指引公司战略决策和行动的核心愿景或目标），它真正指导着我们所有的战略决策。我们的北极星愿景就是我们的宗旨，它非常宏大而广泛，即“在全球范围内赋能经济进步”。这是一个非常宏大而广泛的宗旨，但我们的北极星愿景是我们的使命，我们的使命是“成为世界金融系统值得信赖的基石”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But when we say, well, what really underpins that? like what results what how do we drive those kind of results? The first thing is that we really focus on having a very very strong northstar that really guides all of our strategic decision-m and our northstar is our purpose really which is quite big and broad is to empower economic progress around the world which is a very big and broad a broad purpose but our northstar is our vision and our vision is to be the trusted fabric to the world's financial system and when we talk about that we look at that really through the lens of technology how do we make sure that our markets are as technologically advanced as possible.</p>
</details>

当我们谈论这一点时，我们真正通过技术的视角来看待它：我们如何确保我们的市场尽可能地技术先进？我们如何提供领先的软件，真正帮助行业管理风险，并在**流动性**（Liquidity: 资产变现能力）、**透明度**（Transparency: 信息公开程度）和**诚信**（Integrity: 系统的公正性和可靠性）这三个关键维度上最大化我们在市场中的机会？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How do we provide leading software that really allows for us to help the the industry manage risk and really maximize our opportunity in the markets along three key vectors of liquidity, transparency, and integrity?</p>
</details>

然后，我们如何确保公司内部，我们同时保持谦逊和自信？所以我们经常谈论这种我们称之为“谦逊的自信”，我认为认识到总是有很多东西需要学习是很重要的。一家公司一旦自满，就是它开始衰落的时候。尤其是在这个技术转型不断改变每个行业、我们所能做到的一切的时代。我们可以以不同的方式利用技术来推动业务发展。你必须不断学习。你必须确保你总是将新的能力引入你的组织，并且你一直在努力变得更好。我认为有了这个北极星愿景和这种谦逊的自信，这才是我们认为我们作为一个伟大公司所努力实现的基础。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then how do we also make sure that inside the company um we're we're staying humble and confident at the same time. So we talk a lot about that kind of what we call humble confidence or I think it's it's important to recognize that there's so much to learn all the time. The minute a company becomes complacent is the minute they begin to decline. And it's particularly in this world of technological transformation that is changing really every industry every part of what we can be. We can use technology differently to drive our business forward. You have to be a constant learner. You have to make sure that you're always bringing new capabilities into your organization and you're pushing to be better all the time. And I think that with that northstar and that humble confidence, I think that's really what we see as being the underpinnings of what what we're trying to achieve as a great company.</p>
</details>

### 纳斯达克的转型与全球影响力

**主持人:** 是的，关于学习这一点非常重要。您学到了很多。您在纳斯达克工作了很长时间。您当年从实习生做起，一路走来成为首席执行官，经历了一段相当非凡的旅程。那么，您能告诉我们您在这一路上学到了什么，以及在您的领导下，纳斯达克是如何转型的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. And the point about learning is really important. And you've learned a lot. You've been in NASDAQ for a long time. You started as an intern back in the days and you've had a quite a remarkable journey to CEO. So can you tell us what learnings have you made along the way and uh how has NASDAQ transformed under your leadership?</p>
</details>

**艾德娜·弗里德曼:** 我32年前刚开始工作时，纳斯达克确实大不相同。您很仁慈，没有告诉大家那有多久了。但是的，我确实是从纳斯达克的交易部门开始的。当时，我们当然是一个很棒的市场，但我们仍然是一家非常年轻的公司，试图弄清楚如何成为一家商业企业，如何以不同的方式推动市场向前发展。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, NASDAQ really was quite different when I started 32 years ago. So um and you were kind not to tell people how long that would been. Uh um but yeah, I I did start in the trading division at NASDAQ and at the time, you know, we were of course then a a great market, but we were still really a very young company trying to figure out how to be a commercial enterprise, how to drive markets forward in a different way.</p>
</details>

在那整个时期，我们一直在努力转型业务，并在行业中产生更大的影响。因此，我们从一个在美国具有变革性的市场运营商，发展壮大并扩展到多种资产类别，包括美国的股票和期权，并扩展到欧洲，我们稍后会谈到这一点。我们拥有并运营着北欧大部分交易所，除了奥斯陆证券交易所。因此，我们是欧洲一个规模非常大的参与者。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And we've been on a journey now for for that entire period of time to really try to transform our business and to have a bigger impact in the industry. So we've gone from being a really transformative market operator within the United States um to growing and expanding into multiple asset classes with equities and options in the US expanding into Europe and we'll talk about that. We own and operate most of the exchanges in the Nordics with the exception of Ozor. Um so we we are um a very scale player here in Europe.</p>
</details>

然后，我们真正扩展到了软件业务，这实际上始于收购**OMX**（OMX AB: 一家瑞典-芬兰金融服务公司，曾运营北欧和波罗的海地区的证券交易所，后被纳斯达克收购）。OMX是北欧的运营商，在其组织内部拥有市场技术业务，这就像一个隐藏的宝藏。但它真正做的是使业务全球化，以及公司对世界各地市场的影响力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and then we've really expanded to um go into the software business and it started actually with the acquisition of OMX which was the Nordic operator where they had um a market technology business within their organization and it was kind of this hidden gem but it really what it did was it globalized the business and the impact that the company had on markets around the world.</p>
</details>

因此，今天我们为全球135个市场提供技术。我们为全球3600家银行和**经纪自营商**（Broker-dealer: 既为客户执行交易又为自身账户进行交易的金融机构）提供技术，涵盖其风险管理和交易运营的所有关键方面。因此，我认为通过这些，我们已经成为一个规模更大的业务，成为客户更大的合作伙伴。这很有趣，因为通过帮助他们最大化流动性，帮助他们最大化系统内的透明度和系统的诚信，这确实有利于市场。因此，它最终又回到了我们更有能力成为一个伟大的市场运营商的循环中。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So today we provide technology to 135 markets around the world. We provide technology to 3,600 banks and brokerage firms around the world in all of their key vectors of of risk management and trade operations. And so with that, I think we've become a much more scaled business, a bigger partner to the clients. And it's interesting because by helping them maximize liquidity, helping them maximize the transparency within the system and the integrity of the system, that really occurs to the benefit of markets. And so it kind of comes full circle back into us being um even more equipped to be a great market operator.</p>
</details>

### 市场诚信与金融犯罪防范的重要性

**主持人:** 我想您已经触及了这一点，但纳斯达克，我想大多数人仍然认为它主要是一个交易所，但你们做的远不止这些。例如，你们非常关注金融系统的复杂性以及金融犯罪的预防。那么，为什么这很重要呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think you're touching a bit on that, but NASDAQ, well, I think most most people still think of NASDAQ as mostly an exchange, but you do much more than that. and uh you're for example very involved in in complexity of the financial system and uh prevention of financial crime. So what why is that important?</p>
</details>

**艾德娜·弗里德曼:** 归根结底，如果我们系统有诚信，人们就会信任这个系统。我们最终希望投资者在将资金投入风险中，为自己创造储蓄和财富时，能够感受到极大的信任。所以我们希望确保系统本身能够为他们服务，我们非常关注流动性、透明度和诚信这三个关键支柱。这些是伟大市场的基础，但它们也是一个伟大金融系统的基础。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well at the end of the day if if we have uh integrity in the system people will trust the system and we want ultimately for investors to feel a great deal of trust when they're putting their money putting money at risk um to to drive savings and and wealth creation for themselves. So we want to make sure that the system itself works for them and we focus a lot on those three key pillars of liquidity, transparency, integrity. Those are the underpinnings of a great market but they're also the underpinnings of a great financial system.</p>
</details>

我们的观点是，作为一个市场，我们可以做很多事情来推动这一点。但作为市场的技术提供商，作为金融参与者的技术提供商，它使我们能够更有效地将这三个关键支柱传播到整个系统中。坦率地说，如果我们审视一些我们运营解决方案的新兴市场，无论是我们的市场技术还是我们的经纪自营商和银行技术，它都能让整个经济体提升自身，变得更具创新性，推动本国创新，吸引外国投资，因为人们更信任这个系统，这反过来又创造了经济增长的良性循环。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And uh our view is that that as a market we can do so much to kind of drive that. But as a technology provider to markets, as a technology provider to the financial the financial players, it it kind of it allows us to spread those three key pillars across the system more effectively. And and frankly if we are looking at some of the emerging markets where we operate our solutions both our market our market technology and our broker dealer and uh financial uh the banking technology it allows that whole economy to lift itself up to be to be able to um be more innovative themselves drive innovation in their country drive foreign investment into their country because people trust the system more which then of course creates that positive flywheel of economic growth so it's very important but I think that at the end of the day, we'll talk more about financial crime, but it is such a big problem within the industry that it requires great technology to be able to help solve that problem and and we're really proud to be one of the technology providers to to work on that.</p>
</details>

所以这非常重要，但我认为归根结底，我们稍后会更多地谈论金融犯罪，但它在行业中是一个如此大的问题，需要先进的技术才能帮助解决这个问题，我们很自豪能成为致力于此的技术提供商之一。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so it's very important but I think that at the end of the day, we'll talk more about financial crime, but it is such a big problem within the industry that it requires great technology to be able to help solve that problem and and we're really proud to be one of the technology providers to to work on that.</p>
</details>

### 卓越公司的特质

**主持人:** 那么，考虑到会议的主题以及如何打造伟大公司，纳斯达克上市了一些世界上最具创新性的公司，以及许多最大的科技公司。那么，您会说，是什么将一家优秀的公司与一家真正伟大的公司区分开来呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, thinking a little bit about the theme of the conference and what makes great companies. So, NASDAQ lists some of the most innovative companies in the world and uh many of the biggest tech companies. So what would you say what separates a good company from a truly great one?</p>
</details>

**艾德娜·弗里德曼:** 是的。首先，我会指出技术。那些积极利用技术来推动和颠覆自身，真正以不同方式思考如何利用现有技术解决问题的公司。然后，正如我之前所说，是不断学习并努力更好地部署技术来解决问题。我们认为，在任何行业中，这不仅仅是作为一家科技公司，而是利用技术以不同方式解决问题并推动业务向前发展，这绝对是成功的要素之一。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Well, first I I would point to technology um companies that lean in to technology to help drive and disrupt themselves to really think differently about how to solve a problem with the technology that exists today. And then really as I said before is constantly learning and striving to be better at deploying technology to solve problems. we see as in in any sector that's not just as a technology company but leveraging technology to solve a problem differently and to drive to drive the business forward we see as definitely one of the ingredients.</p>
</details>

第二是确保你以一种有韧性的方式运营。这很有趣，当你遇到一些年轻的企业家时，他们对正在做的事情感到非常兴奋，但你也必须思考你正在做什么来创建一个有韧性的业务。对我来说，正如我之前提到的，我们的现金流转换率，你知道，现金为王。因此，实现盈利和现金流，一种正向的现金流状态，我认为应该是每家公司的目标，同时他们仍在推动增长和技术创新，而技术现在实际上可以成为实现这一目标的推动者。你现在可以利用技术更有效地推动增长，变得更具韧性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The second is making sure that you operate a resilient you in a in resilient manner. Um, and it's interesting, you know, when you meet some young entrepreneurs, they they get very excited about what they're doing, but they you also have to think about what are you doing to create a resilient business. And to me, uh, as I mentioned, our cash flow conversion, you know, cash is king. So, getting to a state of profitability and cash flow, a positive cash flow state is, I think, should be the goal of every company while they're still driving growth and innovating in technology and technology now can actually be an enabler of that. You can leverage technology now to become to drive growth more efficiently to become more resilient.</p>
</details>

然后，确保你有一个非常强大的使命和北极星愿景，你可以将其传达给投资者，然后你可以谈论你将采取的里程碑来实现这些宏伟目标，而且你显然必须执行这些目标。这样投资者才会相信你正在带领他们踏上一段他们能够理解并预见的旅程。但始终要努力做得更好，在如何解决你决定通过业务解决的问题方面。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and then to make sure that you have a very strong mission and a north star that you can communicate to investors that you can then talk about the milestones that you're going to take to achieve those great ambitions and that you al obviously have to execute against those. So so that investors feel trust that you're taking them on a journey that they that they can understand and they can see in front of them. but always always striving to be better um in terms of how you're solving the problems that you've decided to solve with your business.</p>
</details>

**主持人:** 你们在公司选择上市之前，甚至在它们上市之前，就已经与它们打交道了，当它们正在努力进入公开市场时。那么，有什么经验教训可以吸取吗？您能看出谁会变得伟大，谁最终会成功吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So you you're meeting with companies be way before they choose to go public and way before they list and as they're working their way towards the public markets. uh what are there any lessons to be learned and can you can you see who will uh going to be who is going to be great and who will ultimately well a lot of it comes back to what I just said in terms of making sure that you're driving towards a really important goal making sure you're building a truly resilient company and that you're leveraging technology in every possible way to be able to achieve your vision and your mission um and but even then you know not every company is going to be able to um uh you have to recognize the fact that you also have to look at what's the total market opportunity in front of them and there are other ingredients that also go into an investment thesis like what is a total market opportunity how fast is that growing how well positioned are they how quickly can they open the doors but then lastly I would say making sure from a resiliency perspective that they're also thinking about that integrity you know sometimes you want to break something you want to break a system to make it better uh and I think that's actually frankly been the quintessential element of of a lot of technological advancements and and the innovation ecosystem that exists in the US, but you also have to reflect on are you ultimately providing a lasting benefit to the end client or end consumer and are they um you know and are you breaking things that matter and making sure that you're working within the system when you need to and you're trying to kind of create a new system where you have the opportunity to but ultimately for the end benefit of the consumer.</p>
</details>

**艾德娜·弗里德曼:** 很多都回到了我刚才所说的，即确保你正在朝着一个真正重要的目标前进，确保你正在建立一家真正有韧性的公司，并且你正在以一切可能的方式利用技术来实现你的愿景和使命。但即便如此，你也必须认识到，你还必须审视摆在他们面前的整体市场机会是什么，还有其他因素也构成了投资论点，比如整体市场机会是什么，它增长有多快，他们的定位如何，他们能多快打开大门。但最后，我想说的是，从韧性的角度来看，确保他们也在思考诚信问题。你知道，有时你想要打破一些东西，你想要打破一个系统以使其变得更好，我认为这实际上坦率地说，是美国许多技术进步和创新生态系统的精髓。但你也必须反思，你最终是否为最终客户或消费者提供了持久的利益，以及你是否正在打破重要的事情，并确保在需要时在系统内工作，并在有机会时尝试创建一个新系统，但最终都是为了消费者的利益。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but then lastly I would say making sure from a resiliency perspective that they're also thinking about that integrity you know sometimes you want to break something you want to break a system to make it better uh and I think that's actually frankly been the quintessential element of of a lot of technological advancements and and the innovation ecosystem that exists in the US, but you also have to reflect on are you ultimately providing a lasting benefit to the end client or end consumer and are they um you know and are you breaking things that matter and making sure that you're working within the system when you need to and you're trying to kind of create a new system where you have the opportunity to but ultimately for the end benefit of the consumer.</p>
</details>

### 北欧资本市场的活力

**主持人:** 是的，您经常谈到北欧股市，并且你们运营着其中许多交易所，但正如我们所知，不包括挪威的。但北欧股市与许多其他欧洲市场相比脱颖而出，我们现在在挪威。所以我想知道，是什么让北欧资本市场如此充满活力，与一些其他市场相比？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. So you often talk about the Nordic stock markets and uh you operate many of them, not the Norwegian as we heard, but um the fact that the Nordic stock market stand out compared to many other European markets and we're here in Norway now. So I'm curious what makes the Nordic capital market so dynamic compared to some of some other markets.</p>
</details>

**艾德娜·弗里德曼:** 嗯，目前在欧洲，关于如何改进和使欧洲资本市场更具活力，以及如何推动欧洲经济体的经济增长和创新，存在着一场大辩论和讨论。我一直非常坚定地说，你不需要看向美国来回答这个问题。你需要看向瑞典和更广泛的北欧市场。我之所以使用瑞典，是因为我们拥有并运营着瑞典证券交易所，并且我们非常积极地参与其中。但我们也可以将丹麦、芬兰和挪威视为典范。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, right now in Europe, there's a big debate and discussion about how do we improve and make the capital markets in Europe more vibrant. Um, and and also really to drive economic growth and innovation within within the economies here in Europe. And I've I've been saying very consistently, you do not need to look to the United States to answer that question. You need to look to Sweden and to the the broader Nordic markets. And I use Sweden because we have we own and operate the Swedish stock exchange and we're very engaged there. But we can also look to Denmark, Finland, and Norway as being exemplars of this.</p>
</details>

我研究瑞典最多，所以我将从那里开始。对于瑞典，我们喜欢认为纳斯达克作为市场运营商在那里有所帮助。我确实认为我们在那里为促进市场生态系统所做的技术进步和事情是成功的一个因素。但它远不止于此。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So if I uh but I've studied Sweden the most, so I'm going to start there. Um so with Sweden, it's we love to think that having NASDAQ as a market operator there helps. Um and I do think that the technological advancements and things that we've done to really promote the market ecosystem there have been an ingredient to success. But it starts much it's much bigger than that.</p>
</details>

首先，我认为北欧的这些国家已经认识到它们是小国，但它们希望对世界产生巨大的影响。它们在现代经济的早期就决定成为全球性企业，真正促进全球贸易并超越国界。因此，这种不断审视自身系统之外，思考我们能对全球经济产生什么影响，并真正促进全球业务的观念，这是第一点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, first I think that the the countries here in the Nordics have recognized that they're small countries but they want to have an outsized impact on the world. They've decided, you know, very early on um in the modern economy to be global businesses to really promote global trade and to go beyond their borders. So that that notion of constantly looking outside the system you're in to say what impact can we have on the broader economy around the world and to really promote global businesses, number one.</p>
</details>

第二，拥有一个优秀的大学系统，真正推动现代经济成功所需的现代技能。我认为这是北欧系统的精髓之一。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Number two, to have a great university system that really um kind of drives towards the modern skills that are needed to succeed in a modern economy. I think that's one of the quintessential elements of the Nordic system.</p>
</details>

第三是承担风险的能力，这种冒险文化，我们在美国也谈到过。我认为在北欧，北欧国家创造了这种伟大的社会安全网。因此，如果你是这个国家的公民，并且拥有这个安全的社会安全网，你就应该用你的可支配资本承担更多风险。你应该认识到，由于拥有这个优秀的系统，你可以将你的资本进行投资，而不是仅仅存入储蓄账户，从而创造财富，并在生活中给自己带来更多机会。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The third is the ability for ris like this risk-taking culture and we talked about in the United States. I think here in the Nordics, the Nordic countries have created this great social safety net. And that as a result, if you're a cons a citizen of the country and you have this safe social safety net, you should be you taking more risk with your discretionary capital. You should be re realizing that as a result of having that great system around you. You can take your capital and and invest it as opposed to just putting into a savings account and drive wealth creation and give yourself even more opportunity in life.</p>
</details>

我认为因此他们实施了这些非常具体的税收导向计划。其中最具影响力的就是瑞典的**ISK**（Investeringssparkonto: 投资储蓄账户）计划。这是一种具有税收优惠的储蓄账户。只要你将资金投入公开股票，这是你唯一的义务。你每年只需为你持有的总资产支付约1%的税，而且没有资本利得税。自2012年该计划实施以来，瑞典公民的股票持有量一直呈直线上升趋势。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I think that as a result they've done these very specific tax um oriented um uh programs. So the most uh influential has been the ISK program in Sweden. It's a tax advantaged savings account. Um you can invest in any as long as you put your money into public equities. That's that's your only obligation. You you get you pay about 1% tax on your total holdings every year and there's no cap gains tax. And the result of that has been the ownership of equities within the citizens of Sweden has been straight up and to the right since 2012 since that program was implemented.</p>
</details>

所以它实际上是在鼓励公民投资股票，承担风险，拥有自己的财务，具备金融素养，帮助他们规划未来。这反过来又在国家内部创造了一个零售生态系统，加上我们国家内部优秀的养老金系统，真正推动了经济活动、增长和扩张的良性循环。我们在北欧有1200家上市公司。在过去五年里，仅瑞典就有450家公司上市。哦，抱歉，是整个北欧地区。所以这是一个令人惊叹的系统，这背后是许多有意的行动。答案很长，但非常重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So it's really kind of given it's actually encouraging citizens to invest in equities to to take that risk to own their own financials to be financially literate to help them kind of drive their future. And that then creates a retail ecosystem inside the country with a great pension system inside our countries. Um that really drives for that flywheel of economic activity, growth, expansion. We have 1,200 companies listed in the Nordics. Um we've had 450 companies go public just in Sweden alone. Oh, I'm sorry, across the Nordics in the last five years. So it's really an it's an amazing system on the back of a lot of intentional action. Long answer, but really important.</p>
</details>

**主持人:** 不，但我认为这是一个非常重要的观点，可能对在座的听众来说很有趣。所以，非常值得花时间讨论。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No, but I I think that's a really important point and probably of interest to to the people in this uh audience. So, um well worth spending time on.</p>
</details>

### 技术（AI与云）如何塑造金融市场

**主持人:** 那么，回到技术和现在正在发生的一些技术进步。你们如何利用**人工智能**（AI: Artificial Intelligence: 模拟人类智能的计算机系统）和**云计算**（Cloud Computing: 通过互联网提供计算服务）等技术来驱动和塑造金融市场的未来？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um so, going back a little bit to technology and and some of the technology advances that's happening now. So, how are you using technologies like AI and cloud to power and shape the future of the financial markets?</p>
</details>

**艾德娜·弗里德曼:** 是的。我认为我们正在以两种不同的方式使用它们。我首先会谈谈市场，然后我会谈谈我们的反金融犯罪业务，我们在那里使用了许多先进的人工智能技术。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Well, I think we we are using in two different ways. I would actually point to the markets and then I'll talk about our anti-financial crime business where we have a lot of advanced AI that we're using there.</p>
</details>

在市场方面，我们使用人工智能来确保我们以非常动态的方式管理容量规划。我们的系统处理着巨大的消息流量。例如，在四月的前两周，我们创下了有史以来单日最高峰值，一天内有5500亿条消息流经我们的市场。因此，我们必须确保我们以非常动态的水平管理容量。所以我们使用人工智能算法来帮助预测容量需求。

<details>

<p class="english-text">So in the markets um we use we use AI to actually make sure that we're managing our capacity planning uh in a very dynamic way. We managed an enormous amount of message traffic through our systems. For example, in the first two weeks of April, we had our peak day ever of 550 billion messages that flowed through our markets in in a day. Um and so we have to make sure we're managing our capacity on a very dynamic level. So we use AI algorithms to help predict capacity needs.</p>
</details>

第二，我们在市场中拥有人工智能驱动的订单类型，以真正提升投资者在我们市场中的体验。

<details>

<p class="english-text">The second is we have AIdriven um order types in our markets um to really kind of enhance the investor experience in our markets.</p>
</details>

第三是利用**云计算**（Cloud Computing: 通过互联网提供计算服务）的最佳能力。我们与**AWS**（Amazon Web Services: 亚马逊云计算服务）合作。他们已经进入了我们的数据中心。我们已经将我们的市场迁移到云技术几年了，在提高可扩展性、降低延迟以及在与AWS合作中提高伟大市场的其他关键特性方面，这是一个很棒的体验。所以我们知道这确实是市场的未来，我们很高兴现在与他们合作，将所有这些引入我们的北欧市场，然后将它带给全球的市场技术客户。

<details>

<p class="english-text">And then I think that the the third is to use the best of cloud capabilities. So we have AWS as a partner. They've come into our data center. We've we've been moving our markets to cloud technology now for a couple of years and it's been a great experience in terms of improving even the scalability, the latency and all the key characteristics of great markets with in our partnership with AWS. So we know that that's really the future of markets and we're excited to partner with them now to bring all of that into our Nordic markets and then to bring that across the world to our market techch clients.</p>
</details>

但人工智能，我认为在纳斯达克内部最有效的人工智能应用是在反金融犯罪领域。我们收购了一家名为**Verafin**（Verafin: 一家专注于反金融犯罪和欺诈检测技术的公司）的公司，大约在四年半前。这家公司和我们的团队真正使用人工智能算法来根除犯罪分子。我们将所有数据整合在一起。我们被允许在美国共享数据。所以我们有一个跨银行的数据联盟，其中有2600家银行。它使我们能够寻找犯罪行为的模式和做法，并在我们编写的拓扑结构中非常具体，以便我们能够更有效地根除犯罪分子。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But AI I think is actually the most effective use of AI within NASDAQ has been in anti-financial crime. So we have a company called Verafin that we acquired um four and a half years ago and they uh that that business and our team really uses AI algorithms to root out criminal actors. We bring all of the data together. So we are allowed to share data in the United States. So we share I have a data consorcia across the banks. fit 2600 banks in that consortia and it allows us to look for patterns and practices of criminal behaviors and be very specific in the topologies that we write to to make it so we can be more effective in rooting out criminals.</p>
</details>

然后我们使用**生成式人工智能**（Gen AI: Generative Artificial Intelligence: 能够生成文本、图像或其他媒体内容的人工智能）来自动化工作流程。因此，当你研究一个潜在的犯罪分子时（顺便说一句，你的系统每天都会发出成千上万的警报），你如何使其尽可能高效和自动化？所以我们有这个实体研究副驾驶，它自动化了研究实体以寻找犯罪分子的过程，然后编写报告。所以你所需要做的就是审查报告并提交。这非常酷。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then we use Gen AI um on automating workflows. So as you're researching a potentially bad actor, which by the way there are thousands and thousands of alerts that come out of your systems every day. Um how do you make that as efficient and automated as possible? So we have this entity research co-pilot that automates the process of researching entities to look for criminals um and then writes the report um and so that all you have to do is review review the report and submit. So very cool.</p>

### 公司长期保持私有化的趋势

**主持人:** 是的。纳斯达克主要在公开市场运营。一段时间以来，全球趋势是越来越少的公司上市。它们保持私有化更长时间，甚至永远。那么，是什么推动了这一趋势？在您看来，公司为什么要努力进入公开市场？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. So your NASDAQ you mainly operate in public markets. So for a while now there's been a global trend that fewer and fewer companies are going public. They're staying private for longer or forever. So what's driving this trend? And uh in your view, why should companies work toward public markets?</p>
</details>

**艾德娜·弗里德曼:** 嗯，我认为这既有周期性因素，也有结构性因素。从周期性角度来看，我们生活在一个私人资本大量增长的世界。它每年增长约15%，2023年约有15万亿美元的私人资本，而公共股权资本为115万亿美元，但每年仅增长3%。因此，你看到了一种向私人资本的转变，我认为这与投资生态系统内部的趋势有关。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I I do think that there's a cyclical element to that and then and then a structural element to that. So, you know, cycllically speaking, you have a world where we have a lot of company a lot of private capital that's growing. It's growing at about it's about 15 about in 2023, there's about 15 trillion of private capital growing 15% a year versus $115 trillion of public equity capital, but only growing 3% a year. So you've got kind of a shift towards some private private capital and that I think goes towards um just the the trends within within the the investment ecosystem.</p>
</details>

但要对抗这种趋势，你必须认识到竞争更加激烈。你知道，你希望公开市场是每个人都兴奋并努力进入的地方，让他们的公司对普通公民、普通散户投资者开放。大规模实现这一目标的唯一方法就是上市，让你的国家的公民参与到你国家的增长中，并通过投资创造这种参与的良性循环。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But to fight that trend, you have to therefore realize that there's more competition. You know, you want the public markets to be where everyone is excited and strives to come into the public markets to make their companies accessible to everyday citizens, everyday retail investors. and that the only way to really do that at scale is to go public and to to make it so that the citizens of your country are engaged in the growth of your country and you create that virtuous flywheel of that engagement through investment.</p>
</details>

因此，我们专注于美国存在的许多政策问题。每个人都说美国是伟大的市场，它们确实如此，但我们上市公司的数量也在下降。所以我们谈论披露义务。让我们简化这些。让我们减轻公司的一些负担。**委托书改革**（Proxy reform: 旨在改善股东投票流程和公司治理的改革），即对不同提案进行投票的过程，坦率地说，是重新思考整个委托书流程。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So um we have focused on a lot of policy issues that exist in the United States. Um so everyone talks about the US as being great markets and they are but we still have had a decline of public companies as well and so we talk about um disclosure obligations. Let's streamline those. let's take some of the burden off the companies there. Proxy reform, which is the the process of voting for its different proposals and really really frankly rethinking the entire proxy process.</p>
</details>

然后第三是**诉讼改革**（Litigation reform: 旨在减少不必要的诉讼或简化诉讼程序的改革）以及其他真正阻碍公司为股东最大化回报的事情。所以我们的观点是，如果我们能在这三件事上取得进展，它将改变上市的意义，并给我们一个机会让更多公司进入公开市场。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um and then thirdly on litigation reform and other things that really keep companies from actually maximizing returns for their shareholders. So what our view is that if we can make progress on those three things, it will change the u what being public means and it gives us an opportunity to get more companies into public markets.</p>
</details>

因为正如您所说，这为散户投资者、普通投资者提供了参与价值创造的机会。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">because as you say that gives uh access for the retail investors for the average investor to to actually take part in that value creation.</p>
</details>

**主持人:** 那么，随着公司长期保持私有化，您是否担心普通大众参与价值创造的能力？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So with with companies staying private for longer, uh are you concerned about the um abilities for the general public to take part in that value creation? And um it's a it's a major issue.</p>
</details>

**艾德娜·弗里德曼:** 这是一个重大问题。我认为我们必须认识到，美国有56%的成年人拥有股票。但是，只有极少数人能够接触到私人投资。你可能会说，我们是否应该让私人投资更容易获得？我认为有一些方法可以做到这一点。但经济的真正力量在于那些公开市场，在那里，广大公民参与到经济增长中，坦率地说，当经济受益时，他们也会受益。这才是真正创造良性循环的原因，我们希望成为这一循环的管理者。因此，我们希望在那里进行一些改革。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I I think we have to recognize that um really 56% of American adults own equities in the United States. Um but but only, you know, a very small fraction of them have access to private private investments. And you could say, well, should you make private investments more accessible? I think there are ways to do that. But the the real strength of the economy is in those public markets where you get the the broad base of citizen involved in driving the growth of the economy and and frankly they benefit when the economy benefits. That's what really creates a virtuous cycle and we're we want to be stewards of that. Um and so we're hoping to get some reform done there.</p>
</details>

**主持人:** 我认为这是一个很好的结束点。非常感谢您分享的所有见解。谢谢您。
