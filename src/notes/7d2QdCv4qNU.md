### 硅谷：机遇与挑战并存的创业之地

大家好，很高兴今年能来到这里。今天我不想谈论自动驾驶，而是想聊聊普遍意义上的创业。每次来到湾区，我都觉得这里是片充满希望的土地，奇迹在这里发生，当然，也伴随着更多的戏剧性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Hello everyone. Glad to be here this year. Oh, okay. Okay. Wanted to talk about not about autonomous driving today. I wanted to talk about entrepreneurship in general. You know, every time when I visit the Bay Area, I feel this is a promised land. A lot of miracles happening here and more drama of course.</p>
</details>

### 两种资本：风险投资与共识资本

事实上，在创业圈摸爬滚打十年后，我发现资本并非只有**VC**（Venture Capital: 风险投资）一种。实际上存在两种类型的资本：一种是**风险投资**，另一种是**共识资本**（Consensus Capital: 追逐市场热点的投资）。风险投资押注于那些足以改变世界的宏大想法，那些其他人尚不相信的想法，所以我们称之为风险投资。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So there will be two types of uh capitals. In fact after 10 years in a in doing all kinds of uh startups I found that it's actually not only about VC there are two types of capitals. One is called venture capital and the other one is called consensus capital and venture capital bet on ideas. Ideas where it's big enough to change the world. ideas where pe other people don't believe in. So that's why you call them venture capital.</p>
</details>

然而，许多其他资本是为了共识而来。因此，**共识资本**就是那种，比如两年前，每个人都在谈论**大语言模型**（Large Language Model: 基于海量文本数据训练的深度学习模型），认为那是值得押注的方向，于是你就跟着押注。即使你的押注错了，也没关系，因为大家都有同样的感觉。而且，你通常可以在A轮进入，在C轮退出，然后就能赚钱，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But many other capitals are here to bet for consensus. So consensus capital is the type of capital where okay two years ago everyone thinking about large language model that's the thing to bet. So you bet on it. Uh even if you bet your bet is wrong there's no problem because everyone is feeling the same. And more often you can get in in a round and get out in C round. and you can make money, right?</p>
</details>

所以，那是**共识资本**。人们可能会觉得，每个人都在谈论VC，VC，VC，所以VC可能是资本主义的主体。但实际上，我感觉**共识资本**才是更普遍的现象。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So that's a consensus capital and people may feel that well everyone is talking about VC and VC and VC. So VC might be the majority of this capitalism. But in fact what I feel is that the consensus capital is actually more typical.</p>
</details>

这是一个事实。我并不是说**共识资本**是邪恶的或什么的。实际上，他们有自己的理由，因为每个基金都有一定的年限限制，需要在规定时间内向投资者返还资金，所以他们必须押注于具有一定确定性的项目。像**Andreessen Horowitz**（美国著名风险投资公司，常被称为A16Z）这样的大型基金，确实为他们的投资者赚取了丰厚的回报，但归根结底，他们也是在押注共识。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's a matter of fact. I'm not really trying to say consensus capital is evil or anything. It's actually they have their reasons because every fund they have a certain limit of years to return to the in to their investors so that they have to bet on something that has certain amount of certainty and also the biggest fund like Andrea Horowway is actually is is making great money for their investors but after all they are betting money on the consensus.</p>
</details>

看看今天的共识：我们有机器人技术，我们有**BCI**（Brain-Computer Interface: 脑机接口），我们曾经有自动驾驶，但现在不再是了。这些都是我们谈论的共识。所以，在硅谷，我时不时地听到人们，甚至在餐馆里，都在谈论一些流行词，这些就是共识。它们吸引人们进入，吸引投资涌入，并创造奇迹。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and look at the consensus today we have a robotics and we have a BCI right and we we used to have autonomous driving but not any not anymore but those are the consensus we talk about. So every now and then in the Silicon Valley I hear people even in the restaurant I hear people talking about some buzzwords and those are the consensus and those what attracts people getting in attracts investment getting in and making miracles happen</p>
</details>

### 创始人类型与热潮周期

但对于创始人来说，选择并不总是进入一个共识领域。因为如果我进入那个共识领域，我的同行们也都在进入同样的共识，那么每个人都在同一个话题上竞争，这在硅谷这片充满希望的土地上太常见了。我想说，有两种类型的创始人。一种我们称之为做**初创公司**（Startup: 旨在快速增长并最终被收购或上市的企业）的创始人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but the choice is for the founders it's not always true that we get into something that is a consensus because hey if I'm getting into that consensus and my peers are also getting into the same consensus everyone is competing on the same topic that happens too often in this promised land in here in the Silicon Valley and I would say there are two types of founders. One we call them the founders who does startups. The founder do who does startup is a founder that has a certain time before the consensus is running out.</p>
</details>

这类创始人必须在共识周期结束前找到出路。这是一种典型的初创公司模式。我有一些朋友就是这样，他们反复创办小公司，被大公司收购，然后又重新开始。这是一种生活方式，我称之为初创公司。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">They got to make their way out. That is a typical startup. So I I have several friends who just repeatedly starting small businesses getting acquired by big companies and restart again. So that's a lifestyle. So I call them startups.</p>
</details>

另一种是**企业**（Enterprise: 旨在长期发展并独立运营的公司），因为如果你真的把你的公司卖给一家大公司，你就无法继续这段旅程了。其他人会接管，你会被董事会管理，而他们不是由愿景驱动的，他们是由下一年的、下一季度的或年度的财务报告驱动的。所以，如果你想做一些你想走到最后的事情，我称之为**企业**。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The other one is enterprise because if you really sell your company to a big company, uh you you sell your startup to a big company, there's no way for you to continue the journey. Someone else is taking over and you you have a board that managing you and they are not driven by the vision. They're driven by the next year, next uh quarterly report or annual report of the financials. So uh the other one if you're trying to do something you wanted to go to the very end of it I call them enterprises.</p>
</details>

这是一种结果导向的模式。因此，时间导向和结果导向的玩法之间存在着非常不同的心态。当然，所有这些都受到了共识的影响。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So that's results driven. So there's a very different mentality between the timed driven and results driven play. And of course all of that has been influenced by the consensus</p>
</details>

我们都知道，这就是典型的**Gartner技术成熟度曲线**（Gartner Cycle of Hype: 描述新技术从萌芽到成熟的周期）。每年都有新事物出现。我特意为这次会议选择了这个与AI相关的Gartner周期，这不是我的观点，而是Gartner研究所的观点。人们谈论这个，我想这肯定不是你第一次看到它。但我从这个周期中看到两件事：一是总体趋势，事物需要很多年才能成熟，最终达到右下角的生产力高原。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</p>
<p class="english-text">and we all know this. This is a very typical Gartner Gartner cycle of hype. Every year uh there's a new thing and I try to uh for specifically choose for this meeting this is a AI related gardener cycle not my opinion but Gartner Institute's opinion about it people talk about this I think this is definitely not the first time you saw it but what I see from this cycle is that there are two things one in the general trend things take a lot of years to mature to the right end to finally plateau of productivity on the right bottom</p>
</details>

但存在一个热潮周期，事实上，热潮周期换句话说，就是共识的注意力持续时间。很多人关注一件事。当然，这是一种现象，但这种现象，这场“派对”只持续一定时间，通常不超过五年，有时甚至只有一年。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But there is a hype cycle and in fact hype cycle in other words is actually the attention span of the consensus. A lot of people focusing in one thing. Of course this is a phenomena but this phenomena this party only lasts for certain amount of time normally not more than five years sometimes even one year.</p>
</details>

比如，今天有多少人开始考虑创办一家**大语言模型**公司？这不是一门好生意，对吧？也许明天**OpenAI**就会推出另一个功能，让你无法生存。我在2023年和投资者谈过这个问题，但人们不听。但你知道，今年我们可能会谈论机器人技术，但你知道，两年后，有些人会告诉你，哦，当然，机器人技术在2025年不是一门好生意，这是一个非常自然的问题。原因在于A、B、C。两年后，人们会告诉你，这又成了一个新的共识。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Like how many of you started thinking about starting building a large language model company as of today? Not a good business right? Maybe tomorrow OpenAI would have another feature that kills you. I talk about this to investors back in 2023, but people don't listen. But you know, this year maybe we can talk about robotics, but you know, two years in the future, some some people would tell you, oh, of course, that's that's a very natural uh issue for robotics to to robotics is not a good business in 2025. And the reason is A, B, and C. Two years later, people will tell you that that becomes a new consensus of course.</p>
</details>

所以，共识的持续时间相对较短，但要成就一番事业，建立一个**企业**，则需要更长的时间。这就是我所说的**错配**，特别是当我们考虑构建**硬科技**（Hard Tech: 需要长期研发投入的底层技术）时。很多人像我一样来自学术界，我们进入初创公司或企业界，无论我们做什么，都是在构建事物。构建硬科技本身就已经非常非常折磨人，而且需要很长时间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So consensus has a very relatively short time span but in order to achieve something achieving an enterprise takes much longer time. So this this is what I call a mismatch especially if we're thinking about building hard texts. A lot of people are like me who are coming from the academia and we get into the startup world or enterprise world whatever we build things. Building hard tech itself is already very very torturing and it takes a long time.</p>
</details>

更糟糕的是，我们还必须围绕它构建产品。因为构建技术，你知道，你拥有伟大的技术，但它并不能真正赚钱。你需要找到客户，你需要打磨你的产品，而不仅仅是核心技术。那些算法相对便宜，产品才是赚钱的。但是，构建产品加上构建技术，我们如何在短短一个共识周期内完成所有这些呢？很多时候，在我们甚至还没完成硬科技的构建之前，共识周期就已经过去了。这是一个悲哀的现实，这也是许多公司遭受痛苦的原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But even worse, we also have to build the product around it. Because building technology, you know, you have great technology, but it doesn't really make money out of it. You need to find the customer, you need to polish your product instead of uh instead just the core technology. Those algorithms are relatively cheap. The product is what makes money. But building product plus building tech, how can we squeeze all of that within one consensus cycle? And very often the consensus cycle is gone before we even finish building the hard tech. That's a sad reality and that's why many of the company are suffering.</p>
</details>

### 热潮后的世界：挑战与现实

我认为，大多数伟大的技术都必须经历这些周期。它们不能只停留在某个周期内就完成所有构建。如果你在一个周期内构建所有东西，我告诉你，你正在建立一个小型企业，而不是一个**企业**。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Thinking about this great technologies my opinion most of the grid technology they must go through the cycles. They can't really just stay in one cycle and build everything. If you're building that in within one cycle I'm telling you you're building a small business. You're not building an enterprise.</p>
</details>

所有这些东西，比如**虚拟现实**（Virtual Reality: 模拟真实或虚构环境的三维计算机技术）。今天有多少人在谈论虚拟现实？早在2016年，我有一个在硅谷最好的朋友决定回中国创办自己的VR公司。他仍在奋斗，但他的生活不如其他一些公司那么好，因为为虚拟现实筹集资金非常困难。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All of the things virtual reality. How many of you are talking about virtual reality today? Back in 2016, I have one of my best friends in the Silicon Valley decided to go home, go back to China and build his own VR company. He's still fighting, but his life is not as great as some of the other companies because it's very hard to raise money for the sake of virtual reality.</p>
</details>

自动驾驶也类似。我仍在从事自动驾驶领域。我真羡慕七年前的自己，那时很容易就能成为**独角兽公司**（Unicorn: 估值超过10亿美元的未上市公司），很容易就能上市。但你知道，今天这样的机会已经不复存在了。**基因组学**（Genomics: 研究生物体全部基因的科学）、机器人技术、**量子计算**（Quantum Computing: 基于量子力学原理进行计算的新型技术），甚至如果我们从一个非常普遍的意义上讲，**人工智能**（Artificial Intelligence: 模拟人类智能的科学与工程）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Similar things with autonomous driving. I'm still working on autonomous driving. I'm so jealous of myself, you know, uh seven years ago, it very easily become an unicorn and easily go to public. But uh you know the the chance is no longer there today. Genomics, robotics, quantum computing, even if we take a general a very generic sense artificial intelligence.</p>
</details>

**人工智能**已经经历过多次热潮。早在1960年代的达特茅斯会议，人们就谈论计算机视觉可以在一个夏令营中解决。那并没有发生。几十年的起起伏伏，**杰夫·辛顿**（Jeff Hinton: 深度学习领域的先驱，被称为“AI教父”）曾是名人，曾是异端研究科学家，然后又再次成为名人，这是他第三次成为名人。但他有这种坚持，只有这种坚持才能诞生伟大的技术。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Artificial intelligence has been through multiple hypes. Back in 1960s, Dartmouth, right? People are talking about computer vision to be solved in one summer camp. That's not happening. and decades of up and downs and hint Jeff Hinton used to be the celebrity and used to be the hetradox research scientist and then becomes a celebrity again and this is the third time he becomes a celebrity but he has this insistence only with those type of insistence great technology will be born.</p>
</details>

热潮过后会发生什么？我称之为“热潮后的世界”。我已经在“热潮后的世界”生活了大约两年，尽管我仍在奋斗，但我仍然感到痛苦。首先，在“热潮后的世界”里，没有人会轻易相信承诺。你可以承诺说，你知道机器人可以做所有事情，它们的泛化能力足够强大，或者你可以说**智能体AI**（Agentic AI: 能够自主规划和执行任务的人工智能）可以解决所有问题。所有这些都是承诺，因为你还没有提供硬证据。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and what happened after the hype I call them after hype so I've been living in the after hype world for about two years even though I'm still fighting I still feel the pain. First of all, in the afterhive world, no one takes a pain. You can make a promise saying that you know the robotics can do everything. Their generalization power is great enough or you can say agentic AI can actually solve all of the problem for you. All of these things are promised because you have not yet provide hard evidence in doing that.</p>
</details>

顺便说一句，我刚了解到，对于**智能体AI**，一个有趣的衡量标准是，智能体可以运行多少小时而不失败。事实上，这个指标有一个注意事项：如果你有50%的成功率，我们就算作运行时间。拜托，50%根本不是一个产品！但人们愿意押注，因为人们总是可以自我催眠，说“是的，今天技术还不完美，但有50%了。也许明年能到70%，两年后90%。”谁知道呢，对吧？人们对技术抱有这种乐观情绪，但在“热潮后的世界”里，这种事情从未发生过。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">By the way, I just learned that for agentic AI uh one of the metric interestingly is how many hours can you run the agent without falling without failing and in fact the the metric has a caveat. If you have 50% of the success success rate I we count it in as a as a counting in as a duration of of the running like 50% come on that's not a product at all but people are willing to bet in because people can always messize themselves and saying yeah today the technology is not perfect but it's 50%. Maybe next year it gets to 70% and two years later 90%. Who knows, right? People have this kind of optimism about technology, but that thing never happened in the after world.</p>
</details>

“热潮后的世界”是这样的：我一直在和人们说，“嘿，我们正在建造**L4级无人驾驶卡车**（Level Four Driver Out Truck: 达到特定运行条件下完全自动驾驶的卡车），没有司机。我以前做过，所以相信我，我们能做到。”他们会说，“不，等你做完了我们再谈。”当然，我们会完成它，但会有更多的挑战和问题。这是第一点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">After world is like I've been talking to people, hey, we be building the autonomous driving trucks driving without a driver. I've done it before, so trust me, we can do it. Nah, we wanted to talk to you after you finish it. Of course, we'll finish it and there will be more challenges and questions. That's one.</p>
</details>

第二点是，在“热潮后的世界”里，没有人关心相对进步。我总是开玩笑说，我向其他人展示我们已经交付了**L4级无人驾驶卡车**，只花费了4100万美元。这对我来说都是一个惊人的数字，我为团队感到非常自豪。但投资者会说，“嗯，你知道，我见过更资本效率高的公司。”这对我来说是一种侮辱，就好像我告诉人们我跑了100米短跑，用了9.80秒，然后有人说，“哦，让我想起了世界纪录。”所以，我感觉没有人真正关心相对进步。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The second is that in afterhive world, no one cares about the relative progress. I'm always joking that I've been presenting to other people that we have delivered the the driver out level four driver out truck without a human uh with only 41 millions of spending. That's a a wild number even to myself. I feel very proud of the team. But investors like well you know the I've seen more capital efficient companies out there. This is like a very I would say humiliating to me as if I were telling people I've run a 100 meter sprint with nine second and eight 9.80 seconds and some people say oh reminds me about the world record. So this is where I felt that no one really cares about the relative progress</p>
</details>

最糟糕的是，作为创始人，我们都没有为此做好准备。我想在这里做个统计。有多少人从事初创公司工作超过五年了？请举手。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and uh the worst is that for us the founders we're not prepared for all of it. I wanted to do a tally here. How many of you been working in uh startup world for more than five years? Raise your hand please.</p>
</details>

我没看到多少人。你知道，对我来说，我从事这个行业大约十年了，比十年多一点。我的第一家初创公司是在深度学习诞生之时，我当然是热潮的受益者。我的第二家初创公司是自动驾驶领域。我大概在热潮中生活了六年，我享受了热潮。然后第三家初创公司，两年多一点，我生活在“热潮后的世界”里。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I don't see many. And uh you know to me I've been working in this world for about 10 years a little bit more than 10 years but uh I have uh did my account my first startup was the at the born of deep learning where I certainly I'm the beneficiary of the hype and my second startup was in autonomous driving. I lived uh probably six years in the hype which I enjoyed the hype and uh then the third startup a little bit more than two years I live in the after hype world.</p>
</details>

所以，我要么生活在热潮中，要么生活在“热潮后的世界”里。我认为这对于硅谷这片充满希望的土地上的每个人来说，也是一个非常普遍的症状。我们总是生活在热潮或“热潮后的世界”中，我们，包括我自己，都忽略了更大的世界——正常的商业世界。事实上，答案就在这种传统的投资活动中，正常的商业世界才是穿越热潮周期的答案。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I have either lived in the hype world or the hopter hype world. And I think this is also a very common symptom for everyone here in the in the promised land of the Silicon Valley where we always live in this hype or after hype world and we including myself has ignored a bigger world normal business world and in fact the answer is in this traditional investment activity the normal business world is the answer to go through the hype cycles.</p>
</details>

### 穿越周期的生存公式：像经营连锁餐厅一样

我相信这一点。我正在和我的团队讨论：如果人们不再相信自动驾驶了怎么办？如果人们觉得热潮过后会有反弹怎么办？我们仍然可以赚钱。如果我们以非常谦逊的方式思考自己，认为我们正在经营一家连锁餐厅，我们仍然可以找到投资。当然，90%的经济活动都发生在正常的商业世界中，而不是热潮，也不是“热潮后的世界”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This is what I believe. I'm talking to my team. What if people don't believe in autonomic driving anymore? What pe what if people feel that there's after hype repercussion? We can still make money. We can still find investment if we thinking about ourselves in a very humble way thinking that we're running a chain restaurant business. Of course, 90% of the uh all the economics are happening in just like a normal world, not hype, not after hype. Okay?</p>
</details>

没有秘密配方。我们不是肯德基，我们只是一家典型的餐厅，没有人需要对我们抱有信念。我们的食物并不出众，没有估值膨胀，当然，社交媒体的关注也有限。但即便如此，我们能在这里赚钱吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No secret recipe. We were not KFC. We're just like a typical typical restaurant and no one need to need to take a leap of faith with us. Like our food is not superior and there's no valuation inflation and of course limited social media attention. But even with all of that, can we make money here?</p>
</details>

这是一个公式。如果你想拍照，请拍下这张。这可能是最重要的东西——你在“热潮后的世界”的生存公式：**餐厅价值 = 食物价值 - 运营成本 - 广告成本**。如果你能解决这个价值问题，你就可以说：“好的，我的餐厅赚钱了。现在我需要更多的钱来建造更多的餐厅，形成一个连锁。”这对于普通投资者来说非常有说服力。我们不需要寻找那些共识投资者。我们不需要共识或风险投资。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This is a formula. If you want to take photos, please take this one. This is probably the most important thing. Your your survival formula for the after hyper world. Restaurant value equals food value minus operating cost. and minus advertising cost. If you can solve that value, you can say, "Okay, my restaurant makes money. Now I need more money to build more restaurants to make a chain." That is very convincing to normal investors. We don't need to find those consensus investors. We don't need consensus or or uh venture cons venture capital.</p>
</details>

但让我们把这个餐厅公式转化为自动驾驶产品的价值。人们谈论自动驾驶，哦，太棒了，移除了司机，对吧？但人们忘记了运营成本和客户获取成本。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But let's transform that restaurant formula for autonomy product value. People are talking about autonomous driving. Oh, beautiful. Remove the driver, right? But people are forgot about operating cost and customer acquisition cost.</p>
</details>

特别是当你销售技术时。今天我们很多人都在简化我们的技术增长、公司增长或企业增长路线图，认为“好吧，让我们考虑把技术卖给数百万客户”，假设明天我们就有客户，但他们并没有真正考虑如何实现。但我越来越觉得，许多这些**硬科技**需要**企业**的创始人，而不是**初创公司**的创始人，他们计划明年将公司出售给大公司。**企业**的创始人需要真正专注于赚钱，就像我们正在建造连锁餐厅一样，尤其是在自动驾驶的运营成本方面。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Especially especially if you are selling the technology. A lot of us today we're simplifying our uh road map of of technology growth or company growth or enterprise growth by thinking about okay let's about thinking about selling technology to millions of the customers assuming that we have the customer is tomorrow and they don't really think about getting into there but I feel more and more true that many of these hard technologies requires the founder of enterprise not a startup they're planning to sell to big companies next year a founder of a enterprise price to really focusing on making money as if we're building the chain restaurant, especially on the operating cost for autonomous driving.</p>
</details>

即使是清洁传感器也不是一项微不足道的工作。但很多人都忽略了这一点。给你一个数据点。在我上一家公司，我们每英里花费20美元来运营我们的车队，而我们每英里只赚2美元。是的，技术很酷，但人们只会在热潮中为酷买单。我们必须回归正常的商业模式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Even cleaning the sensors is not is not a trivial job. But many people have overlooked that. Give you one data point. Uh in my last company, we spend $20 per mile in operating our fleet and we're making $2 per mile. Yes, the technology is cool, but people will only pay for coolness in the hype. we got to go back to the normal business.</p>
</details>

我不知道今天**Waymo**（Alphabet旗下的自动驾驶技术公司）的成本是多少，但我理解是，运营的总成本加起来仍然不赚钱。我很高兴我的新公司**Auto**（演讲者创办的公司），通过在运营成本中移除司机，已经开始赚取微薄的利润。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I'm not sure if today I I don't I don't wanted to speculate about Whimo's cost, but my understanding is is that the total cost combined of the operation is still not making money. And I'm I'm glad my new company bought auto, we are already making a tiny bit of money by removing the driver here in the operating cost.</p>
</details>

最后一件事是客户获取成本。这对于机器人技术尤其如此。比如，我真的不觉得我的父母会允许机器人被引入他们的家，和机器人一起生活。不可能。他们没有准备好。那么，如果我们要向其他人销售机器人，我们如何获得客户呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the last thing is customer acquisition cost. This is especially true for robotics. Like I don't really feel that my parents would allow a robots to be invited to be introduced to to their home and they're living with a robot. No way. They're not prepared. So how can we get customers if we're selling a robots to others?</p>
</details>

同样，我们如何将自动驾驶技术销售给卡车制造商、汽车制造商或车队？我们必须成为运营卡车的车主。这就像一家连锁餐厅。我们在这里提供食物，而不是提供食谱。我们不是在这里提供半成品食物，对吧？这就像中国现在的一个问题，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Similarly, how can we sell the autonomous driving technology to a car manu truck manufacturer, car manufacturer or a fleet of trucks? We have to be the owner who operate the trucks. Just again this is like a chain restaurant. We are here providing the food. We're not here providing the recipe. We're not here providing the the the the halfy baked food, right? That's a like a halfy processed food. That's a that's an issue in China right now, right?</p>
</details>

但想想看，如果你是一家餐厅，你真正相信你是一家连锁餐厅，你就必须为客户提供食物，因为这是你赚钱最简单的方式。你可以解决客户获取成本，并解决运营成本。好的，我将留下几分钟进行快速问答。对于那些想建造**硬科技**的人，祝你们长寿繁荣。
