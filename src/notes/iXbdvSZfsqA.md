### 驾驭梦想：保时捷与大众集团CEO奥利弗·布鲁姆访谈

大家好，今天我们将与保时捷和大众汽车的首席执行官奥利弗·布鲁姆（Oliver Blume）一起进行一次激动人心的旅程。保时捷是全球最知名的品牌之一，挪威银行投资管理公司拥有保时捷和大众汽车超过1%的股份。2022年保时捷上市（**IPO**：Initial Public Offering，首次公开募股）时，我们是其基石投资者，所以我们可说是在这场竞赛中并肩前行。

<p class="english-text">Hi everybody, today we're going for an exciting drive with the CEO of Porsche and Volkswagen, Oliver Blume. Porsche is one of the most recognized brands on the planet, and we own more than 1% of Porsche and Volkswagen. When Porsche got listed in 2022, we were a cornerstone investor, so we are kind of in the race together here.</p>
</details>

布鲁姆表示，很高兴能与尼古拉（Nikolai）一起参与播客系列节目。当被问及是否是汽车发烧友时，布鲁姆确认道：“是的，我投身汽车行业已有30年，我对汽车充满热情，热爱驾驶。”
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Blume said it's a great pleasure to be together with Nikolai and joining his podcast series. When asked if he was a petrol head, Blume confirmed, "I am. I'm working in the automotive industry since 30 years. I'm passionate for cars and I love it to drive."</p>
</details>

他分享说，自己的第一辆保时捷是在大约12年前加入保时捷时购买的，那是一辆911。尼古拉指出，保时捷在证券交易所的股票代码是P911，发行了9亿1100万股，并询问这个数字有何魔力。布鲁姆解释道，911是保时捷的标志性车型，是公司于1963年推出的第一款车型。自那时起，保时捷在赛车运动中取得了无数成功和胜利，而911正是保时捷品牌精神的体现：它拥有独特的设计、卓越的汽车性能以及保时捷所代表的伟大生活方式。客户们都非常喜爱它。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">He shared that he bought his first Porsche when he started at Porsche almost 12 years ago, and it was the 911. Nikolai pointed out that the ticket code on the stock exchange is P911, and they have 911 million shares in issue, asking what the magic is with this number. Blume explained that the 911 is their icon, their first edition, launched in 1963. Since then, they have had numerous successes and victories in motorsport, and the 911 expresses what Porsche stands for: it's a unique design, a great performance of the car, and it's the great lifestyle of Porsche. Their customers love it.</p>
</details>

### 保时捷的驾驶体验与品牌精髓

尼古拉问布鲁姆，作为一位真正的专业汽车发烧友，当他打开车门坐下并发动引擎时，如何判断这是一辆好车？在驾驶过程中，例如挂二挡、三挡、四挡时，他如何知道自己会爱上这辆车？他寻找的是什么？布鲁姆回答说，首先，保时捷的钥匙在左侧，这让他有回家的感觉。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Nikolai asked Blume, as a real professional petrol head, when he basically opens the door of a car, sits down, and starts the engine, how he knows it's a good car. When driving, for example, in second, third, fourth gear, how does he know that he loves this car, and what is he looking for? Blume replied that first of all, they have the key on the left-hand side at Porsche, and then he knows that he's at home.</p>
</details>

对他而言，感受一辆车就是感受它的驾驶性能。这意味着什么？它是如何转向的？如果它像卡丁车一样操控，转向直接，那么它的操控性、过弯方式、底盘反应以及座椅位置等所有这些因素，都对汽车的驾驶性能至关重要。最终，保时捷的目标是打造一辆真正的跑车。对保时捷而言，重要的是兼具运动性、高性能，同时又能作为日常驾驶车辆的能力。将所有这些驾驶性能因素结合起来，就构成了保时捷与其他汽车的区别。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">For him, feeling the car is about its drivability. What does that mean? How do you steer the car? If it handles like a go-kart, with direct steering, then the handling, how you're taking the curves, how the chassis is reacting, how your seating position is—all these factors are important for the drivability of a car. And at the end, at Porsche, to have a real sports car. For Porsche, it is important to have on the one hand side the sportiness, the performance, and on the other side, the abilities as a daily driver. So you add all these together, this kind of drivability, what how does Porsche differ from other cars.</p>
</details>

布鲁姆解释说，对保时捷而言，不仅仅是加速性能。他们将许多源自赛车运动的创新技术融入汽车，因为他们认为赛道是检验创新的最严苛试验场。例如，保时捷的**PDK**（Porsche Doppelkupplung: 保时捷双离合变速器）、制动系统和混合动力系统等许多创新都来自赛车运动。这对于与竞争对手区分开来至关重要。这不仅仅关乎加速，更关乎驾驶能力。他们最严苛的衡量标准是赛道上的单圈时间，例如德国著名的**纽博格林北环赛道**（Nürburgring Nordschleife）或**拉古纳塞卡赛道**（Laguna Seca）。在那里，他们知道每一秒都至关重要，以打造完美的跑车。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Blume explained that for Porsche, it's not only the acceleration. For them, it's about putting a lot of innovations into the car, coming from motorsports, because they think that the racetrack is the hardest testing field for their innovations. For example, their PDK, the braking systems, and the hybrid systems, and a lot of innovations coming from motorsport. That is important to differentiate from the competition. It's not about acceleration, it's about the driving abilities, and their hardest measure is the time they are achieving on a racetrack, for example, the Nürburgring Nordschleife, the famous one in Germany, or Laguna Seca. And there they know every second is important to build the perfect sports car.</p>
</details>

谈及保时捷品牌意味着什么，布鲁姆表示，品牌非常重要。保时捷在七十多年的发展中成功打造了一个标志性品牌。这是他们品牌的传承，代表着品牌所秉持的理念，例如实用性与设计之间的平衡。保时捷文化也扮演着重要角色，最终，标志性产品如第一款车型356、随后的911以及其他车型如718、Cayenne、Panamera和**Macan**（Macan：保时捷中型SUV车型）都发挥了重要作用。这种结合正是客户喜爱保时捷的原因，因为他们是为那些追逐梦想的人而生的品牌。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Regarding what is implied in the Porsche brand, Blume said the brand is very important. As Porsche, they were able to develop an iconic brand over seven decades, and it's a heritage of their brand, for what their brand stands for: the contradictions between usability and design, for example, play a big role. Then the Porsche culture plays a big role, and at the end, the iconic product, with the 356, their first model, then the 911, and all the other models over the 718, Cayenne, Panamera, then Macan, play an important role. And this combination is what their customers love, because they are the brand for those who follow their dreams.</p>
</details>

### 目标客户与市场定位

布鲁姆指出，保时捷并没有一个特定的目标客户群体，对他们而言，重要的是实现梦想。这些梦想是什么？就是实现人生的梦想。他们有那些代表成功的人，最终为了实现自己的梦想。因此，他们的客户是那些热爱驾驶运动型汽车、热爱品牌，并追求高度个性化和专属感的人。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Blume stated that they haven't got a special target customer; it's important for them to fulfill dreams. And what kind of dreams? That's to have a fulfilled life dream. They have people who stand for success and at the end to fulfill their own dream. And so, their customers are people who love to drive sporty cars, who love brands, and at the end, to have a high level of individualization and exclusivity.</p>
</details>

全球客户画像大致如此，但在亚洲，客户群体的多样性有所不同。在亚洲，男女客户比例各占50%，而在西方世界则更接近80%男性、20%女性。当被问及为何亚洲女性驾驶员的渗透率更高时，布鲁姆解释说，这是因为亚洲女性喜爱保时捷的奢华定位。亚洲有许多非常成功的年轻女性企业家，她们努力工作，追求成功，并乐于在保时捷这样的奢侈品上消费，她们热爱保时捷标志性品牌的传承和现代技术。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So their customer profile around the world is like this, but for example, the share of diversity is different. In Asia, they have a share of 50% male and female, in the Western world it's more 80/20. When asked why they have a higher penetration in Asia in terms of female drivers, Blume explained that it's because they love the luxury positioning of Porsche. They have a lot of very successful young ladies in Asia, entrepreneurs, and that describes the customer profile perfectly: that they are hardworking and they are aiming for success, and then at the end, they are spending in luxury goods like Porsche, loving the heritage of their iconic brand and on the other side, the modern technology.</p>
</details>

### 平衡独特性与规模效应

尼古拉提到，保时捷通过Macan等车型拓展了产品线，并强调了独特性，但同时生产了大量汽车。他询问保时捷如何平衡独特性与销量。布鲁姆回应说，保时捷在汽车行业中拥有独特的定位。一方面，他们是奢侈品牌，平均销售价格超过10万欧元；另一方面，他们也具备规模效应的优势。去年，他们售出了超过30万辆汽车，并受益于品牌内部的规模效应。此外，他们还有机会受益于大众集团的规模效应，在模块、零部件、采购量等方面进行合作。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Nikolai mentioned that Porsche has branched out with the likes of Macan and emphasized exclusivity, but they do produce a lot of cars. He asked how they balance exclusivity with the amount of cars they sell. Blume responded that Porsche is positioned uniquely in the automotive industry. On the one hand, they are a luxury player, achieving an average sales price over €100,000. On the other side, they have the opportunities of scale. They sold over 300,000 units last year, and they are benefiting from the scale effects in between their brand. But they also have the opportunity to benefit from the scale effects in Volkswagen Group, where they are collaborating in terms of modules, parts, purchasing volume, and so on.</p>
</details>

对他们而言，重要的是能够提供独特性，无论客户有什么需求，他们都能够将其融入汽车中。因此，可以说，每一辆离开生产线的保时捷汽车都是独一无二的。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What is important for them is being able on the other side to offer exclusivity. Whatever their customer asks, they are able to implement into their car. So they can say that no Porsche you can compare with the other who is leaving their production line.</p>
</details>

### 大众集团的广阔版图

尼古拉表示，今天的访谈主要关注保时捷，但布鲁姆同时也是大众汽车的首席执行官。他请布鲁姆介绍一下大众集团除了保时捷和大众品牌之外，还包括哪些品牌。布鲁姆解释说，大众集团规模庞大，拥有超过68万名员工，而保时捷公司约有4万名员工。大众集团旗下的每个品牌都各具特色。对他们而言，重要的是，作为一个非常国际化的集团，他们能够保留每个品牌的文化。例如，兰博基尼（Lamborghini）和宾利（Bentley）分别代表意大利和英国文化。此外，他们还有德国的奥迪（Audi）和大众（Volkswagen），以及捷克共和国的斯柯达（Skoda）。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Nikolai stated that they would focus mainly on Porsche today, but Blume is also the CEO of Volkswagen, and asked him to remind them what else is in the Volkswagen Group in addition to Porsche and Volkswagen. Blume explained that Volkswagen Group is much bigger, with over 680,000 people working there, and Porsche is a company with 40,000 people. Each of the brands in Volkswagen Group are different, and for them it's important, as a very international group, that they have the culture of each brand where they are positioned, like Lamborghini or Bentley, with Italian culture and English culture for Bentley, for example. Then they have Audi and Volkswagen in Germany, Skoda in Czech Republic.</p>
</details>

大众集团最大的挑战在于其必须处理的复杂性。但令人欣慰的是，他们能够管理大众集团中所有这些出色的品牌。布鲁姆认为，每个品牌都有其积极之处，可以从中学习。他回顾自己的职业生涯，曾在奥迪、大众和西雅特（Seat）等品牌工作过，并在每个品牌中都看到了非常积极的实践，这些经验也被他运用到保时捷的工作中。尼古拉表示自己是奥迪的忠实车主，这很符合他的性格。布鲁姆对此表示很高兴。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The big difference is the complexity they have to handle in Volkswagen Group. But the great issue is that they are able to manage all these fantastic brands in Volkswagen Group. Blume thinks that each of these brands has something positive where you can learn. In his history, he was able to work at Audi, at Volkswagen, and at Seat, for example, and in each brand, he's seen very positive practices that he was able to implement also in Porsche. Nikolai said he's a happy driver of an Audi, so that kind of suits his temperament, and Blume was happy to hear it.</p>
</details>

尼古拉指出，如果看整个集团的价值，大众集团的大部分价值都与保时捷品牌紧密相连。他询问布鲁姆认为这说明了集团其他部分什么。布鲁姆回答说，通过保时捷的**IPO**，他们展示了保时捷品牌的价值，并在当时非常困难的环境下，通过一次非常成功的IPO释放了品牌的潜力。积极的发展表明了保时捷的巨大潜力，以及其稳健的财务状况。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Nikolai noted that if you look at the value of the group, most of the value in the Volkswagen Group is kind of tied up in the Porsche brand. He asked Blume what he thought that was telling them about the rest of the group. Blume replied that with the Porsche IPO, they had shown the value of the Porsche brand, and they were able to unleash the potential of their brand with a very, very successful IPO, even with very difficult circumstances at that time. The positive development shows what potential they have in Porsche with their robust financial profile.</p>
</details>

在大众集团内部，布鲁姆认为在资本市场价值方面仍有很大的提升空间。他们已在2023年取得了非常稳健的业绩，并实施了清晰的战略和重组计划。今年，他们将推出30多款新产品。他认为这与信任以及交付业绩密切相关，大众集团的股票仍有巨大的市场潜力。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In Volkswagen Group, Blume thinks there is still a lot to improve in terms of the capital market value. They have shown a very robust result in 2023, implemented a clear strategy, a clear restructuring plan. And this year, they will bring over 30 new products to the market. He thinks it has a lot to do with trust and delivering their results, and then there's a big potential also on the Volkswagen Group stocks.</p>
</details>

### 中国市场：创新与竞争

中国是大众集团的重要市场。布鲁姆表示，在中国，他们看到了创新方面的巨大发展和惊人的速度。因此，对保时捷而言，明确的策略是在中国为中国市场开发更多的技术和创新。例如，他们的保时捷数字服务（Porsche Digital）旨在为中国客户提供中国的生态系统，尤其是在数字化方面。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">A big market for them is China. Blume said that in China, they see a big development in terms of innovations, a fantastic speed. And so for them, it was a clear aim in Porsche to build more technology and innovations in China for China, for example, their Porsche Digital to offer their Chinese customers the Chinese ecosystem, especially in terms of digitalization.</p>
</details>

在中国的豪华车市场，保时捷的定位非常好，平均销售价格为100万元**人民币**（RMB: 人民币，中国法定货币），市场规模达60万辆。到目前为止，这个细分市场只有国际品牌，没有中国品牌。布鲁姆认为，凭借其发动机定位，即内燃机（**IC**：Internal Combustion Engine）、插电式混合动力（**Plug-in Hybrids**）和纯电动汽车（**BEVs**：Battery Electric Vehicles）的组合，他们在中国市场拥有良好的定位。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">They are very well positioned in China in the luxury segment, over 500,000 RMB, with an average sales price of a million RMB. This is a segment of 600,000 units up to now, where there are only international brands in this segment, no Chinese brands. Blume thinks with their engine positioning, the mix of IC, plug-in hybrids, and BEVs, they are well positioned for the market.</p>
</details>

市场需求强劲，但对保时捷而言，更重要的是“价值而非销量”。因此，去年他们特意减少了销量，没有参与中国市场面临的折扣和价格战。这使得他们非常成功地保持了在中国的豪华品牌定位。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There's a strong demand, but what is very important for them is also value over volume. And so, especially last year, they reduced their volume, not joining the discount and pricing war they are faced with in China, and that was very successfully maintaining their luxury positioning there.</p>
</details>

谈到中国的电动汽车市场和竞争，布鲁姆表示，许多新的竞争对手正在进入市场，但他们大多集中在大众市场和高端市场。豪华电动汽车市场尚未完全建立。保时捷的**Taycan**（Taycan：保时捷首款纯电动跑车）在豪华电动汽车市场占据了超过30%的市场份额。现在，他们正带着新款**Macan**和新款**Taycan**进入市场，这对保时捷来说是一个巨大的机遇，尤其是在电动化领域建立豪华细分市场。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Regarding the electric vehicle market in China and competition, Blume said a lot of new competitors are entering the market, but most of them are more in the volume and premium segment. The luxury market for electromobility isn't built yet. They have shown a market share over 30% for the Taycan in the luxury electric segment. Now they are entering with a new Macan and the new Taycan, and that's a big opportunity for Porsche, especially to build this luxury segment on electrification.</p>
</details>

重要的是要带来重大的创新。他们现在正在市场上推出新产品，并拥有巨大的机会来开拓市场。当驾驶中国竞争对手的汽车时，布鲁姆认为它们在数字化方面表现出色，在语音识别方面也非常优秀，其中一些还拥有非常先进的自动驾驶能力。因此，他认为中国在过去十年中已经学会了如何制造汽车，并且发展非常迅速。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Important is that you're coming with big innovations. They are offering now their new product there in the market and having great opportunities to build the market. When driving the Chinese competing cars, Blume thinks they are very good in terms of digitalization, they are very good in terms of voice recognition, some of them have very good advanced autonomous driving abilities. And so, he thinks the Chinese have learned during the last decade to build cars, they are advancing very fast.</p>
</details>

布鲁姆表示，他们不必惧怕中国的竞争，但值得关注中国的汽车制造商。他从自己的职业生涯中体会到，无论身处何地，总能学到一些东西，让自己变得更好。因此，他们不惧怕竞争，因为他们来自赛道，竞争使人进步，并最终推动创新，而创新对客户来说是积极的。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Blume stated that they don't have to hide from the competition in China, but it's worth having a look at Chinese car makers. His experience in his work life is that wherever you are, you can learn something and make yourself better. And so, they don't fear competition; they are from the racetrack, and competition makes you better, and at the end, competition drives innovations, and innovations are positive for the customer.</p>
</details>

### 电动化与E-燃料战略

尼古拉提到了数字化，并询问信息娱乐系统在当今汽车中的重要性。布鲁姆认为它越来越重要。客户期望他们的数字生态系统，就像他们在手机上使用的那样，也能在汽车中实现。因此，在保时捷，他们决定设立一个新的董事会职位，由**萨贾德·汗**（Sajjad Khan）负责所有汽车IT事务，信息娱乐系统是他们为客户提供的其中一项重要服务。正如他之前提到的，他们还在世界各地开发解决方案，例如在中国为中国市场开发，在美国也通过合作伙伴关系和活动为客户提供完美的信息娱乐系统。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Nikolai mentioned digitalization, so the whole infotainment system, and asked how important that is in today's car. Blume said it's more and more important. The customers are expecting their digital ecosystem, they used from their mobile phones, for example, in their cars. And therefore, in Porsche, they decided an own new board resort driven by Sajjad Khan, carrying about all the car IT issues, and infotainment is one important offer they had for their customers. And there, as he mentioned before, also developing solutions in the regions of the world, in this case in China for China, but also in the US, they have partnerships and activities to provide to their customers the perfect infotainment system.</p>
</details>

谈到电池技术，布鲁姆认为电池技术在过去几年取得了巨大进步，尤其是在化学方面，这带来了更大的续航里程。对他们而言，快速充电扮演着重要角色。保时捷是第一家推出**800伏系统**（800 volt system：一种高压充电技术，可实现更快的充电速度）的跑车制造商，这使得充电时间从10%到80%仅需20分钟。他们正致力于将未来车型的充电时间进一步缩短至约15分钟。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Regarding batteries, Blume said battery technology has seen a big advancement during the last years, especially in terms of chemistry, which led to bigger ranges. Then for them, fast charging plays a big role. Porsche was the first series manufacturer with an 800-volt system, which brought them to a charging time of 20 minutes from 10% to 80% charging level. And they are aiming for an even more improved charging time of around 15 minutes for the upcoming cars.</p>
</details>

因此，他们在电动化方面看到了巨大潜力，并设定了雄心勃勃的目标，即到2030年实现80%的汽车完全电动化。他们认为电动出行优于燃油车，因为电动汽车在过去几年发展强劲，并且仍有尚未释放的潜力。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so, they see a lot of potential in the electrification, and therefore they have a very ambitious target to achieve by 2030, 80% of their cars fully electric, because they think that electromobility is superior than the combustion engine cars because of the strong development during the last years and the still unleashed potential of electric cars.</p>
</details>

与此同时，保时捷也投资了**E-燃料**（E-fuels：合成燃料，通过可再生能源生产，可用于传统内燃机）。布鲁姆解释说，他们从全球角度考虑脱碳问题，并承担起责任。他们认为合成燃料对于全球的燃油车、船舶和飞机都扮演着重要角色，尤其是在可再生能源无限的地区生产时。虽然E-燃料所需的能源比混合动力或纯电动汽车更高，但如果能在这些地区生产，能源需求就不再是问题。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">At the same time, they invest in E-fuels. Blume explained that they think about decarbonization from a global approach and take over responsibility. They think also for all the combustion engine cars around the world, but also ships and aircraft, synthetic fuels play an important role when you're able to produce them in regions of the world where renewable energies are unlimited. The need of energy is higher comparing to hybrids or to full electric cars, but when you produce them there, there isn't the argument anymore about the need of energy.</p>
</details>

E-燃料是氢气和通过空气捕获的二氧化碳的结合。E-燃料的一大优势是运输非常简便，无需像氢气那样进行冷却或加压。它可以利用现有的加油站网络，与传统燃料混合使用，并可用于现有的内燃机。因此，它是脱碳的额外论据，尤其是在转型期。考虑到欧洲的法规，例如到2035年可能不再允许销售新的燃油车，但路上仍会有现有的燃油车，因此他们需要一个解决方案。所以，除了强大的电动化战略，他们也投资E-燃料。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's a combination of hydrogen and CO2 coming by air capturing from the air. And the big advantage of so-called E-fuels is that the transport is very, very easy without cooling or putting them under pressure like you have to do it with hydrogen. You can use the net of the existing filling stations, you can mix them with traditional fuels, and you can use existing combustion engines. And so, it's an additional argument for decarbonization, especially in the transformation. And thinking about the regulation in Europe, maybe 2035 when they won't release any more combustion engine cars, you will have the existing cars still on the road, and therefore they need a solution. And therefore, in addition to a strong electrification strategy, they are investing also in E-fuels.</p>
</details>

### 产品发布计划与赛车运动的传承

尼古拉问及布鲁姆上次见面时对明年发布计划的兴奋之情，并询问他们将推出哪些产品。布鲁姆表示，这将是保时捷历史上最大的发布计划。他们现在已全面推出新款**Cayenne**（Cayenne：保时捷SUV车型），新款**Panamera**（Panamera：保时捷豪华轿跑）也已市场首发。今年1月，新款**Macan**在新加坡发布，四周前他们推出了新款**Taycan**，特别是**Taycan GT**。这对于保时捷来说是四个全新的车型系列。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Nikolai asked Blume about his excitement for the launch program for next year, and what they are launching. Blume said that's the biggest launching program in the history of Porsche. They are now fully in the market with the new Cayenne, they have had already the market premier for the new Panamera. Then the new Macan in January in Singapore, and four weeks ago they were able to launch the new Taycan, and there especially the Taycan GT, for completely new model lines for Porsche.</p>
</details>

今年年底，他们还将推出新款911，这将是历史上首次搭载混合动力系统。因此，他们正在更新保时捷的五个现有车型系列。这对他们的团队来说是一个巨大的抱负，也是今年必须应对的巨大挑战，但对客户而言则是一个巨大的机遇。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And at the end of the year, they're expecting a new 911 in the first time of the history with hybrids. And so, they are renewing five model lines of Porsche of their existing range, and that is a great ambition for their team, a great challenge they have to handle this year, but a great opportunity for their customers.</p>
</details>

当被问及他会驾驶哪款车时，布鲁姆说他有幸能测试所有车型。他热爱911，拥有多辆911，尤其是新款911，他测试了搭载混合动力发动机的车型，其巨大的加速性能和后置的六缸水平对置发动机令人惊叹。今天他驾驶的是新款Taycan，在**WLTP**（Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure: 全球统一轻型车辆测试程序）工况下续航里程接近700公里，充电时间极快，加速性能惊人。Taycan GT在赛道上的表现也非常出色，在纽博格林北环赛道或拉古纳塞卡赛道都创造了记录。这两款车都非常出色。下半年还将推出Macan，这将使Macan达到一个全新的水平，成为一款纯电动Macan，提供信息娱乐、充电导航或增强现实抬头显示等众多功能，让他们在顶级联赛中占据一席之地。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">When asked which of these he was going to drive, Blume said he's in a good position to test all of them. He loves the 911, and he owns 911s, especially the new 911, and he tested them with a hybrid engine, and the tremendous acceleration and still having the six-cylinder boxer in the rear is fantastic. And today he's driving a Taycan, the new one, with more range; in WLTP, they are close to 700 km of range, fantastic charging times, tremendous acceleration. And what you have seen with the Taycan GT is also on the racetrack a very, very cool car with records on Nürburgring Nordschleife or Laguna Seca. And so, both of these cars are fantastic. And then in the second half of the year will come the Macan, and that will bring the Macan to a completely new level, a full electric Macan with the offers of infotainment, charge navigation, or augmented head-up display with a lot of features where they will play in the Premier League.</p>

谈到赛车运动，布鲁姆强调赛车运动是保时捷的核心。他们已在勒芒（Le Mans）赢得了19次胜利，今年还赢得了戴通纳24小时耐力赛（24 Hours of Daytona），这是美国的一项传统赛事。对他们而言，赛车运动是检验创新的最严苛试验场。例如，新款911的混合动力系统就源自赛车运动，来自918车型。此外，他们用于新电池系统的油冷技术，也是首先为赛车运动开发的。800伏系统也源自赛车运动。这只是他们正在做的三个例子，他们将继续这样做，因为他们认为赛车运动是保时捷的核心，最好的创新都来自赛车运动。

<p class="english-text">Talking about the Premier League and coming back to motorsport, Blume said motorsport is the core of Porsche. They are counting 19 victories in Le Mans, for example. This year they were able to win the 24 Hours of Daytona, the heritage race in the US. And for them, motorsport is the toughest testing field for their innovations. And for example, the new hybrid for the 911 is a motorsport hybrid, which came from the 918. But also the oil cooling they are using for their new battery systems, they developed first for motorsport. The 800-volt system is coming from motorsport. These are only three examples of what they are doing there. They will continue to do so because they think motorsport is the core of Porsche, and from motorsport are coming the best innovations.</p>

### 德国商业环境与工业政策

话题转向企业文化，尼古拉询问在德国做生意是怎样的感受。布鲁姆表示，德国正处于一个回顾数十年成功和社区福祉的时期，但这并非未来必然。就像体育比赛一样，赢得奖杯并不意味着明年还能再次夺冠。因此，德国目前的状况是，必须时刻为国家的成功而奋斗。他们面临一些不利于商业发展的环境因素，例如工业法规和能源价格。

<p class="english-text">Changing the topic a bit and moving on to corporate culture, Nikolai asked generally speaking how it is to do business in Germany. Blume replied that in Germany, they are in a situation where they are looking back to decades of success or welfare in the community, and that's not given for the future. It's like in sports: when you win a cup, you haven't got the guarantee that you will win it the next year. And so, that is the situation in Germany, always thinking about to fight for the success in the country. And so, they have some circumstances which are not so easy to drive the business in terms of industrial regulations, energy pricing.</p>
</details>

但他们为自己是一家在斯图加特（Stuttgart）成立的德国公司感到自豪，并且大部分汽车都在德国生产。他们认为德国的质量仍然是一个重要的品牌标志，尤其是在汽车领域。因此，他们与德国政府保持密切联系，以改进工业法规。他们认为德国拥有非常合格的人才和完美的工程能力。因此，只要他们能够专注于过去所展现的优势，德国就拥有巨大的未来。
<details>

<p class="english-text">But they are proud of being a German company founded in Stuttgart, and they produce the majority of their cars in Germany, because they think that German quality is still an important brandmark, especially in terms of cars. And so, they are in close contact also to the German government to improve the industrial regulations. And then they think they have very qualified people in Germany, they have perfect engineering capacities. And so, Germany especially has got a big future when they are prepared and able to focus on their strengths they were able to show in the past.</p>
</details>

如果可以改变德国工业政策的三件事，布鲁姆会选择：首先，他们的行业是由速度驱动的，但德国和欧洲都有很多法规。他希望减少法规，实现政治与行业之间更快的决策。其次，他们可以改变的是对行业的支持，尤其是在投资方面，包括决策过程和补贴，特别是在发展新技术时。这对于欧洲和德国制定清晰的新技术重点总体规划至关重要。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If he could change three things with the German industrial policy, Blume said first of all, their industry is driven by speed, and they have a lot of regulations not only in Germany but in Europe as well. He would like to reduce regulations and come to faster decision-making between politics and industry. Then what they can change is the support for the industry, especially when investing; there are also decision-making processes, but also subsidies, especially when going into new technologies. And that is important for Europe and for Germany to have a clear master plan on which new technologies they want to focus.</p>
</details>

第三，在电动出行方面，除了行业正在推向市场的新产品外，支持充电基础设施和新的可再生能源也同样重要。他希望加快并改变这三点：速度、技术和充电基础设施。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then in terms of electromobility, he thinks it is important, besides the new products the industry is bringing to the market, also to support in terms of charging infrastructure, in terms of new renewable energies. And these three points he would like to speed up and change: speed, technology, and charging infrastructure.</p>
</details>

尼古拉指出，德国在工会和员工参与董事会层面有着悠久的传统，他询问这种工作方式的优缺点。布鲁姆表示，他们像一个家庭一样共同协作。对他而言，获得来自劳工方面的反馈始终很重要。他们以创业精神共同推动公司发展。这与他谈论政治时所说的相同，即不应增加法规和协议流程，他们需要速度来做决策。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Nikolai noted that Germany has a long tradition of very high union and employee engagement at board levels, and asked what are the pros and cons of working in this way. Blume replied that they are acting as a family, working together, and for him, it's always important to get close feedback also from the labor side. And they are driving the companies together with an entrepreneurial spirit. And there counts the same as they talked about politics: they shouldn't increase their regulations and agreement processes; they need the speed for taking decisions.</p>
</details>

布鲁姆与工会合作的经验非常积极，只要公平透明地处理问题，就能解决所有问题。这是他三十年工作经验的总结，也是他与合作伙伴处理流程的方式。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Blume has very positive experience working together with the worker unions: when you deal fair and deal with full transparency, you can solve every problem. And that's his working experience of three decades, and that's how he's handling the process together with his partners.</p>

### 领导力与企业文化

尼古拉询问布鲁姆如何同时管理保时捷和大众汽车这两家公司，以及他如何分配时间。布鲁姆表示，对他而言，在决定承担大众集团的责任时，同时推动保时捷的发展非常重要。因为对他而言，与技术和流程保持紧密联系，与员工保持密切接触，以便能够在战略集团层面做出正确决策至关重要。这在组织方面无疑是一个挑战，但只要设定正确的优先级，就能奏效。他已经这样做了超过一年半，到目前为止，两者之间没有冲突。他认为同时推动两者是非常有益的。在大众集团，一位首席执行官同时管理一个品牌并非新鲜事，例如费迪南德·皮耶希（Ferdinand Piëch）或马丁·文德恩（Martin Winterkorn）也曾同时管理大众品牌。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Nikolai asked how Blume manages to be CEO of two companies, both Porsche and Volkswagen, and how he splits his time. Blume replied that for him, it was very important when he had taken the decision to also take over the responsibility in Volkswagen Group to drive at the same time Porsche, because for him, it's important to be very closely linked to technology, to processes, to have close contact to the people, being able to take the right decisions on the strategic group level. It is a challenge, very clear, in terms of organization, but when you take the right priorities, it works. And now he's driving this for over one and a half year, and up to now, they haven't got a conflict in between. He thinks it's very supportive driving both at the same time, and it's not new in Volkswagen Group that a CEO driving a brand like Ferdinand Piëch or Martin Winterkorn have driven also the brand of Volkswagen.</p>
</details>

布鲁姆表示，他同时管理保时捷和大众集团，一年半以来的反馈是，这运作得非常完美且具有支持性。当被问及在两个角色之间是否需要改变行为方式时，布鲁姆说，管理这两个“店铺”非常不同。在保时捷，他非常深入地参与运营流程；而大众集团则更具战略性，他领导着12个品牌。技术问题是相似的，但最终他有其他品牌的首席执行官合作伙伴负责。他们更多地做出如何改进品牌间规模效应、如何共同推动绩效计划以及如何做出战略技术决策的决定。在这种情况下，他与汽车业务的紧密联系非常有帮助，能够评估技术并做出这些决策。因此，这两个工作非常不同，一个更侧重运营，另一个更侧重战略。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Blume stated that he's driving Porsche and Volkswagen Group, and his feedback up to now after one and a half years is that it works perfectly and is supportive. When asked if he has to change the way he behaves when going from one to the other, Blume said leading both shops is very, very different. In Porsche, he's very deeply involved in the operative processes, and Volkswagen Group is more strategic; there he's leading 12 brands. The technical issues are similar, but at the end, he has partners, CEOs of all brands, who are responsible for the other brands. And they are taking more decisions on how they can improve their scale effects in between the brands, how they are driving together the performance programs, and taking strategic technology decisions. And there it's very, very helpful that he's very closely linked to the car business and being able to evaluate technologies and taking these decisions. And so, both of these jobs are very different: one is more operative and the other one is more strategic.</p>
</details>

当他如此深入地参与保时捷的技术细节时，尼古拉询问他如何避免微观管理。布鲁姆回答说，这完全取决于优先级。多年来，他一直习惯使用所谓的“十大计划”，即一年中最重要的十个待解决问题。这有助于他专注于正确的事情。他实施了这种系统化方法，无论是十点、五点还是七点都不重要，重要的是拥有正确的优先级。此外，这还融入了一个长期的战略。他制定了十年的战略，因此他有明确的重点来领导公司，同时也有年度运营计划和正确的优先级。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">When he is so involved with technicalities and the technology in Porsche, Nikolai asked how he avoids becoming micromanaging the whole thing. Blume replied that it's all about priorities. He's used since many years to work with a so-called top 10 plan, what are the most important topics to solve in a year, and that helps to focus on the right things. And he implemented this systematic, and that's not important if you're talking about 10 points, five points, seven points, you need the right priorities. And beside of this, this is embedded in a long-lasting strategy. He built his strategy in terms of 10 years, and so he has a clear focus where to lead the company, but also with an operative program year by year with the right priorities.</p>

### 个人工作哲学与生活平衡

尼古拉提到布鲁姆有时会和挪威滑雪运动员**阿克塞尔·隆德·斯温达尔**（Aksel Lund Svindal）一起滑雪，并询问斯温达尔对布鲁姆滑雪技术的评价。斯温达尔说布鲁姆滑得很好，但更无畏，速度很快。尼古拉问这是否也是他管理公司的方式。布鲁姆回答说，他喜欢快速驾驶，阿克塞尔是一位出色的滑雪运动员，也是一个很棒的人，他是保时捷的品牌大使。他喜欢和阿克塞尔一起滑雪，也在赛道上一起赛车，阿克塞尔也是一位出色的赛车手。这让他们产生了共鸣，因为他们都来自体育界。他喜欢像体育团队一样管理公司，一方面专注于性能和速度，另一方面也注重团队精神，共同协作，互相帮助，共同面对输赢，并以相同的思维方式做出正确的决策。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Nikolai mentioned that Blume skis from time to time with Aksel Lund Svindal, his fellow Norwegian, one of the best skiers of all time. He asked Svindal how Blume's skiing was, and Svindal said he is good but almost more fearless than he is good, he goes fast. Nikolai asked if that's the way he runs the company as well. Blume replied that he loves to drive fast, and Aksel is a great skier but also a great person; he is an ambassador of Porsche. He loves to be together with him and going out for skiing and also on the racetrack; he's a great racer. And that combines them, they are coming from sports. And he loves to drive the company like a sports team, on the one hand side focused on performance, on speed, on the other side on team spirit, and working together, helping each other, winning and losing together, and taking the right decisions with the same mindset.</p>
</details>

尼古拉问斯温达尔，布鲁姆滑雪是否比保时捷快，斯温达尔开玩笑说幸好没有。尼古拉问布鲁姆，身居如此重要的职位，如何保持与工厂一线的联系。布鲁姆表示，他的职业生涯大部分时间都在生产部门度过，因此他仍然与生产部门的员工保持着非常紧密的联系。当他在工厂里走动时，仍然有非常密切的接触，那里的员工会告诉他公司里正在发生的最真实的事情。这对他来说非常重要。他认为作为一家公司的首席执行官，对员工来说“触手可及”非常重要，这样才能获得正确的反馈，从而做出正确的决策。在保时捷，他们喜欢与团队紧密合作，并一起举办活动，保持亲近。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Nikolai asked Svindal whether Blume skis faster than a Porsche, and Svindal said thankfully not. Nikolai asked Blume how he remains grounded to the factory floor when he has such important positions. Blume replied that he spent most time in his professional life in production, and so he's still very closely linked to especially people in production. And when he's walking around in the factory, there's still a very close contact, and people there tell him the honest things and the truth in what's going on in a company. And that's very, very important for him. And he thinks as a CEO of a company, it's very important to be touchable for the people, and with this, you're getting the right feedback for taking the right decisions. And so, in Porsche, they like to work very closely with the team and also having events together and there being touchable and being very close to the team.</p>
</details>

布鲁姆拥有机械工程博士学位。尼古拉问他，如果没有这个学位，他是否还能在同事中获得如此高的信誉。布鲁姆认为，最终重要的是你在公司中的投入和影响力。对他而言，在奥迪工作期间同时攻读博士学位是一个很好的机会，他还在20多年前在中国完成了学业。作为一名年轻人去中国，感受当时正在兴起的工程和创新精神，尤其是在电动汽车领域，当时没有人相信电动汽车会成功，那是一次很棒的经历。因此，在上海同济大学汽车学院工作对他来说是一次很棒的经历。但就信誉而言，它有助于理解和深入研究技术，但最终更重要的是你如何行动，如何决策，以及如何与团队合作。
<details>

<p class="english-text">Blume has a PhD in Mechanical Engineering. Nikolai asked if he thought he would have had the credibility with his colleagues if he didn't have that. Blume replied that at the end, it's your input in the company and your impact. For him, it was a good opportunity when he started working at Audi doing a parallel PhD, and also he did it in China over 20 years ago, and it was a great experience as a young man going to China and feeling the engineering and innovation spirit they started in these times with electric vehicles where nobody else thought in the success of electric vehicles. And so for him, it was a great experience working there in the Automotive Institute of University in Shanghai. But in terms of credibility, it helps to understand and to deep dive into technologies, but at the end, it's more important how you act, how you decide, and how you work together with a team.</p>
</details>

布鲁姆每天工作大约12小时，有时在晚上，周末也会有一天。但对他而言，工作与个人生活之间的平衡也很重要。他热爱运动，保持健康和良好的体魄对于管理公司也很重要。除了滑雪，他还喜欢跑步、慢跑，山地自行车是他最喜欢的运动，有时他也会打网球。
<details>

<p class="english-text">Blume works around 12 hours a day, sometimes in the evening, and one day on the weekend. But for him, it's also important to have the right balance between work and personal life. He loves sports, and being fit and having the right physics is important to be able to drive the company. In addition to skiing, he used to play soccer, and now he prefers to run, to jog, and mountain biking is his favorite sport, and sometimes he plays tennis.</p>
</details>

### 给年轻人的建议

尼古拉表示，播客有成千上万的年轻人听众，他请布鲁姆给他们一些建议，不是关于购买保时捷，而是其他方面的建议。布鲁姆说，他作为两个女儿的父亲，她们去年刚开始上大学。他告诉她们要“倾听自己的心声，做自己想做的事情，当你热爱一件事，你就会充满热情，最终会取得好结果。”这贯穿了他整个职业生涯，也是他给年轻人的建议。对他而言，规划职业生涯是不可能的，要始终专注于当下正在做的事情，最终成功会得到回报。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Nikolai said they have tens of thousands of young people on the podcast, so if Blume were to give them advice, not to go and save up to buy a Porsche, but something else, what kind of advice would he give them. Blume replied that he's in the situation as a family father, he has two daughters, and they started last year's studies at university. And he told them, "Listen to your heart, what you want to do, and when you love things, you're passionate for them, and at the end, the right results are coming." And that was also his spirit in his whole career, and that's his advice to young people when they start a career. For him, it's impossible to plan a career, and always focus what you are doing at the moment, and at the end, the success will pay off.</p>
</details>

尼古拉总结道，奥利弗显然听从了自己的心声，而且他怀疑多年来也听从了许多引擎的声音，并感谢他的到来，祝他在快车道上好运。布鲁姆感谢尼古拉的精彩对话以及在保时捷股票上的良好合作。

<p class="english-text">Nikolai concluded that Oliver has certainly listened to his heart and a lot of engines also, he suspects, during the years, but big thanks for being on and good luck in the fast lane. Blume thanked Nikolai very much for the good talk and for the great partnership in the Porsche stocks.</p>
