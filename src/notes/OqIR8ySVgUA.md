### 投资哲学与宏观挑战

主持人: 嗨，马克，很高兴再次见到你。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">hi Mark good to see you again</p>
</details>

Marc Andreessen: 大家好，早上好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">hello good morning how's everybody</p>
</details>

主持人: 我们都很好，谢谢。那么马克，未来我们将在哪里赚钱？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">we are really well thank you now Mark where are we going to make money going forward</p>
</details>

Marc Andreessen: 嗯，在我们的业务中，理论相对简单，那就是我们通过**技术颠覆**（Technological Disruption: 新技术或商业模式彻底改变现有市场）来赚钱。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">well so in our business uh the theory is relatively straightforward uh which is uh we make money on technological disruption um and so we we make money when these new up start uh startups uh form and uh you know either either try to go take down a big incumbent or try to create some kind of New Market um and so that's what we do</p>
</details>

我们通过这些新兴的初创公司来赚钱，它们要么试图颠覆大型现有企业，要么试图创造某种新市场，这就是我们所做的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um and so we we make money when these new up start uh startups uh form and uh you know either either try to go take down a big incumbent or try to create some kind of New Market um and so that's what we do</p>
</details>

我认为对于整个世界而言，挑战在于生产性经济投资机会所需的资本量与这些机会的数量之间存在根本性的供需不平衡。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um I I think for the World At Large uh the you know the challenge is just that there's a fundamental uh uh Supply demand imbalance between the amount of capital um you know that's seeking productive uh economic investment opportunities um and then the the number of those opportunities and so I think there's a a very large macro problem uh on making money in the economy</p>
</details>

因此，我认为在经济中赚钱存在一个非常大的宏观问题，而科技和风险投资只能是这个答案的一小部分，但希望我们能成为这个答案的一部分。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um and and and and Tech and Venture Capital can only be a small part of that answer but but hopefully we will be a part of that answer</p>
</details>

主持人: 是的，你身处**硅谷**（Silicon Valley: 美国加州北部，以高科技创新和公司闻名）中心，你某种程度上发明了互联网。那么，谈到人工智能问题，AI竞赛将如何发展？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yeah well you see in the middle of Silicon Valley and you kind of invented the Internet so um kicking off the the AI question just how how will the AI raise pan out here</p>
</details>

### AI 作为新平台与技术竞赛

Marc Andreessen: 是的，我们所押注并大力投资的理论和希望是，AI，特别是围绕**生成式AI**（Generative AI: 能够生成文本、图像或其他媒体内容的人工智能）的新突破，代表着一个新的**平台**（Platform: 在科技行业中，指一种基础技术或系统，在其之上可以构建大量应用）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yeah so the the the theory and the Hope um certainly that we're betting that we're betting against and investing hard against um is that is that Ai and specifically these new breakthroughs around AI like like generative AI U represent a new platform</p>
</details>

在科技行业中，这是一个非常强大的概念，因为新平台的理念意味着一种新的基础技术，你可以在其之上重新发明成千上万的应用类别。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and in the in the tech industry that's a sort of very powerful concept uh because the idea of a new platform in the tech industry is sort of a new foundational technology um that you can then imagine Reinventing thousands and thousands of application categories on top of</p>
</details>

历史上，科技行业一直由这些平台驱动，比如最初的**大型机**（Mainframe computer: 用于处理大量数据和关键任务的巨型计算机），随后是**小型机**（Mini computers: 比大型机小但比个人电脑大的计算机）、**客户端-服务器计算机**（Client-server computers: 客户端向服务器请求服务，服务器提供服务的计算模式）、**个人电脑**（Personal computers: 供个人使用的计算机）、**移动计算设备**（Mobile computers: 如智能手机和平板电脑）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and and the the tech industry historically um has been fueled by these platforms you know the original one was the Mainframe computer that then led to mini computers client server computers personal computers mobile uh mobile computers</p>
</details>

每次平台转变，都有机会重塑整个行业和生态系统，以及人们使用技术的所有不同方式，并创造全新一代的公司。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um and every time there's a platform shift There's an opportunity to reinvent the industry and reinvent basically the entire ecosystem and and all the different ways that people use technology and and create an entirely new generation of companies</p>
</details>

因此，我们坚信AI是一次新的平台转变，而且是真正重大的平台转变之一。我们认为这可能与微处理器同等重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um and so we we certainly believe that AI is is is is a is a new platform shift we believe that AI is one of the really big platform shifts we we think this you know might the possibility exist that this is on par with the microprocessor</p>
</details>

所以，我们认为这里有机会采取非常广阔的视角，投资于许多不同的核心技术和AI用例。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um and so you know we think there's an opportunity to take a very broad uh perspective here and invest in many different um both core Technologies and also use cases of of AI</p>
</details>

主持人: 目前的竞争焦点在哪里？是关于芯片、资金、人才还是电力？具体是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">where is the where is the kind of fight going on just now what uh is it about chips or money or people or electricity just what exactly is it</p>
</details>

### AI 竞赛的战场与历史背景

Marc Andreessen: 是的，这次AI转变最引人注目之处在于，它是一个我称之为“80年一夜成功”的事件。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yeah so the the the most dramatic thing about this this sort of AI shift um is that it's it's it's what I call an 80-year overnight success</p>
</details>

关于**神经网络**（Neural Networks: 模拟人脑结构和功能的计算模型，是AI的基础技术）的原始论文实际上写于1943年。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um and so the original paper on neural networks which are the foundational technology of AI was actually written in 1943</p>
</details>

在过去的80年里，一代又一代的研究人员基本上都在尝试让AI发挥作用，但大多数时候都未能成功。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um and then you had over the course of the last 80 years you had entire generations of researchers who who basically try to make AI work and for the most part weren't weren't able to do it</p>
</details>

事实上，35年前我上学的时候，AI是一个被贬低的研究领域，因为80年代的AI热潮并未成功。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um in fact when I when I was in school you know 35 years ago AI was a was a discredited field because there had been an AI boom in the 80s that that that didn't pan out</p>
</details>

所以，这是一个长期以来一直在寻找可行产品的技术领域。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um and so it's an it's a it's a technology sector that's sort of been in search of of working products for a long time</p>
</details>

本质上，突破性的时刻发生在2022年，那就是**ChatGPT**（ChatGPT: 由OpenAI开发的大型语言模型，能够生成类似人类的文本）的时刻。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um essentially what happened was the Breakthrough moment was in 2022 and it was the it was the chat GPT moment</p>
</details>

所以，这项技术实际上已经发展了79年，但那是一个突破性的时刻，它基本上从“不工作”到“工作得非常好”只用了一步。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um and so it was you know it's actually 7 79 years into the technology but it was a breakthrough moment and then it was a breakthrough moment of it went basically from not working to working incredibly well in one step</p>
</details>

这项技术尚未完美，仍有大量工作要做，但从根本上说，这些产品已经非常出色，它们的能力令人难以置信，而且它们在起步阶段就比微处理器或互联网要好得多。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">uh and you know the the technolog is not perfect yet there's still a lot of work to be done but it fundamentally you know these products are just incredible already in what they can do and and they're far better out of the gate than the than you know the microprocessor was or the internet was</p>
</details>

因此，这是一种罕见的情况，功能上的巨大飞跃发生得极其迅速。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um and so it's this kind of rare situation where you have this dramatic leap and functionality happening extremely quickly</p>
</details>

因此，基本上科技生态系统的每个部分都在试图做出反应，试图弄清楚如何整合AI，或者如何基于AI进行构建，或者如何弥补AI的弱点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um as a result of that basically every part of the tech ecosystem is trying to react and trying to figure out how to incorporate AI or trying to build on AI or trying to you know basically compensate you know figure out how to how to compensate for weaknesses in AI</p>
</details>

科技行业的每一个细分领域都在此刻做出反应。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um every single sector of the tech industry is reacting right now</p>
</details>

目前存在大规模的芯片短缺，这是我们行业有史以来最大的芯片供需不平衡。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um there is a you know massive chip you know shortage uh this the biggest Supply deance Supply demand imbalance and chips that we've ever seen as an industry</p>
</details>

因此，那里正在发生一场大规模的竞争。数据中心创新和开发也掀起了一波巨浪。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um and so there's a massive fight happening there there's a massive you know wave of data center Innovation development</p>
</details>

实际上，很多人现在都在努力弄清楚如何为这些巨型数据中心供电和散热，甚至对核电的兴趣也重新燃起。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">there's actually power a lot of people are now trying to figure out how to power and cool these giant data centers there's actually a Resurgence of interest in nuclear power um around these data centers</p>
</details>

然后，在整个软件堆栈中都存在竞争。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um and then there's there are there are basically fights happening up and down the software stack</p>
</details>

目前获得最多关注的竞争可能是构建所谓**基础模型**（Foundation Models: 经过大量数据训练的超大型AI模型，可适应多种下游任务）的软件公司之间的竞争。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you know the the the fight that gets probably the most publicity at the moment is the fight between the software companies building the so-call foundation models</p>
</details>

在这方面，存在两种世界观的激烈争论：一种观点认为将会有少数几个大型模型主导一切；另一种观点则认为这更像是微处理器，将会有成千上万种不同的模型运行在数十亿台设备上。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um and so and there there's sort of a big fight between a view of the world in which there will be a few big models that basically win everything and then an alternate view of the world in which this is more like the microprocessor and there will actually be you know many you know thousands of different models running on billions of devices</p>
</details>

这些模型将有各种不同的形状、大小、描述，并以各种方式进行定制。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um you know of many different shapes sizes descriptions customized in various ways</p>
</details>

实际上，我们正在非常积极地投资于后一种观点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um and and actually that that latter thesis is the thesis we're investing against very aggressively</p>
</details>

### 中美AI竞争与制度优劣

主持人: 去年你说我们应该把AI融入我们所做的一切，比如武器、汽车，所有东西，以击败中国人。你能详细谈谈吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">now you said last year that we should just stuff AI into everything we do like weapons cars everything in order to beat the Chinese what do you could you tell us about it</p>
</details>

Marc Andreessen: 是的，关于AI目前存在两种政策辩论，在美国和欧盟都相当普遍。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yeah there's there's sort of two policy debates uh happening around AI um you know somewhat somewhat for sure in the EU but for sure in the US</p>
</details>

一种政策辩论是关于AI有点奇怪和可怕，我们应该对其进行监管，并以各种方式阻止其发展。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um and and there's sort of one policy debate which is you know AI is sort of weird and scary and we should regulate it and we should kind of prevent it from happening in different ways</p>
</details>

欧盟已经出台了这些非常繁重的法规，英国也紧随其后，美国政治中也围绕此问题展开了激烈争论。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and you know the EU has put in place these kind of very onerous regulations the UK has followed and then there's a big fight happening in in in US politics around this</p>
</details>

这是一种内向的、国内政策的观点，人们对AI抱有各种担忧。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um and so this is sort of an inward-looking you know kind of domestic policy uh Viewpoint and people have all these all these fears around AI</p>
</details>

还有一种完全不同的对话，那就是地缘政治对话，基本上是关于与中国的地缘政治竞争。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um there's a completely different conversation which is the geopolitical conversation and that's the that's the conversation of basically you know geopolitical competition with China</p>
</details>

当然，一旦进入这个对话，就会非常清楚我们需要赢。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um and of course you know the minute you get into that conversation it becomes very clear that we need to win</p>
</details>

具体来说，我们需要赢的原因是，我们需要像上个世纪我们赢得与苏联的技术竞赛一样，赢得与中国的AI竞赛。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um and and specifically the reason we need to win is we need to win we need to win the AI race with China you know sort of a very analogous way that we won the you know the sort of Technology race with the Soviet Union um you know in in the previous Century</p>
</details>

也就是说，我们基本上有两种主导的心态和政权：西方民主和中国共产主义，它们都渴望改变世界。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">which is you know we have two basically two basically dominant you know mindsets regimes of you know Western democracy and and and and Chinese communism um you know that both have aspirations to to to transform the world</p>
</details>

这两种政权都由主要的民族国家支持，都由主要的军队支持，都由主要的经济体支持，也都由主要的科技产业支持。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um you know both of those are are supported by Major you know major nation states uh both of those are supported by Major militaries both of those are supported by Major economies and both of those are supported by Major Tech Industries</p>
</details>

如果你看看与苏联冷战的先例，西方之所以获胜，是因为技术优势、经济优势以及国家安全和军事情报优势形成的三角关系。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um and if you look at the pre precedent of the cold war with the Soviet Union the reason the West won was because of sort of a triangle of technological superiority economic superiority and then and then and then National Security Military Intelligence superiority</p>
</details>

我们决定要赢，并且我们赢了。顺便说一句，我们的胜利最终对俄罗斯人民来说是件好事，苏联的解体对他们来说非常好，今天俄罗斯人民的生活好得多。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um but you know we we decided we wanted to win and and and and we won right and by the way our Victory ended up actually being great for the the people of Russia right it was actually really great for the Soviet Union to fall and and you know people people in Russia are much better off today</p>
</details>

所以，我认为这非常直接：我们需要赢，我们需要通过在技术上、经济上和军事上都更优秀来赢得胜利。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um and so you know I think this is very straightforward like we we need to win we need to win by being better technologically better economically and better militarily</p>
</details>

AI已被美国军事规划者、五角大楼以及中国规划者确定为民族国家未来的核心技术。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">AI has been identified as the core technology uh for the future of the nation state by both US military planners by the Pentagon um as well as by uh you know the the the Chinese planners</p>
</details>

因此，这将是这两个“半球”竞争的主要领域之一，我认为我们赢得胜利非常重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and so it will be one of the main areas uh in which these you know these kind of two the two hemispheres compete and and and I think it's important that we win</p>
</details>

主持人: 你认为西方现在相对于中国处于什么位置？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">where do you think the West is now relative to China</p>
</details>

Marc Andreessen: 我会说西方拥有去中心化系统、市场经济以及政府不控制一切系统的所有优点和缺点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so the West has I would say all of the advantages and disadvantages of a decentralized system uh and a market economy and a and a sort of a system in which governments don't control everything</p>
</details>

其巨大的优势在于创新和创业精神，缺点是我们的系统很难进行规划。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um and you know the huge advantage of that is innovation and Entrepreneurship the disadvantage of that is you know a very it's very difficult for our systems to plan</p>
</details>

没有自上而下的美国技术战略，也没有自上而下的欧洲技术战略，这些概念与我们的系统是相互对立的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you know there you know there is no top- down American Technology strategy there is no top down European technology strategy those concepts are kind of you know antithetical to our systems</p>
</details>

所以我们总体上非常强大和充满活力，但我们也非常混乱。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">U and so we're very robust and dynamic in general um but you know we're very messy</p>
</details>

中国人则拥有中心化系统的所有优点和缺点，很像苏联。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um the Chinese have both the advantages and the disadvantages of a centralized system much like the Soviet Union did</p>
</details>

他们有一个**指令与控制系统**（Command and Control System: 一种自上而下的管理和决策模式），共产党拥有并控制一切，他们可以指示他们的私营公司做任何他们想做的事情，他们现在正以越来越大的力度这样做。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um you know they have a command and control system where the Communist party you know owns and controls everything and they can direct their private companies to do whatever they want which they're doing right now you know with sort of increasing Force</p>
</details>

然后他们也拥有中心化系统的所有缺点，那就是他们有一个指令系统。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um and then they have all the disadvantages of of a centralized system which is you know they have they have a command system</p>
</details>

他们实际上正在试图扼杀他们的创业系统，他们正在试图基本上将他们的企业家赶出行业，在许多情况下甚至赶出国家。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um you know they're actually in the process of trying Crush their entrepreneurial system right now they're you know they're trying to basically Drive their entrepreneurs you know out of out of you know in many cases out of business in many cases out of the country</p>
</details>

所以，这就像与苏联的冷战一样，这是一个不对称的局面，双方都有各自的优势和劣势。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um and so it's it's just like like the cold war with the Soviet Union it's it's an asymmetric situation each side brings strengths and weaknesses</p>
</details>

然后我会说，双方都倾向于采纳对方的模式来试图获得优势。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and then I would say you know each side is tempted to embrace the model of the other side to try to get the advantages</p>
</details>

所以中国人有这种虚假的创业系统，他们试图培养这种系统。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so the Chinese have kind of this fake entrepreneurial system uh you know that they kind kind of try to Foster</p>
</details>

而我们则在华盛顿特区和布鲁塞尔拥有这种不太有效的中央规划职能，它运作得不是很好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and then we have this sort of you know you know sort of U not very effective you know Central planning function uh you know in in in DC and in Brussels you know that doesn't work very well</p>
</details>

至少我会认为我们应该充分发挥我们系统的优势，并努力受益于我们应该拥有一个更具活力的经济，我们应该拥有更多的创业精神。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and and at least I would argue we should lean into the strengths of our system um and you know and and try to benefit from the fact that we should have a much more Dynamic economy we should have much more entrepreneurship um and and hopefully that thatss what we'll do</p>
</details>

### 西方社会活力与技术进步的挑战

主持人: 谈到活力，我们见面时你也谈到了投资美国活力的重要性，我想这也适用于欧洲活力。你指的是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">to talking of um dynamism you when we met you also talked about the importance of investing in American dynamism and I guess that also goes for European dynamism what what do you mean by that</p>
</details>

Marc Andreessen: 是的，你看，这某种程度上是地缘政治冲突以及我们国内问题的一部分挑战。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yeah so you know look the the this is sort of part of you know this is part of the challenge for the the geopolitical conflict as well as our our domestic issues</p>
</details>

美国和欧盟，我们都是工业革命的产物，我们是第一次工业革命（如蒸汽动力）的产物，我们是第二次工业革命（如电力）的产物，我们是计算机时代的产物。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and so you know look both both the US and EU I mean we're we're we're we're you know we are the result of the Industrial Revolution right we're a result of the first Industrial Revolution with things like steam power we're the result of the Second Industrial Revolution you know with things like electricity we're the result of the of the computer age</p>
</details>

由美国和欧洲代表的西方，在过去300年里，大多数这些技术都是在这里开发的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you know the the the West represented by the US and Europe is where you know most of these Technologies over the last you know 300 years were developed</p>
</details>

历史上，我们的社会因此受益匪浅。我们拥有最高的生活水平，我们的孩子随着时间的推移表现得最好，这通常是一个非常协同积极的过程。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um and historically our society's benefited enormously by this you know we we have the highest standards of living you know are you know children over time have you know have done the best and and and generally it's been a very you know synergistic positive uh process</p>
</details>

我认为在过去的50年里，美国社会和欧盟社会都对技术进步的理念失去了信心，坦率地说，也对经济进步的理念失去了信心。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um you know in the last 50 years I think both American society and EU Society has sort of lost faith in the idea of technological progress um and lost faith frankly in the idea of economic progress</p>
</details>

他们变得更加谨慎，更加规避风险，更加不愿意将变革视为积极和令人兴奋的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and you know decided to become let say I don't know much more you know cautious much more risk averse um much more you know sort of unwilling to to think of change as a as a positive and exciting thing</p>
</details>

实际上，你现在在美国可以看到，工业与政府之间的关系处于50年来的低点，政府与工业之间存在相当大的敌意。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um and and you know you actually see that I would say in in in in America right now you know the relationship between industry and the government is is at a 50-year low it's it's you know the actually quite quite a large amount of hostility between government and Industry</p>
</details>

在欧洲也确实如此。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and the same is certainly true in in in in Europe</p>
</details>

所以，我们的观点是，我们需要技术，我们需要创新，我们需要市场，我们需要这些东西来运作。为什么？因为我们需要增长。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um and and so again you know our view is like look we you know we need technology we we need technology we need Innovation we need markets uh we need these things to function why because we need growth</p>
</details>

我们希望我们的社会是增长型社会，我们希望人们认为有机会，我们希望人们能够以积极的眼光看待事物。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>

因此，“美国活力”是我们的一项非常直接的投资计划，专注于向政府高度参与的许多经济部门注入更多的技术能量。

<p class="english-text">um and so American dynamism is sort of a very direct investment program that we have um you know focused on injecting a lot more technological energy into a lot of the sectors of the economy that the government's very involved in</p>

当然，国防和情报是其中很大一部分，但能源、法律、教育和医疗保健也是重要组成部分。

<p class="english-text">um and certainly defense and intelligence are a big part of that but also energy and and and law and education and Healthcare are also big parts</p>

在所有这些部门，坦率地说，我认为它们都严重缺乏技术变革和创新，它们确实需要这些。

### 欧洲的动态性与监管选择

主持人: 欧洲如何才能变得更具活力？我的意思是，并非说欧洲不具活力，但与硅谷相比，我们似乎有些落后。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">what would be the key to get Europe to become more Dynamic I mean not that we are not dynamic in Europe but uh compared to Silicon Valley we seem to be lagging a bit behind here</p>
</details>

Marc Andreessen: 是的，你看，如果你在30年前对前50家科技公司进行排名，其中很大一部分是欧洲公司，我认为大约有40%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yeah so look if you you know if you did a rank order of the the top 50 technology companies 30 years ago a large percentage of them were European I think it was about 40%</p>
</details>

如果你今天进行排名，我认为50家公司中只有一家是欧洲公司。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um if you did a rank order today I think it's one out of 50</p>
</details>

所以，欧洲确实落后了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um and so you know Europe Europe has really falling off</p>
</details>

我想我描述它的方式是，至少从外部看来，这似乎几乎完全是一种选择。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and and I guess the the way I would describe it is it it seems at least from the outside it seems to be almost entirely Choice</p>
</details>

这似乎是一种选择，优先考虑监管、风险规避和**预防原则**（Precautionary Principle: 在可能造成严重或不可逆转的损害时，即使缺乏科学确定性，也应采取预防措施），而不是创新。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">uh which is it seems like it's been a choice to sort of prioritize regulation and risk aversion and the precautionary principle over U you know over Innovation</p>
</details>

最尖锐的例子显然是能源部门，他们自愿停止能源开发，我认为这导致了与俄罗斯相关的真实地缘政治压力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you know the most acute version of that obviously is the energy sector um you know with the sort of sort of voluntary standown of energy development which you know I think has has led to you know real geopolitical stresses with respect to Russia</p>
</details>

所以，我认为这是一种选择。我认为欧洲的政治领导阶层已经决定他们想要这样，选民们到目前为止也支持他们的这种愿望。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um and so you know I I I look I think I think it's been a choice I think that I think the the political leadership class in in in in um in in Europe has decided that they they want this the the voters so far have supported them in wanting it</p>
</details>

这会带来后果，我认为这些后果正变得越来越清晰。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um you know it has it has consequences I think the consequences are becoming clearer</p>
</details>

我认为从根本上说，这是社会层面的一个选择，选民们要么会行动起来，要么不会，领导人要么会行动起来，要么不会。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think you know fundamentally it's a choice at a societal level and you know the the voters will either step up or they won't and the leaders will either step up or they won't</p>
</details>

但我认为当前方法的后果已经显现，而且我认为它们并不好。

<details>

### 风险投资家的责任与地缘政治

主持人: 在技术日益融入超级大国竞争的时代，你作为风险投资家或风险资本投资者有何反思？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">any reflection any Reflections on your responsibility as a venture capitalist or Venture Capital investor at a time where technology is becoming so integrated into the race between the superpower</p>
</details>

主持人: 比如埃隆·马斯克的**星链**（Starlink: SpaceX公司提供的卫星互联网服务）突然在乌克兰发挥关键作用等等，你是怎么看待的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you know um ellon musk with with Starling suddenly being key in Ukraine uh and so on what do you how do you think about it</p>
</details>

Marc Andreessen: 是的，我会说我们百分之百站在美国这一边，我们百分之百站在西方这一边。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yeah so I would describe it as we're 100% on the side of the United States um and we're 100% on the side of the West</p>
</details>

因此，我们公司从未在中国进行投资，我们始终认为那会带来困难，这在很长一段时间内看起来像是一个错误，但现在越来越清楚了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um and so we we never as a firm for example had an investment program in China we never you know we always view that there would be difficulties from that which you know for a long time you know looked like a mistake but I think is now you know increasingly clear</p>
</details>

所以，我们百分之百站在美国和西方这一边。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so so we're 100% on the side of the US and the West</p>
</details>

作为一家公司，我们没有自己的外交政策，我们基本上遵循**美国国务院**（US State Department: 负责美国外交政策和国际关系的政府部门）的外交政策。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um as a firm we don't have our own foreign policy we have basically the foreign policy of the US state department</p>
</details>

所以，我们与政府完全保持一致。我们所有涉及国家安全的计划都将基于美国政府对朋友和盟友的看法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um and so we're you know we're sort of in complete lock step with our uh with our government you know we all of our programs that involve anything involving National Security will will will be based you know on on on the US government's view of of friends and allies</p>
</details>

我想说，这个立场基本上直到俄罗斯入侵乌克兰之前都备受争议。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you know I would say this you know this was a controversial position basically up until Russia's invasion of Ukraine</p>
</details>

在俄罗斯入侵乌克兰之前，硅谷普遍存在一种思潮，认为国家安全是某种不好的或不合时宜的东西，科技公司不应该参与其中。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um and so up until Russia's invasion of Ukraine basically there was a prevailing ethos and Silicon Valley that National Security is somehow bad or undesirable or the tech company should not want to you know be involved in it</p>
</details>

曾发生过一个著名的事件，**谷歌**（Google: 跨国科技公司）与**美国国防部**（US Department of Defense: 负责美国军事事务的政府部门）有一个项目，他们的员工在园区内基本上举行了抗议，迫使公司取消了该项目。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and there was this famous incident where go gole had this program with the US Department of Defense that their you know their employees basically rioted on campus and forced them to cancel</p>
</details>

与此同时，谷歌实际上在北京设有一个AI实验室，根据定义，在中国境内的任何事物都与他们的安全国家相关联。

<details>

<p class="english-text">um at the same time that Google actually had you know an AI lab in Beijing that by definition is you know anything in in in in China sort of connected to their Security State</p>
</details>

所以，硅谷内部在科技界与美国政府之间应扮演何种角色方面存在相当多的内部异议和分歧。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um and so you know there was a fair amount of I would think internal dissension division in in Silicon Valley in terms of what the right role is you know between the valley and the US government</p>
</details>

基本上，我们观察到的是，俄罗斯入侵乌克兰的那一刻，虽然这对乌克兰来说显然是一场灾难，一件可怕的事情，我希望它没有发生，但它确实导致了这个问题在美国和硅谷的瞬间“去两极分化”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um basically what what we've observed is the the minute Russia invaded Ukraine it was you know was obviously a catastrophe for Ukraine and a terrible thing and I wish it hadn't happened but it it caused sort of an instant sort of re um I don't know like a depolarization of this issue uh certainly in the in the US and in the valley</p>
</details>

突然之间，那些历史上非常反对科技公司参与国防的人，都变得非常支持。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">where all of a sudden people who historically had been very averse to Tech involvement in defense all of a sudden became very in favor of it</p>
</details>

最生动的例子就是**安杜里尔**（Anduril: 一家专注于国防技术和自动化防御系统的美国公司）这家公司，它曾是一家备受政治争议的公司，我们的新国防承包商，正在建造所有这些自动化防御系统。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um and you know the most Vivid example there was this company andril that was a very politically controversial company you know our our new defense contractor uh you know building all these automated defense systems</p>
</details>

在俄罗斯入侵乌克兰之前，它在硅谷一直是一家备受争议的公司，但自那以后，所有人都喜欢它了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um it was a very controversial company in the valley basically right up to the day Russia invaded Ukraine and ever since everybody loves it</p>
</details>

这家公司的创始人指出，这其中有些讽刺，因为公司做的事情是一样的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um you know which the founder of that company points out you know there's some you know some some some irony to that because the company's doing the same things</p>
</details>

但我认为俄罗斯入侵乌克兰确实让很多人，包括美国政治左翼的很多人，认识到国家安全确实很重要，世界上确实有坏人，确实会发生入侵和坏事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um uh but I you know I think the Russian invasion of Ukraine really highlighted for a lot of people including a lot of people on the political left in the US that actually National Security really matters and there are actually bad people in the world and there are you know going to be invasions and there going to be bad things that happen</p>
</details>

西方民主国家需要能够做出回应，需要具备最先进的能力来应对这些情况。

<p class="english-text">and the Western democracies need to be able to respond and need to be able to be state of the art being able to cope with these situations</p>

然后当然，对以色列的袭击是第二个因素，同样是一件可怕的事情，但它再次促使人们说：“好的，我们需要确保西方民主国家真正武装起来。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and then of course the you know the attack at Israel you know is a is a sort of a second again a another terrible thing but a second kind of uh factor that has caused people to say okay we we need to make sure that Western democracies are actually armed up</p>

### 如何成为更好的投资者

主持人: 是的，马克，最后换一个完全不同的话题，在一分钟内，我们如何才能成为更好的投资者？因为这是这次会议的主题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yeah yeah Mark finishing off on a completely different tag here uh in one minute how can we become better investors because that's the theme of the conference</p>
</details>

Marc Andreessen: 是的，我认为对于大型机构投资来说，问题始终是：如何部署大量资本？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yeah so I think the question always I I think the question for sort of large institutional investing the question is you know deployment of large amounts of capital</p>
</details>

世界上没有那么多地方能实现增长。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">there just are not that many places in the world to get growth</p>
</details>

所以，我与所有大型投资者交谈时面临的根本挑战是，他们投资的大部分资本，根据定义，无法投入高增长领域，仅仅因为高增长领域并不多，它们实际上很难找到。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um and so you know the fundamental challenge every large scale investor I talk to deals with is you know most of the capital that they invest uh you know just kind of by definition can't go into high growth sectors um just because there aren't that many high growth sectors they're actually you know quite quite hard to find</p>
</details>

所以，世界上只有少数几个地方有增长，只有少数人正在创办能够实现增长的公司，并试图建立这样的产业。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um and so there are basically a small number of places in the world that have growth there are a small number of people who are starting the kinds of companies and trying to build the kinds of industries that are going to be able to to deliver growth</p>
</details>

西方投资者通常非常支持这一点，所以风险投资获得了很好的资金。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um and so you know hope you know generally speaking you know Western investors are quite supportive of this and so you know venture capital is quite well funded</p>
</details>

但我认为，关键在于专注于那些能够创造增长的地方和人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but um you know I think focusing in on the specifically the places and the people who are going to be able to generate growth</p>
</details>

坦率地说，另一件事是，当这些投资者不仅通过资金，还通过他们的影响力、权威和说服力等在社会中更广泛地发表意见时，会非常有帮助。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and then quite frankly the other thing is um you know it's very helpful when these investors also weigh in more broadly than just with money uh and also weigh in with their influence and you know with their with their level of authority and their level of of you know persuasive capability and so forth in their societies</p>
</details>

增长是我们应该追求的目标，这不仅从投资角度来看是好的，从社会角度来看也是好的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">uh you know the growth is something that we should be aspiring for and that is is actually good not just from an investment standpoint but from a societal standpoint</p>
</details>

主持人: 太棒了，非常感谢你与我们分享你的想法，祝你一切顺利。
