### 美国与拉美盟友关系

Eight or nine, ten countries, Argentina foremost among them, that have aligned with the United States on issue after issue in international community events all over the world.
有八到九、十个国家，其中阿根廷是首要的，它们在世界各地的国际社会活动中，在各种问题上都与美国保持一致。

In fact, these great allies like Argentina.

But I think one of the more promising developments is later this month, there'll be an election in Bolivia after 25, 30 years of anti-American, hostile government.
但我认为，一个更有希望的发展是，本月晚些时候玻利维亚将举行一场选举，此前玻利维亚经历了25到30年的反美敌对政府。

Both of the candidates running in that election, in the runoff election, want strong and better relations with the United States.
那场选举中，在决选中竞选的两位候选人都希望与美国建立更强劲、更好的关系。

So another transformative opportunity there.

This is our hemisphere.

It's where we live.

And having strong neighbors such as and great progress has been made and will make more.

Over the last nine months, really over the last nine months, I believe the president's for much I want to say this.
在过去的九个月里，真的，在过去的九个月里，我相信总统做了很多，我想说这一点。

### 对阿根廷的贸易支持

Do you imagine soon a free trade agreement with Argentina? Could it be possible soon?

And one of the ways we can do they have great product and we used to do a lot of trade.
我们能做的一件事是，他们有很棒的产品，我们过去常常进行大量贸易。

And then if you look at what the Democrats.

And so form it's good for us.
因此，这对我们也有好处。

### 中国与拉美影响力

Also, this president was trying to try to draw a wedge between the U.S. and Argentina by buying soybeans from Argentina, not U.S. farmers and and China on the Falklands.
此外，这位总统试图通过从阿根廷而非美国农民那里购买大豆，以及在**福克兰群岛** (Falkland Islands: 英国与阿根廷存在主权争议的南大西洋岛屿) 问题上与中国合作，来离间美国和阿根廷。

China likes to draw ships, too.

And if that's what's happening, I'd be very upset about that.
如果正在发生这种情况，我会非常沮丧。

是的，我真的对此感到惊讶。

You do understand what about this one because it's so important for African countries to go ahead and provide the the American assistance is not predicated on this swap with China being closed.

Mr. You said sorry, but you've said that at a convenient cost to export to China for your business on the agenda and this stuff is so important.

It's not going to make a big difference for our country, but it will in terms of South America, if Argentina does well, you're going to have others following and a lot of others are following.
这对我们国家不会产生太大影响，但就南美洲而言，如果阿根廷做得好，其他国家也会效仿，而且很多国家正在效仿。

You have countries in South America that two years ago would have never even been thought of to go as democracies or as just countries that want to do fair and balanced trading.
南美洲有些国家，两年前甚至从未被认为是民主国家，或者只是想进行公平和平衡贸易的国家。

They wouldn't let the man that operated into the booth.

Can you believe by having a specific interest in economic terms, I do have no, I want to see it succeed.
你相信我从经济角度有特定利益吗？不，我没有，我希望它成功。

I think it's going to be great and we will benefit also.
我认为那会很棒，我们也会受益。

But it's not that big a benefit because it's not that big a country, but it's a very important country and it's a country that can be very successful.

And now the domination like **BRICS** (金砖国家: 巴西、俄罗斯、印度、中国和南非五个主要新兴市场国家组成的经济合作机制).
而现在，像金砖国家这样的主导力量。

I don't anybody wants to be in BRICS. That's fine.

如果他们要给我们推行愚蠢的政策，我的意思是，共产主义政策，这已经被数千年的历史证明是行不通的。

You have inferior candidates or something because it's impossible to think that New York City can have a communist mayor.
你们有劣质的候选人或者其他什么，因为无法想象纽约市会有一个共产主义市长。

He's a communist. He's not a socialist, by the way.

There's a big difference. He's a communist.

I mean, how can a policeman he hates Jewish people and yet he's got Jewish people support.
我的意思是，一个警察怎么可能，他憎恨犹太人，但他却得到了犹太人的支持。

He hates Jewish people.
他憎恨犹太人。

So it comes through the White House, the funding for New York and for everyplace comes through the White House.
所以，纽约和所有地方的资金都通过白宫。

And I'm very generous and I was always very generous with New York, even when you had opposition there.
我非常慷慨，而且我一直对纽约非常慷慨，即使那里有反对派。

But I was always very generous.
但我一直非常慷慨。

But I wouldn't be generous to a communist, a guy that's going to take the money and throw it out the window because you're talking about hundreds of billions of dollars and we're not going to let somebody get into office and squander the taxpayer money from this country.
但我不会对一个共产主义者慷慨，一个会拿钱然后挥霍的人，因为你谈论的是数千亿美元，我们不会让某人上任并挥霍这个国家的纳税人钱。

We're not going to let it happen.
我们不会让它发生。

So it's a little bit like that with if you take a look Argentina, if the president doesn't win, I know the person that he'd be running against, I believe probably we probably have the person a person is extremely far left and a philosophy that got Argentina into this problem in the first place.
所以，如果看看阿根廷，情况有点像这样，如果总统没有赢得选举，我知道他将面对的对手，我相信那个人很可能是极左翼的，这种哲学最初让阿根廷陷入了困境。

So we would not be generous with Argentina if that happened.
所以如果发生那种情况，我们不会对阿根廷慷慨。

If he loses, we are not going to be generous with Argentina.
如果他输了，我们将不会对阿根廷慷慨。
