### 金州杀手：从维萨利亚到南加州的罪行升级

本视频讨论了可能令某些观众感到不安的严重罪行，因此我希望提前告知大家，但我认为有必要详细讨论这些罪行，其原因将很快变得明朗。在20世纪70年代中期，加利福尼亚州维萨利亚（Visalia）这个小镇上，该州最多产的罪犯之一开始了他的犯罪生涯。他反复闯入民宅并偷窃现金、硬币和珠宝等小物件。他被冠以“**维萨利亚洗劫者**”（Visalia ransacker）的绰号，但很快他的罪行升级了。

<details>

<p class="english-text">This video includes a discussion of serious crimes which may be disturbing for some viewers so I wanted to let you know that upfront, but I think it's necessary to talk about these crimes in some detail for reasons that will become apparent. In the small town of Visalia, California in the mid 1970s, one of the state's most prolific criminals got his start. He repeatedly broke into houses and stole small items like cash, coins, and jewelry. He was dubbed the Visalia ransacker but soon his crimes escalated.</p>
</details>

六个月后，即1976年，他搬到了萨克拉门托，在接下来的三年里，他横跨北加州，实施了多起性侵犯，超过50起。在这里，他被称为“**东区强奸犯**”（East Area Rapist）。警方当时表示：“请锁好门窗。萨克拉门托臭名昭著的东区强奸犯可能仍在城里。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">- Six months later in 1976, he moves up to Sacramento and over the course of the next three years, he's moving all across Northern California committing numerous sexual assaults, over 50 sexual assaults. - Here, he was called the east area rapist. - [Male Reporter] The police are saying lock up tight. Sacramento's infamous east area rapist may still be in town.</p>
</details>

随后在1979年，他南下至南加州，从圣巴巴拉（Santa Barbara）开始作案并开始杀人。在南加州，他被称为“**最初的夜行者**”（Original Night Stalker）。记者报道称：“他曾被称为东区强奸犯和最初的夜行者，这些都是在1976年至1986年间，跨越加州多个县的残忍、精心策划的罪行。”警方认为所有这些罪行都是由同一个人所为，此人现在被称为“**金州杀手**”（Golden State Killer）。那么，警方是如何得知这些罪行是同一个人所为的呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">- And then in 1979, he moves down to Southern California, starting in Santa Barbara and starts killing. And he was known as the original night stalker in Southern California. - [Reporter] Variously known as the east area rapist and the original night stalker, these were brutal meticulously planned crimes that spanned numerous California counties between 1976 and 1986. - Police believed that all of these crimes were committed by the same person now known as the golden state killer. How was it known that these were committed by the same person?</p>
</details>

调查人员主要依靠**作案手法**（MO, Modus Operandi: 犯罪分子实施犯罪的方式）。他会戴某种面具或头套，穿着短裤和T恤。金州杀手有着非常独特的作案手法。他会持枪闯入一对男女居住的房屋，将他们捆绑起来，并告诉男子：“我会在你背上放盘子，如果我听到盘子移动，我就会杀了你的妻子，然后再杀了你。”接着，他会把妻子带到另一个房间进行性侵犯。然后，他会在屋子里待上一段时间，吃东西、偷东西，偷一些小物件，然后离开。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">- Investigators were relying on MO. MO, modus operandi is basically how a criminal will commit a crime. - He was wearing some type of a mask or a hood. He was wearing shorts and a T-shirt. - The golden state killer had a very distinctive MO - What he would do is he would break into a house with a gun, a house with a man and a woman. He would tie them up tell the man I'm gonna put plates on your back. If I hear those plates move, I'm going to kill your wife and then kill you, take the wife into another room and sexually assault her. Then he would go through the house for however much time, eating, stealing stuff, stealing little things or whatever and then he would leave.</p>
</details>

### DNA技术：从早期挑战到突破性进展

他是如何没有留下指纹证据而被捕的呢？嗯，他没有留下指纹。他总是戴着面具，总是戴着手套。这是一个竭尽全力避免被抓的罪犯。记者报道：“金州杀手至少与加州境内的12起谋杀案、50起强奸案和一系列入室盗窃案有关。”我们向法医实验室提供**DNA**（Deoxyribonucleic Acid: 脱氧核糖核酸，储存遗传信息的分子）测序解决方案，用于处理犯罪现场的DNA。在犯罪现场，通常只剩下不到一**纳克**（nanogram: 十亿分之一克）的DNA，而且通常已经降解，也就是说它会分解。为什么犯罪现场的DNA如此之少？一纳克？是的，这太不可思议了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">- How was he not caught based on fingerprint evidence? - Well, he didn't leave his fingerprints. He always wore a mask. He always had gloves on. This was an offender that did everything to prevent himself from being caught. - [Reporter] The golden state killer has been linked to at least 12 murders, 50 rapes and a string of burglaries throughout California. - All right, how's it going? - How you doing? - Good. - So we supply DNA sequencing solutions to the forensic laboratories that process crime scene DNA. At a crime scene, there's typically less than a nanogram of DNA left and it's usually degraded, right? So it breaks down. - Why is there so little? at a crime scene? A nanogram? - Yes. - That's insane.</p>
</details>

他于1986年停止犯罪并非偶然。1986年是第一起谋杀案通过DNA技术侦破的年份，我想他可能关注着这一点，并意识到：“我在这里留下了我的DNA，我不能再这样下去了。”记者报道：“调查员保罗·霍尔斯（Paul Holes）几十年来一直在追查金州杀手。”他无法预料到DNA技术的发展，那确实是他犯下的一个大错误，一个关键的错误。他把自己的DNA留在了加州各地。结果发现，在三起案件中，我有三份性侵犯证据包，我就是从那里获得了金州杀手在北加州的DNA。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">- Yes. - There's no accident that he stops in 1986. 1986 is when the first DNA case of a murder case is actually solved with DNA and he's, I think he's following that and he's saying, you know what, what I'm doing here, I'm leaving my DNA. I can't do this anymore. - [Reporter] Investigator Paul Holes tracked the golden state killer for decades. - He couldn't it account for DNA technology and that really was his big mistake. That was the critical mistake. He left his DNA all over California. And it turns out that in three of the cases, I had three sexual assault kits and that's where I got the golden state killer's DNA from Northern California.</p>
</details>

然而，仅拥有未知杀手的DNA还不足够。他们需要将其与已知样本进行匹配。1990年，联邦调查局（FBI）开始着手建立一个全国性的基因数据库，后来被称为“**联合DNA索引系统**”（CODIS, Combined DNA Index System）。它主要存储已定罪罪犯和相关人员的DNA图谱。你每个细胞中有23对染色体，一对来自母亲，一对来自父亲。在某些染色体的特定位置，有一些短的DNA片段会重复，比如AATG、AATG、AATG等等。这些被称为“**短串联重复序列**”（STRs, Short Tandem Repeats），不同的人重复次数不同。法医实验室通过计算每个位置的重复次数来生成STR图谱。最初，DNA上只有13个位置的STRs被计数，但在2017年扩展到了20个。这给我的感觉是信息量并不大。确实如此。但两个人所有位置的重复次数完全相同的几率极小。CODIS数据库现在包含超过1800万个STR图谱。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">- But having the unknown killer's DNA wasn't enough. They needed to match it to a known sample. In 1990, the FBI started work on what would become a national genetic database. It mainly stores DNA profiles from convicted criminals and persons of interest. It's called the combined DNA index system or CODIS for short. In each of your cells, there are 23 pairs of chromosomes, one from your mom and one from your dad. And at particular places on some chromosomes, there are short sections of DNA that repeat like A A T G, A A T G, A A T G, and so on. These are called short tandem repeats or STRs and different people have different numbers of repeats. Forensic labs produce STR profiles by counting up the number of repeats at each location. Initially, there were only 13 places on the DNA where STRs were counted, but in 2017 that was expanded to 20. It feels to me like that's not that much information. - It isn't. - But the chances of two people having the exact same number of repeats at all locations is incredibly small. The CODIS database now contains over 18 million STR profiles.</p>
</details>

金州杀手的DNA图谱自2001年以来一直被上传到由FBI运营的全国DNA数据库——CODIS中，并一直在搜索，但没有任何匹配。我们甚至进行了国际刑警组织（Interpol）的搜索，试图搜索其他国家的DNA数据库，心想也许他来自国外，所以这么长时间我们都未能识别他，但显然我们也没有得到任何匹配。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">- The golden state killer's DNA profile has been up at the national DNA database that's run by the FBI called CODIS since 2001 and has been searching ever since with no hits. We did Interpol searching, trying to search other country's DNA databases thinking well, maybe he came from a out of the country that's why after all this time we have yet to be able to identify him and obviously we didn't get any hits.</p>
</details>

### 基因组测序与消费者基因数据库的崛起

然而，基因测序技术正在迅速发展。女记者报道：“**人类基因组计划**（Genome project: 旨在测定人类DNA序列的科学项目）已经完成。自1986年以来，科学家们一直在绘制和测序人类基因组中包含的30亿个**核苷酸**（nucleotides: DNA和RNA的基本组成单位）。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">- But genetic sequencing technology was advancing rapidly. - [Female Reporter] The genome project was completed. Since 1986 scientists had been mapping and sequencing the three billion nucleotides contained in the human genome. It's anticipated that</p>
</details>

很快，私营公司开始直接向消费者提供基因检测服务，它们提供比CODIS数据库多得多的基因数据。我前往德克萨斯州休斯顿，参观了**Family Tree DNA**（一家提供基因检测服务并与执法部门合作的公司）总部。我们进入实验室，开始讨论样本的生命周期。这些样本是什么？它们是颊细胞。人们刮取脸颊内侧的细胞，盖上盖子，然后寄给我们。这就像一场机器人芭蕾。是的，为了提取DNA，我们需要去除DNA上的所有保护层，将其单独分离出来，以便进行检测。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">- Soon private companies began offering genetic tests directly to consumers and they provide far more genetic data than what's in the CODIS database. I traveled to Houston, Texas to visit Family Tree DNA headquarters. - We'll go in the lab and we'll start talking about the life cycle of a sample. There you go. - Thank you. These samples, what are they? - So they're cheek cells. They just scrape the inside of their cheek, they put a cap on it and they send it back to us. - It's like a robot ballet. - Yes, so for DNA extraction, we need to remove all of the protections that are on the DNA and just separate it by itself so we can do testing on that.</p>
</details>

这些检测不是查看你DNA上的20个位置，而是检查70万到80万个位置。**Family Finder**（Family Tree DNA提供的一种基因检测服务）检测基于一种称为“**微阵列**”（micro array: 用于检测大量基因或DNA序列的芯片）的技术，这就是微阵列的样子。每个方框代表一个人。我们可以在上面放置24个人。每个方框内大约有71万个DNA位置，我们正在测量并获取数据。71万个？是的，它们被称为**单核苷酸多态性**（SNPs, Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms）。等等，那是不是像71万个单独的碱基，比如ATGC？是的。对于每个人，你可以在单个芯片上测量24个？没错。人类基因组由30亿个碱基组成。所有人共享大约99.9%完全相同的DNA，这意味着平均而言，人与人之间只有大约300万个碱基不同。这些单个字母的变化被称为单核苷酸多态性（SNPs）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">- Instead of looking at 20 places on your DNA, these tests examined 700 to 800,000. - The Family Finder test is based on what's called a micro array and this is what a micro array looks like. Each one of those boxes is an individual. We can fit 24 individuals on here. And within that box is about 710,000 positions of your DNA, that we're measuring, we're getting data for. - 710,000? - Yes, and they're called snips. - So hang on, that's like 710,000 individual bases, like ATGC? - Yes. - For each person, you can measure 24 on that single chip? - Correct. - The human genome consists of three billion bases. All people share about 99.9% the exact same DNA, which means on average, only about three million basis differ from person to person. These individual letter changes are known as single nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs.</p>
</details>

那么，上面是不是有很多小段DNA呢？是的，我们有一小段DNA，它特定于一个SNP。所以它是基因组中一个我们知道可能存在差异的位置。好的。有没有一个简单的SNP例子能说明什么？实际上，蓝眼睛就是由一个碱基变化引起的。真的吗？是的。所以所有蓝眼睛的人都有这个字母变化？嗯哼。你现在可以看到它开始扫描第一个方框了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So on there, are there a whole bunch of like little pieces of DNA then? - Yes, so what we have is a short piece of DNA that is specific to one SNP. So it's one position in the genome where we know there can be a difference. - Okay. Is there any example of a simple SNP that confers some sort of? - Actually blue eyes is a single base change. - Really? - Yeah. - So everyone with blue eyes has this one letter change? - mm hmm - You can see now it's starting to scan the first box.</p>
</details>

你71万个SNPs的结果可以告诉你你的地理血统或可能的健康状况，但它们也可以量化你与他人的亲缘关系。生孩子就像把两副扑克牌混在一起。结果的牌组会与每个父母共享大约一半的牌，并且会有很长的牌序与父母的牌序完全匹配。现在，如果这个牌组有了孩子，那么它的后代将只与每个祖父母共享大约四分之一的牌，并且相同牌的片段会更短，DNA也是如此。你与某人的亲缘关系越近，你共享的DNA就越多，相同DNA的片段就越长。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The results of your 710,000 SNPs can tell you about your geographic ancestry or possible medical conditions, but they can also quantify how related you are to someone else. The genetics of having a kid are a bit like cutting two decks of cards together. The resulting deck will share about half its cards with each parent and there'll be long sequences of cards which match identically sequences in each parent. Now, if this deck has a kid, well then its offspring will share only about a quarter of its cards with each grandparent and the sections of identical cards will be shorter, and this is how it works with DNA.</p>
</details>

但要比较两个人的DNA，你不需要读取每一个字母。SNPs散布在DNA中，大约每2000个碱基就有一个。所以如果你发现SNPs匹配的长片段，你可以确信中间的DNA也是相同的。通过比较散布在DNA中的数十万个SNPs，你可以看到这些相同片段的起始和终止位置，从而得知共享的总DNA量。所有蓝色高亮的部分都是我共享DNA的地方。和你父亲？和我父亲，这正是你所期望的，因为我应该和他共享所有DNA，因为他给了我50%的DNA。所以这是我的二表兄或三表兄。我不知道这个人是谁。你可以在这里看到，我们与我父亲的关系肯定没有那么近，因为蓝色区域是染色体上我们共享DNA的唯一区域。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The more closely you're related to someone, the more DNA you share and the longer the blocks of identical DNA are. But to compare the DNA of two people, you don't need to read every letter. The snips are sprinkled throughout the DNA roughly every 2000 bases. So if you find long sections where the snips match up, you can bet that the DNA in between is identical too by comparing hundreds of thousands of snips sprinkled throughout the DNA, you can see where these identical blocks start and stop and so how much total DNA is shared. - Everywhere that is highlighted in blue is where I share DNA. - With your father? - With my father which is exactly what you expect because I should share DNA with him everywhere because he gave me 50% of my DNA. So this is a second to third cousin. I have no idea who this person is. And you can see here, we are definitely not as closely related as me and my dad because where the blue is, those are the only regions of the chromosome where we share DNA.</p>
</details>

我们都知道这些基因检测可以帮助识别我们的亲属，但问题是，执法部门的数据库也能做到同样的事情吗？你能利用CODIS数据库识别家庭成员吗？可以，但它仅限于一级和二级亲属。这意味着如果我在寻找金州杀手，我只能寻找他的父亲、兄弟或儿子。我们反复尝试，但没有任何匹配。为什么限制如此之大？因为你只有23个基因座。如果你想进行适当的亲缘关系分析，你需要在基因组上评估更多的点，才能看出你们的真实亲缘关系。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">- We all know that these genetic tests can help identify our relatives but the question is, can you do the same thing with law enforcement databases? Can you identify family members using the CODIS database? - You can and it's only limited to really first order and second order relatives. - That means if I'm looking for the golden state killer, I'm looking for either his father, his brother or his son. We did that over and over again with no hits. - Why is it so limited? - Because you've only got 23 loci. If you wanna do proper kinship analysis, you need to have more points assessed on that genome to see how related you really are.</p>
</details>

我们知道答案就在一扇紧锁的门后，答案就在**23andMe**（一家提供个人基因检测服务的公司）和**Ancestry.com**（一家提供家谱和基因检测服务的公司）的紧锁门后。我们知道他们拥有数百万份基因图谱。我猜，他的某个远房表亲可能就在里面。当然。这很难处理。你知道，答案就在这扇紧锁的门后。执法部门不允许搜索23andMe和Ancestry.com的数据库，但幸运的是，调查人员还有另一种方法。一个名为**GEDmatch**（一个允许用户上传基因数据并寻找亲属的独立网站）的独立网站已经建立，允许人们与亲属建立联系。你可以上传任何大型基因检测公司的原始数据，并搜索匹配项。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">- We know the answer is behind a locked door and the answer is behind the locked door of 23andMe and Ancestry.com. We know that they have millions of profiles. Somebody related to him, a second cousin I would guess, would be in there. - Sure. - And that was very hard to deal with. You know, that the answer is there behind this locked door. - Law enforcement is not allowed to search the databases of 23andMe and Ancestry.com but luckily for investigators, there was another way. An independent website called GEDmatch had been set up to allow people to connect with relatives. You can upload the raw data from any of the big genetic testing companies and search for matches.</p>
</details>

### 基因家谱学：金州杀手案的突破

当我们最初搜索GEDmatch数据库时，我们最好的匹配是三表亲，这意味着他们共享大约1%的DNA。共享的DNA非常少，但这只是一个起始数据点。理论上，通过选取多个共享DNA的个体，并利用传统**家谱学**（genealogy: 研究家族历史和血缘关系）和公共来源文件，如人口普查记录、讣告、报纸文章和findagrave.com等，建立他们的家谱，直到找到金州杀手的两位亲属，让他们的家谱交叉，你就会发现他们共享曾曾祖父母。理论上，金州杀手就是这些曾曾祖父母的后代。所以一旦我确定了那个共同祖先，现在就是要识别这些曾曾祖父母的所有后代，这变成了一个巨大的过程。19世纪40年代的人通常会有15个孩子。你必须识别这些孩子中的每一个，然后是他们所有的孩子，再然后是他们所有的孩子。所以现在我们有了一个呈指数级增长的家谱。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">- So when we initially search the GEDmatch database, our best hits come back at third cousins which means they shared you know, our top hit, I think shared about 1% of the DNA. It's very little DNA that's shared but that's a starting data point. And theoretically, by taking multiple of these individuals that share DNA and building their family trees using traditional genealogy and public source documents like census records and obituaries and newspaper articles and findagrave.com, you build this family tree back until you get two of these relatives of the golden state killer, you get them to intersect where now you see, oh, they've got, they share great-great grandparents together. Theoretically the golden state killer is a descendant from those same great-great grandparents. So once I identify that common ancestor, it's now identifying every single descendant from those great-great grandparents and this becomes a huge process. People in the 1840s would typically have 15 kids. You have to identify each of those kids and then all of their children and then all of their children. So now we have this exponentially growing family tree.</p>
</details>

那个家谱有多大？我想我们的家谱里有超过1000个人，但我们对罪犯了解很多。我们确信他出生于1940年至1960年之间。我们知道他是白人男性。我们知道他身高在5英尺8英寸到5英尺10英寸之间。你知道，他在加州。1976年在萨克拉门托，80年代在南加州。我们基本上将范围缩小到大约五名男性，然后就是调查。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">- How wide did that tree get? - I think we had over 1000 individuals in that family tree but we knew a lot about our offender. We were confident he was born between 1940 and 1960. We knew he was a white male. We knew he was 5'8" to 5'10". You know, he's in California. He's up in Sacramento in 1976. He's in Southern California in the '80s and we basically narrowed it down to about five males and then it's just investigations.</p>
</details>

今年春天，警方锁定了嫌疑人，跟踪他到萨克拉门托地区的一家**Hobby Lobby**（一家工艺品零售连锁店）商店，并从他的车门把手上提取了DNA样本。几天后，调查人员从一个废弃的纸巾中又提取了另一个DNA样本，该样本与犯罪现场留下的DNA证据匹配。加州调查人员表示，DNA证据将他们引向了美国最臭名昭著的连环杀手之一。前警官**约瑟夫·詹姆斯·迪安吉洛**（Joseph James DeAngelo）昨天被捕，他被认为是所谓的金州杀手。

<details>

<p class="english-text">- With a suspect at their fingertips, this spring, they followed him to a Sacramento area Hobby Lobby store and took a DNA sample from his car door handle. Days later, investigators recovered another DNA sample from one discarded tissue which registered a match to DNA evidence left at one of the crime scenes. - Investigators in California say DNA evidence led them to one of the country's most notorious serial killers. Former police officer Joseph James DeAngelo was arrested yesterday and he is believed to be the so-called golden state killer.</p>
</details>

44年来，无数调查人员为此努力，但都未能侦破此案。在四个半月内，一个六人团队就查明了金州杀手是谁，那就是约瑟夫·迪安吉洛。金州杀手被确认后，闸门大开，我们每周不仅看到单个杀手，而且是多个杀手，每周都有20世纪70年代和80年代的连环杀手案件被识别出来。因为现在已经有70多起案件通过这种方式解决了，而且他们继续以相当规律的速度解决案件。我想这个速度只会增加。是的，而且还会更多，因为它正在发挥作用，我们将帮助找到这些人。

<p class="english-text">- For 44 years, countless investigators have worked it and have failed to solve it.

</details>

### 基因隐私与公共安全：一场范式转变

但可怕的是，在美国，有10万起带有DNA证据的**悬案谋杀案**（cold case murders: 未侦破的谋杀案）。悬案数量更多，但带有DNA证据的估计有10万起。大约有65万起性侵犯悬案带有DNA。带有DNA？这似乎是一个真正的**范式转变**（paradigm shift: 根本性的观念或方法改变）。确实如此。多个执法机构表示，这是自指纹技术采用以来，他们拥有的最具革命性的工具。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">- But the scary thing is in the US, you have 100,000 cold case murders with DNA. You have more cold cases but the ones with DNA is estimated about 100,000 There's roughly about 650,000 sexual assaults, cold cases with DNA. - With DNA? It seems like a real paradigm shift. - It is. Multiple law enforcement agencies has said that this is the most revolutionary tool they've had since the adoption of the fingerprint.</p>
</details>

传统的DNA检测需要从实际个体那里获取样本。这是一种一对一的过程。因此，那些犯下罪行但未被捕的罪犯，他们过着自己的生活，心想：“我的DNA从未被采集过。我可能在1975年犯下的案件中留下了DNA，但他们从未获得我的DNA，他们不会找到我。”但现在我们不必依赖这一点了。与罪犯有远亲关系的人已经将他们的DNA上传到数据库中，他们必须开始感到紧张，因为这超出了他们的控制范围。他们无法控制一个三表亲或那个三表亲正在做什么。所以他们开始感到紧张。我一直在想，有多少这样的人意识到，执法部门最终会因为某个三表亲将他们的DNA上传到数据库而敲响他们的门？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">- With traditional DNA, it required getting a sample from the actual individual. It's a one-to-one type of process. And so these offenders who let's say they have committed crimes and haven't been caught and they're just living their life and they're thinking, well, my DNA has never been taken from me. I may have left DNA in the case that I committed back in 1975, but they've never gotten my DNA, they won't find me. But now we don't have to rely upon that. Somebody distantly related to that offender has put their DNA into a database and they have to start getting nervous because that's outside of their control. They can't account for a third cousin or what that third cousin is doing. And so they start getting nervous. And I've kind of wondered how many of these individuals recognize that law enforcement is eventually gonna be knocking on their door as a result of a third cousin putting their DNA in the database?</p>
</details>

每个将信息上传到数据库的人，都会揭示周围数百人的身份：父母、兄弟姐妹、叔叔阿姨和表亲。Ancestry DNA的一项研究发现，英国普通人平均有175个三表亲，而且这还不止于此。一个人的DNA将被数百个尚未出生的人共享：子女、孙子女、侄子侄女和远房表亲。实际上，每个人与过去和未来近1000人共享可识别的DNA。因此，不需要很多人上传数据就能揭示一个国家所有居民的身份。早在2018年，一项研究发现，仅使用一个包含130万人的现有数据库，他们就能识别60%的欧洲裔美国人。他们估计，如果数据库包含仅2%的人口，99%的案件中都能找到三表亲或更近的匹配。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">- Each person who uploads their information to a database illuminates the identities of hundreds of other people around them, parents, siblings, aunts, and uncles and cousins. A study by ancestry DNA found the average person in the UK has 175 third cousins and it doesn't stop there. The DNA in one person will be shared by hundreds of people yet to be born. Children, grandchildren, nieces, and nephews, and cousins once or twice removed. Realistically, each person shares identifiable DNA with nearly 1000 people past and future. So it doesn't take many people uploading their data to reveal the identities of everyone living in a country. Back in 2018, a study found that using an existing database of just 1.3 million people, they could identify 60% of all Americans of European descent. And they estimated with a database containing just 2% of the population, you could find a third cousin or closer match in 99% of cases.</p>

DNA存储是我们拥有的独一无二的东西。如果你往里面看，这里是零下20摄氏度。这能让DNA保存很长时间吗？我们这里有大约15年历史的DNA样本。里面存储了多少样本？刚刚超过200万份。哇。是的。所以容量刚刚超过200万份。200万人的DNA存储在这个小房间里？没错。哇。到2021年，全球已有超过3000万人进行了直接面向消费者的基因检测，其中大部分是通过Ancestry和23andMe进行的，这两家公司目前不与执法部门合作，但**Family Tree DNA**（一家提供基因检测服务并与执法部门合作的公司）会合作。

<p class="english-text">- DNA storage is one of the things that we have that is really unlike anything else. If you look inside, this is at minus 20 degrees Celsius. - That keeps the DNA good for a long time? - We have DNA samples in here that are probably about 15 years old. - How many samples are stored in there? - Just over 2 million. - Wow. - Yeah. So the capacity is just over 2 million. - 2 million people's DNA stored in this one small room? - Correct. - Wow. By 2021, over 30 million people worldwide have taken a direct consumer genetic test, the majority of which are through Ancestry and 23andMe, which do not currently work with law enforcement but Family Tree DNA does.</p>

如果你问美国人，我们是否应该建立一个全国性的数据库，每个人都被记录在案？通过他们的DNA？是的，通过他们的DNA和姓名，大多数美国人会感到有些不舒服，或者可能非常不舒服。但我们正在不知不觉中走向那种情景。有些人担心隐私问题。如果有人选择或决定不希望自己的检测结果用于执法匹配，他们可以自行退出。我确实担心基因信息被用于歧视他人。我最担心的是健康保险。我担心如果你拥有某人的DNA图谱，并且某些法律生效，它落入坏人之手，他们会说这个人有某种倾向，他们正走向帕金森氏症，他们正走向这个，走向那个，然后保费飙升。这是我看到最大的隐私问题。

<p class="english-text">- If you ask Americans, should we have a national database where everyone's logged in it? - As their DNA? - Yeah by their DNA and their name, most Americans will be somewhat uncomfortable or potentially very uncomfortable with that. But we're kind of sleepwalking into that scenario. - There are some people who are concerned with privacy. If anyone chooses or decides that they do not want their results to be used for law enforcement matching, they can remove themselves from that. - I do worry about genetic information being used to discriminate against someone. - My biggest thing is health insurance. I worry about if you have somebody's DNA profile and some laws enacted, it gets in the wrong hands and they say that this person has a proclivity, they're headed towards Parkinson's, they're headed towards this, headed towards that and then rates skyrocket. That's the biggest place that I see as a privacy concern.</p>

一旦你的基因信息泄露出去，它就永远在那里了。它不像信用卡，你可以换一张新的。是的，你正在放弃一些你不知道它能做什么的东西。嗯，是的，我们的信息首先就不完全属于我们自己。没错。我们的信息是共享的。是的，与你的亲属共享。是的。尽管你可能反对这种事情，但如果他们已经做了，那么在某种程度上，你的信息也已经公开了。

Yeah you're giving away something that you don't know what it can do. - Well, yeah our information isn't ours in the first place. - Right. - Our information is shared. - Yes with your relatives. - Yes. - And although you may be adverse to this sort of thing, if they've already done it, if it, you know, in a way you're out there.</p>

在当今社会，你明显可以看到两个阵营。有些人非常乐意让自己的基因组可供执法部门搜索，而另一些人则完全不舒服，这没关系。当然，问题是那些不想让自己的DNA可搜索的人，他们的DNA可能会被亲属无意中上传。你明白我的意思吗？所以，如果我不想让我的DNA可供执法部门搜索，但我的姐姐上传了她的DNA，是的，这几乎和我自己上传一样。

<p class="english-text">- In society today, you have very clearly had two camps. There are those that are very comfortable having their genome available to be able to be searched for law enforcement purposes and there are others that are not comfortable at all and that's okay. - The problem is of course, those people who don't want theirs to be searchable could have their DNA uploaded inadvertently by their relatives. Do you know what I mean? So like, if I don't want my DNA to be searchable by law enforcement but my sister uploads hers, - Yes. - It's almost as good as me doing it myself.</p>

目前，Family Tree DNA的政策是，我们只在特定情况下接受执法部门的样本。必须是性侵犯、遗骸识别、从凶杀现场提取的DNA。我们还处理儿童绑架案件。所以，如果一个孩子被绑架，并且有DNA证据，我们将处理DNA，以便他们能够找出绑架者是谁。这些是我们唯一接受的案件。明白了。不幸的是，现在GEDmatch已经关闭了开关，GEDmatch实际上已经表示，你并非必须在未经选择加入的情况下被搜索信息。没错。GEDmatch的这个决定是金州杀手案的直接结果吗？不，不是。不。想讲讲这个故事吗？你知道，这与犹他州的一个案件有关。

<p class="english-text">- Right now, Family Tree DNA's policy is we only accept samples from law enforcement under certain circumstances. It has to be a sexual assault, identification of remains, DNA recovered from the scene of a homicide. And we also do child abductions. So if there's a child that's kidnapped and there's DNA evidence, we will process the DNA so that they can try to find out who the abductor is. Those are the only cases that we will accept. - Got it. - Unfortunately now GEDmatch has flipped off the switch and GEDmatch has actually said that you don't all have to have your information searched without opting in. - Right. - Was that decision by GEDmatch a direct result of this golden state killer case? - No, it wasn't. - No. - Wanna tell the story? - You know, it had to do with a Utah case.</p>

一名老年妇女在教堂里弹奏风琴。有一个人闯入并袭击了她。但那不是性侵犯，而是一起严重的罪行。我想他相信自己试图勒死她，并以为她已经死了就离开了。我相信警方联系了GEDmatch，因为他们担心他会再次犯罪。但GEDmatch的服务条款规定，他们只会协助强奸或凶杀案的执法。她的问题是她没有死。因为如果她死了呢？如果她死了，那就会符合条件，然后他们就会上传样本，因为它符合服务条款和所有规定。那后来发生了什么？他们没有受理那个案件吗？他们受理了。他们随后通过在GEDmatch上进行的搜索抓住了那个人。

I believe he thought that she was obviously dead and left. The police I believe approached GEDmatch because that they were concerned that he was going to recommit other crimes. - But GEDmatch's terms of service said they would only help law enforcement in cases of rape or homicide. - Her problem was that she didn't die. - 'Cause if she died then? - If she died it would have fit the conditions and then they would have uploaded the sample because it met the terms of service and everything. - So what happened? They didn't take that case? - They did. - They subsequently caught the individual from that search that they performed on GEDmatch.</p>

但家谱界的人们对此感到非常激动，认为这超出了这个工具的用途，他们最终对GEDmatch施加了很大压力。他们关闭了开关，因为他们感到恐慌。但归根结底，这是违反服务条款的。我认为最终导致了一个好结果。所有人都被清零，然后所有人都可以重新登录。随后，GEDmatch被出售给了**Verogen**（一家专注于法医基因组学的公司）。我可以告诉你，今天的新用户注册GEDmatch时，大约73%的人选择允许执法部门搜索。我们对此感到非常满意。是的，我的意思是，这是一个很高的数字。这是一个很高的数字。这表明人们渴望那种清白。

<p class="english-text">- But people within the genealogy world kinda got their passions and flame saying that is stepping outside of what this tool should be used for and they ended up putting a lot of pressure on GEDmatch. - They flipped the switch because they got freaked out. - But at the end of the day, it was a violation of terms of service. And I think ultimately led to a good thing. Everybody got zeroed out and then everybody gets to sign back in. - Subsequently GEDmatch was sold to Verogen. - I can tell you a new user today when they sign up for GEDmatch, about 73% of them are signing up to allow law enforcement to search. We're pretty happy with that. - Yeah I mean, that's, it's a high number. - It's a high number. - And it suggests that people want that innocence.</p>

你现在有多少二表亲或三表亲？你明白我的意思吗？你并不认识他们中的很多人。在不知不觉中，你正在帮助司法公正。你正在帮助受害者的家人获得一点平静，不是了结，而是一点平静，为什么不呢？他们得到了一个答案。部分地，你可以提出一个论点，如果你想成为一个帮助抓捕罪犯的积极分子，你能做的最好的事情之一就是鼓励你认识的每个人都进行检测并上传到数据库中。没错，你知道，有数百万人已经在不与执法部门合作的其他公司进行了检测。如果他们想提供帮助，他们所要做的就是下载他们的原始数据，然后免费上传到我们的数据库中。

我绝对相信一个人的隐私权。但我也绝对相信我们有权不被谋杀或性侵犯，或者不遭受针对我们的暴力犯罪。必须有一个平等的平衡。我的隐私被侵犯了，因为一个三表亲被识别出来，与一位母亲谈论她的女儿被谋杀，这个天平的倾斜程度是如此之大。我们现在正处于一个技术在许多方面已经超越法律的阶段。我坚信，最终这个工具及其所有相关问题可能会提交给国家最高法院，并会做出裁决。我的底线信息是，如果你要做出决定，如果要有法律限制执法部门使用它，请确保你正在做出知情决定，而不是基于DNA、遗传学和执法部门的假设，因为它真的不是你想象的那样。

<p class="english-text">- I absolutely believe in a person's right to privacy. But I also absolutely believe we have a right not to get murdered or sexually assaulted or it will be part having violent crimes committed against us. There has to be an equal balance. - That scale of my privacy has been taken because of a third cousin has been identified versus a mother who's talking about her daughter has been murdered, that scale is way the hell like this. - We're at a point now where in many ways technology has kind of outstripped where the laws are. I truly believe that ultimately this tool and the, all the concerns with it will probably end up in front of the nation Supreme Court and there will be a decision. My bottom line message, if you're gonna make a decision, if there's gonna be laws restricting law enforcement to use it, make sure that you're making an informed decision and not assuming what it is based on its DNA and genetics and law enforcement because it really isn't what you think it is.</p>

我必须让数百万人满意，以便我能够访问数百万、数亿人的身份信息，从某种意义上说。从某种意义上说，对吧？数百万，数亿人。没错。这是一个相当有选择性的样本。这些人愿意放弃他们的信息。放弃，是的。为了找到他们的祖先。是的。可能还有许多人是坚定的隐私主义者，但他们无权决定是否可以通过那个人被搜索到。没错，那是你做出的选择。那是你没有做出的选择。这是一个你没有做出的选择，但这也是我们作为一个社会必须做出的选择，那就是如何平衡。在我看来，总会有赢家和输家，对吧？我不想在这里用“输家”这个词的负面含义，但最终的决定，在我看来，你必须在公共安全和公共隐私之间取得平衡。

### 科技与法律的未来：平衡隐私与正义

**DuckDuckGo**（一个注重隐私的搜索引擎）好用吗？我用它。我有点偏执。所以它应该不会像其他搜索引擎那样追踪你，我想。是的。我制作这个视频已经两年了，所以我要非常感谢**Brilliant**（一个提供STEM概念互动学习课程的网站/应用程序）的赞助。我感谢他们愿意支持我处理复杂而重要的故事。Brilliant是一个网站，一个应用程序，它以互动和深入的方式教授你各种STEM概念。如果你想了解更多关于DNA或通过演绎推理解决谜团的知识，我推荐他们的计算生物学和逻辑学课程。看看这个互动逻辑谜题。你必须弄清楚灯是开着还是关着，要知道有些角色可能会对你撒谎。Brilliant不会直接告诉你答案，而是让你尝试不同的配置，自己发现答案。

So it's supposed to not track you as much I guess, but yeah. - I have been working on this video for a couple of years so I really wanna thank Brilliant for sponsoring it. I appreciate their willingness to support me tackling complex and important stories. Brilliant is a website, an app that teaches you all kinds of stem concepts in an interactive and in-depth way, if you wanna learn more about DNA or solving mysteries with deductive reasoning, I would recommend their courses on computational biology and logic. Check out this interactive logic puzzle. You have to figure out if the light is on or off, knowing that some of the characters may be lying to you. And instead of just telling you the solution, Brilliant allows you to try different configurations and discover the answer for yourself.</p>
