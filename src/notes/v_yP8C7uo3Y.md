### 引言：重新审视我们所知的罗马文化

有时候，你会发现仅仅是重新思考那些你早已熟知但从未真正审视过的罗马文化，就会对你的看法产生巨大影响。我们对罗马的印象在某种程度上都建立在现代电影之上。虽然我认为那些电影在某些方面相当令人印象深刻，但它们在一些事情上却错得离谱。

<p class="english-text">Sometimes, you find that just rethinking things about Roman culture that you've known about for ages but never really interrogated makes a huge difference. Everyone's image of that is in some way based on modern movies. In some ways, I think those were rather impressive, but they got some things terribly wrong.</p>
</details>

我认为凯旋仪式的主要功能是让罗马人思考何为罗马人，但它还有另一面，那就是向敌人灌输恐惧。有些罗马人的形象和成就，无论好坏，都被大书特书，以至于我们认为，没有他们，世界就不会是今天的样子。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think the main function of the triumph is for Romans to think about what it is to be Roman, but it has another side to it, which is, it puts fear into the enemy. There are Romans whose image and whose achievements for good or bad are so written up that we think of them as people without whom the world would not now be like it is.</p>
</details>

我认为译者们通过各种强调手法，帮助我们以新的方式看待一些难题。你无法在翻译《奥德赛》的同时不解读《奥德赛》，也无法不以某种方式与它进行现代对话。我是玛丽·比尔德，我研究古罗马已有50年，并写了许多关于他们的书。我刚开始一个新的播客，名为《速成经典》(Instant Classics)，内容是关于希腊和罗马的。

<p class="english-text">I think there are all kinds of emphases that translators come in and help us see some of the difficulties in a new way. You cannot translate "The Odyssey" without interpreting "The Odyssey," and without, in some way, having a modern conversation with it. I'm Mary Beard, and I've worked on the Ancient Romans for 50 years, and I've written quite a lot of books about them. I've just started a new podcast called "Instant Classics," which is about Greece and Rome.</p>

### 戳破好莱坞的白色滤镜：真实的罗马社会

如今我们很难想象古罗马的真实景象，因为我们不可避免地会通过电影和电视来看待它，而在这些作品中，罗马总是显得宏伟而洁白。它的建筑是白色的，艺术品是白色的，连人民也是白色的。但我们确知的一件事是，古罗马是一个多元文化、国际化的社会。你只需读一点罗马文学，就会发现这座城市是来自西方世界各地乃至非洲人民的家园。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's hard to picture ancient Rome now, because we see it inevitably through film and through television where it's very grand, it's very white, its architecture is white, its art is white, and its people are white. One thing we know about Ancient Rome is that it was a multicultural, cosmopolitan society. You only have to read a bit of Roman literature to discover that the city is a home to people from everywhere in the western world and from Africa too.</p>
</details>

我们倾向于把古罗马人想象成有点像1950年代拘谨的英国人；握手、举止有些浮夸。我敢肯定他们中有些人确实如此，但我记得当我发现两个罗马男人之间正常的问候方式是互相亲吻，而不是握手时，我感到非常惊讶。事实上，在公元1世纪的一次事件中，皇帝不得不禁止这种做法，因为当时正流行一种非常讨厌的传染性疱疹，他想阻止其传播。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We tend to picture ancient Romans as being a bit like rather formal Brits from the 1950s; shaking hands and being a bit pompous. I'm sure some of them were, but I remember being very surprised when I discovered that the normal form of greeting between two Roman men was to kiss each other, not to clasp a hand. And in fact, on one occasion in the 1st century CE, the emperor had to ban the practice because there was a very nasty bout of infectious herpes going around, and he wanted to stop it.</p>
</details>

### 角斗士比赛的真相：更像歌剧而非足球赛

关于角斗士比赛，有很多迷思需要我们去打破，尤其是在罗马市中心的**罗马斗兽场**（English Full Name: Colosseum，位于罗马市中心的大型椭圆形竞技场，主要用于角斗士比赛和野兽狩猎等公共表演）里举行的那些。我想每个人的印象在某种程度上都基于现代电影，比如《角斗士》第一部和第二部。在某些方面，我认为这些电影相当令人印象深刻，但它们在一些事情上错得离谱。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There's a lot of myths that you need to bust about the gladiatorial games, particularly in the center of Rome in the Colosseum. I think everyone's image of that is in some way based on modern movies on "Gladiator I," "Gladiator II." In some ways, I think those were rather impressive, but they got some things terribly wrong.</p>
</details>

对我来说，它们犯下的最大错误在于对观众行为的想象。我们确实倾向于认为观众一定会陷入疯狂，他们去那里是为了满足嗜血的欲望，他们会爆发出激情、愤怒，大喊“杀了他”或“饶了他”之类的话。然而，我们能从罗马史料中了解到的关于观众的一切都表明，实际情况比你在电影里看到的任何场景都要克制得多。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I think the thing that, for me, the biggest mistake they made is to imagine how the audience behaved. We do tend to think that somehow the audience must have gone wild, they were there because they wanted blood lust, they were erupting in passion, in anger, saying "Kill him," or "Save him," or whatever. Everything that we can tell about the audience from Roman sources themselves suggests that actually it was much more controlled than anything you see are in the movies.</p>
</details>

首先，观众席是完全按性别隔离的，女性与男性分开坐。不仅如此，每个人都穿着相当正式的服装，你必须穿**托加袍**（English Full Name: toga，古罗马男性公民的官方服装，是一块巨大的布料，在官方场合穿着）才能入场。托加袍是罗马男性的官方服饰，但只有在出席正式活动时才会穿，你不会穿着它去晚上的本地酒吧。而去观看角斗士比赛，这本身就是一种官方活动，所以你必须穿上你的托加袍。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">For start, it was completely sex-segregated, the women sat separately from the men. But more than that, everybody came dressed quite posh, you had to wear a toga to go. Now a toga is the official Roman dress for Roman men, but it's worn when you are doing something official, you don't wear it to the local bar in the evening. To go to the gladiatorial games, that was kind of official, and you had to wear your toga.</p>
</details>

每个人的座位不仅按性别分开，还按社会等级排列。根据法律，元老院成员，即罗马社会的最高阶层，坐在前排，然后是次一级的人坐在他们后面，直到最后排，那里坐着奴隶和妇女。我认为我们必须彻底颠覆那种认为现场是疯狂、“失控”的印象。我想，那场面可能更像一个歌剧之夜，而不是一场足球比赛。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Everybody sat not just segregated by sex, but they sat in rank order. Senators by law, the top rank of Roman society, on the front rows, and then the next rank down just above them, until you got to the very back where you found the slaves and the women. Now I think that we somehow have to just overturn our sense that it was kind of mad, "losing control" going on. I think it was probably more like an evening at the opera than an evening at a football match.</p>
</details>

如果你想看到罗马人真正疯狂的场面，那种成千上万人的疯狂，那么你应该去关注战车比赛，而不是角斗士格斗。在罗马，最大、最著名、最精致的战车赛场是所谓的**马克西穆斯竞技场**（English Full Name: Circus Maximus，古罗马最大、最著名的战车赛场）。我们只能估计，无法确定，它大概能容纳大约二十五万人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If you want to see the Romans going wild, you know, in very, very large numbers, then what you should be doing is thinking about the chariot racing, not the gladiatorial combat. Now in Rome, the biggest, most famous, most elaborate stadium for chariot racing was the so-called Circus Maximus, the biggest circus. Now that held probably, we have to estimate this, we can't be certain, it held something like quarter of a million people, 250,000.</p>
</details>

现在，把它和罗马斗兽场比较一下，斗兽场相对较小，最大容量为五万人。而二十五万人的容量，现代世界没有一个体育场有那么大。最大的足球场大概接近十五万人，所以马克西穆斯竞技场真的非常巨大。在那里，我们确实能感觉到气氛要随意得多。首先，观众是混合的，男女似乎坐在一起。那里有大量的赌博活动，我们几乎没有任何证据表明斗兽场里有赌博，但在马克西穆斯竞技场，你肯定可以对比赛下注。那是一个你真正可以放松的地方，与斗兽场那种实际上更为沉静的氛围截然不同。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, compare that to the Colosseum, Colosseum's relatively small at 50,000 maximum capacity. Now if you go to 250,000, there isn't a stadium in the modern world that is that big. The biggest football stadium is something like pushing 150,000, so it's really vast. And there, we do get a sense that it was much less well-behaved, that, for a start, the crowd was mixed, women and men seemed to have sat together, there was loads of betting going on, we have no evidence at all really of any betting in the Colosseum, but you sure bet on the races in the Circus Maximus. And it was a place where you really did let your hair down, unlike the much more sedate, actually, atmosphere of the Colosseum.</p>
</details>

问题在于，罗马斗兽场幸存了下来，并极大地固化了我们对罗马标志性建筑的看法。可悲的是，最初更为奢华的马克西穆斯竞技场被掠夺用作建筑材料等等。恐怕你现在去参观它，并不会觉得有多么宏伟，你需要发挥大量的想象力。但那里才是罗马体育真正激动人心的地方。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, the trouble is, the Colosseum survives and has very much fixed our view of, you know, the iconic building of Rome. Sadly, the Circus Maximus, which was much more lavish originally that was looted for building material, et cetera, et cetera. And I'm afraid if you go to visit it now, it isn't exactly impressive, you have to do a lot of work with the imagination. But that is where the real Roman excitement of sport happened.</p>
</details>

### 着装与发型：奴隶制在日常生活中的无形之手

有时候，你会发现仅仅是重新思考那些你早已熟知但从未真正审视过的罗马文化，就会对你如何看待罗马人产生巨大影响。托加袍，罗马男性公民的官方服饰，就是其中之一。人们已经开始真正认识到的一点是，托加袍非常巨大，它是一块巨大的布料，包裹在身上作为外衣。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Sometimes you find that just rethinking things about Roman culture that you've known about for ages but never really interrogated makes a huge difference to how you think about the Romans. The toga, the official dress of the Roman male citizen, is one of those things. One thing that people have really begun to see the significance of is that the toga is vast, it's a vast piece of cloth which is wrapped around you to make it an outer garment.</p>
</details>

问题在于，你绝对不可能自己穿上托加袍，你需要有人帮忙。好吧，这听起来没什么，但我认为这会引出其他结论。它至少提醒了我们服务和奴役在罗马社会中的作用。这是一种需要奴隶帮助你穿衣的文化。这就是奴隶社会的真正含义。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, it is absolutely impossible to put a toga on yourself, you need someone to help you. Well, fine, but I think that leads on to other conclusions. It's a reminder at the very least of the role of service and servitude in Roman society. This was a culture in which you needed slaves to help you get dressed. That's what being a slave society really means.</p>
</details>

当你观察女性的发型时，你会发现对奴隶制的依赖性也同样显现出来。我们现在看到的罗马精英女性雕像，她们有着精致的发髻，几乎无法想象仅用发辫和一些发夹就能重现。我认为，如果你尝试去做，就会清楚地发现，那些发型是逐字逐句“缝”在你头上的。这又是一个例子，让你看到罗马精英阶层在日常小事上，比如做头发，对奴隶制和奴隶的绝对依赖。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You can see when you look, for example, at women's hairdressing, that something very similar about the dependence on slavery comes across, and the statues that we see of Roman elite women now with their elaborate top knots, they're almost impossible to imagine recreating them with just braids and some pins. And what's clear I think if you try to do it is that those are hairstyles which are literally stitched onto you. Now that's another case of where you see the absolute dependence of the Roman elite on slavery and slaves, just doing your hair.</p>
</details>

### 考古发现中的生活片段：庞贝与罗马边疆

如果我们想获得对罗马生活最深刻的洞见，那么我们应该去**庞贝**（English Full Name: Pompeii）和**赫库兰尼姆**（English Full Name: Herculaneum），这两座在公元79年因维苏威火山爆发而被摧毁的城镇。不过，我认为我们必须小心，不要像人们常说的那样，想象庞贝和赫库兰尼姆是时间被冻结的城镇。它们并没有被冻结在时间里，两个城市的居民都有相当多的预警，知道有可怕的事情要发生，他们收拾了一些东西，然后逃走了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If we want the best insight we can possibly get into Roman life, then we go to Pompeii and Herculaneum towns destroyed by the eruption of Vesuvius in 79 CE. Now, I think we have to be a bit careful about imagining, as people often claim that Pompeii and Herculaneum are towns that were somehow frozen in time. They weren't frozen in time, the population of both cities had quite a lot of notice that something nasty was going to happen, they packed up a bit, and, people, they just escaped.</p>
</details>

尽管如此，你从这些城镇中获得的一些生活片段，是在别处无法复原的。我最喜欢的，我想，是最近发现的一个作坊，嗯，其实是一座正在重新装修的房子。那些愚蠢或过于乐观的油漆工显然在火山爆发的早晨还在那里工作。你可以看到他们的小罐子，可以看到他们如何整理水桶，可以看到脚手架是如何工作的。你可以想象，在某个时刻他们拔腿就跑，但恐怕，如果他们拖到那么晚，是无法活着出去的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All the same, there are some vignettes you get from those towns that are just irrecoverable elsewhere. My favorite I think is relatively recently discovered workshop, well, it's a house really which is undergoing redecoration. And the foolish or the over-optimistic painters were obviously still working there on the morning of the eruption. You can see their little pots, you can see how they've organized their buckets, you can see how the scaffolding was working. You can imagine that at a certain point they ran for it, and I'm afraid, I don't think if they'd left it that long, they were going to get out alive.</p>
</details>

在意大利之外，你也能找到各种关于真实罗马生活的见解。最近，一个为我们提供古代世界运作新视角的好地方是**温多兰达**（English Full Name: Vindolanda）遗址，这是位于不列颠北部哈德良长城附近的一个军队基地。在那里，你不仅能看到考古遗迹，还因为遗址的保存条件，发现了最初写在蜡板和木板上的信件和文件。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You can find all kinds of insights into real Roman life outside Italy. And one of the best places recently for producing kind of new look at how the ancient world worked is the site of Vindolanda, It's an army base near Hadrian's Wall in northern Britain. And there, not only have you got the archeology, but you've also got, because of the conditions of the site which is preserved, basically letters and documents that were originally written on wax on wood.</p>
</details>

在这些文件中，你什么都能看到：从军需官，那个负责仓库的人，试图计算和记录储藏室里有什么；到一份病假条清单，记录了所有因严重眼部感染而休假的士兵，因此不被允许执行任务。但你也能看到基地里的社交生活。在那里发现的最著名、最感人的文件之一是一份生日派对邀请函，指挥官的妻子写信给驻扎在不远处另一个军事基地的另一位女士，说：“请来参加我的生日派对。” 这上面可能有我们拥有的罗马世界最早的女性签名，虽然这一点有些争议，但我认为这很可能是真的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And there, you see everything from the quartermaster, the guy who's in charge of the stores, trying to work out and keep records of what they've got in the store rooms. You see a list of sick notes really of all the soldiers who are off, because they've got very nasty eye infections, and so, weren't allowed out on active service. But you also see the social life that went on on the base. One of the most famous and touching documents that has been discovered there is a birthday party invitation where the wife of the commandant is writing to another woman who's based on another army base, not far away, saying, "Do come to my birthday." It may have on it the earliest signature of a woman from the Roman world that we have bit debated, but I think that's probably true.</p>
</details>

有时，一些看似微不足道的微小发现，真的会改变你对罗马世界生活的看法。由于潮湿的环境——因为不列颠北部一直很潮湿——在军事基地发现了大量的罗马皮鞋。其中一件完全令人大开眼界的事情是，这些鞋子中有很多是童鞋，还有相当一些女鞋，与士兵的鞋子放在一起。这引发了一种全新的思考罗马军事基地的方式，让我们开始思考士兵们有家庭，思考这是一个混合社区，而不仅仅是一群士兵，里面没有女性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Sometimes, apparently insignificant tiny discoveries really change your view about life in the Roman world. And because of the wet conditions, 'cause it has always been wet in northern Britain, because of the wet conditions, a lot of shoes have been discovered, Roman leather shoes on army bases. And one thing that is completely eyeopening is that many of those shoes are children's shoes, there's quite a few women's shoes alongside the shoes of the soldiers. Now, that has kickstarted a whole new way of thinking about a Roman army base, thinking about soldiers having families, thinking about it being a mixed community, not just, you know, a bunch of squaddies and no women inside.</p>
</details>

### 重新审视罗马女性的地位

古罗马女性绝对没有特权，首先，她们都没有投票权。但在许多方面，罗马女性的待遇比古代世界几乎任何其他地方的女性都要好。如果你去公元前五世纪的雅典，你会发现女性的生活相当封闭，几乎没有权利，如果她们是精英阶层的一员，她们不会与家庭中的男性进行社交。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There's absolutely no way that ancient Roman women were privileged, none of them had the vote for a start. In many ways, Roman women had a much better deal than almost any other women in the ancient world. If you go to fifth century BCE Athens, you find women are pretty enclosed, really no rights, they don't mix socially if they're members of the elite with the men of their family.</p>
</details>

然而，回到罗马，女性拥有的权利可能比欧洲直到19世纪之前的任何时候都多。她们可以继承财产，可以上法庭，并且享有一项巨大的特权：与她们的男性家人共进晚餐。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, go to Rome, and women probably have more rights than any time up to the 19th century in Europe. They can inherit property, they can go to court, and they have a great privilege of having dinner with their men folk.</p>
</details>

### 罗马艺术的真实色彩：告别纯白大理石

我们继承了一个非常极简主义的、白色的希腊和罗马版本。幸存下来的雕像大多没有任何装饰，没有任何颜料。因此，我们的印象非常倾向于白色、闪亮的大理石。事实上，我们知道这一点已经超过一百年了。现在人们完全认识到，希腊和罗马的雕像是经常被上色的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We've inherited a very minimalist white version of both Greece and Rome. The statues that survive have mostly survived without any decoration, without any paint on them. And so, our picture is very much something white, shiny marble. And, in fact, we've known this for more than a hundred years. It's totally now recognized that Greek and Roman statues were regularly painted.</p>
</details>

我认为关于它们被涂得多俗艳，还存在一些争论。我们可以从雕像上找到一些颜料的痕迹，现在可以检测出来。但颜色到底有多么鲜艳，我认为这仍然是一个悬而未决的问题。但无论如何，我认为，仅仅开始将那种色彩带回画面，想象一下当你是一个富有的罗马人，委托制作一尊你妻子或父亲的雕像时，你不会委托制作这种非常朴素、纯白的大理石物件，你会委托制作一个充满色彩的东西，你在为它注入生命，你在看到他们嘴唇的红色和眼中的瞳孔。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now I think there is a bit of a debate about how garishly they were painted. We can get traces of some of the pigments that we can now pick up from the statues. But quite how lurid the colors were, I think it's still a bit up for grabs. I think whatever though, just to start to put that sort of color back into the picture, to imagine that when you were a rich Roman commissioning a statue of your wife or your father or whatever, you wouldn't have been commissioning this very kind of austere, pure white marble object, you'd be commissioning something that was full of color that you were injecting life into, that you were seeing the red of their lips and the pupils in their eyes.</p>
</details>

当你把罗马人和希腊人放在那样的背景下看时，他们会显得更加亲近。你知道，他们在那里的形象是光彩照人的。我想，对我们中的一些人来说，那种光彩可能有点过头了。我敢肯定有些人可能更喜欢闪亮的白色大理石，而不是有时被建议的非常艳丽的红色和蓝色，但你必须接受某种形式的色彩。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And there is something much more immediate about the Romans and the Greeks when you see them in that context. You know, they're there with images of people that are radiant. Now, I think, for some of us, that radiance is a bit over the top. I'm sure there are some people who probably would prefer the shiny white marble to the very lurid reds and blues that are sometimes suggested, but you've gotta get your head around color of some sort.</p>
</details>

### 希腊与罗马：相互交织的文化共生体

希腊和罗马文化深度交织，你实际上无法将它们分开。我认为其中一个方面是，罗马精英看待希腊，看到了他们想要重用、借鉴和改编的文学传统和艺术传统。毫无疑问，希腊对罗马有很强的影响。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Greek and Roman culture were deeply intertwined, and you can't actually pull them apart. I think one aspect of that is that elite Romans looked at Greece and saw literary traditions, artistic traditions, that they wanted to reuse and borrow and adapt. There is no doubt that there's a strong influence from Greece to Rome.</p>
</details>

不过，你必须小心，不要仅仅把古罗马文化看作一种次生文化，好像它只是从希腊世界接收了二手货。罗马总是在改编希腊文化，以不同的方式使用它。当然，罗马文化也反向影响。当希腊成为罗马帝国的一个省份时，它也在继承和改编来自罗马世界的文化形式。所以这在很大程度上是一种双向交流。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You have to be a bit careful though of just seeing ancient Roman culture as if it was a kind of secondary culture, you know, that just took hand-me-downs from the Greek world. Rome is always adapting Greek culture, it's using it in a different way. And, of course, Roman culture goes the other way. And when Greece is a province of the Roman empire, it is inheriting and adapting cultural forms from the Roman world. So it's very much a two-way traffic.</p>
</details>

希腊人从罗马借鉴的东西之一，我们可能不太喜欢，就是角斗士表演和野兽狩猎。有一种倾向认为希腊人对于这类事情过于纯粹，他们的思想总是集中在哲学、戏剧和高雅文化上。但他们所做的是，我们可以看到这方面的痕迹，他们改造了自己的剧院来举办野兽狩猎和角斗士表演。你可以看到他们在剧场空间周围设置了栏杆，以保护观众免受在那里被残忍屠杀的动物的伤害。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">One of the things that the Greeks borrowed from Rome, we might not like this very much, was indeed gladiatorial displays and wild beast hunts. Now, there's been a bit of a tendency to say the Greeks were far too pure for that kind of thing, that, you know, their minds were always on philosophy and theater and, you know, high culture. But what they did was they, and we can see the traces of this, they adapted their theaters to host wild beast hunts and gladiatorial displays. You can see where they put bars around the theatrical space to keep the audience safe from the animals that were being horribly slaughtered there.</p>
</details>

对我来说，希腊和罗马始终是同一个世界的一部分，它们总是在相互对话。其中一个标志当然是，从很早的时候起，大约公元前7世纪，意大利就有了希腊的定居点。事实上，一些最早的希腊文字就来自意大利。所以，这是一种比一种文化借鉴另一种文化更为错综复杂的共生混合体。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">For me, Greece and Rome are always part of the same world, they're always talking to each other. And one sign of that is of course that there were Greek settlements in Italy from very early on, from the 7th century BCE. And, in fact, some of the earliest Greek writing comes from Italy. So it's a much more kind of intricately mixed up symbiosis mixture than just, you know, one culture borrowing from another.</p>
</details>

### 罗马的遗产：一个不断被重新诠释的权力符号

罗马从未从西方世界消失，每一代人，我想，我们可以追溯到几个世纪前，每一代人都以一种略微不同的方式重新发现了它，而且他们总是认为自己的重新发现非常新颖。但我认为这部分是因为，或者说很大程度上是因为，罗马为我们提供了一个关于什么是强大、什么是超凡、什么是幽默、什么是帝国的形象。因此，它为我们思考自身提供了许多构建模块。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Rome has never gone away from the western world, and every generation, I think, and we're going back centuries here, every generation has rediscovered it in a slightly different way, and they always, they always think they're being very novel when they rediscover it. But I think that's partly because, or very largely because, Rome has given us an image of what it is to be powerful, what it is to be larger than life, what it is to be funny, what it is to be an empire. And so, it's provided many of the building blocks that we need in order to think about ourselves.</p>
</details>

一个很好的例子是16和17世纪的所有那些王朝、王子和国王，他们让雕塑家或画家以罗马皇帝的形象来塑造自己。现在对我们来说，这看起来其实有点傻，我们想，他们难道不觉得作为现代人穿着那些小小的罗马军裙有点可笑吗？但我认为我们应该看到的是，罗马所做的是提供了一种思考何为强大的方式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">A good example of that is all those dynast and princes and kings in the 16th and 17th century who had themselves sculpted or represented in paint in the guise of roman emperors. Now, to us, that looks actually a bit silly, we think, didn't they think that they looked a bit silly wearing as modern people, those little Roman military skirts? But I think what we ought to be seeing is that what Rome was doing was providing a way of thinking about what it was to be powerful.</p>
</details>

而且它从政治光谱的不同角度来做到这一点。我们倾向于认为罗马为右翼提供了榜样，当我们想到意大利的法西斯独裁者墨索里尼时，他著名地将自己视为尤利乌斯·凯撒和奥古斯都皇帝的典范。但我们也不应忘记，卡尔·马克思曾说，法国大革命是穿着罗马服装进行的。罗马有革命性的一面，也有独裁性的一面，它们都非常真切地存在于我们面前，等待我们去重新诠释，并使之成为我们自己的东西。罗马之所以能够幸存下来，是因为每一代人都将它变成了自己的东西。

<p class="english-text">And it does that from different perspectives on the political spectrum. We have a tendency to think that Rome provides a model for the right-wing, and when we think of fascist dictator Mussolini in Italy, who famously saw himself very much in the model of Julius Caesar and Augustus, the Emperor Augustus. And we shouldn't forget that Karl Marx said that the French revolution, you know, took place in Roman dress. There are revolutionary aspects to Rome, there are dictatorial aspects to Rome, and they're there terribly present for us, waiting for us to come and reinterpret them, and make them our own. And Rome has survived because every generation has made it their own.</p>

### 罗马凯旋仪式：权力、财富与恐惧的盛大游行

**罗马凯旋仪式**（English Full Name: Roman triumph，授予战功卓著的罗马将军的一种盛大游行仪式）是授予战功卓著的罗马将军的一种盛大游行。目前尚不清楚是否有任何确切的规定。一些古代作家说，“哦，你必须杀死5000名敌人才能被授予凯旋仪式。” 我们不知道这是否完全属实。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">A Roman triumph or a triumphal procession was awarded to a super successful Roman general. It's not clear whether there were any exact rules for this. Some ancient writers said, "Oh, you had to have killed 5,000 of the enemy to be awarded a triumph." We don't know if that's entirely true.</p>
</details>

它是一场穿越罗马街道的盛大游行，最终到达卡比托利欧山上的朱庇特神庙。得胜的将军站在一辆非常华丽的礼仪战车上，身着一套非凡的紫色服装，披着带有银色星星的紫色斗篷，据说这模仿了卡比托利欧山上朱庇特神本人的雕像。他穿过城市，前往神庙，向朱庇特献祭，以纪念他的胜利。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What it was was a vast procession through the streets of Rome leading up to the Temple of Jupiter Best and Greatest on the Capitoline Hill, with the general, the successful general, standing in a very elaborate ceremonial chariot, dressed up in an extraordinary purple outfit with a purple cloak and silver stars, which apparently mimicked the statue of Jupiter, the God himself, on the Capitoline Hill. He processed through the city, up to the temple to make a sacrifice to Jupiter in honor really of his victory.</p>
</details>

但不仅如此。在将军的战车前，你会看到他在战争中俘获的俘虏和战利品。我们有一些关于这些俘虏的描述，当他们是最高级别、穿着最奇特服装时，似乎最令人印象深刻。一个将军真正想要的是让一个国王走在他的战车前，一个穿着王室服装，但被罗马的力量束缚和俘获的国王。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But it wasn't just that. In front of the general's chariot, you find the captives that he'd taken in the course of the war, and the spoils of victory. Those captives, we have some descriptions of them, and they seem to be most impressive when they're of the highest rank and the most exotically dressed. And what a general really wants is to have a king walking before his chariot, a king in his regal outfit, but shackled and captured by the power of Rome.</p>
</details>

从我们拥有的描绘这场游行的雕塑中可以看到，一些俘虏似乎实际上是被抬着游行的，而不是走路。有些肯定是在走路，但有些被放在平台上，手脚被绑住，被抬着供人们观看。我们知道，凯旋仪式的观众被吸引来观看罗马人现在征服了什么样的人。有时这可能会适得其反，他们有时实际上会为俘虏感到非常难过。但将军真正展示的是他对被他征服的君主和普通士兵的权力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Some of them we can see from the sculptures that we have depicting this procession, some of them seem to have been actually carried in this procession, not walking. Some certainly did walk, but some were kind of put onto platforms, and bound hand and foot, were carried along for people to look at. And we know that the audience of the triumph were drawn to see what the people were like the Romans had now conquered. Now it could sometimes rebound, they sometimes felt very sorry for them actually. But the general is really parading his power over the dynasts and the ordinary soldiers that he had conquered.</p>
</details>

还有战利品，他在战役中缴获的一些最好的掠夺物。我们通常对胜利的战利品的看法相当有限。我们想到的是雕塑、珍贵的艺术品、硬币进入罗马，并在游行中向人们展示，当然这些东西有很多。但远不止于此。他们想要做的是，可以说，具体展示被征服的领土是什么样的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There was the booty, some of the best bits of loot that he'd taken in the course of his campaign. We often think of the spoils of victory in a rather limited way actually. We think of sculptures, precious works of art, coin coming into Rome and being on display to the people in the procession, and there were certainly plenty of those. But it goes much further than that. And what they were wanting to do was to, as it were, kind of exemplify what the conquered territory was.</p>
</details>

凯旋仪式的规模和场面差异巨大。随着罗马的征服深入到那些真正富裕、在罗马人看来真正充满异国情调的地方，它们似乎变得越来越奢华。我认为你必须将凯旋仪式部分地看作是，它确实让那些可能从未离开过罗马城或意大利30英里范围的罗马观众，亲眼见到了他们从未见过的东西和生物。我的意思是，他们没有图画书来看出国是什么样子。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Triumphs differed hugely in scale and spectacle. Gradually, it seems they got more and more lavish as Roman conquest reached into places that were really rich, and in Roman terms, really exotic. And I think that what you have to see the triumph as, in part, is literally something that brings the Roman audience, who might have never been outside a radius of 30 miles of the city of Rome or certainly not Italy, it brings them face to face with the kind of stuff and creatures that they had never ever seen. I mean, they've not got picture books of what it looks like when you go abroad.</p>
</details>

确实有一些描绘外国地方的绘画和马赛克，但这是真正让罗马人民直面世界，而且我认为，从我们的角度来看，可能有点不安，是他们相信自己已经征服的世界。所以你可以看到展出的动物，可以看到展出的植物、树木。在公元71年由维斯帕先皇帝和他的儿子提图斯举行的一次凯旋仪式中，他们从犹太地带来了香脂树。所以你看到的不仅仅是精致的小摆设，有时确实非常精致，有关于看到镶满珠宝的国王宝座被抬着游行的非凡故事，但它也是被占领地方的动植物。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There are some representations of the foreign places you find in painting, a mosaic, that's true, but this is literally bringing the Roman people face to face with the world, and I think it's likely uneasily from our point of view, the world that they believe they've conquered. So you could find animals on display, you could find plants, trees on display. In one triumph of 71 CE by the Emperor Vespasian and his son, Titus, they had balsam trees brought from Judea. So what you are seeing is not just the elaborate brica-brac, and sometimes it is very elaborate, this extraordinary stories of, you know, seeing the king's throne encrusted with jewels carried along in precession, but it's also the flora and fauna of the captured place.</p>
</details>

这有时会以一种奇怪的方式与将军的吹嘘结合在一起，所以你会看到有标语牌被抬着，上面列出了将军征服的地方，个别城镇，标语牌描绘了胜利的发生，敌人的被摧毁的堡垒。将军后面跟着他至少一部分得胜的军队。有趣的是，据说他们会唱一些略带猥亵的歌曲，稍微取笑一下将军，这样他就不会得意忘形。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that combines sometimes in a strange way with boasts on the part of the general, so that you get placards carried along with that, which list the places that the general conquered, the individual town, placards which depict the victories happening, the destroyed thoughts of the enemy. And behind the general came at least some of his victorious troops. They interestingly were said to have sang lewd songs slightly at the expense of the general, so he didn't get above himself.</p>
</details>

而且为了防止他得意忘形，他穿着朱庇特的服装，你不想让他认为自己真的是神。据说战车里有一个奴隶一直对他说：“记住你只是个人，记住你只是个人，记住你只是个人。” 但他们就这样穿过城市。我现在认为很难体会到它的规模和激动人心的程度。我们知道他们搭建了特殊的看台，以便人们能有好的视野。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And just in case he should get above himself, there he is dressed as Jupiter Optimus Maximus, you don't want him to think that he really is a god. It said that there was a slave in the chariot with him saying, "Remember you're a man, remember you're a man, remember you're a man" the whole time. But they go through the city like that. It's now I think very hard to get a sense of the size and the excitement of it. We know they put up special stands, so people could get a good view.</p>
</details>

作为一个英国人，我倾向于把这想象成你可能在英国君主加冕典礼上看到的情景。但我认为英国君主的加冕典礼是一个相当苍白的比较。我想人们是来看将军做了什么，他们来到罗马市中心，看罗马的征服意味着什么。所以它非常令人印象深刻，但它也深深植根于意识形态。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I suppose I tend to think of this as a Brit as something like what you might see in the coronation of a British monarch. But I think the coronation of a British monarch is a rather feeble comparison. You know, I think people were coming to see what the general had done, they were coming into the center of Rome to see what Roman conquest meant. So it's hugely impressive, but it's also very, very ideologically rooted.</p>
</details>

我认为凯旋仪式的主要功能是为本地罗马观众服务的，是为了让罗马人思考何为罗马人，但它还有另一面，那就是向敌人灌输恐惧。这是一个新闻会传播的仪式，我怀疑，它上演了对战败者的羞辱。我们知道有几位战败的君主和将军宁愿自杀，也不愿在凯旋仪式中被展示。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think the main function of the triumph is for the local Roman audience, it's for Romans to think about what it is to be Roman, but it has another side to it, which is, it puts fear into the enemy. It's a ceremony news, of which I suspect, travels that enacts the humiliation of the defeated. And we know that there are several defeated monarchs and generals who kill themselves rather than be displayed in the triumph.</p>
</details>

其中最著名的我认为是克利奥帕特拉女王，她可能从她的情人尤利乌斯·凯撒和马克·安东尼那里听说了所有关于凯旋仪式的事情。当未来的皇帝奥古斯都的屋大维想要带她回去，作为他凯旋游行中的关键战利品来展示时，据说她说：“我不会被凯旋游行羞辱”，这就是她自杀的原因。我认为你可以看到，在罗马人民的眼中，成为一件战利品的羞辱，是你可能会想，而且我们知道有些人确实这么想，“我不会那么做，我绝对不会。” 你知道，克利奥帕特拉是一个拒绝者，米特拉达梯是另一个拒绝者。这是一个庆祝的仪式，也是一个羞辱的仪式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The most famous of those I think is Queen Cleopatra who probably heard all about triumphs from her lovers Julius Caesar and Mark Antony. When Octavian, the future emperor, Augustus wants to take her back to parade as, you know, the key bit of booty in his triumphal procession, she is said to have said, "I will not be triumphed over," and that accounts for her suicide. And I think that you can see that the eyes of the Roman people and, you know, the she humiliation of becoming a piece of spoil is something that you might think, and we know some did, "I am not going to do that, I am simply not." You know, Cleopatra is a refusenik, Mithridates is another refusenik. It's a ceremony of celebration, it's also a ceremony of humiliation.</p>
</details>

凯旋仪式在其鼎盛时期一定非常壮观。很难想象有任何罗马庆典比它更自信地展示其场面。凯旋游行的路线，我们不完全知道它通向哪里，但它必须能够容纳成千上万，数十万人。这真的是非常大的新闻。它是否是人类历史上同类游行中规模最大的，这无法断言，但它无疑为欧洲此后庆祝王室或军事力量的活动提供了典范。文艺复兴时期成功的将军们模仿罗马凯旋仪式来庆祝他们自己的胜利。所以我认为在很多方面，它为庆祝征服提供了榜样。它是城市如何展示其力量的模板。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The triumph must have been at its biggest, it must have been quite extraordinary. It's hard to imagine that there was any Roman celebration that was more, you know, confident in some ways of its own spectacle. And the root of a triumphal procession, we don't exactly know where it goes, but it must have been able to accommodate thousands, hundreds of thousands. It is really, really big news. Whether it's the biggest kind of procession of its type in human history, it's impossible to say, but it certainly provided the model in Europe for celebrations of royal or military power ever after. Successful generals in a Renaissance imitating the Roman triumph to celebrate their own kinds of victory. So I think in many ways it provides a model for what it is like to celebrate conquest. It's a template for how the city puts its might on display.</p>
</details>

我们对举行的凯旋仪式数量有很好的了解，因为罗马人尽可能准确地记录了它。公平地说，不完全准确，因为他们将一次凯旋归功于罗马的创始人罗慕路斯，而他可能并不存在。所以有一些模糊的边缘，但基本上，他们有一份凯旋仪式清单，总数超过200次。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We have a very good idea of the number of triumphs that took place, because Romans recorded it as accurately as possible to be fair, not entirely accurately, because they attribute one triumph to Romulus, the founder of Rome, and he probably didn't exist. So there's some fuzzy edges, but, basically, they've got a list of triumphs and they add up to more than 200.</p>
</details>

有趣的是，在第一位皇帝奥古斯都统治时期的公元前19年，凯旋游行的类型发生了真正的重大转变。因为在19年之后，除了皇帝本人或王室王子之外，没有任何普通将军能获得凯旋仪式。所以直到公元前19年，在罗马共和国时期，是普通或非凡的将军们来争取他们的凯旋仪式。在奥古斯都统治下，它变成了一种王室仪式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What is interesting, there is a real big break in the kind of triumphal procession that you get in the reign of the first emperor Augustus in 19 BCE, because after 19, no one who is not either the emperor himself or a prince of the royal house, no ordinary general receives a triumph. So up to 19 BC through the Republic of Rome, it is for ordinary or rather the extraordinary generals to claim their triumph. Under Augustus, it becomes a royal ritual.</p>
</details>

其逻辑是，那之后的所有战争都被视为皇帝的战争。所以当凯旋仪式来临时，是皇帝获得凯旋的荣誉。因此，它们变得非常君主化，而在此之前并非如此。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The logic is that all wars after that point are fought as if they were the emperor's wars. So when a triumph comes, it is the emperor who gets the honor of the triumph. So they become very, very monarchical, which they hadn't been up to that point.</p>
</details>

很难说哪个仪式最宏大、最奢侈、最铺张或最俗气，但人们挑出来并且罗马人也挑出来的仪式是庞培大帝在公元前61年为他征服海盗以及征服东方国王米特拉达梯而举行的为期两天的仪式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's very hard to say which is their grandest or the most extravagant, over the top lavish, or bad taste of these ceremonies, but the ceremony that people pick out and that Romans picked out was the two-day ceremony that Pompey the Great held in 61 BCE for his conquest of the pirates, and also his conquest of the Eastern King Mithridates.</p>
</details>

这从一开始就非同寻常，因为凯旋仪式通常是一天的事情。你把所有东西都装上，穿过罗马城，到达朱庇特神庙，举行祭祀，然后吃一顿大餐，就结束了。而庞培所做的是，他说他无法把他所有的东西都塞进只持续一天的游行中，所以这是一个为期两天的游行。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now this starts out by being extraordinary, because triumphs by and large are one day affairs. You know, you load everything up, you process through the city of Rome, you get to the Temple of Jupiter, Optimus Maximus, you do a sacrifice, and you have a great dinner, and that's it. Now what Pompey does, he says that he cannot squash all his stuff into a procession that lasts just one day, so it's a two-day procession.</p>
</details>

游行中充满了极其奢华的战利品，特别是来自米特拉达梯宫廷的。实际上，其中一件我们有一个青铜罐，几乎可以肯定可以追溯到庞培的凯旋仪式，并且至今仍然存在。它在罗马的卡比托利欧博物馆，很明显来自米特拉达梯的王国，并且很可能是在游行中实际被抬着的物品之一。它绝不是最宏伟的，它是一个相当优雅的素面青铜水壶，大约70厘米高。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It is full of really, really extravagant spoils, particularly from the court of Mithridates. Actually one of these we have one bronze pot, which almost certainly goes back to Pompey's triumph and still survives. It's in the Capitoline Museums at Rome, and it's clearly came from Mithridates' kingdom, and it's very, very likely was one of the things that was actually carried in the procession. It is not by any means the grandest, it's a rather elegant plain bronze picture about 70-centimeters high.</p>
</details>

但我们读到有最奇妙的装饰日晷，我们读到成桶的硬币，我们甚至读到庞培本人的一个形象，大概是用战利品制成的，他的头像在这场游行中被抬着，作为征服的果实的一部分。他的头完全由珍珠制成，那一定是一个由珍珠制成的巨大头像。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But we read of most fantastic ornamented sundials, we read kind of barrels load of coin, we read even of an image of Pompey himself presumably made out of the spoils, where his head carried in this procession as part of the fruits of conquest. His head is made entirely out of pearl, it must have been a colossal head made of pearl.</p>
</details>

必须说，这是庞培在某种意义上有点搞砸了的案例之一。我的意思是，人们总是在看待凯旋仪式时，既想欣赏它，被它打动，又想说，“我觉得这有点过头了，我觉得这有点庸俗，我觉得这太奢侈了。” 所以总有那种对立的观点。而庞培的珍珠头像正是抓住了那种批判倾向的物品之一。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It has to be said that this is one of the cases where in a sense Pompey got it a bit wrong. I mean people are always looking at the triumph, both wanting to admire it, be impressed, but also wanting to say, "I think this is a bit over the top, I think this is a bit vulgar actually, I think this is too luxurious." So there's always that counterpoint. And the head of Pompey in pearl was one of the objects that really captured that critical tendency,</p>
</details>

因为人们对此说了两件事，他们说这是一种非常女性化的行为。在罗马人的想象中，珍珠与女性紧密相连。所以庞培的批评者说：“他怎么能用那种女性化的材料来代表他的头呢？” 但恐怕后来还有更恶毒的影射，因为庞培最终是尤利乌斯·凯撒的主要对手，尤利乌斯·凯撒和庞培在公元前40年代为谁将统治罗马世界而战。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">'cause people said two things about it, they said this is a very effeminizing thing to do. Pearls in the Roman imagination were very, very much associated with women. So the critics of Pompey said "How could he have his head represented in that female material?" But there were also, I'm afraid, rather nastier insinuations made later because Pompey, in the end, he's the major adversary of Julius Caesar, Julius Caesar and Pompey fight it out in the 40s BC basically for who's going to run the Roman world.</p>
</details>

凯撒赢了，庞培逃往埃及。当他到达埃及时，他以为自己下船就安全了，但实际上，岸上的埃及人砍下了他的头。人们回顾这个在游行中被抬着的庞培的头像，他们摇着手指说：“嗯，那是他最终下场的预兆。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Caesar wins, Pompey flees to Egypt. When he gets to Egypt, he thinks he's getting out of the boat to safety, actually, but the Egyptians on the shore cut his head off, and people looked back at this head, that is just the head of Pompey carried in the procession, and they wagged their fingers and said, "Hmm. That was an omen of what was going to happen to him in the end."</p>
</details>

所以总有这样一种说法，巨大的奢华，罗马人对此非常道德化，巨大的奢华总是有点危险。将军的时刻，他职业生涯的顶峰，你知道，凯旋仪式是你会说小罗马男孩们梦想的、他们能取得的最大成功：一场凯旋游行。然而，它常常略带潜在的灾难、潜在的过度。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So there is always this saying that huge luxury, and Romans are very moralizing about this, huge luxury is always a bit dangerous. The moment of the general's, the acme of his career, you know, the triumph is kind of thing you'd say what little Roman boys dream of as being the biggest success they could ever achieve: a triumphal procession. And yet, it's very often slightly tainted with potential disaster, potential overreach.</p>
</details>

有无数的故事，例如，凯旋的将军们不久后发现他们的儿子死了。凯旋的成功反过来困扰着你。总有一个问题，作为凯旋的将军，你到底在多大程度上是主角。显然，如果你是一个将军，在你面前有一个伟大的国王，在你面前行进，以表明你征服了一个国王，这是非常令人向往的。但令人不安的是，人群实际上往往对国王、公主和悲伤的俘虏更感兴趣，而不是对将军本人。所以，如果你举行了凯旋仪式，也并非全是赢家。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Any number of stories of, for example, triumphing generals who very soon after found that their sons died. Now kind of the success of the triumph comes back to haunt you. There was always a question of how far you really were as the triumphing general, the star of the show, and it was obviously extremely desirable if you are a general to have a great king in front of you, marching along in front of you to show that you had conquered a king, there was uncomfortably often a sense that the crowd were actually more interested in the king and the princesses and the sad captains, than they were in the general himself. So, it's not all win if you have a triumph.</p>
</details>

罗马哲学家塞内卡有一句精彩的名言，他也是尼禄皇帝的导师，部分是思考凯旋仪式时说的，他说：“小规模的亵渎会受到惩罚。大规模的亵渎，那才会让你获得凯旋仪式。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There is a wonderful quote from the Roman philosopher, Seneca, who was also the tutor of the Emperor Nero, I'm thinking in part about triumphs, and it says, "Petty sacrilege gets punished. Sacrilege on a grand scale, that is what gets you a triumph."</p>
</details>

这是塞内卡部分借鉴和改编自一个关于亚历山大大帝的著名故事的一句话。亚历山大俘获了一个海盗，并问他，这是在公元前4世纪，他对海盗说：“你为什么拿走别人的财产？你为什么偷东西？” 海盗回答说：“如果你偷东西，而你只有一艘船，你被称为海盗。如果你偷东西，而你有一整支军队和海军，你被称为国王。” 对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's a quote which Seneca is partly drawing and adapting from a famous story about Alexander the Great who captures a pirate and asks a pirate, this is in the 4th century BC, he says to the pirate, "Why did you take other people's property, what? Why did you steal things?" And the pirate replies, "If you steal things and you've only got one ship, you're called a pirate. If you steal things and you've got a whole army and a navy, you are called a king," right?</p>
</details>

塞内卡在某种程度上是在改编这个故事，并且一只眼睛盯着凯旋仪式。我非常喜欢这句话，因为它显示了罗马人真正在反思奖励、道德、谁能成功、谁不能、谁被指责。我们，或者说现代世界的大部分人，倾向于认为罗马人对这一切都没有任何问题，他们出去征服，带着战利品和掠夺物回来，他们连眼皮都不眨一下，他们认为这对他们完全是好事，他们没有道德顾虑。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Seneca, in a way, is adapting that, and having one eye on the triumph. And I think it's quite I very much like, because it shows the Romans really reflecting on reward, morality, on who makes it big, who doesn't, who gets blamed, and we do have, or much of the modern world I think has a tendency, to think of Romans as if they had, you know, no problem about any of this, they went off and they conquered things, and they came back with their booty and their loot, and they didn't bat an eyelid, they thought it was holy to their good, they had no morals group.</p>
</details>

塞内卡说的是，如果你抢东西，你去神庙，拿走神庙里所有的圣物，而你只是一个人，你会发现自己受到惩罚。如果你大规模地这样做，罗马会尊敬你。当然，他提出的关于罗马帝国主义和罗马帝国的问题是，它真的不同吗？它不就是大规模的盗窃吗？我认为，当罗马人谈论凯旋仪式时，他们正在协商的就是这类担忧。

<details>

<p class="english-text">What Seneca's saying is that, you know, if you rip things off, you go to temple and you take all the sacred objects from the temple, and you're just a single guy, you'll find yourself punished. If you do that on a grand scale, Rome honors you. And the question, of course, is that he's raising about Roman imperialism and the Roman Empire is it actually different, you know? Is it just theft on a very big scale? Now it's those kind of worries I think that the Romans are negotiating when they talk about triumph.</p>

### 改变世界的罗马人：一份有争议的名单

有少数几个罗马人，我们现在认为他们改变了世界。我认为很难回去说这是否是真的，但有些罗马人的形象和成就，无论好坏，都被大书特书，以至于我们认为，没有他们，世界就不会是今天的样子。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There are a handful of Romans who we now perceive to have changed the world. I think it's very hard to go back and to say whether that's true or not, but there are Romans whose image and whose achievements for good or bad are so written up and so much part of the way history seems to have developed that we think of them as people without whom the world would not now be like it is.</p>
</details>

我认为他们中的一些人比我们想象的要模糊得多，我们对他们的了解也比我们想象的要少得多，但他们仍然在西方历史如何看待自身发展的方式中占据一席之地。我认为我们应该做的是探索这些真正有影响力的罗马人，并问一问为什么他们对欧洲历史有如此大的影响。

<p class="english-text">Now I think some of them are much murkier than we'd like to think, and we know much less about them than we imagine, but still, they occupy a place in how Western history thinks of itself having developed. I think what we ought to do is explore some of these really consequential Romans and ask a bit about why they have been so impactful on European history.</p>
</details>

我会从奥古斯都皇帝开始，他是第一位罗马皇帝。关于尤利乌斯·凯撒或奥古斯都谁应该算是第一位罗马皇帝，存在一些争论，但第一个自称皇帝的人是尤利乌斯·凯撒的养孙侄，出生时名为屋大维，当他独揽大权后最终改名为奥古斯都。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the one I would start with is the Emperor Augustus, the first Roman emperor. There is a bit of debate about whether Julius Caesar or Augustus should count as the first Roman emperor, but the first person to call himself Emperor was the adopted great nephew of Julius Caesar, born Octavian, who eventually changes his name when he takes sole power to become Augustus.</p>
</details>

他的职业生涯非常长。在公元前44年尤利乌斯·凯撒被刺杀后，当时屋大维还很年轻，他介入其中，自己组建了一支军队，站在那些想要为凯撒复仇的人一边。此后是一场漫长的内战。结果是屋大维成了最后的赢家。他最终击败了马克·安东尼，凯撒的另一位伟大捍卫者。在公元前31年，经过十多年的内战，他成了事实上统治罗马世界的人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">His career is very long. After the assassination of Julius Caesar in 44 BCE, when Octavian is still very young, he intervenes, raising an army himself, to fight on the side of those who want to avenge the assassination of Caesar. There's a long civil war that follows that. What turns out is that Octavian is the last man standing. He finally beats Mark Antony, another of Caesar's great defenders. And in 31 BCE, as it were, left after more than a decade of civil war, left as the person who is defacto ruling the Roman world.</p>
</details>

接下来非凡的是，他如何从那些内战中一个特别令人不快的年轻暴徒，一个在内战中真正暴力、恶毒、能干的人，转变为一位年长的政治家皇帝。他放弃了屋大维这个名字，改用奥古斯都。这个名字其实没什么特别的含义。如果非要说有什么含义，我想是“受尊敬的人”。他建立了一套一人统治的制度，并持续了几个世纪。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What is then extraordinary is how he moves from being actually a particularly unpleasant young thug in those civil wars, really violent, vicious, competent in civil war, he transforms himself, and at the same time transforms the Roman world, he transforms himself into the elder statesman emperor. Gives up the name Octavian, he takes the name Augustus instead. Doesn't mean anything really. If it means anything, I suppose, it's revered one, and he establishes a system of one-man rule which lasts for centuries.</p>
</details>

他实际上成功地设计了一种罗马可以在一人掌舵下运作的方式，这与权力分享和准民主的共和传统截然相反。我认为绝对非凡的是，首先，我们不知道他是如何做到的。我们几乎没有同时代的观察资料来告诉我们他统治期间发生了什么。他的统治一直持续到公元14年，是统治时间最长的罗马皇帝。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">He actually manages to craft a way that Rome could operate with one man at the helm, as against the republican tradition of power sharing and quasi sort of democracy. And I think that what is absolutely extraordinary is that, A, we don't know how quite he did this. We have very few contemporary observing sources to tell us what happened during his reign. It lasts until 14 CEs, longest reigning Roman emperor.</p>
</details>

但在那段时期，无论反对力量如何，他都设法构建了一套政治关系，这套关系仍然包括旧的精英阶层，仍然包括元老院，但现在都围绕着皇帝这个个人。这一点没有改变。在罗马历史的其余部分，罗马就是这样被统治的，它为此后无数的君主和独裁者提供了模板。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But during that period, whatever the opposition was, he manages to construct a kind of set of political relationships, which still includes the old elite, it still includes the Senate, but now focused around the emperor as an individual. And that doesn't change. You know, for the rest of Roman history, that is how Rome is governed, and it provides a template for any number of monarchs and dictators ever after.</p>
</details>

这是一个谜，我认为它之所以如此引人入胜，是因为我们看不清他是如何做到的。我们不知道在内战结束时，他是否有一个总体规划，或者像我怀疑的那样，他是在边做边学，试图找出一个人们即使不喜欢也会接受的权力体系，而它成功了。我不是罗马帝国权力的忠实崇拜者，但你必须承认奥古斯都，他建立了一个持续数百年的独裁统治体系。非同寻常。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's a mystery, and I think why it is so intriguing and enticing is we can't quite see how he did it. We don't know if at the end of the civil wars, he had a master plan, or as I suspect he's improvising on the go to try to work out a system of power that people will, even if they don't like, go along with, and it worked. I'm not a great admirer of Roman imperial power, but you do have to hand it to Augustus that he established a centuries lasting system of one-man rule. Extraordinary.</p>
</details>

我想我的第二位人选，将是奥古斯都的一位同路人，我将选择罗马诗人维吉尔。原因很简单，维吉尔在创作他伟大的罗马建国史诗时，讲述了埃涅阿斯作为特洛伊人从燃烧的特洛伊城逃离，在意大利奠定罗马民族的开端。他为后世提供了一种理解帝国及其悖论的方式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think as my number two, I'm going to have a fellow traveler of Augustus, and I'm going to have the Roman poet Virgil, for the simple reason that Virgil in writing his great epic of the foundation of Rome, Aeneas fleeing as a Trojan from the burning city of Troy to found the beginnings of the Roman race in Italy. He provided, for all time, a way of understanding what empire was and its paradoxes.</p>
</details>

这不是一首沙文主义的诗，而是一首相当谨慎和深思熟虑的诗。我认为这是一首比任何其他诗都更成功的诗。这是一个合理的猜测，我无法证明，但这是一个合理的猜测，自从维吉尔在公元前19年去世以来，每天，某个地方的某个人都在读这首诗，《埃涅阿斯纪》。它既捕捉了罗马帝国成为一个永无止境的帝国的雄心，也捕捉了伴随帝国而来的疑虑、问题和代价。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's not a jingoistic poem, it's a rather careful and thoughtful poem. It's a poem I think than which no other poem has ever been so successful. It's a fair bet, I couldn't prove it, but it's a fair bet that since Virgil died in 19 BCE, every day, somebody somewhere has been reading this poem, the "Aeneid," and it captures both the ambition of the Roman Empire to be an empire without end, but it also captures the doubts, the problems, and the costs of what come with empire.</p>
</details>

在诗的最后一幕，你看到英雄埃涅阿斯杀死了一个向他投降的人，这在古罗马也是一种战争罪。最后一幕说：“看看帝国的代价。” 此后，它产生了巨大的影响，可能几乎和奥古斯都本人一样有影响力，仅次于他。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In the final scene of the poem, you see the hero, Aeneas, kill somebody who has surrendered to him in a war crime that was a war crime even in Ancient Rome And the final scene says, "Look at the cost of empire." It has been utterly influential ever after, and probably almost as influential, very close second, to Augustus himself.</p>
</details>

我想我的第三个位置将留给尤利乌斯·凯撒。我这么说有点不情愿，因为尤利乌斯·凯撒在很大程度上是昙花一现。他刚开始时职业生涯相当普通，后来他显然越来越关心成为罗马的单一民粹主义领袖，废除民主的虚饰，建立自己的一人统治。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think my third spot is going to go to Julius Caesar. I say that slightly reluctantly, because Julius Caesar was very much a flash in the pan. He has a fairly ordinary career when he starts out, he becomes clearly more and more concerned to become a single populist leader at Rome, to dispense with the trappings of democracy and to establish himself as a one-man ruler.</p>
</details>

他确实做到了，这是真的，他使用的技巧至今仍在民粹主义政治家的剧本中，他直接与人民对话，他绕过国家机构，你知道，他使用古代相当于社交媒体的方式与罗马人民沟通。他确实超越了罗马式民主的惯例和规范。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">He sort of does, that's true, he does it by techniques that are still in the playbook of populist politicians, he speaks directly to the people, he bypasses the institutions of the state, you know, he uses the ancient equivalent of social media to communicate with the Roman people. And he does transcend the conventions and the norms of Roman sort of democracy.</p>
</details>

问题是，也是他只排在第三位的原因，这只是昙花一现。他只在那里待了五年，而且大部分时间，他都在罗马之外的其他地方。他没有建立任何东西，他把一切都搅乱了，但他没有建立起结构。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The problem is, and why he only comes in in third place is it's a flash in the pan. He's only there for five years, and most of the time, he's off out of Rome somewhere else. He doesn't just establish anything, he shakes everything up, but he doesn't put structures in place.</p>
</details>

我想第四位，我们将选择辛辛那图斯，我必须承认，他并非完全，但在很大程度上是一个神话人物。但他的神话如此强大，以至于我认为他对我来说是这些真正有影响力的人之一。我们能了解到的关于他的是，他是公元前5世纪罗马共和国初期一位相当，嗯，非常保守的政治家。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think for number four, we're going to go to Cincinnatus, who is, I have to confess, not entirely, but very largely a mythical character. But his myth is so strong that I think he counts for me as one of these really influential people. What we can tell about him is that he was a fairly, well, a very conservative politician in Rome in the 5th century BCE towards the beginning of the republic.</p>
</details>

他非常反对罗马人民的权利，非常，你知道，是一个保守的贵族，他与改革派的平民政治家有过一些相当激烈的冲突。但辛辛那图斯的关键在于，他当了很短时间的执政官，在他当过执政官，罗马国家的最高官员之后，他回到他的农场，他可以说，“我已经尽了我的本分，现在我要去种田了。我要再次成为一个普通人。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">He is very much an opponent of the rights of the Roman people, very much, you know, a conservative patrician, he has some pretty rocky encounters with reforming plebeian politicians. But what is key about Cincinnatus is that he's counsel for a short time, after he's been consul, the chief officer of the Roman state, he goes to his farm and he, as it were, says, you know, "I've done my bit, I'm now going to do the farm. I'm going to become an ordinary person again.</p>
</details>

几年后，当罗马在一次紧张的军事对峙中真正受苦时，罗马人民来找他，罗马当局来找他，他们说：“你能来拯救罗马吗？我们需要你的专业知识。” 他所做的是他回去，他掌权，他拯救了罗马免受敌人侵害，但他随后直接回到了他的农场。

<details>
<summary>Veiw/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">A few years later when Rome is really suffering in a, you know, tense military standoff, Roman people come to him, the Roman authorities come to him, and they say, "Could you please come and save Rome? We need your expertise." What he does is he goes back, he takes charge, he saves Rome against the enemy, but then he goes straight back to his farm.</p>
</details>

我认为辛辛那图斯如此重要的原因是，毕竟他的名字仍然反映在辛辛那提市，重要的是他没有打破共和国的惯例。他表明你可以为国家服务而不用接管它。因此，他成为了那些想要领导而不成为独裁者的人的巨大英雄和榜样。所以我认为他对我来说是挤进来的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I think what is so important about Cincinnatus is that, you know, his name is still reflected in Cincinnati after all, what is important is that he did not break through the conventions of the republic. He showed that you could serve the state without taking it over. And so he became a huge hero and a role model for those who wanted to lead without being an autocrat. So I think he nudges himself in there for me.</p>
</details>

第五位，我将选择格拉古兄弟，提比略·格拉古和盖约·格拉古，在公元前2世纪下半叶。他们是极具魅力的角色，他们的魅力有时被归因于他们的母亲科妮莉亚的影响，她培养他们成为政治家。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">For number five, I'm going to have the brothers Gracchi, Tiberius Gracchus and Gaius Gracchus in the second half of the 2nd century BCE. Amazingly charismatic characters, which are sometimes put down, their charisma is sometimes put down to the influence of their mother Cornelia, who groomed them to be politicians.</p>
</details>

我选择他们的原因，嗯，有两个。他们代表了我们第一次清楚地看到一位领先的罗马政治家明确地、经过深思熟虑地站在非精英一边对抗精英。他们来自精英背景，但他们都以不同的方式为穷人和被剥夺者争取权利。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Why I've chosen them is, well, for two reasons. They represent the first time we see clearly a leading Roman politician explicitly and in a thought-out way taking the side of the non-elite versus the elite. Now, they come from an elite background, but both of them stand up in different ways for the rights of the poor and the dispossessed.</p>
</details>

提比略·格拉古在公元前133年看到了罗马农民阶级的可怕经济困境，并发起了一项土地重新分配计划。他的兄弟盖约·格拉古十年后重新启动了该计划，因为它陷入了停滞。但盖约·格拉古是罗马历史上我们能看到的第一个不仅有一些好主意，而且有一些能组合成一个计划的好主意的人。他有土地分配，他有向罗马人民分配补贴粮食，他有反腐败法，他有税收改革。在我看来，他是罗马第一个有系统政治的人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Tiberius Gracchus in 133 BC sees the terrible economic distress of the peasant class in Rome, and initiates a land redistribution program. Gaius Gracchus, his brother, a decade later, reinitiates that because it gets stalled. But Gaius Gracchus is the first person in Roman history that we can see has not just some good ideas, but he has some good ideas that fit together into a program. He has land distribution, he has the distribution of subsidized grain to the Roman people, he has anti-corruption laws, he has changes in taxation. He seems to me to be the first person who kind of has joined up politics in Rome.</p>
</details>

恐怕他们俩都下场悲惨。提比略和盖约基本上都遭到了保守派元老的司法谋杀，他们在某种程度上是在工作中被杀害的。但他们从此成为了那些能够重新构想政治应有面貌的人的灯塔。在提比略的案例中，我认为，在某些方面，他不如盖约激进，但他明确表示，“罗马帝国的利润应该归罗马人民，而不仅仅是精英。” 这是一个至关重要的进步。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, I'm afraid both of them come to sad ends. (chuckles) Tiberius and Gaius are both basically subject to judicial murder by conservative senators, and they're killed on the job in a way. But they become forever after this beacon of people who could reformulate how politics should be. And in Tiberius' case, I think, in some ways, he's not as radical as Gaius, but he explicitly says, "The prophets of the Roman Empire should go to the Roman people, not just to the elite." That's a crucial, crucial step forward.</p>
</details>

第六位是罗马政治家马库斯·图利乌斯·西塞罗。我选择他，因为他绝对是把演说、说服和言论视为民主基础的集大成者。西塞罗不是一个军人，他有一些军事经验，但他在这方面相当糟糕。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Number six is the Roman politician, Marcus Tullius Cicero. And I've chosen him because he is the absolute summing up of what it is to see oratory, persuasion, and speaking as the foundation of democracy. Cicero is not a military man, he has a bit of military experience, but he's pretty lousy at it.</p>
</details>

他是罗马政治中的一个新人，他没有一整套精英祖先，他不穷，但他不属于既定的政治阶层，他靠口才登上了顶峰。他认为说服你的同胞，这就是权力的所在。他在罗马很早就获得了官职，他揭露了一个看起来是针对罗马国家的内部恐怖阴谋，即喀提林的阴谋，他实际上相当残酷地镇压了它，但他的话语从未被遗忘。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">He is a new man in Roman politics, he doesn't have a whole set of elite ancestors, he's not poor, but he's not part of the established political class, and he speaks his way to the top. He sees that persuading your fellow citizens is about that is where power consists in him. He gets office very early in Rome, he unmasks what looks like a terrorist conspiracy against the Roman state from within the conspiracy of Catiline, he actually rather brutally puts it down, but his words have never ever been forgotten.</p>
</details>

像许多罗马人一样，他下场悲惨，他在尤利乌斯·凯撒的继承人和尤利乌斯·凯撒的刺客之间的内战中，基本上被暗杀了。但他明确表示，并继续明确表示，你可以说服人们采取不同的行动。你今天仍然可以在政治示威的标语牌上看到西塞罗的拉丁语引语。他就是这么重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Like so many Romans have a sad end, he is in the civil war between the heirs of Julius Caesar and the assassins of Julius Caesar in that civil war, he's assassinated basically. But he made it clear and continues to make it clear that you can persuade people to act differently. You can still see Latin quotes from Cicero on placards in today's political demonstrations. That's how important he is.</p>
</details>

我选择的第七位是尼禄皇帝，不是因为我特别喜欢尼禄，事实上现在很难判断如何评价尼禄。关于尼禄的史料都非常敌对，但我们也知道他在生前很受欢迎，在他死后，东方出现了假尼禄，声称自己是尼禄的人冒出来说：“看，我没死。我在这里，我是尼禄。” 这表明他有一定程度的受欢迎程度。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I've chosen as number seven, the Emperor Nero, not because I'm a particular fan of Nero, and in fact it's now very hard to know how you cast judgment on Nero. The sources about Nero are so hostile, and yet we also know that he had popularity during his lifetime, and after his death, there were false Neros, people claiming to be Nero, bubbled up in the East saying, "Look, I didn't die. Here I am, I'm Nero." That suggests a degree of popularity.</p>
</details>

但我认为，在重新定义何为皇帝的方式上，他展示了有不同的方式来展示你的权力。这些方式几乎总是被他的反对者大肆抨击，而我们是那些抨击的继承者。我们现在仍然谈论，仍然有漫画，描绘现代政治领导人做着尼禄被认为做过的事情，在罗马燃烧时拉小提琴和唱歌，这仍然是我们自己政治言论的一部分。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But I think that, in a way of reformulating what it was to be emperor, he showed that there were different ways of demonstrating your power. These have almost always got really rubbished by his opponents, and we are the inheritors of that rubbishing. Now we still talk, we still have cartoons, you know, of modern political leaders doing what Nero is supposed to have done, fiddling and singing while Rome burns, it's still part of our own political rhetoric,</p>
</details>

但很明显，尼禄将艺术和文化置于罗马皇帝的核心位置，在某些方面，尼禄的榜样一直潜藏在罗马政治权力的表面之下。他成了批评的对象，不仅是在罗马燃烧时拉小提琴，还有他那种明显的虚荣心。他是一个伟大的演员，他会在剧院里表演，他会锁上剧院的门，这样人们在他表演结束前就出不去，以至于据说有些妇女在剧院里生了孩子，因为她们在等待皇帝结束表演。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but what is clear is that Nero put art and culture right at the heart of what it was to be a Roman emperor, and in some ways the example of Nero was always bubbling under the surface of Roman political power ever since. He has become the but of criticism, not just fiddling while Rome burned, but also his sense of apparent vanity. He was a great actor, and he would perform in theaters, and he would lock the theater doors, so that people couldn't get out while he was still performing, so that, you know, some women were supposed to have had babies in the theater while they were waiting for the emperor to finish.</p>
</details>

但我认为有一种感觉是，权力不仅仅在于剑，不仅仅在于演讲，权力也体现在艺术、文化、戏剧和软艺术中。我的意思是，如果你慷慨地看待他，尼禄是关于软实力的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But I think there is a sense there that saying power doesn't just rest in the sword, doesn't just rest in speechmaking, power is also represented in art, in culture, in theater, in the softer arts. I mean, Nero is about soft power, if you like, if we see him in a generous way.</p>
</details>

我的最后一个选择是历史学家科尔奈利乌斯·塔西佗，活跃于公元1世纪末和2世纪初。实际上，塔西佗在现实生活中，不得不说，有点像罗马帝国权力的合作者。他自己也承认，他在一个特别令人讨厌的皇帝图密善手下飞黄腾达，但我选择他不是因为这个。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">My last choice is the historian Cornelius Tacitus, active in the late 1st and early 2nd century CE. Now actually Tacitus, in real-life, have to say, was a bit of a collaborator with Roman imperial power. He flourished as he himself admits under a particularly obnoxious emperor demission, but that's not why I'm choosing him.</p>
</details>

我选择他，是因为他对尤里乌斯-克劳狄王朝，即公元1世纪追随奥古斯都的皇帝们的记述，在我看来，是有史以来对一人统治最深刻的剖析。他专注于揭露腐败如何运作，以及人们如何与帝国权力勾结，帝国在某种意义上，不是地理上的帝国，而是一人统治意义上的帝国，如何污染罗马国家。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm choosing him because his account of the dynasty of the Julio-Claudian, the emperors that followed Augustus in the 1st century CE, his account of that dynasty is in my view the most searing account of one-man rule ever. He hones in on exposing how corruption works and on exposing the way that people collude with imperial power, the way the empire in the sense, not of the geographical empire, but the empire in the sense of one-man rule, pollutes the Roman state.</p>
</details>

当人们读他的拉丁文时，他们发现很难读懂，实际上，语言非常困难。人们常常会觉得这非常令人沮丧和恼火，但这种语言是有意义的。塔西佗说的是，“我无法描述一人统治是如何运作的，除非用本身就被腐蚀的语言。” 对吧？一人统治腐蚀了你所说的话。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">When people read his Latin, they find him very hard to read, actually, the language is extremely difficult. People can often find that very frustrating and irritating, but that language has a point. What Tacitus is saying is that "I cannot describe how one-man rule works except in language that is itself corrupted," right? One-man rule corrupts what you say.</p>
</details>

在某些方面，我认为塔西佗的现代继承人是乔治·奥威尔，他看到语言的腐败和言论的腐败与权力的腐败相伴而行。

<details>

### 历史叙事中缺失的女性

你可能注意到了，我在编制名单时肯定注意到了，上面没有女性。看，我是一个女权主义者，我一直在反思，但我认为我本可以找到一个女人，我本可以找到，例如，奥古斯都皇帝的妻子莉维娅，我本可以把她放进去，在某些方面，这会让我感觉好一些，而不是一个全男性的阵容。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You might notice, and I certainly noticed when I was compiling the list, that there were no women on it. Look, I'm a feminist, and I had been heart-searching, but I thought I could have found a woman, I could have found, for example, the emperor Augustus's wife, Livia, and I could have put her in there, and in some ways, it would've made me feel better not to have an all-bloke lineup.</p>
</details>

我不认为那是正确的做法。我认为罗马有非常有才华的女性，当然有。有影响力和以各种方式行使权力的女性，当然有。我认为问题在于她们对我们来说已经失落了。我们可以重塑她们，但这确实是重塑。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I don't think that would've been the right thing to do. I think that there were women of immense talent in Rome, of course, there were. There were women who had influence and who exercised power in all kinds of ways, of course, there were. I think the problem is that they are lost to us. We can reinvent them, but it is literally reinvention.</p>
</details>

我认为在某种程度上，你必须面对罗马官方世界的男性化，我希望我已经面对了它，并且也看到这里肯定有不同的视角，但它们几乎完全对我们失落了。相反，我们得到的是，当罗马作家思考有权势的女性时，他们确实会想到像奥古斯都的妻子莉维娅这样的人，但她们的权力总是坏的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think that to some extent, you have to face up to the maleness of the official Roman world, I hope that I have faced up to it, and also to see there must have been different perspectives here, but they are almost entirely lost to us. Instead, what we get, when Roman writers think about powerful women, they do think of people like Augustus's wife, Livia, but their power is always for the bad.</p>
</details>

莉维娅在那个早期王朝中的角色是什么？嗯，就是她在罗伯特·格雷夫斯的《我，克劳狄乌斯》中的角色，她是投毒者，阴谋家，是你可以为事情出错而责备的人。我的意思是，女性的权力在古代世界被认为是具有腐蚀性的，无论是克利奥帕特拉，她引诱并以某种方式阉割了像马克·安东尼这样正直的年轻罗马人，还是帝国宫廷的女性，她们在幕后策划，以实现她们自己的情欲，“我下一个要和谁睡觉？”，女性在罗马历史学家看来是臭名昭著的性生物，但也试图影响谁真正登上王位。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, what is the role of Livia in that early dynasty? Well, it's the role that she had in Robert Graves' "I, Claudius," she's the poisoner, the schemer, she's the person that you can blame for why things went wrong. I mean, women's power is perceived in the ancient world as being corrosive, whether that's Cleopatra who is seducing and somehow emasculating upstanding young Romans like Mark Antony, or the women of the imperial court who are scheming behind the scenes to bring about either their own erotic desires, "Who am I going to sleep with next?", women are notoriously sexual beings for Roman historians, but also trying to influence who actually gets on the throne.</p>
</details>

问题是，情况可能就是这样，我们无法知道。但我们确实知道，当男人搞砸事情时，女人总是非常方便的替罪羊。西方厌女症的历史非常擅长在事情出错时找女人来背锅，我认为这或多或少始于罗马帝国。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, the trouble is, that might have been the case, we can't know. But we do know that women are always very convenient people to blame for when men mess things up. The history of Western misogyny is very adept at finding women to blame for when things go wrong, and I think it more or less started in the Roman Empire.</p>

### 我们该如何评判历史人物？

我认为如何评判这些人是非常棘手的问题。人们经常写信给我说，“我不喜欢你有时对两千年前的人做出像X是大屠杀凶手这样的判断。当然，”人们常说，“你应该用他们自己的标准来评判他们，而不是用你的标准。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think the question of how you judge these people is very tricky. People often write in to me and say, "I don't like the way that you do sometimes make judgments about X as a mass murderer, when they're 2000 years in the past. Surely, it's often said, "You should be judging them on their own terms, not on your terms."</p>
</details>

对此我有两个回应。一个是，很多时候，这些人在古代本身就受到了敌对的评判，但我们往往对此视而不见。例如，尤利乌斯·凯撒，现在估计他在对高卢的战役中可能杀害了大约一百万高卢人，当时罗马就有人说他犯下了反人类罪。凯撒是战犯并不是一个新发明，罗马就有人这么说。所以我认为我们必须非常小心，始终倾听古代本身的不和谐声音。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I've got two responses to that. One is, quite often, these people were hostilely judged in antiquity itself, but we rather brush that under the carpet. Julius Caesar, for example, it's reckoned now that he may well have killed about a million Gauls in his campaign against Gaul, and there were people in Rome who said he was committing crimes against humanity. This is not a new invention that Caesar was a war criminal, there were people in Rome who said that. So I think we have to be very careful always to listen out for the discordant voices in antiquity itself.</p>
</details>

但我认为也许更重要的是，历史学家的工作，这在某种程度上解释了为什么我们有时会发现对亚历山大大帝的评判摇摆不定，有利或不利，凯撒也是如此，等等，我认为历史学家的工作是拥有立体视觉。我认为在他们自己的背景下，用他们自己的术语，以及人们如何根据他们时代的标准来理解这些人物，这很重要，是的，我认为你应该这样做。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But I think perhaps more important is that the job of the historian, and this kind of explains I think why we sometimes find there's a flip flop here between one sort of judgment of Alexander the Great and another, you know, favorable or not favorable, same with Caesar, whatever, is that the job of the historian I think is to have stereoscopic vision. I think it is important to understand these characters in their own context, and in their own terms, and how people, by the standards of their time, yes, I think you should do that.</p>

但我认为现代历史学家不能把自己的道德价值观留在图书馆门口。在某个时刻，我确实必须说，我发现亚历山大大帝的征服非常非常令人不舒服，我认为我特别不喜欢的是，就我们现代对他们的挪用而言，我们似乎以某种方式赞同他们所做的事情。

<p class="english-text">But I think that the modern historian can't just leave their own moral values, you know, at the library door. I do at a certain point have to say I find the conquests of Alexander the Great, very, very uncomfortable, and I think what I particularly dislike in terms of our modern appropriation of them is the way we somehow seem to go along with approving of what they did.</p>
</details>

我可能不想不赞成它，我可能想说，在某种程度上，按照他们自己时代的标准，那是可以的，但我确实必须说，那不是我们的标准，我们必须认识到，古代发生的事情存在道德问题和疑问，我们不应该害怕把它们揭示出来。我非常乐意这样做。

<p class="english-text">I might not want to disapprove of it, I might want to say, in part, that by the standards of their own time was okay, but I do have to say it's not the standards of ours, and we have to realize that there are moral issues and questions about what happened in antiquity that we shouldn't be afraid of bringing to the surface. I'm very happy to do that.</p>

我的意思是，我认为这很有趣，我为我最有影响力的罗马人选择了一群男人，我认为我别无选择。我也可以说，但我认为罗马帝国的厌女症有些东西是我谴责的。我认为你必须能够同时持有这两种观点。

### 《奥德赛》：从童年故事到复杂的史诗

我第一次接触**《奥德赛》**（English Full Name: The Odyssey，古希腊史诗，传统上被认为是荷马的作品，讲述了英雄奥德修斯在特洛伊战争后返回家乡的漫长旅程）大概是在我七八岁的时候，但那不是接触整部《奥德赛》，而是我们在学校听到的故事，以及我妈妈告诉我的那些从《奥德赛》中提取的故事，比如奥德修斯如何挑战独眼食人巨人独眼巨人，他如何设法经过诱人的塞壬等等。我学到的是《奥德赛》中的故事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I first touched base with "The Odyssey" when I was I suppose about seven or eight, but it wasn't with "The Odyssey" as a whole, it was with the stories that we were told at school, and that my mum told me that were drawn from "The Odyssey," now, how Odysseus challenged the one-eyed cannibal giant, the Cyclops, how he managed to get past the alluring Sirens, et cetera, et cetera. I learned the stories of tales from "The Odyssey."</p>
</details>

直到我十几岁中后期，在高中和大学，我才详细阅读了《奥德赛》。我认为令我惊讶的是，《奥德赛》不仅仅是一个我以为的英勇事迹的故事，它是一个极其复杂的故事，关于一个人试图回家的故事，关于何为男人的问题，以及不看英雄奥德修斯本人，而是看他的儿子忒勒马科斯，关于成长的故事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I didn't read "The Odyssey" in any detail until I was in my mid to late teens, both at high school and at university. And I think what was surprising to me was that "The Odyssey" isn't just a story of tales of daring-do, which is what I thought it was, it's a hugely complicated story about, you know, one man's attempt to get home about questions of what it is to be a man, and questions looking not at Odysseus the hero himself, but looking at his son Telemachus of what it is to grow up.</p>
</details>

我认为当时《奥德赛》真正吸引我的是它的复杂性。它从故事的中间开始，我们一开始没有看到奥德修斯，他本应是英雄，我们把镜头对准伊萨卡，找到了他的家人。最终，当我们听到这些故事时，是奥德修斯讲给别人听的，我们不是第一手看到的。这是你能想象到的最复杂的后现代史诗，直到我从头到尾读完它，我才意识到这一点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What really gripped me I think then about "The Odyssey" was its complexity. The fact that it starts right in the middle of things, we don't see Odysseus for a bit, he's supposed to be the hero, we zoom down on Ithaca and we find his family. Eventually, when we do hear these stories, they are told by Odysseus to somebody else, we don't see them as it were firsthand. It is the most complicated postmodern epic you could ever imagine, and I never realized that until I read it cover to cover.</p>
</details>

古代听众或读者如何理解和接受《奥德赛》是一个非常令人费解和有趣的问题。我们以为我们知道，我的意思是，关于《奥德赛》几乎没有什么事情是真正确定的，但我们以为我们知道，这首诗现在分为24卷，起源于一种吟游诗人文化。它最初是一系列部分相互关联、部分公式化的故事，由吟游诗人在篝火旁或晚饭后演唱。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How ancient listeners or readers, you know, understood and received "The Odyssey" is a really puzzling and intriguing question. We think we know, I mean almost nothing is really certain about "The Odyssey," but we think we know that the poem in its now 24 books originated in a bardic culture. It started life as a series of partly interlocking, partly formulaic tales sung by bards, let's say around a campfire or after dinner in the evening.</p>
</details>

每次表演都略有不同，因为人们会加入不同的部分，观众会说，“哦，今晚我们来听独眼巨人的故事吧。” 我们首先有这种非常流动的口头接受和口头创作，你知道，无论我们认为那是什么年代，你知道，从公元前10世纪开始。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's slightly different each time it was performed as people put different bits in, as the audience would say, "Oh, let's have the Cyclops tonight," you know? We've got this very fluid kind of oral reception and oral production first, you know, whatever date we think that is, you know, anytime from the 10th century BC onward.</p>
</details>

我认为我们很难理解口头听众的复杂性。我怀疑我们有点低估了这种复杂性。我认为，如果我们更多地是一种口头文化而不是书面文化，我们会看到口头要点和口头强调可以以我们可能会错过的方式产生效果。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think it is very, very hard for us to understand the sophistication of oral audiences. You know, I suspect we'd rather minimize the sophistication. I think that if we were more of an oral rather than a written culture, we would see the ways that oral points and oral emphases can hit home in a way that we probably would miss.</p>
</details>

很可能《奥德赛》在经过几代人的口头创作后，达到了某种书面形式，也许最早是在公元前八世纪，无论这是否与一个叫或不叫荷马的人有关，我们一无所知。但它并没有就此停止，我认为很明显，《奥德赛》一直在被整理和修改，直到公元前5世纪。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The likelihood is that "The Odyssey" reached some kind of written form after generations of body composition, perhaps in the eighth century BCE first, whether or not it had anything to do with someone who was or was not called Homer, we haven't a clue. But it didn't just stop there, I think that it's clear that "The Odyssey" is being tidied up and altered right up to the 5th century BC.</p>
</details>

我认为在那个时候，《奥德赛》仍然有口头的一面。我怀疑在公元2世纪仍然有人在听《奥德赛》，但也有非常博学的读者和评论家，他们对《奥德赛》所做的事情与我们所做的很相似，那就是非常仔细地阅读它。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think at that point, we still have an oral aspect to "The Odyssey." I suspect there are still people listening to "The Odyssey" in the 2nd century CE, but there are also very learned readers and commentators who are doing with "The Odyssey" much that we do, which is reading it really carefully at heart.</p>
</details>

看起来，我认为这是古代读者和现代读者的结论，在某个时刻，似乎有一个总体的作者，或一系列的作者，正在把它整理成形，我认为他们读得和我们一样复杂。他们在寻找什么样的文化，什么样的历史文化隐藏在它背后。我们问的关于《奥德赛》的问题可以追溯到很久以前。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It does look, and I think this is the conclusion of ancient readers and modern readers, it does look as if there is at some point, there is a kind of overarching author, or series of authors, who are pulling it into shape, and I think they're reading it as sophisticatedly as we do. They're looking for signs of what kind of culture, what sort of historical culture lies behind this. The kind of questions that we ask about "The Odyssey" do go back a very long way.</p>
</details>

所以我认为在我们的口头专注能力方面存在巨大差异，我确信第一批听众有这种能力，但我也认为我们与《奥德赛》的读者，比如在公元3世纪的亚历山大港的读者，有更多的共同点，他们所做的与我们所做的很相似：非常专注地阅读它。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I think there are huge differences in terms of our ability to concentrate orally, which I'm sure that the first listeners had, but I think we also have much more in common with readers of "The Odyssey," in, you know, 3rd century Alexandria, they were doing much what we are doing: reading it with great attention.</p>

### 翻译即诠释：与《奥德赛》的现代对话

我对克里斯托弗·诺兰的电影感到非常兴奋。《奥德赛》在电影制作人那里运气不太好，我得说。我希望终于有人能给我们一部我们能真正投入的《奥德赛》。我希望它能鼓励很多人去发现或重新发现《奥德赛》，如果他们还没有这样做的话。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I am really excited by the Christopher Nolan film. "The Odyssey" has not had much luck with filmmakers, I have to say. I'm hoping that finally someone will give us an Odyssey that we can really get into. And I hope that it will encourage a lot of people actually to discover or rediscover "The Odyssey," if they haven't done so already.</p>
</details>

这也是为什么在我们的新播客《速成经典》中，我们有一个读书俱乐部，我们将在大约一年的时间里阅读《奥德赛》，逐卷深入讨论。我认为人们必须认识到，他们会发现不同的《奥德赛》，就像他们一直以来一样。如果你看到这部电影将来自的文本是什么，那将有很大帮助。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's one of the reasons that on our new podcast, "Instant Classics," we've got a book club where we will be reading "The Odyssey" over about a year to really talk it through book by book. I think that one has to reckon that people will find different Odysseys as they always have. It helps a huge amount if you see what the text is from which this movie is going to come.</p>
</details>

其中有很多可以谈论的东西，我认为如果人们已经投入其中，这将有助于真正为对诺兰电影的批评或欣赏提供信息。我非常期待在接下来的一年左右，《奥德赛》能迎来一个畅销书榜的辉煌时刻。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There's so much in that to talk about that I think it will help really inform a kind of a criticism or an appreciation of the Nolan film, if people have already got into it. I'm very much looking forward to a great best seller list moment for "The Odyssey," actually, in the next year or so.</p>
</details>

至于翻译，我认为过于规定性不是一个好主意。如果有人从二手书店或网上拿起一本他们能读进去的《奥德赛》译本，那就很好。我认为真正重要的是你有一个英文文本，它们中的大多数都相当可靠。你有一个能带你一起前进的英文文本。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">As for translations, I think it's a bad idea to be too prescriptive. If somebody picks up from a secondhand bookshop or off the web a translation of "The Odyssey" that they get into, that's fine. I think the really important thing is that you have an English text that most of them are pretty reliable. You have an English text which will take you along with it.</p>
</details>

最近，有两本《奥德赛》的译本，我认为如果人们只是问“我应该读哪一本”，我会建议他们去读这两本。一本是几年前艾米莉·威尔逊的《奥德赛》译本，令人惊讶的是，这是第一本由女性翻译成英文的《奥德赛》。还有一本更新的，是丹尼尔·门德尔松的，今年早些时候出版，我认为也非常出色。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In recent times, there've been two translations of "The Odyssey," which I think if people were just saying "Which one should I read," I would suggest they went to, one is Emily Wilson's translation of "The Odyssey" a few years ago, which is amazingly the first translation of "The Odyssey" by a woman into English. There's also an even more recent one by Daniel Mendelsohn, which came out earlier this year, which is also I think excellent.</p>
</details>

他们在翻译上可能有些分歧，但我认为他们彼此之间，都是非常好的、最新的、非常易读的译本。话虽如此，翻译绝对总是诠释。你无法在翻译《奥德赛》的同时不诠释《奥德赛》，也无法不以某种方式与它进行现代对话。你知道，为什么19世纪的翻译常常听起来很生硬，因为他们在与19世纪的人谈论《奥德赛》，他们不是在与我们交谈。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">They have some kind of translator issues, I think with each other, but they are very good up to the minute, very readable translations. That said, you know, translations are absolutely always interpretation. You cannot translate "The Odyssey" without interpreting "The Odyssey" and without, in some way, having a modern conversation with it. You know, why 19th century translations often do sound stilted is 'cause they were talking to 19th century people about "The Odyssey," they're not talking to us.</p>
</details>

我认为译者们通过各种强调手法，帮助我们以新的方式看待一些难题。在威尔逊的翻译中非常清楚的一点是，当她谈到伊萨卡的佩涅罗佩（奥德修斯的妻子）和他的儿子忒勒马科斯家中的奴隶时，她把奴隶翻译成“slaves”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think there are all kinds of emphases that translators come in and help us see some of the difficulties in a new way. And what was very clear in the Wilson translation was that when she was talking about the slaves in the household of Penelope, Odysseus' wife, and his son, Telemachus, in Ithaca, she translated slaves as slaves.</p>
</details>

现在你回到1950年代或之前的大多数标准译本，他们总是或几乎总是使用那个委婉的说法“serving girl”（女仆）。他们实际上掩盖了这种文化中的奴隶制。威尔逊说，她想直面这个问题。当她看到一个被奴役的人时，她会称那个人为“enslaved”（被奴役的）。当然，这确实改变了你对我们在《奥德赛》中看到的社会类型的看法，这是完全合法的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now you go back to most of the standard translations from the 1950s or before, and they always use, or almost always use, that euphemism "serving girl," right? They actually obscure the slavery in this culture. Wilson said, she wanted to look at this head on. And, you know, when she saw an enslaved person, she was going to call that person enslaved. And, of course, it does change your view of the kind of society that we see in "The Odyssey," it's perfectly legitimate.</p>
</details>

在某些方面，你可以说两种翻译在技术上都是合法的，但威尔逊的翻译所做的是说，“更仔细地看看这些人的地位是什么。” 我认为每一个新的翻译总是在增加一些东西，打开一些东西，好吧，也许它也在隐藏一些东西，但它打开了不同的看待方式，在《奥德赛》的案例中也是如此。它不可避免地在努力解决我们不太知道如何翻译的词语。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In some ways, you could say that both translations are technically legitimate, but what Wilson's does is say, "Look a bit more carefully at what the status of these people are." I think that every new translation is always adding something, opening up, yeah, okay, maybe it's concealing things too, but it's opening up different ways of seeing it, it's also in the case of "The Odyssey." it's inevitably grappling with words that we don't quite know how to translate.</p>
</details>

在《奥德赛》的开头几行，奥德修斯，他被谈论着，诗人在呼唤缪斯来讲述这个人的故事，我们还不知道这个人，但这个人是奥德修斯。与“人”搭配的希腊形容词是 **polytropos**，字面意思是“多变的”、“转来转去的”。“告诉我一个多变的人的故事？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Very early in the first couple of lines of "The Odyssey," Odysseus, he's being talked about, the poet is calling to the Muse to tell the story of this man, the man we don't yet know, but the man is a Odysseus. And the Greek adjective that goes with man is polytropos, and it literally means much turning, turny abouty, "Tell me about a much-turning man?"</p>
</details>

几个世纪以来，实际上可以追溯到公元前3世纪《奥德赛》的拉丁文译本，人们一直在想这段文字是什么意思？polytropos 是什么意思？是狡猾的意思吗？是他在航行中饱受颠簸的意思吗？他是走了一条艰难曲折的回家路吗？他有点不值得信赖吗？他聪明吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">For centuries, in fact, back to Latin translations of "The Odyssey," in the 3rd century BC, people have been wondering what the text meant? What does polytropos mean? Does it mean wily? Does it mean bashed around on his voyage? Is he kind of having a terrible, difficult circuitous route home? Is he a bit not trustworthy? Is he clever?</p>
</details>

我认为，一个好的翻译的注释通常会帮助你，当译者解释说，“嘿，看，我很难决定在这里用哪个形容词，这些是我的选择，这些是我这样或那样决定的原因。” 所以我认为……我认为当你对翻译进行深入研究，审视它们，不把它们当作福音，而是把它们看作对文本的诠释性实验时，翻译是最好的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I think that quite often it's possible and the notes on a good translation will help you when the translator explains, "Hey, look, I had trouble deciding what adjective to use here, and these were the choices I had, and these were the reasons that I made my mind up this way or that way." So I think there's something... I think translations are best when you kind of get messy with them, and you interrogate them a bit, and don't take them as Gospel, but take them as interpretive experiments on the text.</p>
</details>
