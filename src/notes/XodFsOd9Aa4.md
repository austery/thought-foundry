title: 中国男人为何如此疲惫？中年男性的困境与等级制的批判
summary: 本文深入探讨了中国男性所面临的多重压力，从身体疲惫、经济焦虑到社会期望。文章以一位49岁中年男性的意外离世为引，揭示了这些困境，并将其与西方国家的社会福利和分配制度进行对比。作者批判性地指出，所谓的“父权制”实为一种深层的“等级制”，它在底层同时压榨男性和女性。文章还分析了“雄竞”现象和传统性别观念与现代女权思潮的冲突，最终呼吁瓦解等级制，实现真正的平等。

### 中国男性的多重困境：从身体到心灵的疲惫

大家好，欢迎收看夸克说。我是夸克。本期节目我们将探讨一个可能引起许多人共鸣的话题：中国男人为何如此疲惫？在此需要提前说明，讨论中国男性的疲惫并非意味着女性不累，只是本期节目聚焦于男性。如果大家对女性的困境感兴趣，也欢迎在评论区留言，我们改天可以单独制作一期节目。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Hello everyone, welcome to Quark Says. I am Quark. In this episode, we will discuss a topic that many people may resonate with: why are Chinese men so tired? I need to clarify upfront that discussing the tiredness of Chinese men does not mean women are not tired; it's just that this episode focuses on men. If you are interested in the plight of women, please feel free to leave a comment, and we can make a separate episode another day.</p>
</details>

之所以制作这期节目，是因为我昨天看到一位女生发布了一个帖子，讲述她49岁的堂哥不幸去世。我在此稍微念一下帖子的内容：“49岁的堂哥突发**脑瘀血**（Cerebral Hemorrhage: 脑部血管破裂引起的出血）走了。他说我们家唯一的男丁，我爸很喜欢他。他**好高骛远**（Overambitious: 指脱离实际地追求过高过远的目标），一辈子创业无数次。他**油嘴滑舌**（Glib-tongued: 形容说话油滑，不诚恳），一辈子没结婚，更没生孩子，最后靠着他老父亲的钱混日子。我心里总是不服气，很多时候都想着比他强，心里也鄙视他，甚至有时候也会私下讨论他。但听到他离世的消息，到现在脑海中只有他微笑着叫我妹妹的样子，只想着他是我爸最喜欢的侄儿。可他却在我爸离世三年后也突然离世，留下了他八十多岁的父母，留下了一辈子想**光宗耀祖**（Bring honor to ancestors: 指使家族荣耀，扬名显亲）的遗憾。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The reason I made this episode is because yesterday I saw a girl post about her 49-year-old cousin's passing. I'll read a bit of the post here: "My 49-year-old cousin passed away suddenly from a cerebral hemorrhage. He was the only male in our family, and my dad loved him very much. He was overambitious, started countless businesses throughout his life. He was glib-tongued, never married, never had children, and ended up living off his elderly father's money. I always felt a sense of injustice, often wanting to be better than him, and I secretly looked down on him, even discussing him privately sometimes. But upon hearing the news of his death, all I can think of now is his smiling face calling me 'little sister,' only remembering that he was my dad's favorite nephew. Yet, he suddenly passed away three years after my dad's death, leaving behind his parents in their eighties, and a lifelong regret of wanting to bring honor to his ancestors."</p>
</details>

这个帖子瞬间引发了众多男性的共鸣，大家纷纷在评论区留言，大意是他们在这个堂哥身上看到了自己和无数中国男性的缩影。因为他是家族这一代唯一的男丁，大概率被全家寄予了厚望，他也想通过自己的努力光耀门楣，所以才会不停创业。结果呢，却成了堂妹口中的好高骛远。同时，又因为没资源、没人脉，他只能对堂妹讨好，而这在堂妹眼里就成了油嘴滑舌。与此同时，因为传统观念，他又不想在功成名就前娶妻生子，于是就一直耽搁着。结果他至死也没成功，反而成了不理解他的堂妹眼中的笑柄。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This post instantly resonated with many men, who left comments expressing that they saw themselves and countless Chinese men reflected in this cousin. As the only male heir of his generation in the family, he was likely burdened with high expectations from his entire family. He also wanted to bring honor to his family through his own efforts, which led him to continuously pursue entrepreneurship. The result, however, was that he became "overambitious" in his cousin's eyes. At the same time, lacking resources and connections, he could only ingratiate himself with his cousin, which she perceived as "glib-tongued." Meanwhile, due to traditional beliefs, he didn't want to marry and have children before achieving success, so he kept delaying it. In the end, he never succeeded before his death, becoming a laughingstock in the eyes of his cousin, who didn't understand him.</p>
</details>

应该说，这些评论确实反映了当今相当一部分中国男性的心声，那就是中国男人太累了。那中国男人到底为什么这么累呢？这种情况是中国独有的吗？接下来，咱们就来聊聊这个话题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It should be said that these comments indeed reflect the sentiments of a significant portion of Chinese men today: Chinese men are too tired. So, why are Chinese men so tired? Is this situation unique to China? Next, let's discuss this topic.</p>
</details>

### 三种“累”：身体、经济与无形社会成本

在开始讨论前，咱们照例先定义一下我们所说的“累”指的到底是什么。第一种，也是最直观的，就是身体累。比如大清早挤地铁，熬夜加班到凌晨两点，第二天上午九点还得赶到会展现场。这一点相信在国内上过班的人或多或少都有体会。就以我自己为例，我有次周五晚上正跟当时的女朋友一起在电影院看电影，突然被项目负责人临时抓去开会。结果这个会从头天晚上九点一直开到了第二天中午十二点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Before we begin our discussion, let's first define what we mean by "tired." The first, and most direct, is physical exhaustion. For example, squeezing onto the subway early in the morning, working overtime until 2 AM, and then having to rush to an exhibition site by 9 AM the next day. I believe anyone who has worked in China has experienced this to some extent. Taking myself as an example, one Friday night I was watching a movie with my then-girlfriend at the cinema when I was suddenly called into an impromptu meeting by the project manager. This meeting lasted from 9 PM that night until 12 PM the next day.</p>
</details>

回家以后，女朋友听着我嘶哑的声音，直接抱着我就哭了，说：“咱能不能不干了？”当然，也只是抱怨抱怨，因为你换个公司情况也差不多，高强度工作其实是国内，起码是北京生活的常态。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">After returning home, my girlfriend heard my hoarse voice, hugged me, and cried, asking, "Can we just quit?" Of course, it was just a complaint, because if you switched companies, the situation would be similar; high-intensity work is actually the norm in China, at least in Beijing.</p>
</details>

第二种类是来自经济压力带来的焦虑。我到了加拿大以后发现自己有个毛病，就是一闲下来，比如出去度假或者什么都不干就那么待着，就觉得不踏实，有种负罪感，觉得自己又浪费了一天。后来仔细一琢磨，发现这个毛病是在中国养成的。因为从小到大几十年都处于那种高压状态，每天都安排得满满当当的，哪怕没安排自己也得找点事做。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The second type of tiredness comes from the anxiety caused by economic pressure. After I arrived in Canada, I discovered a habit of mine: whenever I'm idle, for example, on vacation or just doing nothing, I feel uneasy, a sense of guilt, as if I've wasted another day. Later, upon careful reflection, I realized this habit was developed in China. Because for decades, from childhood to adulthood, I was always in a high-pressure state, with every day fully scheduled; even if there wasn't a schedule, I felt compelled to find something to do.</p>
</details>

严格来说，我在国内时的经济压力比大多数人轻，房和车都买得早，也没什么债务，那时没孩子，父母也不用我养老。如果连我都有这种感觉，那想必很多人都有。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Strictly speaking, my economic pressure in China was lighter than most people's; I bought a house and a car early, had no debt, no children at the time, and my parents didn't need me for their retirement. If even I felt this way, then surely many others do too.</p>
</details>

第三种类叫**心累**（Mental/Emotional Exhaustion: 指精神或心理上的疲惫，而非身体上的劳累），也就是整个社会给到你的无形的合规成本。简单来说，作为男性，社会会对你产生某种期待，认为你应该按照那个大家观念里男人的样子生活。比如你是个男的，你就必须坚强，扛得住压力，永远保持理性，不能情绪失控。女朋友难过了可以趴在你身上大哭一场，或者对你抱怨她的老板同事，但你要这么干，就会被认为是不成熟、没长大，让女生缺少安全感。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The third type is called mental exhaustion, which refers to the invisible compliance costs that society imposes on you. Simply put, as a man, society has certain expectations of you, believing you should live according to the common perception of what a man should be. For example, if you're a man, you must be strong, able to withstand pressure, always remain rational, and never lose emotional control. A girlfriend can cry on your shoulder or complain about her boss and colleagues, but if you were to do the same, you would be considered immature, not grown up, and lacking in providing a sense of security for women.</p>
</details>

去年还是什么时候，我看了一部电影，觉得很感人，哭了。然后老婆吓了一跳，说：“我认识你十几年了，这是第一次见你哭。”类似的，我这辈子也只见到我爸哭过一次，就是在我叔叔的葬礼上。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Last year, or whenever it was, I watched a movie that I found very touching and I cried. My wife was startled and said, "I've known you for over ten years, and this is the first time I've seen you cry." Similarly, I've only seen my dad cry once in my life, and that was at my uncle's funeral.</p>
</details>

除开上面这种隐形的，还有显性的。比如你必须得考名校，到了一定岁数得结婚生孩子，当然前提是会赚钱能养家糊口，否则你就不配有老婆孩子。工作方面最好考公或者进**央企**（Central State-Owned Enterprises: 指由中央政府直接管理的大型国有企业），老了以后最好能守在父母身边，这样才算孝顺等等等等。以上是三种累，我相信帖子里那位英年猝死的堂哥肯定都遇到过。屏幕前的你也可以对比一下，你或者你身边的男性朋友都体会过几种？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Besides these invisible expectations, there are also explicit ones. For example, you must get into a prestigious university, and by a certain age, you must marry and have children – provided, of course, that you can earn money and support a family; otherwise, you're not worthy of a wife and children. In terms of work, it's best to pass the civil service exam or join a central state-owned enterprise. In old age, it's best to stay by your parents' side to be considered filial, and so on. These are the three types of tiredness, and I believe the cousin who died prematurely, as mentioned in the post, must have experienced all of them. You, watching this, can also compare how many of these types you or your male friends have experienced.</p>

### 中国困境的全球对比：福利保障与社会分配

那以上这几种情况是中国独有的吗？其他国家的人也有这么累吗？咱们先看一段视频。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, are these situations unique to China? Are people in other countries also this tired? Let's watch a video first.</p>
</details>

美国的底层民众他们的生活水平究竟有多难受？这是一名有三个孩子的单亲妈妈，孩子分别是一岁、四岁和八岁。她的职业是教师，年薪在三万七千美元，今年已经三十七岁。对于要养育三个孩子的母亲来说，显然是不够的，而且居住条件也是十分艰苦朴素。从2008年开始，米歇尔就已经开始当老师了，一直到今年已经做了十七年的教师，但是工资却常年未涨。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How difficult is life for the working-class people in the United States? This is a single mother with three children, aged one, four, and eight. She is a teacher, earning an annual salary of $37,000, and she is thirty-seven years old this year. For a mother raising three children, this is clearly insufficient, and her living conditions are very difficult and modest. Michelle started teaching in 2008 and has been a teacher for seventeen years now, but her salary has not increased for years.</p>
</details>

米歇尔表示自己干这份工作主要是因为热爱，否则这种薪资是很难坚持的，所以她必须寻找不同的兼职才能维持生存。每天米歇尔是九点上班，再三点下班，结束了恐怖的七个小时后，米歇尔立即就需要开始第二份工作，而她选择的兼职就是去送外卖。米歇尔表示，送一单外卖只有可怜的两美元至五美元，每天最主要的还是靠顾客的小费。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Michelle stated that she primarily does this job out of passion, otherwise it would be very difficult to sustain with such a salary, so she has to find different part-time jobs to make ends meet. Every day, Michelle starts work at 9 AM and finishes at 3 PM. After a grueling seven hours, Michelle immediately has to start her second job, which is delivering food. Michelle said that each delivery only earns a meager two to five dollars, and her main income each day relies on customer tips.</p>
</details>

米歇尔从小就有一个美国梦，感觉自己长大后只需要得到一份工作就能轻松地养家糊口。但是她认为自己的梦想已经裂开，美国梦骗了她。米歇尔通常在下午六点就结束了一天的工作，她送三个小时的外卖，每天的平均收入除去邮费只有三十美元左右，所以是十分不容易。米歇尔感觉现在的美国各大政客已经不知道民间疾苦了。虽然现在政府已经对自己全额免税，也有住房补贴和儿童照料补贴，还有每月三百美元左右的食品补贴以及五百美元的现金补贴，但这远远不够。所以米歇尔希望美国政府应该要深入群众，了解底层民众的需求，不要张嘴就来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Michelle had an American dream since childhood, feeling that once she grew up, she would only need one job to easily support her family. However, she believes her dream has shattered, and the American dream has deceived her. Michelle usually finishes her day's work by 6 PM; she delivers food for three hours, and her average daily income, after deducting postage, is only about thirty dollars, which is extremely difficult. Michelle feels that current American politicians are out of touch with the struggles of the common people. Although the government now provides her with full tax exemption, housing subsidies, childcare subsidies, about $300 per month in food subsidies, and $500 in cash subsidies, it's far from enough. Therefore, Michelle hopes the U.S. government should engage with the public, understand the needs of the working class, and not just make empty promises.</p>
</details>

这个视频本来是吐槽美国底层人民生活水深火热，结果评论区全面翻车。大部分评论都是：“原来美国的单亲妈妈每天只需要工作八个小时就能养活三个娃！”现实情况也是如此。以我身边为例，我到加拿大以后雇了一个白人大姐帮我看儿子。她就是个单亲妈妈，一个人带五个孩子，大女儿十七岁，小儿子四岁。一家六口租住在一个两百多平米的独立屋。那她的工作强度有多高呢？通常是上午去餐馆或者超市打工，下午帮我带娃大概两到三个小时。她这种情况如果在中国，别说住两百平米养五个娃了，连养活自己都困难，而且大概率还是跟人合租。但在加拿大，因为医疗教育都免费，算上政府给孩子和低收入家庭的各种补助和税收减免，她就能做到。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This video was originally intended to criticize the dire living conditions of America's working class, but the comment section completely backfired. Most comments were, "So, an American single mother only needs to work eight hours a day to support three children!" And the reality is indeed like this. Taking my own experience as an example, after I moved to Canada, I hired a white woman to help me look after my son. She is a single mother raising five children alone, with her eldest daughter being seventeen and her youngest son four. The family of six rents a detached house over 200 square meters. How intense is her work? She usually works at a restaurant or supermarket in the morning, and then helps me with childcare for about two to three hours in the afternoon. If she were in China, let alone living in a 200-square-meter house and raising five children, she would struggle to even support herself, and most likely would have to share an apartment. But in Canada, because healthcare and education are free, and with various government subsidies and tax breaks for children and low-income families, she can manage it.</p>
</details>

所以之前墙内搞什么中美对账，一堆美国IP跑到小红书上卖惨，说美国底层生活多么多么艰辛，小粉红们各种高潮时，我都是直接当成笑话。因为美国人认为的“惨”跟中国压根就不是一个标准。他觉得每天工作八小时，一年没有两次度假，一家三口住一百五十平米的联排就算很惨了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, when there were discussions comparing China and the US online, and a bunch of American IPs went on Xiaohongshu to complain about how difficult life was for the American working class, and the "little pinks" (Chinese nationalists) were all excited, I simply treated it as a joke. Because what Americans consider "miserable" is simply not the same standard as in China. They think working eight hours a day, not having two vacations a year, and a family of three living in a 150-square-meter townhouse is already quite miserable.</p>
</details>

这个道理就跟美国人总抱怨大萧条是多么多么悲惨，**胡福炖菜**（Hoover Stew: 指大萧条时期美国穷人吃的廉价食物，通常由通心粉、黄豆、番茄酱和午餐肉组成）都不是人吃的，结果中国人一看人家的食谱，**通心粉**（Macaroni: 一种管状意大利面）、**黄豆**（Soybeans: 一种豆类作物）、**番茄酱**（Ketchup/Tomato Sauce: 以番茄为主要原料的调味酱）、**午餐肉**（Spam/Canned Luncheon Meat: 一种罐装肉制品），还是政府免费提供的。类似的，像中学课本里**莫博桑**（Guy de Maupassant）的名篇《我的叔叔于勒》里原文提到主角一家生活很拮据，平时吃的是肉汤和各种方式做的牛肉。后来编者觉得不太合适，就把这段给悄悄删除了，因为一百年以后的中国人很多都吃不上牛肉。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This is similar to how Americans always complain about how tragic the Great Depression was, and that Hoover Stew was not fit for human consumption. But when Chinese people look at their recipe – macaroni, soybeans, tomato sauce, and luncheon meat – and it was even provided free by the government. Similarly, in Guy de Maupassant's famous short story "My Uncle Jules" from middle school textbooks, the original text mentioned that the protagonist's family lived very frugally, usually eating meat broth and beef prepared in various ways. Later, the editors felt it was inappropriate and quietly deleted this passage, because many Chinese people a hundred years later couldn't even afford beef.</p>
</details>

之所以会产生这个差异，最主要的原因其实就两条：一是绝大部分国家都建立起了相对完善的福利保障体系，从教育、医疗到低收入补贴，能给兜底；二是这些国家的社会分配制度相对公平，没有那么大的由贪腐引发的贫富差距。说白了，下限相对高，对社会底层而言，即使不那么拼，也能有一个相对体面的生活。但对多数的中国人来说，你不努力工作成为人上人，那你的生活基本就是地狱级难度，毫无生活品质可言。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There are two main reasons for this difference: first, most countries have established relatively comprehensive welfare systems, from education and healthcare to low-income subsidies, providing a safety net; second, the social distribution systems in these countries are relatively fair, without the vast wealth disparity caused by corruption. In short, the lower limit is relatively high, meaning that for the bottom of society, even if they don't strive as hard, they can still have a relatively decent life. But for most Chinese people, if you don't work hard to become a top-tier person, your life is basically hellish, with no quality of life to speak of.</p>
</details>

我之前在北京的时候，曾经有段时间把房子委托给了中介，结果他们违反合同给改成了**群租房**（Shared Apartment/Subdivided Housing: 指将一套房屋分隔成多个小房间出租给多人的居住形式）。我跑过去一看，一百多平米的一个两居，声称给隔成了十一间，住十四个人，每间月租一千多。就连阳台都封起来做成了上下铺。里面住的都是国贸上班的小年轻，每天一大早得排队上厕所，厨房里两三个人一起刷牙。为什么呢？因为附近两居或者三居里的一个单间，哪怕小卧也得三千五往上。多少上班族一个月工资才四五千，他不住群租房能怎么办？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">When I was in Beijing, for a period I entrusted my apartment to an agent, and they violated the contract by converting it into a subdivided apartment. When I went to see it, a two-bedroom apartment of over 100 square meters was claimed to be divided into eleven rooms, housing fourteen people, with each room renting for over a thousand yuan per month. Even the balcony was enclosed and made into bunk beds. The residents were young professionals working in Guomao, who had to queue for the toilet every morning, and two or three people would brush their teeth together in the kitchen. Why? Because a single room in a nearby two or three-bedroom apartment, even a small one, would cost 3,500 yuan or more. How many office workers earn only four to five thousand yuan a month? What can they do if they don't live in subdivided housing?</p>
</details>

中国大城市的居住条件之差，你放眼全世界，哪怕香港、东京这种以人均居住面积狭小而著称的地方，也难以望其项背。这种情况，你像开头猝死的那位堂哥，没人脉、没背景、没资源，他不创业能怎么办呢？光靠上班什么时候才能过上有尊严的生活？

When could he live a dignified life just by working a regular job?</p>

### “父权制”的伪概念：实为等级制下的工具人

有人可能会说，你说的这个情况对男女不是一样的吗？男生租不起房难道女生就租得起了？你说的对，但问题是中国社会是给女性设计了退出机制的。我租不起房还可以跟男朋友或者老公一起住，因为按默认的规则，房租或者买房得男的出钱。并且即便不谈恋爱不结婚，承受不了在大城市工作的压力，事业也没起色，你还可以回老家跟爸妈一起住，也没人会唧唧歪歪说你废柴、**啃老**（Boomerang Kids/Dependent Adults: 指成年子女依靠父母供养生活）什么的。这些词主要是给男性准备的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Some might say, isn't what you're describing the same for both men and women? If men can't afford rent, can women? You're right, but the problem is that Chinese society has designed an exit mechanism for women. If I can't afford rent, I can live with my boyfriend or husband, because by default, the man is expected to pay for rent or buy a house. And even if you don't date or marry, can't handle the pressure of working in a big city, and your career isn't taking off, you can still go back to your hometown and live with your parents, and no one will nag you about being useless or a "boomerang kid." These terms are primarily reserved for men.</p>
</details>

听到这部分女性观众可能不高兴了，说：“你不就是在阴阳怪气说我们女的占男的便宜吗？”我还真不是这个意思。上周我讲《利古索哈》那期的时候曾经说过，父权在权而不在父。因为篇幅的限制，这段话没有展开，这里可以稍微讲透一点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Some female viewers might be unhappy hearing this, saying, "Aren't you just implying that we women are taking advantage of men?" I genuinely don't mean that. Last week, when I discussed the episode on "Liguso Ha," I mentioned that patriarchy lies in power, not in the father. Due to space constraints, that point wasn't fully elaborated, but here I can explain it a bit more thoroughly.</p>
</details>

**父权**（Patriarchy: 指男性在社会、政治、经济和家庭中占据主导地位的社会结构）是这个词，英文叫Patriarchy，意思是一个由男人拥有全部或者绝大部分权利的社会或者群体。但这个概念我认为是伪概念。为什么呢？因为这个说法实际上暗示了这么一种情况，也就是这个社会的所有男性用类似结社的方式结成了一个统一管理、有纪律、有相同目标和愿景、行动高度协同的组织，以便于打压或者奴役女性。这种情况用来形容中共的一党专政是OK的，比如党中央一声令下，整个四川的党员和军警就能结合起来跑去镇压和殴打江油的民众，哪怕里面有这些人自己的家属。因为前者是高度组织化的，服从统一调令。但你什么时候听说过哪个男的一声号令，全城的男性就都接受调遣，掉头打自己的老妈、老婆和女儿，或者换个说法，打自己的GRO呢？显然不可能对吧？如果哪个男的打你老婆，你肯定是上去跟他拼命，而不会因为对方跟你都是男性你们就成一伙子了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The term is patriarchy, meaning a society or group where men hold all or most of the power. But I believe this concept is a pseudo-concept. Why? Because this statement actually implies a situation where all men in society form a unified, disciplined organization with common goals and visions, acting in highly coordinated ways, similar to an association, in order to suppress or enslave women. This description is suitable for describing the CCP's one-party dictatorship; for example, with an order from the Party Central Committee, all party members and military police in Sichuan can unite to suppress and beat the people of Jiangyou, even if their own family members are among them. This is because the former is highly organized and obeys unified commands. But when have you ever heard of a man giving an order, and all the men in the city accept the command, turning around to beat their own mothers, wives, and daughters, or, to put it another way, beating their GROs? Obviously impossible, right? If a man hits your wife, you would definitely fight him, and you wouldn't side with him just because you are both men.</p>
</details>

再举个例子，我们都知道中国历史上曾经出现过多次太后废掉皇帝的例子，类似**吕后**、**武则天**、**慈禧**这样掌握了最高权力的女性的例子不少。在他们各自所处的年代，他们的实际权力都要远高于坐在皇位上的那个男性继承人，哪怕对方已经成年了。那你能说武则天在位的时候，整个社会的所有或者绝大部分权力是被男性掌握的吗？有点牵强对吧？所以如果要精准地描述中国一直以来的社会结构，可能用**家长制**（Patronage System: 指以家庭或家族为核心，权力集中于少数长辈或核心人物的社会管理模式）或者**等级制**（Hierarchy: 指社会成员根据地位、权力或财富等因素划分等级的系统）这样的表述会更合适一些。也就是通过系统性的等级安排和组织管理来将权力集中到少数人手上，只要你处于那些关键节点和**生态位**（Ecological Niche: 在社会学中指个体或群体在社会结构中的位置和功能），你就能掌握权力，这跟你的性别无关。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">To give another example, we all know that in Chinese history, there have been many instances of empress dowagers deposing emperors. There are numerous examples of women like Empress Lü, Wu Zetian, and Empress Dowager Cixi who held supreme power. In their respective eras, their actual power far exceeded that of the male heir on the throne, even if the latter was already an adult. So, can you say that during Wu Zetian's reign, all or most of society's power was held by men? It's a bit far-fetched, right? Therefore, to accurately describe China's long-standing social structure, terms like "patronage system" or "hierarchy" might be more appropriate. This means that power is concentrated in the hands of a few through systematic hierarchical arrangements and organizational management. As long as you are in those key nodes and ecological niches, you can wield power, regardless of your gender.</p>

比如《红楼梦》里，**贾政**对于**贾宝玉**当然是拥有更高权力和地位的父，但整个大观园里地位最高的是谁？是**贾母**。贾政见了自己的老娘也得下跪对吧？因为儒家搞的其实是家长制，家庭内部的等级序列是按辈分而不是完全按性别来的，否则就应该是母亲听儿子的了。只要女性占据了家长这个生态位，就成了事实上的父。也就是说，父并不必然是男性。这个道理就像我们不能把奴隶制叫做白权制一样，因为奴隶主并不一定是白人，他既可以是黑人，也可以是北美原住民、阿拉伯人或者中国人。

<p class="english-text">For example, in "Dream of the Red Chamber," Jia Zheng certainly holds higher power and status as a father to Jia Baoyu, but who holds the highest status in the entire Grand View Garden? It's Grandmother Jia. Jia Zheng had to kneel before his own mother, right? Because Confucianism actually implemented a patronage system, where the internal hierarchy of the family was based on seniority, not entirely on gender; otherwise, mothers would have to obey their sons. As long as a woman occupied the ecological niche of the family head, she became the de facto patriarch. In other words, a patriarch is not necessarily male. This principle is like how we cannot call slavery "white supremacy," because slave owners are not necessarily white; they could be Black, Native American, Arab, or Chinese.</p>

那么，这个被称为父权，实际上是等级制的制度是怎么运行的呢？我之前在讲《共产主义三部曲》的时候曾经说过一个观点，就是共产主义其实是用人民、无产阶级这些生造出来的概念取代了基督教里的上帝，成为了新神。这中间用到的手法叫**戴高帽**（Flattery/Elevating: 指通过虚假的赞美或抬高来操控他人），就是故意把事实上处于社会最底层的工人农民捧上神坛，说你们是这个国家的主人，让你们产生道德上的优越感，挑唆你们斗地主资本家，但实际的权利和利益都和你们无关，你们只是炮灰而已。

<p class="english-text">So, how does this system, called patriarchy but actually a hierarchy, operate? I once made a point when discussing "The Communist Trilogy" that communism essentially replaced God in Christianity with fabricated concepts like "the people" and "the proletariat," making them new gods. The method used here is called "flattery," which means deliberately elevating workers and peasants, who are actually at the very bottom of society, to a divine status, telling them they are the masters of the country, making them feel morally superior, and instigating them to fight landlords and capitalists. However, actual rights and interests have nothing to do with them; they are merely cannon fodder.</p>
</details>

名为父权的等级制其实也用了类似的手法，也就是制造了一种幻觉，让全社会都以为这个社会是由男性掌控，男尊女卑的。而实际掌握权力的只是处于金字塔尖的那一小撮男性以及少部分女性。但这些人和底层里的同性别，其实已经不是一个物种了。**习近平**和你不是兄弟，**孟晚舟**和你也不是姐妹，他们跟你的关系就跟农场主跟公猪、女农场主跟母牛的关系一样。但因为多数人在谈到男性、女性这样的划分时，往往会笼统地混为一谈，从而给人产生了错觉：男的是一波，女的是一波。然后一帮男的就产生了“我是社会的主人翁，家庭顶梁柱”的错觉，心甘情愿地接受规训，自我牺牲，成为等级制希望你成为那个工具人，然后还觉得自己是个负责任的好男人。这种行为和少先队员看了自己胸前飘扬的红领巾就感动得热泪盈眶，觉得自己是社会主义接班人，然后从路边捡起一分钱交给警察叔叔，本质上是一回事。用**波夫娃**（Simone de Beauvoir）的那句话：“男人是后天成为的男人，是一种处境。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The hierarchy, masquerading as patriarchy, actually employs a similar tactic: it creates an illusion that society is controlled by men, with men superior to women. In reality, power is held only by a small group of men and a few women at the very top of the pyramid. But these individuals and those of the same gender at the bottom are essentially no longer the same species. Xi Jinping is not your brother, and Meng Wanzhou is not your sister; their relationship with you is like that of a farmer with a boar, or a female farmer with a cow. However, because most people tend to broadly lump men and women together when discussing such divisions, it creates a misconception: men are one group, women are another. Then, a group of men develops the illusion that "I am the master of society, the backbone of the family," willingly accepting discipline, sacrificing themselves, becoming the tool that the hierarchy wants them to be, and still believing they are responsible good men. This behavior is essentially the same as a Young Pioneer being moved to tears by the fluttering red scarf on their chest, believing they are successors to socialism, and then picking up a penny from the roadside to hand it to a police officer. To quote Simone de Beauvoir: "One is not born, but rather becomes, a man; it is a situation."</p>
</details>

当然，这种规训肯定不能只针对男性，还得同步给女性洗脑。也就是说，男女在这场等级制的游戏里遵循的是同一套规范。在这套规范里，底层男性欣然戴上了高帽，以做一炉努力而崇高的炮灰为荣，并且他身边的女性也都是这么认为的。而为了让被规训的男女各司其职，等级制又发展出了一整套戒律，让两边各自按照自己的剧本表演。男人必须假装强大，否则就会被看不起；女人必须扮演柔弱，以便配合演出。演得久了，大家也就各自入戏，出不来了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Of course, this indoctrination cannot target only men; women must also be brainwashed simultaneously. This means that both men and women follow the same set of rules in this hierarchical game. Within this framework, men at the bottom gladly accept their elevated status, priding themselves on being hardworking and noble cannon fodder, and the women around them also believe this. To ensure that the indoctrinated men and women fulfill their respective roles, the hierarchy has developed a complete set of commandments, making both sides perform according to their own scripts. Men must pretend to be strong, or they will be looked down upon; women must play the role of being delicate to complement the performance. After playing these roles for a long time, everyone becomes deeply immersed and cannot escape.</p>
</details>

有人可能会好奇，说就算等级制想找炮灰、找冤大头戴高帽，为什么偏偏是男性呢？其实说来也简单，因为女性天生离生育更近，男的没法生孩子，没法哺乳，在孩子年幼时起到的照顾作用也比不上女性。所以他们天然就是更好的牛马、打工人，适合作为“睡鸡”。这个道理就跟农场主总会把公猪阉了做成罐头，而留下母猪产崽一样，并不是对哪一方更好，而只是各司其职。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Some might wonder, even if the hierarchy wants cannon fodder, scapegoats, and people to flatter, why specifically men? The answer is quite simple: women are naturally closer to reproduction; men cannot give birth or breastfeed, and their caregiving role for young children is not comparable to women's. Therefore, they are naturally better beasts of burden, laborers, suitable as "sleepy chickens." This principle is like how farmers always castrate male pigs to make canned meat while keeping female pigs for breeding; it's not about favoring one side over the other, but simply about fulfilling different roles.</p>
</details>

之前在讨论“立功”概念时，很多人，包括部分女生都提到了一个观点，说“立功男”的悲哀在于他们都是工具人，而忘了发展自己的个性，也就是所有人，甚至包括他们自己，都只看重他们身上的工具性价值——有什么用？就像开头那位堂哥一样，长辈喜欢他是因为他有可能创业成功光宗耀祖，他的自我定位也可能是这样。如果他结婚了，老婆看中的可能是他有没有能力让孩子住大房子、上私立学校。反过来，如果有了下一代，他也有可能更在乎儿子能不能给自己养老送终。在这个过程中，没有人在乎他的感受，他喜欢什么、讨厌什么、有什么梦想、快不快乐。这个道理就像你打车去机场，只会在意司机能不能准时给你送到，免得误机，你也不会在意师傅中午吃没吃饭、肚子饿不饿。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Previously, when discussing the concept of "meritorious men," many people, including some women, raised the point that the tragedy of "meritorious men" lies in their being mere tools, forgetting to develop their own individuality. That is, everyone, including themselves, only values their instrumental worth – what use are they? Just like the cousin mentioned at the beginning, his elders liked him because he might succeed in business and bring honor to the family, and his self-perception might also be this way. If he married, his wife might value whether he could afford a big house and private schooling for their children. Conversely, if he had a next generation, he might care more about whether his son could support him in old age. In this process, no one cares about his feelings, what he likes or dislikes, what dreams he has, or whether he is happy. This is like taking a taxi to the airport; you only care if the driver can get you there on time to avoid missing your flight, and you don't care if the driver has eaten lunch or is hungry.</p>
</details>

但这个观点应该说只对了一半，因为在“立功”思维里，身为工具人的并不仅仅是男性，也包括女性。在女性看来，“立功”是幼崽的供养者，但在“立功”和顶层那些人的眼里，女人又何尝不是“立功”们传宗接代、为国家繁育下一代小“立功”的工具呢？女性的烦恼不也经常源于没人在乎她们的喜怒哀乐，最多给点生活费吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">However, this view is only half correct, because in the "meritorious service" mindset, not only men but also women are treated as tools. From a woman's perspective, "meritorious men" are providers for offspring, but in the eyes of "meritorious men" and those at the top, aren't women also tools for "meritorious men" to procreate and raise the next generation of "little meritorious men" for the country? Don't women's troubles often stem from no one caring about their joys and sorrows, at most providing some living expenses?</p>

### 雄竞内卷与观念转型期的冲突

然后围绕这种冷漠的工具人设定，大部分男性又不得不面对残酷的底层**雄竞**（Male Involution: 指男性之间为争夺社会资源和性资源而展开的过度竞争）。我们都知道一个词叫**雌竞**（Female Involution: 指女性之间为争夺男性资源而展开的过度竞争），指的是女性之间为了争夺男性资源而展开的竞争。但男性的雄竞又远不止争夺性资源这么简单，而是因为社会给男性设定了一整套所谓的成功标准，你会随时随地被任何人拿来和其他同性进行比较竞争，哪怕这些人并不将你当成潜在的择偶对象。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Then, around this cold, instrumental role setting, most men are forced to face the brutal male involution at the bottom. We all know the term "female involution," which refers to competition among women for male resources. But male involution is far more complex than just competing for sexual resources; it's because society has set a whole series of so-called success standards for men, and you will be constantly compared and competed against by anyone with other men, even if these people do not consider you a potential romantic partner.</p>
</details>

举个例子，每个中国男人小时候都听说过一个人叫“别人家的孩子”。这个孩子可能出现在父母和亲戚的嘴里，可能是老师口中上一届的某个师兄或者师姐。但随着你慢慢长大，这种比较会越来越倾向于是另一个男人。小时候父母可能还会说邻居家的姐姐成绩有多好，考了全校第一。但一旦你长到十八岁，这种情况就少多了。过年回家时，亲戚们只会提到你那个当了局长的表哥，偶尔提到表姐也只会是她那个接着市政府工程的老公开的是什么车。你看，这就是雄竞。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">For example, every Chinese man has heard of "someone else's child" when they were young. This child might be mentioned by parents and relatives, or by teachers referring to an older student from a previous year. But as you grow older, this comparison increasingly shifts towards another man. When you were little, your parents might have talked about how well the neighbor's sister did in school, ranking first in the whole school. But once you turn eighteen, this situation becomes much less common. When you go home for Chinese New Year, relatives will only mention your cousin who became a bureau chief, and if they occasionally mention your female cousin, it will only be about what kind of car her husband, who got a city government project, drives. You see, this is male involution.</p>
</details>

并且雄竞更险恶的地方在于他是全方位无死角什么都得比的。在社会评价上，他需要比学历、智商、经济实力、政治地位、领导力、人格魅力、家庭责任。在婚恋市场上，他除了上面这些，还要比身高、样貌、有没有胸肌腹肌人鱼线、是否知情识趣、胸毛多不多、分泌了多少荷尔蒙、大小长短、性能力。而女性向上择偶的观念则进一步加剧了内卷。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Moreover, the more insidious aspect of male involution is that it's an all-encompassing, no-holds-barred competition. In terms of social evaluation, men are compared on education, intelligence, economic power, political status, leadership, charisma, and family responsibility. In the marriage market, in addition to these, they are also compared on height, appearance, whether they have pectoral muscles, abs, or a V-line, whether they are understanding and interesting, how much chest hair they have, how many hormones they secrete, size, length, and sexual ability. And the concept of women seeking upward mobility in partners further intensifies this internal competition.</p>
</details>

在男性扎堆的地方，他有时甚至会表现得幼稚和无厘头。比如上中学的时候，我们班男生就会在上厕所时比谁能尿得更远，能从门口尿到最里面的小便池里。到了大四，我对面下铺的一个男生竟然为了摆脱**处男**（Virgin man: 指未有过性经验的男性）的身份，不被其他男生笑话，而**一掷千金**（Spend lavishly: 形容花钱大手大脚），把攒了几个月的生活费和子弹一起扔进了亮马桥的**天上人间**（Heaven on Earth: 曾是中国北京一家著名的豪华夜总会）。生活在这样的环境里，你说累不累？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In places where men congregate, they sometimes even act childish and nonsensical. For example, in middle school, the boys in our class would compete in the restroom to see who could urinate the furthest, from the doorway to the innermost urinal. In my senior year of college, a guy in the bunk below me actually spent a fortune, throwing several months' worth of living expenses and his "bullets" into the Heaven on Earth nightclub in Liangma Bridge, just to shed his virgin status and avoid being laughed at by other guys. Living in such an environment, wouldn't you say it's tiring?</p>
</details>

除开以上这些，当今中国男性的累还在于他们处在一个观念的急剧转型期，自己却还没转过来。什么意思呢？简单说，原本的等级制其实是设计了一套平衡机制的。之前有过一个说法，说等级制是一种高效的，能说服男人心甘情愿上战场送死，女人给男人当丫鬟的制度。他的逻辑是这样的：我给予了各阶层男性在自己家庭中相对于女性更高的地位，那你自然也有义务为家族荣誉添砖加瓦，对吧？怎么添砖加瓦呢？如果你脑子好使，可以考科举走仕途；如果脑子一般，但有膀子力气，那就从军，报效国家，拿命去拼。要是运气好没死，回来还能娶妻生子，心安理得在家当大爷。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Beyond all these, the current exhaustion of Chinese men also stems from being in a period of rapid ideological transition, while they themselves haven't yet adapted. What does this mean? Simply put, the original hierarchy actually designed a balancing mechanism. There was a saying that hierarchy is an efficient system that can persuade men to willingly go to war and die, and women to serve men as maids. Its logic is this: I grant men of all social strata a higher status relative to women in their own families, so you naturally have an obligation to contribute to family honor, right? How do you contribute? If you're smart, you can take the imperial examinations and pursue an official career; if you're of average intelligence but have physical strength, then join the army, serve the country, and fight with your life. If you're lucky enough to survive, you can come back, marry, have children, and comfortably live as the master of your home.</p>
</details>

而站在女性角度就是，你得好生伺候你家男人，他要是撂挑子不干了，等敌人打进来了，你也活不了。今天中国婚恋市场上的军人崇拜，鼓励女人们嫁给军人，其实就是这一思路的体现。多说一句，中国几乎是当今世界上唯一一个有专门的**破坏军婚罪**（Crime of Undermining Military Marriage: 指与现役军人的配偶同居或结婚的行为，在中国属于刑事犯罪）的国家，也就是你如果和军人的配偶同居，是要坐牢的，但反过来军人和普通人的配偶同居就没事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">From a woman's perspective, you must serve your man well; if he gives up, and the enemy invades, you won't survive either. The current worship of soldiers in China's marriage market, encouraging women to marry soldiers, is actually a manifestation of this idea. On a side note, China is almost the only country in the world today that has a specific crime of undermining military marriage, meaning if you cohabit with a military spouse, you will go to jail, but conversely, if a soldier cohabits with a civilian's spouse, it's not an issue.</p>
</details>

其他国家像是美国不仅没有军婚罪，反而军人如果和普通人的配偶搞外遇，要受到军法处置。也就是说，美国是约束军人保护平民，而中国正好反过来。有人可能会觉得这是好事，说明国家重视军人，军人地位才高。但依据上面提到的逻辑，这其实是一种交换，也就是我给你更高的地位，其实是鼓励你去送死的。这个逻辑最极端的表现其实就是伊斯兰恐怖分子，你去恐袭搞**圣战**（Jihad: 伊斯兰教中的“奋斗”，常被极端组织解释为武装斗争）是无比光荣的，死后会分到七十二个处女。而在生前，你作为男人对你的老婆们也拥有绝对的权威，可以在家当大爷，作为对你送死的补偿。所以千万别觉得军人地位高是好事，一个国家越是抬高军人地位，说明他越好战。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Other countries, like the United States, not only don't have a crime of undermining military marriage, but soldiers who have affairs with civilian spouses are subject to military justice. In other words, the US restrains soldiers to protect civilians, while China is the opposite. Some might think this is a good thing, indicating that the country values soldiers and that their status is high. But according to the logic mentioned above, this is actually a trade-off, meaning that giving you higher status is actually encouraging you to die. The most extreme manifestation of this logic is Islamic terrorists: engaging in terrorist attacks and jihad is incredibly glorious, and after death, you will be granted 72 virgins. And during your lifetime, as a man, you have absolute authority over your wives and can be the master at home, as compensation for your sacrifice. So, never think that high military status is a good thing; the more a country elevates the status of its soldiers, the more warlike it is.</p>
</details>

说回正题，刚才说了传统等级制是有平衡机制的。今天的很多男性脑子里也依然遵循这种旧的道德体系，觉得我出去挣钱养家拿生活费了，我就是一家之主，你女的就应该做家务带孩子，什么都听我的。但问题是，随着全球范围内**第四波女权思潮**（Fourth-wave Feminism: 始于21世纪初，关注网络女权、交织性、反性骚扰等议题）的兴起，这种观念也受到了强大的冲击。很多女性，尤其是受到过高等教育的女性，她们有的认为女性也应该有自己的事业，有的认为即使我不上班，但生孩子带孩子也同样是一种劳动和付出，理应得到尊重，所以家务应该一人一半，家里的事也得商量着来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Returning to the main topic, as I just mentioned, the traditional hierarchy had a balancing mechanism. Many men today still adhere to this old moral system, believing that since they go out to earn money and support the family, they are the head of the household, and women should do housework, take care of children, and obey their every command. But the problem is, with the rise of fourth-wave feminism globally, this notion has been strongly challenged. Many women, especially those with higher education, some believe that women should also have their own careers, while others believe that even if they don't work outside the home, giving birth and raising children is also a form of labor and contribution that deserves respect. Therefore, housework should be split equally, and household matters should be discussed collaboratively.</p>
</details>

这造成的结果就是很多男性在观念和现实之间感受到了割裂。一方面他们从小就被灌输了只要努力挣钱就能翘着二郎腿等老婆做饭的观念，但现实是哪怕你小有成就娶了个老婆，这个老婆也很有可能不吃你这一套。以上这种情况还是好的，讲道理的。更离谱的是这种：“What is your money? Where did you get the money? The money I make. Who do you make money for? For you. Then how did the money you make for me become yours? So I gave it to you. Do I need you to give me my money? Then I won't give it to you. Why don't you give me my money?”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The result is that many men feel a disconnect between their beliefs and reality. On one hand, they have been indoctrinated since childhood with the idea that as long as they work hard to earn money, they can sit back and wait for their wives to cook. But the reality is that even if you achieve some success and marry a wife, she might not buy into that idea. The above situation is still good, based on reason. What's even more outrageous is this: "What is your money? Where did you get the money? The money I make. Who do you make money for? For you. Then how did the money you make for me become yours? So I gave it to you. Do I need you to give me my money? Then I won't give it to you. Why don't you give me my money?"</p>

注意啊，上面小品里的这位女生的逻辑既不同于传统的父权制，也不同于正统的女权，因为无论是父权还是女权，都要遵守权力和责任对等的原则，以便逻辑自洽嘛。而这个女生的逻辑是我既享受权力又拒绝承担义务，既使丈夫的付出为理所当然，又不给予对方基本的尊重。也难怪很多男生看到会**破防**（Emotional Breakdown: 指心理防线被突破，情绪失控）了。要知道，哪怕是奴隶制，奴隶辛苦劳作的前提也得是奴隶主提供食宿啊。如果性转一下，就相当于一个男人天天躺家里打游戏，靠老婆挣钱养活，然后什么家务都不干，老婆下班了还得给她做饭、收拾屋、带娃，她还觉得理直气壮。以上这些就是中国男人这么累的主要原因了。

<p class="english-text">Note that the logic of the girl in the skit above differs from both traditional patriarchy and orthodox feminism, because both patriarchy and feminism must adhere to the principle of equal rights and responsibilities to be logically consistent. This girl's logic, however, is that she enjoys power while refusing to bear obligations, taking her husband's efforts for granted without giving him basic respect. No wonder many men would have an emotional breakdown upon seeing this. You know, even under slavery, the premise for slaves' hard work was that the slave owner provided food and lodging. If we reverse the genders, it would be like a man lying at home playing games all day, relying on his wife's income, doing no housework, and when his wife comes home from work, he still expects her to cook, clean the house, and take care of the children, and he feels perfectly justified. These are the main reasons why Chinese men are so tired.</p>

### 瓦解等级制：从平等对待身边人开始

问题和现象说完了，接下来咱再说说解决方案。方法很简单，就是努力去瓦解这种等级制。我在之前的《在中国你是第几等人》那期提出过一个观点，那就是一种设计精妙的不公的制度必然会将那些受害最严重的个体发展成为这种不公的坚定维护者。具体的做法是通过等级安排，让每个受害者也同时成为加害者，从中获得收益，找到心理平衡。比如你一个民企老板在官员面前是三孙子，但回了公司你还可以当大爷，要求员工无偿加班。同理，加班到两三点的员工还可以点份外卖，从这种外卖自由中感慨中国人还是很幸福的。而外卖小哥呢，累了一天回家了还可以拿老婆孩子撒气，因为你是这个家里的父嘛。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Now that we've discussed the problems and phenomena, let's talk about solutions. The method is very simple: strive to dismantle this hierarchy. In my previous episode, "What Class Are You In China?", I put forward a view that a cleverly designed unjust system will inevitably turn its most severely victimized individuals into staunch defenders of that injustice. The specific method is through hierarchical arrangements, where each victim also becomes a perpetrator, gaining benefits and finding psychological balance. For example, a private enterprise owner might be subservient to officials, but back at his company, he can act like a boss, demanding unpaid overtime from employees. Similarly, employees who work until two or three in the morning can order takeout, and from this freedom of ordering takeout, they might sigh that Chinese people are still very happy. And the delivery rider, after a tiring day, can go home and vent his anger on his wife and children, because he is the patriarch of the family, right?</p>
</details>

就连**董志明**这种底层中的底层，不也依然有铁链女可以欺负吗？这种受害者成为加害者的叙事里，还有一种相对另类的变种，就是主动顺应这种等级制，钻他的漏洞，期待从中吃到红利。典型案例就是以“娶大女人”为代表的**捞女**（Gold Digger: 指通过不正当手段获取男性财富的女性）群体。你们某些事业成功的男性不是想当大爷包小三吗？那些看重女权的女生不是不愿意出卖尊严、伏低做小，跟你谈男女平等吗？他们不肯干的活我干，只要钱到位，我可以百依百顺、柔情似水，可以知三当三、未婚先孕、向正主逼宫。最讽刺的是，这种以自我矮化、加害其他女性为代价的行为，却被冠上了“当代女权”、“女性独立自强自信”的漂亮口号。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Even someone like Dong Zhiming, who is at the very bottom of society, still has a "chained woman" to bully, doesn't he? In this narrative of victims becoming perpetrators, there's also a relatively alternative variant: actively conforming to this hierarchy, exploiting its loopholes, and hoping to reap benefits from it. A typical example is the group of "gold diggers" represented by those who aim to marry powerful women. Don't some of you successful men want to be masters and have mistresses? Don't those women who value feminism refuse to sell their dignity, humble themselves, and talk about gender equality with you? I'll do the work they won't; as long as the money is right, I can be obedient and gentle, I can knowingly be a mistress, get pregnant before marriage, and force the legitimate wife out. The most ironic thing is that this behavior, at the cost of self-abasement and harming other women, is branded with pretty slogans like "contemporary feminism," "women's independence, self-reliance, and confidence."</p>
</details>

所以，要想瓦解等级制，最好的做法就是每个人从自己开始，先平等对待身边的每个人，别用那套价值排序去羞辱、否定他们的价值，无论对方是陌生人还是家人。因为解放他人就是解放自己。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Therefore, to dismantle the hierarchy, the best approach is for each person to start with themselves, treating everyone around them equally, and not using that system of value ranking to shame or deny their worth, whether they are strangers or family members.

节目的最后，我想聊聊近年来中国互联网上严重的男女对立，也就是部分女性视男性如仇寇，男性则觉得女生都是拜金捞女。关于这一点，我想用一个比喻来结束今天的讨论。当你把一百只黑蚂蚁和一百只红蚂蚁放进同一个罐子里，什么也不会发生。但如果用力摇晃罐子，蚂蚁就会开始互相残杀。红蚁会认为黑蚁是敌人，黑蚁也认为红蚁是敌人，而真正的敌人是那个摇动罐子的人。人类社会也是这样。所以在互相攻击之前，你需要先想想是谁摇动了罐子。

<p class="english-text">At the end of the program, I want to discuss the severe gender antagonism on the Chinese internet in recent years, where some women view men as enemies, and men believe women are all money-worshipping gold diggers. On this point, I'd like to conclude today's discussion with an analogy. When you put 100 black ants and 100 red ants into the same jar, nothing happens. But if you shake the jar vigorously, the ants will start killing each other. The red ants will think the black ants are enemies, and the black ants will think the red ants are enemies, but the real enemy is the person who shook the jar. Human society is the same. So, before attacking each other, you need to first think about who shook the jar.</p>
