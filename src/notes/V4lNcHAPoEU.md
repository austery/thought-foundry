### 开场白与法拉利的新梦想

主持人分享了一个关于法拉利创始人恩佐·法拉利（Enzo Ferrari）的趣闻，他曾因被困电梯而输掉一场比赛，此后便再也不乘坐电梯。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I heard that the founder of Ferrari, Enzo Ferrari, once was stuck in a lift and lost a race. Notice he lost the race and never took a lift again.</p>
</details>

Benedetto Vigna证实了这个故事的真实性，并指出这发生在佩斯卡拉。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's true. You studied very well history. Yeah, it's true. Absolutely. It was in Piscara.</p>
</details>

主持人提到，Benedetto Vigna曾说过法拉利不仅仅是一辆车，它是一个梦想，而就在一个小时三十五分钟后，法拉利将推出一个新的梦想。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So Benedetto, you say that Ferrari is not the car. It's a dream and in 1 hour and 35 minutes you will bring out a new dream.</p>
</details>

Benedetto Vigna确认了这一点，并表示今天将推出两款特别版车型，带来“两个梦想”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Because you have a car launch today. Two dreams with two car two special version of a car coming out today.</p>
</details>

他认为这与本次研讨会的时间安排非常契合。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. So good timing with this seminar. Yeah. Very good.</p>
</details>

主持人表示很遗憾无法提前展示图片，因为发布时间尚未到来，并询问Benedetto Vigna能否透露一些关于这两款新车的信息。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh you should have been waiting and we could show but we can't show any pictures because it's like 1 hour and 35 minutes early. But what can you tell us about these two new cars?</p>
</details>

### 创新：法拉利的核心驱动力

Benedetto Vigna强调，创新是法拉利非常关键的要素，他从David和Judy的演讲中也听到了这一点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Look we have innovation is very key. I was listening the presentation of David and Judy. Innovation is key.</p>
</details>

他指出今年对法拉利来说非常重要，因为他们将向世界推出六款新车型，其中前两款将在几分钟内公布。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And uh this year is very important for us because we will have six new model that will propose to the world and the first two will be announced in a few minutes.</p>
</details>

当被问及能否透露更多细节时，他开玩笑地描述了汽车的基本构成，但随后表示由于与记者的会议，一切都处于**禁运期**（Embargo: 在正式发布前禁止对外披露信息），所以无法提前透露。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So if you had to if you had to say something about them. Four wheels, one steering wheel, some aluminum, some glass. No, you you you have to wait because we had a meeting with our with journalist. Yeah. Everything is under embargo. So if I I say something Yeah, I know.</p>
</details>

不过，他透露这两款新车是**混合动力汽车**（Hybrid Car: 结合燃油发动机和电动机的汽车）的特别版本，他本人已经多次驾驶过，并觉得“非常有趣”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But I can tell you that is special version of hybrid car and uh it will be I drove it several times. It's very funny.</p>
</details>

他甚至提到有客户和Nikolai都在催促他透露信息，但他坚持必须让大家等待。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I have a lot of client. One of them was texting me now, can I see something? Can I see something? I said you have to wait also Nikolai is asking something you have to wait a little bit I cannot make a difference.</p>
</details>

### 法拉利的企业宗旨与人文维度

回到Patrick的评论，主持人询问Benedetto Vigna，在他心中法拉利究竟代表着什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, uh what uh just coming back to uh to Patrick's comment I mean what is Ferrari in in your mind what what is it?</p>
</details>

Benedetto Vigna解释说，自他上任以来，公司一直在努力弥补法拉利缺少一份正式的**品牌圣经**（Brand Bible: 详细阐述品牌宗旨、价值观和风格的指导文件）的空白。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Ferrari I mean we have been working in the last years since I I came over there because Ferrari was missing if you want a formal brand bible.</p>
</details>

他们通过倾听公司所有员工的意见，明确了法拉利的宗旨，这个宗旨非常简单：“我们大胆地重新定义可能的边界。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So we clarified the the purpose of Ferrari and this was done listening to all the people in the company and we the purpose of our company is very simple is the following. We audaciously redefine the limit of possible.</p>
</details>

他提到自己曾在一个完全不同的领域工作了25年，为一个制造芯片的公司工作，那个世界以极快的速度发展。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I as you said I mean I was working in a in a different world in a different space for 25 years in a space we were we were making I was working for a company making chips and that world is moving at very high pace very high pace.</p>
</details>

然而，当他来到法拉利这样一家奢侈品公司时，他看到了真正独特的东西：**人文维度**（Human Dimension: 关注人的因素、情感和关系），包括员工的激情和归属感，以及所有利益相关者和法拉利周边人群的独特感受。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">When you go in a company such as Ferrari that is a luxury company you see something that is really unique is the human dimension the human dimension the passion the sense of belonging that you see in people in Ferrari but also all the stakeholders and the people around Ferrari is very unique.</p>
</details>

因此，他喜欢说法拉利是“将人们凝聚在一起的粘合剂”，推动他们重新定义可能的边界。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I like to say that Ferrari is the glue around the people putting them for the people pushing them toward redefinition of of what is possible that that's.</p>
</details>

### 速度与传承：平衡之道

主持人指出，在Benedetto Vigna之前从事的微芯片行业，每18到24个月就需要“重塑”自己，推出新模型。他询问在法拉利，哪些方面需要重塑，哪些方面需要保持不变，例如标志性的黄色时钟等。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But I mean in your previous job where you do microchips you reinvent uh yourself every 18 24 months or whatever new new models and so on. Now with Ferrari, what are the what are the things that you do reinvent and what are the things that need to be the same? I mean you got some you got some iconic things, right? The yellow clock in the middle, all that kind of stuff. Yeah. Which of course I don't know so much about, but you know much more a little bit.</p>
</details>

Benedetto Vigna分享了一个故事：在2022年6月16日的**资本市场日**（Capital Market Day: 公司向投资者、分析师等介绍其战略、财务表现和未来计划的活动）之后，他告诉公司管理层：“你们认为自己很快，但我告诉你们，你们不够快。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No, look, I I can tell you something. I shared with the team after the capital market day. It was 16th June 22 when we had capital market day. The day after we did deployment in all the company and I was with the the leader the management of the company and I said look you believe you are fast I told them I told them you are not fast.</p>
</details>

他解释说，如果与汽车公司相比，法拉利确实很快，但如果与高科技公司相比，则不然。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Silence a lot of said you are fast yes if you compare yourself with automotive companies you are fast but if you compare with high-tech companies you are not fast.</p>
</details>

他提出了一个速度等级：汽车公司是1，法拉利是10，高科技公司是100。他问公司是否需要达到100的速度，并回答“不”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then I told them three things one the speed of automotive companies is one the speed of Ferrari is 10 the speed of high-tech is 100. Do we need as a company to go to 100? No.</p>
</details>

因为高科技公司不关心过去，过去对他们来说是负担；而对于奢侈品公司，过去是基础性要素。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Because high-tech companies don't care about the past. The past in high-tech company is a burden. In a luxury company, the past is a fundamental ingredient.</p>
</details>

他表示，法拉利的目标速度是30-35，而经过三年半，他们目前的速度大约是18-20。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So where we are aiming to be as a company. For me the indicator is 30 35 where we are in terms of speed after three years and a half I would say around 1820.</p>
</details>

这意味着公司在运营效率和创新方面仍有改进空间。他总是敦促团队保持脚踏实地，审慎行事，并识别可以改进的领域。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So what does it mean? There are opportunities for us to improve on the operational efficiency. There are opportunities for us to improve on on innovation. The company is doing relatively well. But I always push the team to stay really with the four wheels on the ground. Nowadays more than ever it's important to be prudent to understand what are the areas where you can improve.</p>
</details>

他指出，高科技公司追求速度是为了速度本身，否则就会失去竞争力，但这在奢侈品公司中没有意义，反而会自我毁灭。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So it company have a different mindset different culture the company I don't know maybe some of you have been working over there it is a speed for the sake of speed because otherwise you don't you lose the you know you lose the grip in a in in a luxury company does not make sense. So you would destroy yourself.</p>
</details>

那么，法拉利哪些方面需要速度呢？他认为需要在通过删除不为客户带来价值的环节来提升速度。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So where in the company where in the company do you need speed? I think that there are speed on speed we need to achieve by deleting something that is not bringing value to client. That is important.</p>
</details>

这涉及到生产、营销、沟通等不同领域。他认为没有公司是完美的，总是一个持续改进的过程，需要保持谦逊。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think there are different areas. It goes in in production. It goes on the on the the marketing. It goes in the communication. It goes I mean there are different areas. I think no company is perfect. Nobody will no company will be ever perfect is always an improving process. I think that we have to to be conscious of this and we have to work on that. Have a you know humility I would say.</p>
</details>

### 领导力与企业文化变革

主持人询问Benedetto Vigna自上任以来，对公司文化做出了哪些改变。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Absolutely. How have you changed the corporate since you came in? What are the things you've changed?</p>
</details>

Benedetto Vigna表示，如果听取员工的反馈，他带来的改变是更加开放的沟通。他强调这并非批评前任领导者，因为每种领导风格都适合特定的历史时期。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But uh what I understand I changed if I listen to what people tell me is that I am and this is not a critic at all for all the people before me because each leadership style is good I think for each historical moment.</p>
</details>

他指出，法拉利一直以来都非常关注员工，这也是他选择加入法拉利的原因之一，公司对员工成长和发展的投入让他印象深刻。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think that uh the attention of of the company to employee has been always there. I have to say that one of the reason why also I selected to join Ferrari is because of tension of the company to the grow and development of employee. I remember when I had the discussion with the board member and I saw the program and investment on the grow employee that that was for me an important decide I mean factor.</p>
</details>

他认为自己带来了两点改变：一是更开放的沟通，二是相互尊重。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There is also another point is the uh how do you say there's mutual respect is there I think two things I brought one is more open communication.</p>
</details>

他透露自己只有1%的时间待在办公室，大部分时间都与不同组织层级的员工交流。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I don't I I spend I would say 1% of my time in my office I am always with people and I I talk with all the people across different organizational level.</p>
</details>

主持人评论说他似乎真心喜欢与人交流。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I mean you actually like people, right?</p>
</details>

Benedetto Vigna回应说他确实喜欢人，因为这是最简单、最好的学习方式。虽然可以读书，但那需要更多时间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I Yeah, I like people because I think that's the easiest and the best way to learn. You can read books, but the point is that takes more time.</p>
</details>

主持人追问他与多少人交流过。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then how many how many people do you speak how many people you speak to? Because because I generally because I generally speak generally speak I don't think we speak with enough people.</p>
</details>

Benedetto Vigna同意，并分享了一个故事：他之前工作的那家公司，一位89岁的前CEO曾建议他“一对一地与人交谈”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I agree with you. Look, I I I had the luck to have I was working for this company I was telling you before and the CEO that now is 89 years old before stepping in the role, I call it many friends, young CEO and old CEO, old in the role I mean and I got some advices and this CEO, the previous CEO of the company I was working for, three CEO before he told me talk to the people onetoone.</p>
</details>

因此，当他加入法拉利时，他要求助理在90天内安排300次一对一访谈，涵盖所有层级的员工。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So when I get in the company I asked my assistant to arrange 300 interview one to one to be to do in uh let's say 90 days and that's what I did. I mean all levels of the all levels.</p>
</details>

他解释说，这样做很重要，因为你需要从不同角度看待现实，才能获得清晰的全貌。公司不像一个对称的物体，而是非常不对称的，因此需要听取不同人的不同观点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think why why is that important? Because you need to see the reality from different angle. If you want to have a clear picture of the reality you need to see from different angles. I mean if you see an object like this is the same from your point of view but the company is not so symmetric. It's very asymmetric. So you needed to have different point of view from different people.</p>
</details>

他认为没有员工的投入和洞察力，他将无法以目前的方式领导公司。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And for me it was very easy. I mean without their input without really their insight I don't think I would have been able to to lead the company with the team in this way.</p>
</details>

### 管理风格：科学、直接与以人为本

当被问及如何描述自己的管理风格时，Benedetto Vigna表示他非常直接，并且是“科学的”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How would you if you were to describe your management style? What would you say? I would say that I have a very direct. I am maybe scientific in the sense that uh I go in a meeting and I like to hear what the people tell me.</p>
</details>

他喜欢在会议中倾听他人的意见，如果别人能证明他的观点是错误的，他会毫不犹豫地改变。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If I have my point of view and they demonstrate my point of view is wrong, I I don't have any problem to change it.</p>
</details>

他认为这是员工喜欢他的特点，他不会带着预设的、不可动摇的观点进入会议。他喜欢与人“共舞”，即通过讨论事实来达成共识。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I would say that this is the feature that the people uh at least to what they tell me they like they don't you know I would say more really scientific. I do not enter meeting with my point of view that is already nailed down carved out. I mean I would like to I like to to dance with the people. Allow me to say so I have my point of view. You have a point of view. Let's discuss. Let's see which are the fact.</p>
</details>

主持人开玩笑说他是个好舞者，Benedetto Vigna则幽默回应妻子不这么认为。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You're a good dancer. No my wife is telling me I'm not a good dancer. That's okay.</p>
</details>

主持人询问他如何在组织中传达自己的想法，让每个人都朝着他的方向努力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um how do you get your ideas across in the organization? How do I get ideas? Because you can sit at the top and you can have great ideas, right? But I mean, how do you get uh everybody in your direction?</p>
</details>

Benedetto Vigna认为，当你与人建立关系时，不仅讨论业务，更重要的是讨论他们作为“人”的一面。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">When you have a when you have people, okay, when you have people and you have a relation with those people, you discuss also about business most of all, most important, you discuss about them as people.</p>
</details>

他举例说，他会关心员工Yakopo的儿子，或者其他员工的孩子在做什么，这种关心建立了联系，让员工觉得他很亲近，而不是遥不可及。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I know what the people do. I know for example, Yakopo is the son of a a guy that was born a few weeks ago. So I keep asking about Yakopo or I keep asking what the son or the daughter is doing. This kind is bringing some link. So they don't see me far away. They see me close.</p>
</details>

主持人提到，法拉利所在的马拉内罗（Maranello）像个村庄，这可能是一个优势。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So but doesn't help. So you all live in the same village, right? I mean Marlo is that that is a big advantage.</p>
</details>

Benedetto Vigna承认这是一个优势，但强调马拉内罗不是村庄。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No doubt that is a big advantage. But I can tell you it's not a village by the way. Yeah. Don't offend please.</p>
</details>

他补充说，即使在他之前工作的公司，员工分布在21个不同地点，他也能与他们建立同样的联系，尽管马拉内罗因为大家在同一个地方会更容易。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No look but when I was also in the other company my people were spread over 21 location and I can tell you that I have the same link that I have Marinelo Marinelo is easier because we are on the same place you're right but also when I was in the previous company I was traveling like hell like some colleague here in the room I you can have the same kind of relation I have some friends in some in Czech Republic I'm regular in touch.</p>
</details>

主持人询问作为意大利人，是否在家庭、朋友和食物方面有更多关注，这是否有所不同。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But do you think but do you think being Italian is different. I mean, is it more there is more uh you know focus on family, friends, uh food? Of course, you are very good at you're very good at cutting the reindeer by the way. Um but do you think there is this focus on family and which makes it into I I don't think is a matter I have a lot of friends. I see a lot of business people from all over the world but they are very good.</p>
</details>

Benedetto Vigna认为这并非国籍问题，他认识世界各地很多优秀的商业人士。他觉得可能有些意大利人，特别是来自意大利南部的人，在人际关系上可能更直接、更容易开始。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, so what is the only things you can say that maybe some some for some Italians especially from south of Italy they may have the advantage to be a little bit more direct but I don't know not more direct more in the human relation more easy to to start I mean.</p>
</details>

### 法拉利文化的未来：速度与客户体验

主持人询问Benedetto Vigna目前正在努力改变法拉利文化的哪些部分。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But where where do you want what are you trying to change now at Ferrari what part of the culture are you working on uh?</p>
</details>

Benedetto Vigna表示他正在两个维度上努力。首先是提高速度，他还需要12个点才能从目前的18-20达到目标30-35。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm working on two dimension. One, I want to find a way to increase this speed because I still need the 12 points to go from 18 to 30.</p>
</details>

他正在与团队一起识别并删除那些不增加价值的领域，这属于流程方面。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think that uh I am identifying together with the team some areas that it makes sense for us to delete because they do not add value. So this is if you want on the process side.</p>
</details>

其次是客户方面，他们需要超越传统的客户群。目前，75%的客户是重复购买者，这很好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">On the on the on the client side I think that we start we need like like I say we need to expand beyond the classical you know we have a lot of repeaters that is good we the so you mean repeaters repeat client that are buying the same the same client that are buying cars today are 75%.</p>
</details>

他感谢在场的一位最大的挪威客户的信任，并表示他们需要拓展客户基础。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We have your biggest Norwegian client in the audience today thank you for your trust you I would like no I think that we need also to expand the client base.</p>
</details>

他们在这方面取得了良好进展，40%的新客户年龄在40岁以下，但他认为仍有改进空间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We are doing good progress because 40% of new client are younger than 40 years and uh but I think there is still opportunity here.</p>
</details>

此外，他们还需要在提供给客户的体验方面取得进展，因为在奢侈品公司中，产品固然重要，但体验也同样重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I think we need to do some progress also in the experience we provide to our client because in a luxury company the product is important but also the experience is very important so this is another dimension.</p>
</details>

当被问及具体指什么时，他解释说他们定期组织特别活动和赛道或公路上的独特体验。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What do you what do you mean by that but look we're organizing regularly, special event, special experience on track, on road with the client.</p>
</details>

未来几周，客户将齐聚西班牙或巴塔哥尼亚驾驶他们的法拉利。他们还将为热爱驾驶、购买赛车并在赛道上享受驾驶乐趣的人提供体验。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In the next few weeks, we will have client that will join all together in Spain or in Patagonia driving their Ferrari. But we will also experience of people that are fun of driving. They buy their racing uh cars and they're fun of driving in um on the track. So this is the experience that we want to bring on the track on the on the client.</p>
</details>

### 十年展望：情感驱动的创新

最后一个问题，主持人询问Benedetto Vigna认为法拉利十年后会是怎样。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">M m. So um last question. What do you um where do you see where do you think Ferrari will be in 10 years time?</p>
</details>

Benedetto Vigna表示，他希望法拉利成为一家更快、更开放、相互尊重作为核心价值的公司。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What I think uh what I want the Ferrari to be is a company that is faster that is uh continues to be more and more open where uh really the mutual respect stays there as a value.</p>
</details>

他们将继续倾听并预测客户想要的产品。他希望公司能持续改进，提供**情感驱动的创新**（Emotion-Driven Innovation: 以激发用户情感和体验为核心的创新），而非单纯的技术推动或市场拉动。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Where we listen and we anticipate we continue to anticipate which are the product the client is willing to to have from us. So I would like that we continue to do and we improve, we keep improving in delivering emotion-driven innovation. No technology push, no market pull, emotion-driven innovation because only in that way you make a difference.</p>
</details>

他认为，如果等待太久或仅仅推动技术，那不是创新，而是复制粘贴。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If you wait too much or if you push the technology is not innovation, it's cutting, you know, copy and paste.</p>
</details>

主持人提到Benedetto Vigna曾说过不希望车内有太多屏幕，并询问原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And you have said you don't want to have too many screens. No. Why? There are a couple of them already. Why don't Why don't you want to have too many screens in a Ferrari?</p>
</details>

Benedetto Vigna解释说，他来自半导体公司，知道什么对汽车有用，什么没用，什么对客户有用，什么对供应商有用。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
