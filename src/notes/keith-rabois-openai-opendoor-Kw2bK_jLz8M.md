### AI与国家未来：主权AI的重要性

ChatGBT becomes a monopoly. It is transforming how everybody, every normal person basically does their work, funds their life.
**ChatGPT** (Generative Pre-trained Transformer: 一种基于大型语言模型的聊天机器人) 正在成为一种垄断。它正在改变每个人、每个普通人完成工作和维持生计的方式。

The thesis of AI is too important to the future of nations to allow an American company to dominate in certain regions. I think is going to prove to be true.
我认为，**AI** (Artificial Intelligence: 人工智能) 对于国家未来的重要性不容小觑，不能允许一家美国公司在某些地区占据主导地位，这一论点将被证明是正确的。

### 中东和平进程与地缘政治

>> Yeah.

>> Keith, welcome to the podcast.

>> Pleasure to be with you.

>> It's been a long time. Excited to have you back. It's an exciting day to do it. Big day for the Middle East. This I feel like this is something you've been predicting for a while.

>> Well, if you read actually if you read Jared Kushner's autobiography.

>> Yeah.

>> All you have to do is quote he quotes you know the Saudi king says you're going to bring peace to the Middle East. And it turns out to be correct.
如果你读过贾里德·库什纳（Jared Kushner）的自传，他引用了沙特国王的话，说他将为中东带来和平，结果证明这是正确的。

It was pretty obvious like this would happen. If you visited Israel recently in the last 6-9 months, you could feel the Tatonic plates shifting.
这很明显会发生。如果你最近六到九个月访问过以色列，你会感觉到地缘政治板块正在移动。

It was just a question what would be the trigger and everybody's looking forward to the new Middle East. You're going to see lots of countries make peace explicitly with Israel which is great.
这只是一个触发点的问题，每个人都在期待新的中东。你会看到许多国家与以色列明确建立和平关系，这很棒。

Whether they join the **Abraham Accords** (亚伯拉罕协议: 一系列由美国斡旋，以色列与阿拉伯国家关系正常化的协议) directly or indirectly, it's all going to happen in the next six months.
无论它们是直接还是间接加入亚伯拉罕协议，这一切都将在未来六个月内发生。

Is your view that Iran is neutralized that this leads to some sort of durable non-violent pack?

>> Everybody off the record wanted Iran to be neutralized and they were basically blocking any progress.
私下里每个人都希望伊朗被压制，因为他们基本上阻碍了所有进展。

People were scared, terrified and now that they've been neutralized. I think the natural arc of human history is for there be basically progress innovation technology innovation actually in the Middle East driving piece AI data centers.
人们曾经害怕、恐惧，而现在伊朗已经被压制了。我认为人类历史的自然发展轨迹是进步、创新和技术创新，尤其是在中东地区，它将推动和平，包括AI和数据中心的发展。

You're going to see all of this. It's really an interesting and fascinating future.

>> Yeah. Are you bullish on sovereign AI sort of that these are you sort of you know think that you might invest in that type of

>> We have at KV we invested in a sovereign AI company in Japan called Scono.
在KV，我们投资了一家名为Scono的日本主权AI公司。

The thesis of AI is too important to the future of nations to allow an American company to dominate in certain regions, I think is going to prove to be true.
我认为，AI对于国家未来的重要性不容小觑，不能允许一家美国公司在某些地区占据主导地位，这一论点将被证明是正确的。

I think you still need to marshall the hard part that's easy to say at a conceptual level to implement that though, you still need to marshall a critical density of talent of AI researchers and there's not that many world-class AI researchers across the globe.
我认为，虽然在概念层面这很容易说，但要实施起来，你仍然需要汇聚足够密度的AI研究人才，而全球范围内世界级的AI研究人员并不多。

I saw a public presentation by Jensen where he said there's 150 people on the planet who could actually build a foundational model. He's probably more right than wrong.
我看到黄仁勋（Jensen Huang）的一次公开演讲，他说全球只有150人能够真正构建基础模型。他很可能说得没错。

And so you still, if you're going to build one for Germany or Europe or Israel or wherever, you're still going to need a critical density of those 150 people to be able to compete at the cutting edge of frontier models. But I think most countries are going to try.
所以，如果你要为德国、欧洲、以色列或其他任何地方构建一个模型，你仍然需要那150人中的关键密度人才，才能在前沿模型的尖端竞争。但我认为大多数国家都会尝试。

### 特朗普的政治遗产与经济展望

>> Yeah. Before we get to tech, just to close the politics front, do you think that this will end up defining Trump's legacy or what do you think his second term will be remembered for?

>> Well, I was thinking last night, he's going to solve all the problems he inherited in the first two years.
我昨晚在想，他将在头两年解决他继承的所有问题。

Like if you think about it, immigration basically solved. If you think about the Middle East, on its way to being solved, he'll get Russia and Ukraine solved.
比如，如果你考虑一下，移民问题基本解决了。如果你考虑中东问题，它正在得到解决，他还会解决俄罗斯和乌克兰问题。

I'm pretty sure tariffs are bringing down the debt. The growth rate is going to accelerate. We're going to have 4% or more growth all of next year. That will make the debt irrelevant.
我很确定关税正在降低债务。增长率将会加速。明年全年我们将实现4%或更高的增长。这将使债务变得无关紧要。

You can grow your way out of deficits. Interest rates still need to come down. Trying to fix the Federal Reserve has been upset.
你可以通过增长来摆脱赤字。利率仍需下降。试图修复美联储（Federal Reserve）一直令人沮丧。

That'll eventually get fixed. He will replace Powell at some point. Bess's going to continue to be outstanding. So, I think after the next year, it's going to be all upside.
这最终会得到解决。他会在某个时候替换鲍威尔。贝斯（Bess）将继续表现出色。所以，我认为明年之后，一切都将向上发展。

>> And why doesn't Powell want to reduce rates? What is the seal man for what?

>> Well, his argument, I don't know that he has a good argument. I think he has Trump derangement syndrome. He just hates Trump.
他的论点，我不知道他是否有充分的理由。我认为他患有“特朗普错乱综合症”（Trump derangement syndrome）。他就是恨特朗普。

That's why he artificially lowered rates to try to get Kamala elected. It is indefensible cutting 50 basis points off in LA, you know, last fall.
这就是为什么他人为降低利率，试图让卡马拉当选。去年秋天在洛杉矶降息50个基点是站不住脚的。

But he does see employment is running pretty hot. But the difference is with AI and productivity gains through technology.
但他确实看到就业市场非常火热。但不同之处在于AI和技术带来的生产力提升。

Hot employment does not necessarily yield inflation. It's not just wage growth that's fueling GDP growth.
火热的就业不一定会导致通货膨胀。推动**GDP** (Gross Domestic Product: 国内生产总值) 增长的不仅仅是工资增长。

And so I think you're seeing some of the substitution where productivity gains can be made. GDP can run four 5% without triggering inflation because it's not just you don't grow GDP just by paying humans more which is the historical precedent.
因此，我认为你看到了一些替代现象，即可以通过提高生产力来实现增长。GDP可以达到4%到5%的增长，而不会引发通货膨胀，因为它不仅仅是通过给人类支付更多工资来增长GDP，这与历史先例不同。

### 狗狗币与政府规模的思考

>> And again before I segue what's sort of reflection post Doge like what did we learn from that experiment?

>> Well actually the funny thing is I was watching some political polls and there's not that many pollsters that I find accurate but there's a few and until this week Trump's height of his popularity was when Doge was at his best.
有趣的是，我一直在看一些政治民意调查，虽然我发现准确的民调机构不多，但有几个。直到本周，特朗普人气的巅峰时期正是狗狗币（Doge）表现最好的时候。

The American people really do want to cut the size and scope of the federal government.
美国人民确实希望削减联邦政府的规模和范围。

You can see like look at the government's officially shut down and Trump's fixing everything. It does suggest like why do we need the rest of the government?
你可以看到，政府正式关门了，特朗普正在解决所有问题。这确实暗示，我们为什么还需要其他政府部门呢？

Like everything has been better the last two weeks. Like can you name one thing in society across the globe that's got worse in the last two weeks with the government

>> can't go public. This is the problem. Yes, I agree.

>> But yeah, other than that, well, fortunately my companies will be right good enough to go public whenever they want.
除了那一点，幸运的是，我的公司随时都能上市。

It will be eventually, but Ramp can be public whenever it wants. It doesn't need like a timing move and manipulation.
它最终会上市，但Ramp公司随时都可以上市。它不需要像那种时机把握和市场操纵。

But fundamentally that'll get fixed. But the government being shut down doesn't seem to be interfering with the rate of progress.
但从根本上说，这会得到解决。但政府关门似乎并没有影响到进步的速度。

And I think maybe Americans wake up one day and say like, "Wait, why do we need this size federal government?"
我认为也许有一天美国人会醒悟过来，说：“等等，我们为什么需要这么大的联邦政府？”

I actually believe you could probably cut 50% of the federal government ex-military easily.
我真的相信，除了军队之外，联邦政府的规模可以轻易削减50%。

Like what does the commerce department actually do? Literally, I mean, Howard does a lot of work. He's at the forefront of everything like negotiating tariff deals.
比如，商务部到底做了什么？说真的，霍华德确实做了很多工作。他在一切事务的最前沿，比如谈判关税协议。

>> But like all the thousands of bureaucrats what department why do we have a department of agriculture? This is actually an interesting question.
但是那些成千上万的官僚呢，农业部是做什么的？这其实是个有趣的问题。

Why do we actually have thousands of people probably I haven't looked at it recently but probably 30,000 people work at the department of agriculture
我们为什么要有成千上万的人，我最近没查过，但大概有三万人供职于农业部？

What world does that make sense? Even like the State Department there's like three or four thousand economic officers over posted overseas.
这在什么世界是合理的？即使是国务院，也有三四千名经济官员派驻海外。

This is like back in the day when you count the ships, you know, kind of an artifact of history where you count the ships showing up at a port and then report back to DC this economy is growing, Poland's growing, the UK is not.
这就像过去数船只的时代，是一种历史遗留物，你数着到港的船只，然后向华盛顿汇报哪个经济体在增长，波兰在增长，英国没有。

Where obviously you can just log into like a Bloomberg terminal and track that probably more accurately.

>> but if Elon couldn't do it to some degree does it speak to the intractability of actually

>> Well, you need political will, but I think one of the things the last two weeks is showing, Trump's going to be more popular than ever.
你需要政治意愿，但我认为过去两周表明的一件事是，特朗普将比以往任何时候都更受欢迎。

He's literally posting the highest popularity and approval rate of his career right now and the government shut down.
他现在正处于职业生涯中最高的人气和支持率，而政府却关门了。

One of the reasons why there hasn't been political will is when you have sort of a diffuse benefit when and concentrated aggravated people politicians elected officials are afraid.
缺乏政治意愿的原因之一是，当利益分散而受影响的人群集中且愤怒时，政治家和民选官员会感到害怕。

So when you cut something. The people who like whatever that program is, they may only be 1% of the population, but they're very loud and annoying.
所以当你削减某项开支时，那些喜欢该项目的人，他们可能只占人口的1%，但他们非常吵闹和烦人。

And the 99% of the people benefit are quiet typically. But if you can convince people that, hey, we don't need all this stuff, and the 99% people are like, hey, why do we need all this stuff?
而通常情况下，那99%受益的人是沉默的。但如果你能说服人们，“嘿，我们不需要所有这些东西”，而那99%的人也说，“嘿，我们为什么需要所有这些东西？

Why am I paying all these taxes? Then the 1% you can safely ignore.
我为什么要交这么多税？”那么那1%的人你就可以安全地忽略了。

And because the 1% have historically been channeling through the legacy media, which is no longer relevant, they're going to need to find a new megaphone.
而且由于那1%的人历来都是通过传统媒体发声，而传统媒体已不再重要，他们将需要找到新的扩音器。

Like whether New York Times or the Wall Street Journal writes some attack piece, nobody on the Republican side cares anymore.
比如，无论是《纽约时报》还是《华尔街日报》写了什么攻击性文章，共和党方面的人都不再关心了。

We've learned that that stuff is just garbage, it's fake and irrelevant. And so if you have the if you're on the right side of history with the right evidence and the right ideas, you can just ignore the legacy media.
我们已经知道那些东西不过是垃圾，是虚假且无关紧要的。所以，如果你站在历史的正确一边，拥有正确的证据和理念，你就可以完全无视传统媒体。

So I think it's going to be a lot easier to cut things.

### 特朗普与马斯克的关系

>> Do you think Elon and Trump are going to make up in a material way or that Elon is going to support the Republican party and

>> Oh yeah. I think it's obvious. I mean, I think the Charlie Kirk funeral was like ceremonial.

>> He must get back into politics in a material.

>> I don't know if he'll get back into politics, but he's not going to fund non-conservative parties. Like, I think that's dead.
我不知道他是否会重返政坛，但他不会再资助非保守党派了。我认为那已经不可能了。

I put a stake in the ground in it on the All-In podcast. I think after my comments, I think it was dead anyway. But I think now they've reconciled, which makes sense.
我在All-In播客上就此表了态。我想在我发表评论之后，这件事无论如何都已告吹。但我认为现在他们已经和解了，这很合理。

Like, ideologically, they mostly agree.

>> Um, you know, I think the debate, the funny thing is the divorce was kind of weird in a sense of Elon's kind of a perfectionist of like, why can't you do this?
你知道，我认为这场争论，有趣的是，他们的“分歧”有点奇怪，从某种意义上说，埃隆（Elon）有点完美主义，他会问“你为什么不能这样做？”

Why can't you cut more faster? And Trump was like the political realist in that case where he's like, I just don't have the votes in the Senate to do this and you've got to give me some, you know, over time I'll get there, but you got to give me some rope and you got to give the Secretary of Treasury some rope.
你为什么不能更快地削减更多？而特朗普在这种情况下则像个政治现实主义者，他说：“我只是在参议院没有足够的票数来做这件事，你们得给我一些时间，你知道，假以时日我会做到的，但你们得给我一些余地，也得给财政部长一些余地。”

And it was really a not a fight about the idea, but a fight about like the prioritization, sequencing, timing.
这真的不是一场关于理念的争论，而是一场关于优先顺序、执行次序和时机的争论。

And you know, Trump's a pretty astute politician, so I would trust his judgment on the timing.
你知道，特朗普是一个非常精明的政治家，所以我信任他在时机上的判断。

He's pretty aggressive and assertive. And if he doesn't think he can move that fast, he's probably more right than wrong.

>> It also just feels like there's this question of do you grow your way out of something or cut your way out of something.
这感觉也像是在问，你是要通过增长来摆脱困境，还是通过削减来摆脱困境。

The greatest entrepreneur of all time and you can quintuple I mean, I'm making this up, but imagine you can quintuple GDP with AI and everything else versus, you know, cut us even more or whatever, right?
史上最伟大的企业家，你可以让GDP翻五倍——我是随便说的，但想象一下，你可以通过AI和其他一切让GDP翻五倍，而不是，你知道，进一步削减我们或其他什么，对吧？

The growth mentality for the greatest entrepreneur of all time probably makes more sense.

>> Yeah, the growth mentality is almost surely right. The austerity mentality probably doesn't work.
是的，增长思维几乎肯定是正确的。紧缩思维可能行不通。

Which is funny because ironic as you point out, the greatest entrepreneur of all time should understand the concept to lift.
这很有趣，因为正如你所指出的，具有讽刺意味的是，史上最伟大的企业家应该理解提升的概念。

Growth and lift are basically the same thing. And you need to create value and that growing GDP sustainably durably is the way to solve America's problems.
增长和提升基本上是一回事。你需要创造价值，而可持续、持久地增长GDP是解决美国问题的方法。

Austerity is like a temporary hack. You're kind of holding everything together and making life painful.
紧缩就像一种临时性的权宜之计。你只是勉强维持一切，让生活变得痛苦。

It's kind of like a startup trying to save its cash for the last 12 months, but you're not really achieving anything.

### AI对GDP的影响预测

>> By the way, Keith, what's your mental model prediction of what AI will do to GDP? Some people are, you know, Teran is more conservative and just expressing a mild, you know, step up.
顺便问一下，基思，你对AI将如何影响GDP的预测心智模型是什么？有些人，你知道，特兰（Teran）比较保守，只是表达了一种温和的、逐步的增长。

Some people are saying, oh, if we actually have **AGI** (Artificial General Intelligence: 人工通用智能), you know, should be 10% or like some

>> Well, I think you can run four to 6% durably without inflation, which is magic.
我认为你可以持续实现4%到6%的增长，而不会引发通货膨胀，这简直是魔法。

Like, so we used to do this like some sometimes I tweet about like 4% growth and people are like that's crazy.
所以，我们以前经常这样做，有时我会在推特上提到4%的增长，人们会觉得那很疯狂。

From 1950 to 2010 on average in a normal decade we had 4.6 years per decade of 4% growth or higher.
从1950年到2010年，在一个正常的十年里，我们平均每十年有4.6年的时间实现了4%或更高的增长。

So we used to do this all the time and expect it and then we stop for a variety of reasons.
所以我们过去一直这样做，并且期待它，然后因为各种原因我们停止了。

And if you grow that fast, a incomes real incomes grow, but b if you have a debt if you have a deficit, you can solve these problems without cutting essential services and you can probably expand the influence of America across the globe.
如果你增长得这么快，a）实际收入会增长，b）如果你有债务、有赤字，你可以在不削减基本服务的情况下解决这些问题，而且你可能会扩大美国在全球的影响力。

What Howard Lutnik articulated to me is basically post World War II, we sort of intentionally sabotaged our growth and harmonized it with let's say Europe people rebuilding and made an explicit tradeoff to do that and then just forgot that 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 years have gone by and that makes no sense.
霍华德·卢特尼克（Howard Lutnik）向我阐明的是，基本上在二战后，我们有点故意破坏了自己的增长，并使其与欧洲的重建保持一致，为此做出了明确的权衡，然后就忘记了50、60、70、80、90年已经过去了，这毫无意义。

America should be leading the world and we should be dominating in technology. We should be dominating in growth and that creates more and more influence.
美国应该引领世界，我们应该在技术上占据主导地位。我们应该在增长方面占据主导地位，这将创造越来越多的影响力。

So it's profound in every way.

### AI对经济的影响：生产力与就业

>> Yeah. Let's get deeper just on the effects of AI in the economy. If scaling laws hold to some degree, do you know will it show up in the productivity statistics directly?
好的。让我们更深入地探讨AI对经济的影响。如果扩展定律在某种程度上成立，你知道它会直接体现在生产力统计数据中吗？

What does it do to wages?

>> But you do have the I do believe in the ball you sort of the ball cost thing where like the limiting step is the most the most difficult most human things actually put a constraint on like AI growth or jobs going away.
但我确实相信“成本球”之类的东西，其中限制性步骤是最困难、最人性化的事情，实际上对AI增长或工作岗位的流失构成了制约。

I think that is actually true. Like someone still needs to construct all these power plants or data centers and as long as there's manual electricians and as long as there's man maybe you don't need manual architects but you probably need manual plumbing for a while manual electricians I don't think robots are building the next data center at least not right away and so that is going to be the constraint and so these jobs are not really going to go away.
我认为这确实是事实。比如，仍然需要有人建造所有这些发电厂或数据中心，只要有手动电工，只要有工人——也许你不需要手动建筑师，但你可能暂时还需要手动管道工、手动电工。我不认为机器人会立即建造下一个数据中心，所以这将是一个限制，因此这些工作并不会真正消失。

So some if you read the bomb, you know, curse of the bomb stuff, I think we're not going to see radical disruption. We're just going to see the golden age that Trump talked about in his inaugural address.
所以，如果你读过那些关于“炸弹诅咒”之类的东西，我认为我们不会看到彻底的颠覆。我们只会看到特朗普在他就职演说中提到的“黄金时代”。

### OpenAI的垄断地位与对谷歌的冲击

>> Yeah. The We just had Sam Alman here last week on the podcast. We were both investors.

>> I wore a much more subtle shirt.

>> Exactly. What is your mental model of OpenAI as a company? What is how do you sort of see it going forward?
确切地说。你对OpenAI这家公司的心智模型是什么？你如何看待它未来的发展？

Well, I think there's several things they're doing. Obviously, it's a phenomenal company. It's the most important company of the last decade.
我认为他们正在做几件事。显然，这是一家非凡的公司。它是过去十年最重要的公司。

I think Chat GBT becomes a monopoly. It's the fastest growing consumer product of all time.
我认为ChatGPT将成为垄断。它是史上增长最快的消费产品。

It is transforming how everybody, every normal person basically does their work, runs their life.
它正在改变每个人、每个普通人完成工作和管理生活的方式。

And so that product alone is a several trillion dollar company. Then they do all these other things.
因此，仅凭这一款产品，它就是一家价值数万亿美元的公司。然后他们还做所有其他的事情。

And some of them may pay commercial dividends, some may pay societal dividends, but Chad GBT alone there is no competition for.
其中一些可能会带来商业回报，一些可能会带来社会效益，但仅ChatGPT一项就没有竞争对手。

It's not like anthropic or all these other companies have any competition for that. There are vertical applications where some foundational models or some geos where some foundational models may thrive and AI may be important enough that even having a vertical application like coding or having a vertical a geo application may be worth tens of billions of dollars.
这不像Anthropic或所有其他公司有任何竞争。在某些垂直应用领域或某些地理区域，一些基础模型可能会蓬勃发展，AI可能足够重要，即使是像编码这样的垂直应用或地理应用也可能价值数百亿美元。

But OpenAI is the few trillion dollar company. The what happens to Google?

>> Good question.

I know it doesn't show up in all their metrics. I know they're good at spinning like, hey, it's not having effect on this and that.
我知道这不会体现在他们所有的指标中。我知道他们擅长夸大其词，比如，“嘿，这对这个和那个都没有影响。”

But if you just survey, you know, walk outside your office and just ask 10 people like how how often you go to Google versus how often do you use chatbt?
但如果你只是做个调查，你知道，走出你的办公室，随便问10个人，你多久用一次谷歌，又多久用一次ChatGPT？

And yes, maybe you grow both for a while, but I don't use Google for anything.
是的，也许你会在一段时间内同时使用两者，但我已经不用谷歌了。

Like I can't remember the last time I used Google versus chatbt. Like it's just so inferior.

### 谷歌的应对策略与设备之争

>> Yeah. Alex, I know you've thought a lot about Google as well. What

>> I know their strategy. So their strategy is going to be at some point they're going to try to take advantage of all this personal data from your Gmail, from your YouTube videos, you know, from all the different products they have and then therefore make a much better personalized experience.
我知道他们的策略。所以他们的策略是，在某个时候，他们会尝试利用你Gmail、YouTube视频以及他们所有不同产品中的个人数据，从而创造出更好、更个性化的体验。

And I think the tradition the company being a conservative institution and a legacy sort of institution, they've moved very slowly on that.
我认为，由于公司作为一家保守且历史悠久的机构的传统，他们在这方面进展非常缓慢。

But there is a lot of data there and you could create a power a very powerful personalized assistant sort of proactive product and that's what they should build.
但那里有大量数据，你可以创建一个非常强大的个性化助理，一种主动式产品，这正是他们应该构建的。

The question is, can you get can Chachi be get enough of my prompts over enough period of time that they're creating an equivalent data set about me that allows them to compete on the personalization basis.
问题是，ChatGPT能否在足够长的时间内获取我足够的提示，从而建立一个关于我的等效数据集，使他们能够在个性化方面展开竞争。

And the longer Google waits to ship something like this that's robust, the more time Chad GBT has to develop, you know, sort of my personalized prompt history which can inform the future and then they can ship, you know, better products, personal assistants, devices.
谷歌发布如此强大的产品等待的时间越长，ChatGPT就有越多时间来开发我的个性化提示历史，这将为未来提供信息，然后他们就能发布更好的产品、个人助理和设备。

There's also a question around devices. Does someone do you need a device? Is AI driven by a new computing device and who's going to build that?
还有一个关于设备的问题。你需要一个设备吗？AI是否由新的计算设备驱动？谁来建造它？

Obviously, OpenAI made an acquisition to try to get down that path. Google's been terrible at devices historically.
显然，OpenAI已经进行了一次收购，试图朝着这个方向发展。谷歌在设备方面历来表现糟糕。

We'll see if they can get any better, but someone, you know, Apple is great at devices but bad at AI.
我们会看看他们能否有所改进，但有人说，你知道，苹果在设备方面很出色，但在AI方面却很糟糕。

Someone is going to build a device. Where are we going to be using, you know, your iPhone as your personal computing device 5 years out?
总会有人制造出一种设备。五年后，我们还会用iPhone作为个人计算设备吗？

Maybe 10 years out almost surely not.

>> Do you do you know what that device might be?

>> I personally am a fan of putting something in your ear. I think first of all I believe in the science fiction movie adoption of like like Mission Impossible.
我个人倾向于把东西戴在耳朵里。首先，我相信科幻电影中的这种设定，比如《碟中谍》。

It's always in his ear. The glasses have done reasonably well, but if you know I have Lasix,
它总是戴在他的耳朵里。眼镜做得还不错，但如果你知道我做过激光手术，

I think most people who wear glasses try to get Lasix at some point and so I think putting another device here all the time, the bar on the value proposition goes up versus put something in your ear, it might actually go down.
我认为大多数戴眼镜的人在某个时候都会尝试做激光手术，所以我认为一直在这里放置另一个设备，其价值主张的门槛会提高，而如果放在耳朵里，它可能反而会降低。

There are people with like pendants and necklaces which have some value and you may have multiple instead of having a phone maybe you have something in your ear and something here, something here.
有些人戴着吊坠和项链，它们有一些价值，你可能拥有多个设备，而不是只带一部手机，也许你耳朵里有一个，这里有一个，那里有一个。

Depends what the use case is, what the ideal form factor is. There's issues around battery innovation, too.
这取决于使用场景，取决于理想的形态因素。电池创新也存在问题。

Like some of the stuff's really hard because you need power, constant power.
有些东西真的很难，因为你需要电源，持续的电源。

Depending on where something's located, it may be very difficult to power it or not.
取决于设备的位置，供电可能会非常困难。

So, I don't know how to do it, but if I had a vote, if I was running a company that's doing hardware, I'd try the year first. Interesting.

>> Alex, any reaction to this either on the on the Google side or on the device side?

>> Yeah, I mean, I think on the Google side, I mean, you and I have talked about this a bunch.
是的，我的意思是，在谷歌方面，我和你已经讨论过很多次了。

I don't think Google's going to get hit for a long time on the monetization part, but I agree like all of the non-monetizing searches go away first.
我不认为谷歌在货币化方面会在很长一段时间内受到冲击，但我同意所有非货币化的搜索会首先消失。

It's like, you know, how do I get here? What should I prepare for this interview? Like all of these things that aren't commerce related, but like where do I buy a like I want to buy a tennis racket right now?
就像，“我怎么到这儿？”“这次面试我该准备什么？”所有这些与商业无关的东西，但是“我现在想买一个网球拍，去哪里买？”

Like that's Google until it isn't because

>> So it isn't until you say show me the best five tennis rackets for me.

>> Oh yeah. Yeah. Cuz like if you try try that right now top 10 top five racket choices for me on cha ch versus Google search

>> right

>> I think even already now cha chibi would be better

>> Well it's it's where it will really be better is I kind of think it's like there's impulse buys which won't really be be hit by either because that's just like I'm looking at Instagram I see something that I shouldn't buy anyway and then there's highly highly considered purchases like buying a house we'll get to that later with the door and everything else but and then in the middle this is something where I think AI eventually will do a phenomenal up, which is like, I want this skew, this tennis racket.
它真正更好的地方在于，我有点认为，冲动购买不会受到任何一方的影响，因为那就像我在看Instagram，看到一些我不应该买的东西；然后是经过高度深思熟虑的购买，比如买房子，我们稍后会讨论OpenDoor和其他一切。但介于两者之间，我认为AI最终会做得非常出色，比如，“我想要这个SKU，这个网球拍。现在以最低价格给我买下来。”

Buy it for me right now at the lowest price. You're not going to go through Google and like look at coupons and like all that crap is going to go away.
现在就以最低价格给我买下来。你不会再通过谷歌去查看优惠券，所有那些垃圾都将消失。

You will just go to chat GPT or to your point, like it's possible that the Empire Strikes Back, but like the like, all right, I already have my calendar, my Gmail, everything else.
你只会去ChatGPT，或者就像你说的，帝国有可能反击，但是，好吧，我已经有了我的日历、我的Gmail和其他一切。

That personalization potentially makes it better. But the execute on this skew and buy it for me.
这种个性化可能会让它变得更好。但执行这个SKU并为我购买。

If chat GBT get it gets that going, which I think is one of their top priorities, then like that's that's going to really steal the monetization engine by from Google because like that's where they make all their money.
如果ChatGPT能够实现这一点，我认为这是他们的首要任务之一，那么这将真正从谷歌手中夺走货币化引擎，因为谷歌的所有收入都来源于此。

>> I mean, but imagine a couple things. So, first of all, like the example, if you have Gmail, you probably can figure out what tennis rackets I purchased previously.
我的意思是，但想象一下几件事。首先，举个例子，如果你有Gmail，你可能可以查到我之前购买过哪些网球拍。

I mean, if I bought in the real world, maybe not. But if I bought them online in my receipts, you know, they're going to be in my Gmail.
我的意思是，如果我是在实体店购买的，也许查不到。但如果我是在网上购买的，我的收据就会在我的Gmail里。

But then the other hand on Chad GBT, you know, I could say I prompt like, you know, I'm this ranked tennis player, better at forehand than backhand, blah blah blah blah blah, you know, etc.
但另一方面，在ChatGPT上，我可以输入提示，比如“我是这个排名的网球选手，正手比反手好，等等等等”，

Which racket's best for me. And I can't even fathom like how to do a Google search that would be something like that.

>> It's more of like Google has this like complete inventory, but I I think that advantage will not hold for long.
这更像是谷歌拥有完整的库存，但我认为这种优势不会持续太久。

And I think the metrics that they're kind of faking right now is it's like what percentage of our users are using AI and that's not using Gemini as a **DAOU** (Decentralized Autonomous Organization: 去中心化自治组织) I'm sure of that.
而且我认为他们现在有点在伪造的指标是，比如我们有多少用户在使用AI，而且我确信那不是在使用Gemini作为去中心化自治组织。

It's just like they had like an AI summary something something in there but they're losing all of the free in the premium sense searches to chat GPT.
就像他们那里有一个AI总结之类的东西，但他们正在失去所有免费的、在高级意义上的搜索流量给ChatGPT。

>> So eventually that's going to catch up with them. Well, also Chhatty Boutique is fixing the first sin of the internet, which is they charge subscriptions.
所以最终这会追上他们。嗯，ChatGPT也在纠正互联网的第一个原罪，那就是他们收取订阅费。

And so to some extent, you may not have to rebuild an advertising model if your subscription revenue is excellent.
因此，在某种程度上，如果你的订阅收入非常出色，你可能就不需要重建广告模式。

Consumers are basically learning that they should pay for things that create value, which has always been true offline.
消费者基本上正在学习为创造价值的东西付费，这在离线世界中一直都是如此。

Like there's almost nothing you consume offline except oxygen that you don't pay for.
就像你在离线状态下消费的几乎所有东西，除了氧气，你都需要付费。

But online, the first generation of internet entrepreneurs assumed you had to make things free.
但在网上，第一代互联网创业者认为你必须免费提供服务。

They sort of equated the marginal cost reduction with the value reduction and it was just a massive mistake.
他们将边际成本的降低与价值的降低混为一谈，这简直是一个巨大的错误。

And Chad GBT is now fixing that where people are going to pay for AI products directly whether it's $200 a month, $20 a month or even $2,000 a month.
而ChatGPT现在正在纠正这一点，人们将直接为AI产品付费，无论是每月200美元、20美元，甚至是2000美元。

>> And yet at the same time, merchants will still pay for traffic.

>> Yeah. So you can do hybrid, but then you can offset some of Google's advantages if you're already monetizing users through subscriptions successfully.

### 科技巨头在AI时代的挑战：亚马逊、微软、Meta、苹果

>> Yeah. Let's let's talk more broadly about how incumbents are are going to be affected. You we just talked about Google Keith.
好的。让我们更广泛地谈谈现有企业将如何受到影响。我们刚才谈到了谷歌，基思。

I'm curious to hear your thoughts when we look at the next 5 to 10 years like how you know companies like Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, how do you think they're going to handle?

>> It's a great question. I don't know what Amazon's going to do. It has the selection and the delivery.
这是一个很好的问题。我不知道亚马逊会怎么做。它拥有产品选择和配送能力。

I mean still you're there's a fulfillment one way or the other's a fulfillment aspect which is never been Google's strength.
我的意思是，仍然存在一个履行方面的问题，无论是哪种方式，这从来都不是谷歌的强项。

They've tried various initiatives none of them work. Never been it's not going to be chatbt actually fulfilling most likely

>> well most of their gross profit is AWS like that is the

>> vast another issue too structurally like maybe they don't even care to some extent at some point but I think the fulfillment's very real and Amazon is actually on fulfillment not that many people are although e-commerce fulfillment is somewhat distinct from traditional fulfillment so we'll see if there's room for innovation there but they could hold on for a long time of being the reliable delivery mechanism.
结构上还有一个很大的问题，可能在某种程度上他们甚至不在乎，但我认为履约是非常真实的，亚马逊在履约方面确实做得很好，虽然电子商务履约与传统履约有所不同，所以我们会看看那里是否有创新的空间，但他们可以长期保持作为可靠的配送机制。

You get satisficing, you get a reasonable price and quality experience and that's good enough. So maybe that sustains them for a bit.
你得到的是“满意性”，即合理的价格和质量体验，这就足够了。所以也许这能让他们维持一段时间。

Microsoft, I don't know. I think you know people gave them a lot of credit up front for their investing in AI, forging this relationship and partnership with OpenAI before it was obvious that OpenAI was going to transform all of our lives, society, industries, etc.
微软，我不知道。我认为人们在早期就给予他们很多赞誉，因为他们投资AI，在OpenAI明显将改变我们所有人的生活、社会、产业等之前，就与OpenAI建立了这种关系和伙伴关系。

But over the last two years, it's not clear that they have been able to preserve that advantage.

>> And now if you think about business applications, do you really think that Microsoft has an advantage in business applications?
现在如果你考虑商业应用，你真的认为微软在商业应用方面有优势吗？

Not in LinkedIn, not in Word, probably not in Excel. They're holding on to Excel, but there's a lot of startups, you've probably funded a few around here, that are, you know, AI for Excel and things like that.
不在LinkedIn，不在Word，可能也不在Excel。他们还在坚守Excel，但有很多初创公司，你可能在这里投资了一些，它们正在做Excel的AI化等事情。

Keynote or PowerPoint. I doubt they can hold on to that, you know, cloud revenue.
Keynote或PowerPoint。我怀疑他们能否保住这些，你知道，云收入。

Sure, for the point about AWS or Google Cloud, but that's not really why Microsoft's valued the way they are.
当然，对于AWS或Google Cloud而言，但那并非微软获得现有估值的主要原因。

So, I don't know what their advantage that's going to sustain through the AI wave is going to be.

>> Well, historically, it's always been a distribution advantage where they've just crushed everybody and it's like you go back to Lotus 123 or whatever.
嗯，从历史上看，它一直是一种分销优势，他们就是把所有人都打垮了，就像你回到Lotus 123或其他任何产品。

Pick your pick your company and it's like they just have this dominant browsers.

>> They will just they'll clone you, they'll crush you and then they'll distribute the heck out of their shittier product and then

>> Teams.

>> Yeah, Teams is a perfect example. It's like Zoom had a higher market cap than Exop.
是的，Teams就是一个完美的例子。就像Zoom的市场估值比Exop还要高。

>> Right. And then they like totally flipped after like COVID reversed and Teams is just but it's actually not because of Exxon, right?
没错。然后他们就像在疫情逆转后完全翻盘了，而Teams只是，但这实际上不是因为埃克森美孚，对吧？

It's it's because of it's not even because of CO restrictions or interest rates. They're losing but they started with they started with an advantage in coding co-pilot etc.
这是因为，甚至不是因为疫情限制或利率。他们正在失去优势，但他们最初在编码、Copilot等方面拥有优势。

They're losing that cur cursor or cognition and maybe others.

>> But it feels like developers are much more attuned to like I want good software whereas if you're like an Oompa Loompa at a big company and you're just like you're using Microsoft Office, it's just like you're using Microsoft Office whereas like developer like really really high-end developers like of course they're going to use cursor over like Microsoft Copilot.
但感觉开发者更倾向于“我想要好的软件”，而如果你是大型公司的一个普通员工，你只是在使用Microsoft Office，那你就只是在使用Microsoft Office；然而对于真正高端的开发者来说，他们当然会选择Cursor而不是Microsoft Copilot。

But I wonder if office even has a future like this is where you know when people write stuff I mean obviously Microsoft Word was default way most humans have been writing stuff for like 20 years although I grew up with word perfect but the point yeah
但我怀疑Office是否还有未来，你知道，当人们写东西的时候，微软Word显然是大多数人写东西的默认方式，已经有20年了，虽然我是用WordPerfect长大的，但重点是，是的。

>> Um, but are people with the way you know AI writes chatbt writes for you and increasingly better and are there specialized versions of that do people draft documents in word in three four five years probably not well
但是，你知道AI写作的方式，ChatGPT为你写作，而且越来越好，是否有专门的版本？人们在三四年五年后还会用Word起草文档吗？可能不会。

>> it's also like this classic disruption theory of like Microsoft Word has overshot the market, right?
这就像经典的颠覆理论，比如微软Word已经超出了市场需求，对吧？

It's like there are 9 million features in Microsoft Word that I never use. Like do I need to make a table of content contents generator for my book? Like no.
就像微软Word有900万个我从不使用的功能。比如，我需要为我的书制作一个目录生成器吗？不需要。

And like to a certain extent like Google Docs like that was pillaried when it came out because it's like oh it doesn't do the table of contents generator or whatever.
在某种程度上，像Google Docs这样的产品刚推出时也受到了批评，因为人们觉得它没有目录生成器之类的功能。

But like Microsoft Word has overshot the market but they do have the distribution which is which I think is the hardest.
但微软Word已经超出了市场需求，但他们确实拥有分发优势，我认为这是最难的。

Chachi is going to be in every it's going to be on everybody's phone or device and like so for example I was considering writing a book everybody's always like you should write a book so I was like chachi write me a book
ChatGPT将无处不在，它将出现在每个人的手机或设备上，所以举个例子，我曾考虑写一本书，大家总是说你应该写书，所以我就让ChatGPT帮我写一本书。

>> and it's a pretty good you know sort of first draft I'm not that book's not going to get written in Microsoft Word as far as I can tell

>> if it's ever written

>> It's crazy to think that for a day Sam Alman was conceivably going to join Microsoft or like

>> yeah for like 24 hours until Venode and some other friends intervened a fair amount

>> I guess I asked to ask did Microsoft sort of drop the ball on their relationship with like could they have capitalized in a much bigger way or was it just

>> I don't know you know the talent there's a complexity around talent like you know individual people if there's only 150 people that could build research models successfully talent's going to have a lot of power and if the talent doesn't want to work for Microsoft
我不知道，你知道人才方面存在复杂性，比如，如果只有150人能成功构建研究模型，那么人才将拥有巨大的权力，如果这些人才不想为微软工作，

There there may not be economics there. I mean meta's trying this of like can you use economic leverage to force people to work there?
那里可能就没有经济效益。我的意思是，Meta正在尝试，比如你能否利用经济杠杆迫使人们在那里工作？

You know, and we'll see we'll see what the results are. It's not a bad idea. Like I actually think Mark's clever. He mints more money than most.
你知道，我们会看看结果如何。这不是一个坏主意。我其实觉得马克很聪明。他比大多数人都能赚钱。

Take the money and use it. It's like imagine you're competing in sports.

>> Yeah.

>> Mark doesn't really have a salary cap.

>> Yeah.

>> So why not try to pay the highest salaries? Now there are issues when you do that and he's running into some of those, but it's a relatively coherent strategy for Meta to try it.
那为什么不尝试支付最高的薪水呢？现在这样做会遇到一些问题，他正在经历其中一些，但对Meta来说，尝试这种策略是相对连贯的。

>> I just worry I I wonder I shouldn't even say I worry like the moral hazard of it's like I mean this is kind of what went wrong with like crypto 1.0.
我只是担心，我甚至不该说担心，而是想知道这种道德风险，就像加密货币1.0时代出了问题一样。

Where it's like I'm gonna give you tons of money upfront and normally the way that you build a startup is you build the startup, you work really hard and then at the end you get the Ferrari.
就像我先给你一大笔钱，而通常你创建一家初创公司的方式是，你创建公司，努力工作，然后最终你得到法拉利。

>> And if you get the Ferrari first, will you still build the hard start? And like the people that are in it for the love of the game, they will.

>> They will. But then can you tell the difference? Can you discern the difference? In sports, it kind of works where you guarantee contracts in some sports.
他们会的。但你又能分辨出区别吗？你能辨别出不同吗？在体育界，在某些运动中，你保证合同是可行的。

But maybe that's because there's such statistical measurements of people's performance.
但这也许是因为对人们的表现有如此多的统计测量。

And a lot of people who are in sports are just so dedicated, love the game. Whatever so passion about what they do they can't imagine doing anything else but I I think this could backfire but it is a coherent strategy for a company that was losing AI race to try something different leveraging that they make probably other you know the Apple could have done this but so culturally foreign
很多从事体育运动的人都非常投入，热爱这项运动。无论他们对自己的工作多么充满热情，他们都无法想象做其他事情，但我认为这可能会适得其反，但这对于一家在AI竞赛中落后的公司来说，是一种连贯的策略，可以尝试利用他们可能制造的其他产品，比如苹果本可以这样做，但文化上却如此格格不入。

Apple could have competed on dollars they made more money than anybody else like their profits are greater than like Google's revenues or something.
苹果本可以凭借资金进行竞争，他们比任何人都赚更多的钱，比如他们的利润比谷歌的营收还要高。

Something like that I haven't done the math recently but it's pretty comparable but culturally that just wouldn't work at Apple and so it became a non-starter but they're going to have to figure out something or they're going to be irrelevant at some point too,
我最近没算过，但大致相当，但从文化上讲，这在苹果行不通，所以它根本无法启动，但他们必须想出办法，否则在某个时候他们也将变得无关紧要。

>> right? Once the device question comes into play.

>> Yes. Well, that that's what's saving Apple right now is the combin the vertical integration required to build a device successfully is something that no other company at least in the west knows how to do because you do need software, you need hardware expertise.
是的。嗯，现在拯救苹果的正是成功构建设备所需的垂直整合，这是西方至少没有其他公司知道如何做到的，因为你确实需要软件，你需要硬件专业知识。

You also need like the ability to compete on batteries and chips and like there's four or five different things you have to be pretty excellent at.
你还需要在电池和芯片方面具有竞争力，你需要在这四五件不同的事情上都非常出色。

But someone will figure out a solution at some point.

>> Well, it feels like they're looking at it like you know every Samsung phone when it comes out has a better camera for like you know a week or a year or whatever than Apple or like you know now the Samsung phone folds in half or it has all these advanced features that really aren't for the mainstream and Apple has always been like we're going to wait.
嗯，感觉他们看待这个问题的方式是，你知道，每款三星手机推出时，其摄像头在一周或一年内都会比苹果的好，或者现在三星手机可以折叠，它拥有所有这些并不真正面向主流的先进功能，而苹果一直以来的态度是“我们会等待”。

We're going to make it better but like they're not the first.

>> Yeah. And like AI strikes me as a little bit different than that because number one it's software.
是的。AI在我看来有点不同，因为首先它是软件。

So it's not like we have to go get the world's greatest AI right now and put it in in day zero.
所以不是说我们必须现在就去拿到世界上最棒的AI，并在第一天就把它投入使用。

And this whole we're going to wait three years. I mean it's just such a lost opportunity.
而“我们要等三年”这种说法，我的意思是，这简直是错失良机。

I'm convinced that like traffic fatalities would go down in this country if Siri actually work.

>> Right. Like there's so many things where they could make it better but they're treating it I mean at least from the outside in like oh this is like you know Samsung has a 400 megapixel camera or something.
没错。就像有很多地方他们可以做得更好，但他们对待它的方式——我的意思是至少从外部看来——就像“哦，这就像三星有4亿像素的摄像头一样”。

We're going to wait on that one and not get it right. And like they just announced like you know why doesn't Siri work?
我们会在那方面等待，而不是把它做好。而且他们刚刚宣布，你知道，为什么Siri不能用？

It's an embarrassment in 2025 when chat GBT is like AGI like I mean maybe not by like current researchers but like 10 years ago we would have said this is AGI and like Siri is just as bad as it was in 2015.
在2025年，当ChatGPT达到**AGI** (Artificial General Intelligence: 人工通用智能) 水平的时候，Siri仍然像2015年一样糟糕，这简直是耻辱。我的意思是，也许现在的研究人员不会这么说，但10年前我们会说这就是AGI。

It's just remarkable.

>> Yeah. Just to close the loop on this Keith what's your perspective on Meta's sort of durability or defensibility or strategy going forward?

Well, as I mentioned, I think the approach is interesting because when you want any strategy, whether you're a venture capitalist or an entrepreneur has to take advant you want to leverage the advantages you have and maximize those.
正如我所提到的，我认为这种方法很有趣，因为任何策略，无论是作为风险投资家还是企业家，都必须利用你所拥有的优势并将其最大化。

And so cash is one that Meta has. And so trying to leverage that smart, but they still need the ability to ship products.
而现金正是Meta所拥有的优势之一。因此，尝试巧妙地利用这一点，但他们仍然需要发布产品的能力。

And so for Google's weakness has always been they just don't ship products.
所以谷歌的弱点一直是他们不发布产品。

Like they have ideas, they have researchers, they have lots of money flushing around, but when is the last time Google launched an interesting product?

>> Gmail was pretty good.

>> Yeah. 2008.

>> 2004.

>> Before Yeah, actually that's right. So, um yeah. Um and then you know when did when did they do maps?
是的，其实没错。那么，你知道他们是什么时候做地图的？

Like 2005, something like that. Brett when did Brett do maps? Like it was something like that.
大概是2005年左右。布雷特是什么时候做地图的？大概是那个时候。

And then you know they acquired some things like YouTube whatever but like launched a coherent product.
然后你知道他们收购了一些东西，比如YouTube之类的，但他们推出了一款连贯的产品。

No, actually Whimo would in some ways count, but it's it's actually won't help with this problem.
不，实际上，Waymo在某些方面可以算，但它实际上并不能解决这个问题。

As far as I can tell. But like a a true sort of consumer product. I'm not sure they know how to do it,

>> right? That that's Google and the meta. The question is how defensible is their the graph that they've built?

>> Well, I don't think the graph is defensible. I think there are other assets that are.
嗯，我不认为这个社交图谱是可防御的。我认为还有其他资产是可防御的。

I think the graph has kind of been weakened by like TikTok has kind of shown that on social products the graph may certainly isn't in is not indispensable to success and may even be a handicap.
我认为社交图谱已经有点被削弱了，比如TikTok已经表明，在社交产品上，社交图谱对于成功来说肯定不是不可或缺的，甚至可能是一个障碍。

Ax is you've moved from a people you follow to a for you feed which is the default and probably how all of us engage with axe has also made the graph fairly irrelevant.
X（前身为Twitter）已经从你关注的人转向了默认的“为你推荐”信息流，这可能也是我们所有人与X互动的方式，这也使得社交图谱变得相当无关紧要。

Well, there there's a question people are asking with Sora, which is, hey, if your friends can make as good content as, you know, professional content makers, which is a big if, but maybe you want to maybe you want the best of both worlds, which is you want the social and you want the highest quality stuff
嗯，人们对Sora提出了一个问题，那就是，如果你的朋友能制作出和专业内容创作者一样好的内容（这很大程度上是个假设），那么你可能想要两全其美，既想要社交属性，又想要最高质量的内容。

>> ideally, but also Reddit, like Reddit's a 42 billion or $40 billion market cap company. No graph,

>> right?

>> So, I I think the graph was very valuable to be clear.

>> Yeah.

>> I'm just not sure it's valuable in the future.

### 房地产行业：OpenDoor的教训与机遇

>> Let's get into real estate. Let's get into open door. A lot we recently had Cass on as well.
让我们来谈谈房地产。谈谈OpenDoor。我们最近也邀请了卡斯。

Why did open door lose its way? What were the mistakes that were made? And let's talk about how we're going to fix.

>> Well, there was two. One was predictable. Venode actually warned Eric and me about this in 2015
嗯，有两个原因。其中一个是可以预见的。维诺德早在2015年就警告过埃里克和我。

That real estate has a cycl cyclical nature to it and you need to make sure that your cost structure will be acceptable when you hit the lows of that cycle.
房地产具有周期性，你需要确保在周期低谷时，你的成本结构是可接受的。

So he's basically get as many variable costs built into your company culture and as low fixed costs as possible and then you don't care like so real estate residential real estate people's intuition on this is very very off the low market like when people think real estate's dead 4 million homes transact a year high in the market six
所以他基本上是说，尽可能多地将可变成本融入公司文化，并尽可能降低固定成本，这样你就不用担心了。就像房地产，住宅房地产，人们对它的直觉非常非常偏离低迷市场，比如当人们认为房地产已死时，每年仍有400万套房屋交易，市场高峰期是600万套。

So you have four to six million transactions a year you need to build your cost structure that you can be break even or not incredibly unprofitable at 4 million transactions a
所以你每年有四百万到六百万笔交易，你需要建立你的成本结构，使得在四百万笔交易时能够盈亏平衡或不至于严重亏损。

And Eric and me collectively did not do that from 2015 to 2019. So when the Fed started raising interest rates and it actually did raise interest rates six times in a very compressed period of time which is the fastest rate of interest rate hikes
埃里克和我从2015年到2019年都没有做到这一点。因此，当美联储开始加息，并且在非常短的时间内实际加息六次，这是最快的加息速度时，

The company then went from 5 to 5.5 million transactions a year as a market as a **TAM** (Total Addressable Market: 市场总规模) to four
该公司市场总规模从每年500万到550万笔交易下降到400万笔。

And immediately started burning money. An extreme example of this that clarifies my point I think is what happened to Airbnb co the first month
并立即开始烧钱。我认为一个极端的例子可以阐明我的观点，那就是Airbnb在第一个月发生的事情。

Airbnb is a wonderful business one of the best network effect businesses maybe the best of all time 13% kind of margin take rate whatever and all of a sudden COVID happens and nobody's traveling anywhere companies had a very bloated cost structure too but nobody noticed because they're minting money nobody travels guess what all that gna is pure burn and they almost went bankrupt until they structured this very complicated deal with silver which saved the company.
Airbnb是一个很棒的业务，是最好的网络效应业务之一，也许是史上最好的，利润率约为13%，突然间疫情爆发，没有人出行，公司的成本结构也非常臃肿，但没有人注意到，因为他们正在大把赚钱，没有人出行，你猜怎么着，所有的**G&A** (General and Administrative Expenses: 一般和行政费用) 都是纯粹的消耗，他们几乎破产，直到他们与Silver达成了这项非常复杂的交易，才拯救了公司。

OpenDoor had that problem but less excusable co is kind of these true black swans that you really don't have to typically build your business taking account for in real estate you should take account for the idea that this would happen so anyway basically that's what happened openor
OpenDoor也遇到了这个问题，但更不可原谅的是，疫情这种真正的黑天鹅事件，你通常不需要在建立业务时考虑到它；但在房地产领域，你应该考虑到这种情况会发生。所以，基本上这就是OpenDoor发生的事情。

Then secondly as Eric decided he didn't want to be CEO anymore, the board for a variety of reasons promoted this completely mediocre CFO which is almost always a bad idea to be CEO and she went from mediocre to like the worst CEO on the planet.
其次，当埃里克决定不再担任CEO时，董事会出于各种原因提拔了这位完全平庸的**CFO** (Chief Financial Officer: 首席财务官) 担任CEO，这几乎总是一个糟糕的主意，而她从平庸变得像地球上最糟糕的CEO。

The company for 3 years did every possible thing you could do wrong. It still survived barely, but like literally the dumbest possible things, partnering with agents, shutting down innovation, hiring people overseas, adopting **DEI** (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion: 多元化、公平和包容) writ large, every possible mistake, stupid capital markets decisions, underinvesting in what we call **AVM** (Automated Valuation Model: 自动化估价模型), automated valuation, every possible mistake.
这家公司三年里把所有能做错的事情都做了。它勉强活了下来，但真的做了最愚蠢的事情，比如与代理商合作、扼杀创新、在海外招聘、大规模推行DEI、所有可能的错误、愚蠢的资本市场决策、对我们称之为AVM的自动化估价模型投资不足，所有可能的错误。

So, the good news is you can get like 10x value just by unwinding those mistakes, which Cass is definitely doing.
所以好消息是，你只要纠正这些错误就能获得10倍的价值，卡斯（Cass）肯定正在这样做。

Even his first month, I think he'll get half of those unwound, maybe even more, like just in one month because he, you know, faster.
甚至在他上任的第一个月，我认为他就能纠正一半，甚至更多，就像仅仅在一个月内，因为他，你知道，更快。

But, it's just like literally the more you dig in, it's kind of like Biden.
但是，这就像你挖得越深，就越像拜登。

Trump trying to cover Biden. It's like if I just stopped doing every stupid thing that Biden did, like the world would be so much better.
特朗普试图掩盖拜登。这就像如果我停止做拜登做的所有愚蠢的事情，世界就会好得多。

And like I don't have to really do any innovation. I just have to stop doing stupid. The immigration border is a perfect example.
而且我真的不需要做任何创新。我只需要停止做蠢事。移民边境就是一个完美的例子。

Like literally on day one he's just we're going to stop like enticing people to come here and all of a sudden like border crossings go from like here to here like in 24 hours.
就像他上任第一天就说，我们要停止引诱人们来这里，然后突然之间，边境偷渡在24小时内从这里骤降到那里。

So like that's like OpenDoor. It's like basically border crossings like we had Biden running the company about about as competently.

>> So what's your what's your wish? You know in our last episode with Cass Alex fleshed out kind of his Amazon for homes thesis why he got so excited about you know leading our investment in the company.
那么你的愿望是什么？你知道在我们与卡斯的上一集中，亚历克斯阐述了他关于“居家亚马逊”的论点，解释了他为什么对领导我们对这家公司的投资如此兴奋。

What's your where are you excited? Well, here's my I'll give you the top down thesis which I've shared publicly before is in 2017 I had dinner with Yuri and Max Lein and Yuri asked this question.
你兴奋的点在哪里？好吧，我给你一个自上而下的论点，我之前也公开分享过，那就是在2017年我与尤里和马克斯·莱因共进晚餐时，尤里问了这个问题。

He's like what's the largest market cap company on the planet in residential real estate?
他问，全球住宅房地产领域市值最大的公司是哪家？

And I assume there must be something outside the United States and that's why he was asking the question.
我猜肯定有美国以外的公司，所以他才会问这个问题。

Turns out the time the answer was Zillow at 18 bill and it's insane. The largest asset class period that of 30 we've basically been innovating a technology consumer technology call it 30 years like 1995 let's say to now 30 years that in the largest asset class in the world for consumers that the largest market cap company that would take advantage of any technology would be $18 billion makes absolutely no sense like that's like insane.
结果当时答案是Zillow，市值180亿美元，这太疯狂了。在人类基本创新消费技术30年（比如从1995年到现在）的时间里，全球最大的消费者资产类别中，利用任何技术实现最大市值的公司竟然只有180亿美元，这完全说不通，简直是疯了。

Our goal is to reinvent the process of buying and selling a home. And if you do that, you're going to be worth hundreds of billions of dollars.
我们的目标是重塑房屋买卖流程。如果你做到了这一点，你将价值数千亿美元。

Now, it's difficult to do that successfully, completely reinventing the process of buying and selling a large asset.
现在，要成功做到这一点，彻底重塑大型资产的买卖过程是困难的。

But it's not impossible. Things that, you know, eBay did back in 1995 to 2003 apply to homes.
但这并非不可能。你知道，eBay在1995年到2003年间所做的事情也适用于房屋交易。

Carvana has mastered this applied to automotive which for a normal American there's actually sometimes people are like oh there's nothing like in common between autos and homes but that's often very wealthy people who have like a $40 million home in Palo Alto or Athetherton and they drive you know if they drive at all like a 100k car or something like that Tesla or something
Carvana已将此应用于汽车领域，对于普通美国人来说，有时人们会说汽车和房屋之间没有什么共同点，但这通常是针对那些在帕洛阿尔托或阿瑟顿拥有价值4000万美元豪宅，并驾驶价值10万美元左右的特斯拉汽车的富人。

Most Americans have a 5 to10 ratio more like 10 now but like a reasonable ratio between the cost of the value of their car and their home.
大多数美国人的汽车和房屋价值比约为5到10，现在更接近10，这是一个合理的比例。

So, you're only talking about an order magnitude difference. And I think that we should be as valuable and some of the things we do are very comparable to what Carvana does.
所以，你只谈论一个数量级的差异。我认为我们应该同样有价值，我们所做的一些事情与Carvana所做的非常相似。

We actually have less competition than Carvana. Carvana actually has been incredibly successful given that there were very significant competitors that they were competing with, but it's a plus or minus a $40 billion company.
我们实际上比Carvana面临的竞争更少。考虑到他们曾与非常重要的创新竞争对手竞争，Carvana实际上取得了令人难以置信的成功，但它是一家市值约400亿美元的公司。

And if we just get the same multiples on what they do, we'll be worth tens of billions to $50 billion. That's like the base case.

### 金融科技的投资机会与挑战

>> I want I want to segue to fintech. You guys are among two of the best fintech investors and, you know, founders, operators, in the world.
我想转到金融科技领域。你们是世界上最好的两位金融科技投资者、创始人兼运营者。

What is the, you know, what is the state of fintech in terms of where are we actively looking for for for investments?
那么，金融科技的现状如何？我们在积极寻找哪些投资机会？

And how we think about it. Keith, why don't you start?

>> Well, I think there's lots of promising fintech companies. It's always been difficult.
我认为有很多有前途的金融科技公司。这向来很难。

Like the reality is I personally have a view that to be successful as a fintech innovation you want an underwriting advantage and a distribution advantage.
现实情况是，我个人认为，要成功进行金融科技创新，你需要拥有承保优势和分销优势。

If you have both then you can build a really epic company. If you have one you might be able to build a pretty solid company.
如果你两者兼备，你就能建立一家真正史诗级的公司。如果你只有其中之一，你可能也能建立一家相当稳健的公司。

A firm which we were both involved in had both underwriting mispric certain kinds of people were mispriced.
我们都参与过的一家公司，它既有承保方面的优势，即某些人群的定价被错误评估了。

We're going to figure out a different way to underwrite based upon other things and a distribution a very clever distribution hack that other people have now copied but basically was very innovative at the time.
我们将找出一种基于其他因素的不同承保方式，以及一种非常巧妙的分销策略，现在其他人已经复制了，但当时这非常创新。

And that's why firms, you know, $25 billion company with still upside.
这就是为什么公司，你知道，一家价值250亿美元的公司仍然有上升空间。

But I think those are rare to find. If you find them, the world's still open for innovation.
但我认为这些公司很难找到。如果你找到了它们，世界仍然对创新敞开大门。

It's not like the world's incredibly efficient around financial services. We have some very successful ones that have been built over the last 5 years that now need to infuse more AI, but they're not they're not predicated on AI.
这并不是说金融服务领域效率高得令人难以置信。我们有一些在过去五年中建立起来的非常成功的公司，它们现在需要注入更多的AI，但它们并非以AI为基础。

And I actually kind of like that because you could argue there's an AI overinvestment sort of cycle going on.
我实际上有点喜欢这样，因为你可以说现在正在发生一场AI过度投资的周期。

And arguably one way to kind of create a portfolio that's not as sensitive to AI valuations is financial services innovation which still requires distribution and innovation around underwriting.
可以说，创建一种对AI估值不那么敏感的投资组合的一种方法是金融服务创新，这仍然需要分销和承保方面的创新。

There's also this kind of question of like there's bits and atoms like you mentioned vomals cost disease right it's like you know plumbing healthcare like all of these things that are so atomcentric that will be atomcentric for a long time until we have sentient robots or something whereas every financial services product that I know of except for like the delivery of physical gold ingots like it's all bits
还有一种问题，就像你提到的“鲍莫尔成本病”（Baumol's cost disease），它涉及到比特和原子。你知道，管道工程、医疗保健等所有这些以“原子”为中心的事物，在很长一段时间内都会是“原子”为中心，直到我们有感知机器人或其他什么。而我所知道的每一种金融服务产品，除了实物金条的交付，都是“比特”的形式。

So there probably is a fair amount of upside for for AI but you still have to get the distribution which is really hard like consumer fintech products are so hard because like all of the I mean right now all of the the economic rent goes to Google or wherever you fund it from.
所以AI可能确实有很大的上行空间，但你仍然需要搞定分销，这真的很难。比如消费金融科技产品之所以如此困难，是因为现在所有的经济租金都流向了谷歌或者你从哪里获得资金。

>> Um, but for the ones that unlock distribution, it's like number one, you could bring down the variable costs that you were talking about with AI.
但是对于那些解锁分销的公司来说，第一，你可以利用AI降低你所说的可变成本。

And then number two, it's like there are I think there are so many things right now in the world, this is kind of my view on AI where it's like cost is here just for any any object, any delivery of service and value is here.
其次，我认为现在世界上有很多东西，这是我对AI的看法，就是任何物体、任何服务的交付的成本都在这里，而价值在这里。

So if you just keep value here, like you're not trying to change the value equation, but you can bring the cost down.
所以如果你只是把价值保持在这里，你不是想改变价值等式，而是可以降低成本。

Now you've unlocked a new market that just didn't exist before.

>> Yeah.

>> Um and it's almost hard to articulate what those are until you see them. But like it's like oh yeah like people wanted that.
嗯，在看到它们之前，几乎很难清楚地阐明它们是什么。但就像“哦，是的，人们想要那个”一样。

It's like um you know

>> well Square was a quintessential example that everybody thought there was no market for Square like including very smart pe like lots of very smart people that we both know

>> because you couldn't really prove that everybody really wanted to accept like credit pay credit card based payments until you actually gave them real people the option to do it.
因为你无法真正证明每个人都真的想接受信用卡支付，直到你真正给他们提供了选择。

It made it so simple, easy, intuitive that they didn't have to think about it. And then it's massive market, right?

>> Or like it's I'm on the board of a company called Wise and Wise has shown that like the market this kind of makes sense in retrospect, but like the market for real-time delivery of cash is just so much bigger than the market for like you get it two days later.
或者就像我目前在一家名为Wise的公司董事会任职，Wise已经证明了，回想起来这有点道理，但即时现金交付的市场比两天后才能到账的市场要大得多。

>> Yeah. Cash Well, Cash App, this is this is the monetization strategy beyond Cash App.
是的。Cash App，这是Cash App之外的变现策略。

Cash App makes money now. The reason why is people will pay for instant quote unquote delivery.
Cash App现在赚钱了。原因在于人们会为“即时交付”付费。

This has always been true in financial services. By the way, this is the magic behind PayPal's revenue model.
这在金融服务领域一直都是如此。顺便说一句，这就是PayPal营收模式背后的魔力。

We basically created an instant debit, effectively an instant debit or a product back before people knew those that language and then we just charge the fee for the instant receipt of the availability of the capital.
我们基本上创造了一种即时借记，实际上是一种即时借记或一种产品，在人们了解这些术语之前，我们只是对即时收到可用资金收取费用。

It's like FedEx time FedEx financial services, right? This is like, you know, Frederick Smith proved this with FedEx.

>> UPS. You pay 32 cents versus $10 overnight. It's like some people need it before TED AO some and like it turns out that's true for like a large like countably infinite number of things.
UPS。你支付32美分，而不是10美元隔夜送达。这就像有些人需要在TED AO之前得到它，而且事实证明，对于大量，像可数无限多的事物来说，情况都是如此。

So, but I think just in general for like fintech, there probably are going to be a lot of other service like the banks.
所以，但我认为总的来说，对于金融科技来说，可能会有很多其他服务，就像银行一样。

I love something that you tweeted. I think it was your pin tweet for a long time. It's like how to disrupt a market.

>> Yeah.

>> Right. Like pick something with very low **NPS** (Net Promoter Score: 净推荐值) and like you don't get better by delivering one particular service of that.
对。比如选择一个NPS很低的产品，你不会通过只提供其中一项特定服务而变得更好。

Right. It's like oh here's a camera that attaches to your phone. No, that that nobody wants that.
没错。就像“哦，这是一个可以连接到你手机的摄像头。”不，没人想要那个。

You want like the better fully integrated service so you vertically integrate and this was open door right you could just say here's a better AVM automated valuation model okay like if you really want to get the whole value I mean like would you rather be like at the at the the heart of it is like would you rather be Amazon which has a very low gross margin on products that they actually you know store and sell or would you rather be eBay which has amazing high gross margins but is the shittiest service in the world nobody wants to buy from eBay because you don't know if you're going to get the product on cloud you don't know if Eric Torber is going to ship it to me like you want to buy from Amazon and Amazon is worth $2 trillion and eBay is worth like $40 billion.
你想要更好的完全集成服务，所以你进行垂直整合，这就是OpenDoor，对吧？你可以说“这是一个更好的AVM自动化估价模型”，好吧，如果你真的想获得全部价值，我的意思是，你宁愿成为亚马逊，它在实际存储和销售的产品上毛利率很低，还是宁愿成为eBay，它拥有惊人的高毛利率，却是世界上最糟糕的服务，没人愿意从eBay购买，因为你不知道你是否会在云端收到产品，你不知道埃里克·托伯（Eric Torber）是否会把它运给我，你想要从亚马逊购买，亚马逊市值2万亿美元，而eBay市值约400亿美元。

So like obviously Amazon is better but you would misjudge that based on the gross margin classification like oh VC is only like doing high margin things and like I I think that's one of the things that I really respect about you.
所以显然亚马逊更好，但你会根据毛利率分类错误判断，比如“哦，VC只做高利润的事情”，我认为这是我非常尊重你的一点。

It's like do something really hard. It doesn't matter what the gross margin profile is. It matters like how much gross profit are you generating.

>> This is the worst thing. There's lots of bad things you learn as a NBA like it's like in list.
这是最糟糕的事情。作为NBA球员，你会学到很多不好的东西，就像在名单上一样。

This is the worst one is like the gross margin especially percentage. It's one of the reason why a Amazon is successful.
这是最糟糕的一点，就像毛利率，特别是百分比。这也是亚马逊成功的原因之一。

Stripe actually back in the day took this model and back before more people understood this and said we only care about the sliver of contribution dollars not like the percentages.
Stripe在过去采用了这种模式，在更多人理解之前，他们就说我们只关心贡献的美元份额，而不是百分比。

And everybody else was like oh you got to worry about this margin or that margin percentage.
而其他人则会说，“哦，你得担心这个利润率或那个利润率百分比。”

It's just like are we adding incremental layers of dollars actual cash? And that actually works really well.

>> Yeah. And so to the extent that VCs have soured on the or not been not as excited about the category in the in

>> perfect just send them all to us.

>> Keep being soured. Financial service terrible innovation.

>> It's a very small market. Nobody cares.

>> Nobody likes it.

>> Well, this is the point that I was getting to. It's like how many people like their bank and like a lot of these the a lot of these companies actually work because of regulatory capture.

>> Yeah.

>> Right. Like if it was very easy for Keith and I to start a bank tomorrow. Yes. Distribution is very hard, right?
没错。就像如果基思和我明天很容易就能开一家银行一样。是的。分销非常困难，对吧？

And underwriting is very hard. I'm pretty confident at least in your ability and to a lesser extent mine like we would be able to get we could build a very valuable company but it's so hard like the regulatory overlay on these things is so high and that's part of what makes it challenging because nobody likes Chase.
承保也非常困难。我相当有信心，至少在你和在较小程度上我的能力下，我们能够建立一家非常有价值的公司，但它太难了，因为这些东西的监管覆盖非常高，这也是它具有挑战性的部分原因，因为没有人喜欢大通银行。

>> Yeah. Um and there there's a saying that I love which you've heard me use a lot which is the best companies have hostages not customers and like all the financial services comp all the the incumbent financial services companies they have hostages they don't have customers and it just it turns out it's very even if you build a better product a 10 times better product it's still like the distribution is very very challenging but this is what the killer entrepreneurs can do it's like you find and this is why like you know new bank did this for Brazil like in many cases it's geo by geo just because the regulatory overlay is so high versus you build a software for a product like Microsoft Excel is Microsoft Excel for the world.
是的。我喜欢一句你听我用过很多次的话，那就是最好的公司拥有的是“人质”而不是客户。所有金融服务公司，所有现有的金融服务公司，他们拥有的是“人质”，而不是客户。事实证明，即使你开发出更好的产品，一个好10倍的产品，分销仍然非常非常具有挑战性。但这正是顶尖创业者能够做到的，就像你发现的，这就是为什么像Nubank为巴西做到了这一点，在许多情况下，它都是按地理区域进行的，仅仅因为监管覆盖非常高。相比之下，你为像Microsoft Excel这样的产品构建软件，Microsoft Excel是全球通用的。

There's no like Portuguese version of Microsoft Excel that only is sold in Brazil and Portugal.

>> This is a it's a great opportunity. It's one of the best investments I've ever made is a company in Europe called Trade Republic.
这是一个绝佳的机会。我做过的最好的投资之一是欧洲一家名为Trade Republic的公司。

It's actually better than New Bank on any metric actually. And but it could only be done in Europe.
它实际上在任何指标上都比Nubank做得更好。但它只能在欧洲实现。

It it it's not easy to translate what they do and why it's successful here. There's Robin Hood's a poor comparison here, but like is the closest, but so you have to kind of arbitrage the geo too um because and it's because of the law and regulation.
他们所做的事情以及为什么它在这里成功，并不容易复制。Robinhood在这里是一个不太恰当但最接近的比较对象，所以你必须在地理位置上进行套利，因为这涉及到法律和法规。

There's things that are easier actually to do in Europe. There's a reason why Trade Republic's better than Robin Hood because in Europe actually it's more permissive certain things and then there's things that are much easier to do here.
有些事情在欧洲实际上更容易做。Trade Republic之所以比Robinhood更好，原因是在欧洲某些事情实际上更具包容性，而有些事情在这里做起来容易得多。

And so you need someone who understands like how to do the how to create a product and value prop given the constraints and where are their gray zones and like how does it translate to customer value and so that's very difficult but there's a lot there's a modern generation of financial service innovation it's a little under the radar I mean people definitely are paying attention to ramp
所以你需要有人理解如何在给定约束条件下创造产品和价值主张，灰区在哪里，以及如何将其转化为客户价值。这非常困难，但有一代现代金融服务创新，它有点不为人知。我的意思是，人们肯定关注Ramp。

>> so you know like high-profile company but even a company in our portfolio that I've invested in many times called a most people still don't really know about

>> it's a great company

>> another company is called imprint great still fairly under the radar, competes with two public companies.
另一家公司叫Imprint，也很棒，但仍然相对低调，与两家上市公司竞争。

Actually we sort of helped seed fund it back in a firm back when they were starting the company. A firm did a corporate, you know, sort of investment.

>> Cool.

>> Well, and that's the thing. It's like, you know, software like I'm very confident that all of the banks cannot build software, will not be able to build software, will not build software.

>> We're going to use Devon. So, that's their best shot.

>> That's their best shot. But they can't really like if if it turns out that software is at the core of everything.
那是他们最好的机会。但他们不能真的，如果软件最终成为一切的核心。

Software is going to eat the world. Like why hasn't it eaten financial services?
软件将吞噬世界。为什么它还没有吞噬金融服务业？

It has around the margin. It's like the cool thing for ramp is like it's like a net new market where it was kind of like there was a shitty version of some corporate card something something but it's like that wasn't the software that was a financial product.
它在边缘地带已经有所渗透。Ramp的亮点在于它像一个全新的市场，之前有一些糟糕的企业信用卡之类的产品，但那不是软件，那是一个金融产品。

>> Once you marry it to a software product it's 10 times better. Like you have vertically integrated that

>> and the incumbents can't do this. They they're still like literally in **COBOL** (Common Business-Oriented Language: 一种面向商业的通用编程语言) often and their ability to attract talent is just like zero.

>> Yeah. That's why Devon is actually arguably over time a save for them because they won't need to attract talent.
是的。这就是为什么Devon实际上可以说是长期来看对他们的一种拯救，因为他们不需要吸引人才。

They can use software to compete with software

>> and the software can write cobalt.

>> Yep. Yeah. Exactly.

### 专家与颠覆性创新

>> We'll take the conversation full circle. We were talking about real estate. A real estate expert solved the Middle East.
我们把话题回到最初。我们谈论房地产。一位房地产专家解决了中东问题。

What does it say about the nature of expertise that a guy who was a tycoon in real estate and private equity but didn't have a ton of, you know, foreign policy expertise.
这说明了专业知识的本质是什么？一个在房地产和私募股权领域是巨头，但并没有大量外交政策专业知识的人。

You know initially or a trained background in it could be more effective than, you know, trained experts.

>> Well at KV you know from Venode on down we don't believe in experts.
在KV，你知道从维诺德（Venode）开始，我们就不相信专家。

You know Vid has a whole speech about how no expert has ever created fundamental disruption in any field.
你知道维诺德有一整篇演讲，关于没有任何专家在任何领域创造过根本性的颠覆。

You could argue that maybe in the last 90 years there's one or two exceptions but the fact that you have to argue about the one or two exceptions suggests he's right.
你可能会争辩说，在过去90年里有一两个例外，但你必须为那一两个例外争辩的事实表明他是对的。

So like for example I don't like experts like hiring domain experts in the companies I work with is pretty much a non-starter.
所以，例如，我不喜欢专家，在我合作的公司中招聘领域专家几乎是不可能的。

At PayPal, we had of the 254 employees we had in Mountain View when we went public,
在PayPal，我们在芒廷维尤（Mountain View）上市时有254名员工，

Two maybe three had any expertise in financial services. At Square, if you included me, which is I'm certainly not a prototypical financial services guy.
其中两到三个人在金融服务方面有专业知识。在Square，如果你算上我，我当然不是典型的金融服务人士。

Of the first 300 employees, maybe two had any financial services experience. So, it's a pretty common formulation.
在前300名员工中，可能只有两个人有金融服务经验。所以，这是一个相当普遍的规律。

Airbnb, I'm pretty sure Brian, Nate, and Joe did not have any hospitality experience.
Airbnb，我敢肯定布赖恩（Brian）、内特（Nate）和乔（Joe）没有任何酒店业经验。

So I think if you're going to reinvent industry, you don't want experts. So the same thing is true in politics.
所以我认为如果你要重塑一个行业，你不需要专家。政治也是如此。

If you want to solve a problem that's been intractable,

>> at least since World War II, arguably for hundreds of years, but at least the modern era been intractable, you probably don't want anybody who's got expertise in the Middle East.
至少自二战以来，可以说几百年来，但至少在现代，这个问题一直难以解决，你可能不希望任何在中东有专业知识的人参与。

You know, as Jared, you know, was maligned for, he just read books, which is a great idea.
你知道，贾里德（Jared）曾因此受到诋毁，他只是读书，这真是个好主意。

Actually, I talk about this all the time. Like people are like, where do you get your contrarian ideas? I was like, I read books.
实际上，我一直在谈论这个。人们会问：“你的逆向思维从何而来？”我回答说：“我读书。”

Like there's actually all the greatest thinking of all time is available to anybody.

>> You just have to read. And the more you read, the sharper you are because what it what Jared talks about and I think is the common formulation and we definitely apply this at KV specifically and explicitly is asking the right questions.
你只需要阅读。你读得越多，思维就越敏锐，因为贾里德所谈论的，我认为是普遍的表述，而且我们在KV明确地应用这一点，那就是提出正确的问题。

So what books prepare you to do is to ask questions. So when Jared went to the Middle East and got dispatched the first time, he actually asked the people who were influential and important in the Middle East like what do you care about and why?
所以书本让你准备好的是提问。所以当贾里德第一次被派往中东时，他实际上问了中东地区有影响力和重要的人物：“你关心什么？为什么？”

Once you understand that, you can navigate and find solutions. And that's the same thing we teach all of our investments at KV is if you ask the right questions, you'll make the right investment decisions.
一旦你理解了这一点，你就能找到方向并找到解决方案。这与我们在KV教导所有投资团队的道理一样：如果你提出正确的问题，你就会做出正确的投资决策。

So when people join the team at KV, we don't actually look at their output like are the companies great.
所以当人们加入KV团队时，我们实际上不看他们的产出，比如公司是否伟大。

We look at the quality of their questions. Venode is adamant about this, been adamant about this for like 40 years.

>> Just the quality of questions tells you everything you need to know.

>> That's a good place to wrap. You can just do things. You can just read books.

Uh Keith, thanks so I'll give you book recommendations next time.

>> Amazing. Perfect. Love

>> Thanks for having me.
