### 硅谷的“信仰”与AI投资策略

**Reid:** 这实际上是人们对**硅谷**（Silicon Valley: 位于美国加利福尼亚州北部，是高科技创新和发展的中心）不了解的一点。你从“你能突然创造出什么惊人的东西？”这个问题开始。很多公司，当你问他们“你的商业模式是什么？”他们会说：“我不知道。”他们会说：“是的，我们会努力解决，但我能在这里创造出一些惊人的东西。”这实际上是硅谷的根本，可以称之为硅谷的信仰和知识，我非常热爱、钦佩并身体力行。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This is actually one of the things that I think people don't realize about Silicon Valley. You start with what's the amazing thing that you can suddenly create. Lots of these companies, and you go, "What's your business model?" They go, "I don't know." They're like, "Yeah, we're going to try to work it out, but I can create something amazing here." And that's actually one of the fundamental, call it the religion of Silicon Valley and the knowledge of Silicon Valley that I so much love and admire and embody.</p>
</details>

**Alex:** Reid，欢迎来到播客。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Re welcome podcast.</p>
</details>

**Reid:** 很高兴来到这里。Reed，你是那个时代最成功的**Web 2**（Web 2.0: 互联网的第二代，强调用户生成内容、社交互动和云计算）投资者之一。你投资了Facebook，当然还有你共同创立的LinkedIn，以及Airbnb等等。你有一些框架帮助你做到了这一点，其中之一就是我们经常谈论并喜爱的**七宗罪**（Seven Deadly Sins: 指Reid Hoffman在Web 2.0时代用于评估投资机会的框架）。当你考虑AI投资时，你采用什么样的框架或世界观？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's great to be here. So Reed, you're one of the most successful web 2 investors of of that era. You know, Facebook, uh, LinkedIn obviously, which you co-created, Airbnb, many, many others. And you had several frameworks that helped you do that. One of which was the seven deadly sins, which we talk about often and love. As you're thinking about AI investing, what what's a framework or worldview that you take to your AI investing?</p>
</details>

**Reid:** 显然，我们都像通过一块暗玻璃，透过闪烁的频闪灯看东西，很难真正理解正在发生什么。所以我们都在这个新宇宙中航行。我不知道我是否有像克里斯托弗那样的**七宗罪**，但它仍然有效，因为这是一个关于跨越所有80亿人类的心理基础设施的问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So obviously we're all looking through a glass darkly looking through a fog with strobe lights that don't really you know are hard to understand what's going on. So we're all navigating this new this new universe. So I don't don't know if I have as Christopher but the seven deadly sins still work because that's a question of what is infrastruct psychological infrastructure across all 8 billion plus human beings.</p>
</details>

**Reid:** 但我想说有几件事。首先，会有一些显而易见的东西，比如**聊天机器人**（chatbots）、生产力、**编程辅助**（coding assistance）等。顺便说一句，这些仍然值得投资，但显然，显而易见意味着对每个人都显而易见，所以进行差异化投资会更难。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But I'd say there's a couple things. The first is um there is going to be a set of things that are the kind of the obvious line of sight obvious line of sight bunch of stuff with chat bots bunch of stuff productivity coding assistance you know da d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d and so and by the way that's still worth investing in but obviously obvious line of sight means it's obvious to everybody line of sight and so so you know uh doing a differential investment is harder.</p>
</details>

**Reid:** 第二个领域是，这意味着什么？因为人们在颠覆性领域往往说一切都会改变，而不是重要的东西会改变。就像你提到的Web 2和LinkedIn，显然，随着平台的变化，你会想，现在是否有可能出现新的LinkedIn，因为**AI**（Artificial Intelligence: 人工智能）或其他类似的东西？显然，考虑到我的背景，我希望LinkedIn能做到这一点，但你知道，我总是支持创新、创业精神和对人类最好的事物。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The second area is well what does this mean because too often people say in an area of disruption that everything changes as opposed to significant things change. So like you were mentioning web 2 and LinkedIn and and obviously you know part of this with a platform change you go okay well are there now new LinkedIns that are possible because of AI or something like that and obviously given my own heritage I would love LinkedIn to be that but you know it's it's whatever I'm always pro innovation entrepreneurship best possible thing for humanity</p>
</details>

**Alex:** 但是，那些更传统的东西，比如没有改变的**网络效应**（Network Effects: 指产品或服务的价值随着用户数量增加而增加的现象）、**企业集成**（enterprise integration）以及其他一些新平台会打乱现有秩序，但你仍然会以某种方式将其重新整合起来。那会是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um but like what are the kind of more traditional like the kind of things that haven't changed network effects you know enterprise integration you other kinds of things that that the new platform um upsets the apple cart, but you're still going to be putting that apple cart kind of back together in some way. And what is that?</p>
</details>

**Reid:** 然后第三个领域，可能是我投入最多时间的地方，就是我所认为的**硅谷盲点**（Silicon Valley Blind Spots: 指硅谷在创新和投资方面可能存在的认知局限）。因为我们倾向于认为硅谷是世界上最令人惊叹的地方之一，它拥有一个由激烈**协同竞争**（Coopetition: 合作与竞争并存的关系）、学习、发明、构建新事物等组成的网络，这非常棒。但我们也有自己的局限，自己的盲点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then the third um which is probably where I've been putting most of my time has been what I think of as Silicon Valley blind spots because what we tend to be like Silicon Valley is is one of the most amazing places in the world. there's a network of intense coopetition, learning, you know, invention, you know, kind of uh building new things, etc., which is just great. But we also have our cannons. We have our kind of blind spots.</p>
</details>

**Reid:** 对我们来说，一个典型的盲点往往是——好吧，所有事情都应该用**计算机科学**（CS: Computer Science）来完成，所有事情都应该用软件来完成，所有事情都应该用比特来完成。这是最相关的事情，顺便说一句，这是一个很好的投资领域。但是，AI革命将在哪些领域产生魔力，但又不在硅谷的盲点之内呢？这可能是我投入大部分共同创立、发明和投资时间的地方。因为我认为，通常一个非常大的盲点，正是那些你可以长期创造出像另一个标志性公司那样东西的领域。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And a classic one for us tends to be um well, everything should be done in CS, everything should be done software, everything should be done in bits. And that's the most relevant thing because by the way, it's a great area to invest. Um, but it was like, okay, what are the areas where the AI revolution will be magical but won't be within the Silicon Valley blind spots? And that's probably where I've been putting the majority of my co-founding time, invention time, um, you know, kind of investment time, etc. Because like I think usually a blind spot on something that's very very big. Yeah. Right. is precisely the kinds of things that you go, okay, you have a a long runway to create something that could be like another one of the iconic companies.</p>
</details>

### 超越比特：AI在物理世界的应用

**Alex:** 是的。让我们深入探讨一下，因为我们之前也在谈论人们如何过于关注生产力和工作流程方面，却忽略了其他元素。请多谈谈你现在觉得更有趣的其他事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Let's go deeper on that because we were also talking just just before this about how people focus so much on the productivity side, the workflow sides, but they're missing other other elements or so. Say more about other other things that you find more interesting now.</p>
</details>

**Reid:** 好的，所以，我在2015年，也就是大约十年前，告诉我在Greylock的合伙人，我说：“看，AI在生产力方面会有很多不同的应用。我会帮忙的，对吧？”比如，你们有公司需要我合作，那很好，很棒。比如企业生产力等等，这些是Greylock擅长的领域。但我说，实际上，我认为这里存在的盲点，也会是一些像，你知道，我们如何创建一个以软件速度运作的**药物发现工厂**（Drug Discovery Factory）？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, so um so one of the things I, you know, kind of told my partners back at Greylock in 2015, so it's like 10 years ago, um was I said, "Look, there's going to be a bunch of different things on productivity around AI. Um I'll help, right?" Like, you know, I'll you know, you have uh companies you want me to to work with that you're doing. Great. That's awesome. You know, enterprise productivity, etc. You know, things that Greylock tends to specialize on. But I said actually in fact what I think that's here getting the blind spots is um is also going to be some things like you know what you know as you guys both know Mattis AI um which is how do we create a drug discovery factory that works at the speed of software</p>
</details>

**Reid:** 现在显然有监管问题，有生物学上的比特问题，所以它不会纯粹是软件的速度，但我们如何做到这一点？他们说：“哦，你对生物学了解多少？”答案是：

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">right now obviously there's regulatory obviously there's biological bits obviously d and so there's it won't be purely a speed of software but how do we do this And they said, "Oh, well, what do you know about biology?" And the answer is</p>
</details>

**Alex:** 零。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">zero.</p>
</details>

**Reid:** 嗯，也许不完全是零。你知道，我在**Biohub**（Biohub: 一个致力于生物医学研究的非营利组织）董事会任职十年了，我也是**Arc**（Arc Institute: 一个专注于基础科学研究的非营利机构）的董事会成员。我一直在思考**原子世界**（World of Atoms: 指物理世界，与数字比特世界相对）和**比特世界**（World of Bits: 指数字信息世界）的交叉点。生物比特在某种程度上介于原子和比特之间。我一直在思考这个问题，以及有哪些事物能够提升人类生活，你知道，那种关注点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, it maybe not quite zero. You know, been on the board of Biohub for 10 years. I'm on the board of Arc, etc. Like, I've been thinking about the intersection of the worlds of atoms and the worlds of bits. And you have biological bits which are kind of halfway between atoms and bits in various ways. I've been thinking about this a lot and kind of what the things are, not so much with a specific company focus as much as a what are things that elevate human life, you know, kind of focus.</p>
</details>

**Reid:** 这部分是Biohub和Arc的原因。但后来我想，等等，现在有了AI，并且有了加速。例如，大约十年前，我被邀请去**斯坦福长期规划委员会**（Stanford Long-Term Planning Commission）做一次演讲，我告诉他们，他们应该基本上将所有精力投入到为每个学科开发AI工具上。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">part of the reason why Biohub, part of the reason why ARC um but then I was like well wait a minute actually now with AI and you have the acceleration because like for example um actually this detour will be fun. Um so roughly also around 10 years ago I was asked to give a uh a talk to the Stanford Long-Term Planning Commission and um what I told them uh was that they should uh basically divert and and put all of their energy into AI tools for every single discipline.</p>
</details>

**Alex:** 这远在**ChatGPT**（ChatGPT: OpenAI开发的一种大型语言模型）和所有其他东西出现之前。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And this is well before chat GBT and all the rest.</p>
</details>

**Reid:** 我用的比喻是搜索，因为想象一下，如果你在每个学科都有一个定制的搜索生产力工具。那时，我能想象并为除了理论数学或理论物理之外的每个学科构建一个。今天，你甚至可能能够做理论数学和理论物理。是的，没错。所以，这样做可以改变知识的生成、知识的交流和知识的分析。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the metaphor I used was a search metaphor because think if you had a custom search productivity tool in every single discipline. Now back then I could imagine it I could build one for every discipline other than theoretical math or theoretical physics. Today you might even be able to do theoretical math and theoretical physics. Right. Exactly. And so do that like transform knowledge generation, knowledge communication, knowledge analysis.</p>
</details>

**Reid:** 同样的事情，现在我们认为生物系统仍然过于复杂，无法模拟。我们有了所有这些惊人的**大型语言模型**（LLMs: Large Language Models），但经典的硅谷盲点是，哦，我们会把所有东西都放入模拟中，然后药物就会自动出现，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, that kind of same thing now thinking, well, well, the biological system is still too complex to simulate. We've got all these amazing things with LLMs, but like the classic Silicon Valley blind spot is, oh, we'll just put it all in simulation and drugs will fall out, right?</p>
</details>

**Reid:** 模拟是困难的。现在，你从**AlphaGo**（AlphaGo: DeepMind开发的人工智能围棋程序）和**AlphaZero**（AlphaZero: DeepMind开发的一种通用人工智能程序，通过自我对弈学习）的工作中开始看到的部分洞察是，人们只是认为物理材料会需要量子计算。现在，**量子计算**（Quantum Computing: 利用量子力学原理进行计算的新型计算模式）可以做非常惊人的事情，但实际上，仅仅是进行预测并正确地进行预测，顺便说一句，它不必100%正确。它只需要1%正确，因为你可以验证其他99%不正确，然后找到那一个正确的东西。所以，这实际上就像，这不是大海捞针，而是在一个太阳系中找一根针，对吧？但你有可能做到。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That simulation is difficult. Now part of the insight that you begin to see from like the work with alpha you know glow and alpha zero is because like people just think ah physical material is going to take quantum muning. Now quantum computing could do really amazing things but actually simply doing prediction and getting that prediction right and by the way it doesn't have to be right 100% of the time. It has to be right like 1% of the time because you can validate the other 99% weren't w were right and then finding that one thing. And so literally it's like it's not a needle in a hay stack. It's like a needle in a solar system, right? And it's like but you could possibly do that.</p>
</details>

**Reid:** 这就是导致硅谷经典地认为“我们会把所有东西都放入模拟中，然后它就会解决问题”的原因。不，那行不通。或者“哦不，我们将拥有一个超级智能的药物研究员，那将在两年后实现。”我实际上认为，也许有一天会实现，但不是很快。对吧？所以，无论如何，这就是在其他不同领域发生的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that's part of what led to like okay Silicon Valley will classically go we'll put it all in simulation and that will solve it. Nope, that's not going to work. Or oh no, we're going to have a super intelligent drug researcher and that will be two years down the thing. I actually look maybe someday, not soon. Right? So anyway, that was the kind of thing that was the the the in other different areas.</p>
</details>

**Reid:** 现在，其中一部分也是，很多人实际上没有意识到，如果我没有说得太长，我会举我给出的另一个例子，因为你会喜欢这个。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, part of it's also um you know, kind of uh what a lot of people don't realize actually if I'm not going too long I'll go I'll go to the other example that that I gave because you'll love this.</p>
</details>

**Alex:** 这会呼应我们10到15年前的一些对话。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um this will echo some of our conversations from 101 15 years ago.</p>
</details>

### AI对职业的影响：医生、律师与程序员

**Reid:** 所以，我正在准备本周日的一场辩论，主题是AI是否会在几年内取代所有医生。支持方的论点非常简单，那就是我们拥有大规模增长的能力。如果你看看今天的ChatGPT，你会发现，例如，给所有听众的建议是，如果你不把ChatGPT或同等工具作为第二意见来使用，那你简直是疯了，你是无知的。如果你得到一个严重的诊断结果，把它作为第二意见来检查。顺便说一句，如果它有分歧，那就去寻求第三意见。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um so um I am prepping for a debate about on Sunday this week on whether or not AIS will replace all doctors in a small number of years. Now the procase is very easy which is we have massively increasing capabilities. If you look at chat GBT today, um you'd go like for example, advice to everyone who's listening to this, if you're not using chat GBT or equivalent as a second opinion, you're out of your mind. You're ignorant. You get a serious result. Check it as a second opinion. And by the way, if it diverse, then go get a third.</p>
</details>

**Reid:** 诊断能力方面，这些是比地球上任何人类都更好的知识库。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um and so the diagnostic capabilities, these are much better knowledge stores than any human being on the planet.</p>
</details>

**Alex:** 所以你会说，如果医生只是一个知识库，那它就会消失。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So you go well if a doctor is just a knowledge store yeah that's going away.</p>
</details>

**Reid:** 然而，问题是，我实际上认为“医生”这个词的真正含义，并不是指“哦，有人握着你的手说没关系”等等。你知道，我实际上认为十年、二十年后仍然会有医生的职位。他们不会是知识库，他们将是知识库的专家用户，但不会是因为我上了十年医学院，我刻苦记忆了东西，所以我才是医生。那一切都将消失。那部分很好，但成为医生还有很多其他部分。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">However the question is actually think that really do mean doctor and it's not like oh someone who holds your hand and says oh it's okay etc. Um you know I actually think there will be a a position for a doctor 10 years from now 20 years from now. It won't be as the knowledge store. It will be as a user of the as an expert user of the knowledge store, but it's not going to be, oh, because I went to med school for 10 years and I memorized things intensely, that's why I'm a doctor. That's all going away. Great. That part, but that but there's a lot of other parts to being a doctor now.</p>
</details>

**Reid:** 所以，我用了ChatGPT Pro，进行了深入研究。我用了Claude 4 Opus 4.5，进行了深入研究。我用了Gemini Ultra。我用了Co-pilot，进行了深入研究。在所有这些工具中，我运用了我所知道的所有提示技巧，以获得对我立场最有利的论点，因为我想，我即将就AI进行辩论，当然应该使用AI来辩论。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I went to Chat GBT Pro, you know, using deep research. I went to Claude, you know, uh, 4 Opus 4.5 deep research. I went to Gemini Ultra. I went to co-pilot deep research. And I in all of these things, I was doing everything I knew about prompting for to give me the best possible arguments for my position because I thought, well, I'm about to debate on AI. Of course, I should be using AI debate.</p>
</details>

**Reid:** 尽管我尽了最大的努力，答案却只有B减或B。我不是说世界上没有更好的提示工程师，但我从GPT-4向公众开放六个月前就一直在做这件事。对吧？所以我在提示方面有一些经验，我不是一个业余提示者。我看到这个结果后，觉得“哦，这很有趣，它说明了当前**大型语言模型**（LLMs: Large Language Models）在推理能力上的局限性。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The answers were B minus or B despite absolute topping. And I'm not like maybe there's probably better prompters in the world, but I've been doing this since I got access to GPD4 6 months before the public did. Right? So I' I've got some experience in the whole prompting thing. It's not like I'm an amateur prompter. And so I looked at this and I went, "Oh, this is very interesting and a telling of where current LLMs are limited in their reasoning capabilities."</p>
</details>

**Reid:** 因为它基本上在10到15分钟内完成了32个GPU计算集群的推理工作，产生了惊人的结果。一个分析师需要三天才能完成的工作，它在10分钟内就完成了。当然，我并行设置了所有这些，在不同的浏览器标签中，所有系统都在运行，然后对它们进行了比较。但它的缺陷在于，它给我的是关于“好杂志、好文章”如何支持当前立场的共识意见。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</p>
<p class="english-text">because um what it did is it basically did you know 10 to 15 minutes of like 32 GPU compute clusters doing inference bringing off all in amazing work relative to a work that an analyst would have produced in 3 days was produced in 10 minutes and of course I set it up all in parallel you know with different browser tabs all all going into the different systems and then ran the comparisons across them everything but its flaw was is that it was giving me a consensus opinion about how articles in good magazines, good things are arguing for that position today.</p>
</details>

**Reid:** 所有这些论点都很薄弱，因为它们都像在说：“哦，你需要人类来交叉检查诊断结果。”这是普遍的主题。我想，顺便说一句，作为技术人员，我们非常清楚，人类交叉检查诊断结果，我们将会有AI来交叉检查诊断结果。我们将会有AI交叉检查AI交叉检查诊断结果。当然，周围会有一些人类，但这不会是20年后医生交叉检查诊断结果的中心位置。因为顺便说一句，医生应该很快学会的是，如果你相信与AI给出的共识意见不同的东西，你最好有一个非常好的理由，并且你需要去做一些调查。这并不意味着AI总是对的。这实际上是我们所有职业中都需要的东西：更多的横向思维。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And all of that was weak because it was kind of like, oh, you need to have humans cross-check the diagnosis, right? Like was a common theme across this. I'm like, well, by the way, very clearly we know as technologists that human cross-checking the diagnosis, we're going to have AI cross-checking the diagnosis. We're going to have AI cross-checking the AI are cross-checking the diagnosis. And sure, there'll be humans around here somewhere, but like that's not going to be the central place to say in 20 years doctors are going to be cross-checking the diagnosis. Cuz by the way, what doctors should be learning very quickly is if you believe something different than the consensus opinion that an AI gives you, you'd better have a very good reason and you're going to go do some investigation. Doesn't mean the AI is always right. That's actually part of what you're like what we're going to need in all of our professions is is more sideways thinking, more lateral thinking.</p>
</details>

**Reid:** 好的，这是一个很好的共识意见。现在，如果它不是共识意见呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The okay, this is good consensus opinion. Now, what if it's not consensus opinion?</p>
</details>

**Alex:** 这就是医生需要做的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's what doctors need to be doing.</p>
</details>

**Alex:** 这就是律师需要做的。这就是程序员需要做的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's what lawyers will need to be doing. That's what coders will need to be doing. You know, that's what it is.</p>
</details>

**Reid:** 而且大型语言模型在这方面仍然存在结构性限制。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And LLMs are still pretty structurally limited there.</p>
</details>

**Alex:** 很有趣。我最喜欢的一句话是**理查德·费曼**（Richard Feynman: 著名物理学家）说的：“科学是对专家无知的信仰。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, it's funny. My my favorite saying is by Richard Feman. Science is the belief in the ignorance of experts.</p>
</details>

**Reid:** 是的。有很多职业，**资历主义**（Credentialism: 强调学历、证书等资历而非实际能力或经验的倾向）就是专业性，对吧？就像“如果这样，那么那样”。就像“我有医学博士学位，所以我懂。”“我有法学博士学位，所以我懂。”这就是为什么编程实际上领先一点，因为它就像“我不在乎你从哪里获得的学位。”它有点领先于社会其他部分。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes. And there are so many professions where the credentialism is the expertness, right? It's like it's it's if this then that. And it's like I have MD, therefore I know. I have JD, therefore I know. And that's that's why coding is actually a little bit ahead of it because it's like I don't care where you got your degree. This is a it's kind of ahead of the rest of society.</p>
</details>

**Reid:** 现在，很有趣，**米尔顿·弗里德曼**（Milton Friedman: 著名经济学家，诺贝尔经济学奖得主）有一次被问到，因为他是一位著名的自由主义者，难道你不认为脑外科医生应该有资格证书吗？他回答说：“是的，市场会解决这个问题。”这听起来有点疯狂，对吧？但这就是我们现在在比特世界中进行编程的方式。但感觉很多你拥有这种不太先进思维的原因，是因为它太多地建立在层层资历主义之上。这是一个非常好的启发式方法。从历史上看，它一直如此。如果你有一个从哈佛医学院以优异成绩毕业的医生，那他很可能是一个好医生。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, um it's funny, Milton Friedman one time got asked um because he was you famous libertarian, don't you think that brain surgeons should be credentials? And it's like yeah, the market will figure that out. seems kind of crazy, right? But that's how we we now do coding when you're in the world of bits. Um, but it feels like a lot of the reasons why you have this, you know, very not not very advanced thinking is because so much of it is built upon layers of credentialism. And that's that's a very good huristic. Historically, it has been. If you have a doctor that graduated at the top of their class from Harvard Medical School, it's like probably a good doctor.</p>
</details>

**Alex:** 是的，顺便说一句，你非常需要那样的人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes. And by the way, you critically wanted that.</p>

**Reid:** 三年前，对吧？

</details>

**Alex:** 对。他们只是说：“不，不，我需要一个有知识基础的人。”你拥有它，太棒了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right. They just like, "No, no, I need someone who has the knowledge base." You have it. Great. Right.</p>
</details>

**Reid:** 但现在我们有了知识库。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But now we have a knowledge base.</p>
</details>

**Alex:** 是的，我完全同意。这就是我为什么说你会喜欢这个，因为它呼应了我们的专业知识。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, I totally agree. That was the reason I was saying you would love this because it echoes of our expertise.</p>
</details>

**Reid:** 我以为你会谈到比特与原子，这现在很有趣。高价值的工作，比如高盛的卖方分析师，那需要深入研究。而叠衣服，那需要10万美元的**资本支出**（Capex: Capital Expenditure，指用于购买、改进或延长固定资产寿命的资金）。所以它不如你每小时支付10美元的人做得好。原子世界的东西很难被颠覆。是的，我们最终会达到那里，但那是硅谷肯定存在盲点的地方。但这就像资本支出与**运营支出**（Opex: Operating Expenditure，指企业日常运营产生的费用），或者说比特与原子。

<p class="english-text">I thought you were going to get into um you know, Bits versus Adam atoms where it's kind of interesting right now where it's like all this highv value work like Goldman Sachs sellside analyst, that's deep research, right? Whereas Fold by Laundry, that's $100,000 of capex. So it doesn't work as well as somebody that you could pay $10 an hour to. And it's like the atoms stuff is so hard to actually disrupt. Yes. Um and we're going to get there eventually, but that's where Silicon Valley certainly has a blind spot. But it's like a capex versus opex or like you know bits versus Adams.</p>
</details>

**Reid:** 是的，原子是另一部分，但这也是生物学的原因，因为生物是比特化的原子。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Adams is another part, but that's also the reason why bio because bios are the are the are the are the bitty atoms.</p>
</details>

**Alex:** 是的，是的，是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes. Yes. Yes.</p>
</details>

**Reid:** 对。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right.</p>
</details>

**Alex:** 那么，为什么叠衣服这么难，而其他事情却那么容易呢？最好的解释是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And what's the what's the best explanation for why it's so hard to figure out fold folding laundry but so easy to figure out? Um</p>
</details>

**Reid:** 嗯，实际上并没有那么难。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">well it's actually not that hard to figure out</p>
</details>

**Alex:** 或者为什么我们花了更长的时间，更多的钱，因为我们无法预见到这一点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">or why it's taken us much longer much more expensive because we couldn't it would have been hard to foresee that in advance.</p>
</details>

**Reid:** 嗯，我记得几年前我和**Ilya Sutskever**（Ilya Sutskever: OpenAI联合创始人兼首席科学家）谈过这个问题，就像为什么如果你读**艾萨克·阿西莫夫**（Isaac Asimov: 著名科幻小说作家）的小说，里面谈到人们会为你做饭、叠衣服，为什么这些事情都没有发生？嗯，那是因为你从来没有一个足够聪明的大脑。这是问题的一部分，你可以，我的意思是，是的，你有像“你如何拿起这个水瓶”这样的事情，结果你的手非常非常灵巧。为什么人类比其他所有物种都更先进？有两个原因：第一，我们有对生拇指；第二，我们发明了一种语言系统，可以代代相传，那就是文字。海豚非常聪明，实际上有一个完整的理论，它不仅仅是脑容量，而是脑身比。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well I remember I talked to Ilia about this a few years ago and it's like why is it that if you read an Asimov no no novel where it talked about like how you know people will cook for you and fold your lawn like why have none of these things happened. Um and it's like well you just never had a brain that was smart enough. This was part of the problem is that you could I mean yes you have things like you know how do you actually pick up this water bottle and it turns out your hands are very very well like why are humans more advanced than every other species. So there are two reasons number one is we have opposable thumbs and then number two is we've come up with a language system that we could pass down from generation to generation which is writing dolphins are very smart like there was actually a whole theory which is it wasn't just brain size it was brain to body size</p>
</details>

**Alex:** 所以人类最高。不，不是真的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so humans were the highest. Nope. Not true.</p>
</details>

**Reid:** 现在我们实际上测量了每一种动物，有很多动物的脑身比比人类更高。嗯，比如大象或海豚的这个比例更高，我忘了具体数字，但有很多动物实际上比人类更先进，但它们没有对生拇指。正因为如此，它们从未发展出文字。所以它们无法真正代代相传。而人类做到了。然后当然，人类的状况就像这样，然后工业革命，然后它就这样发展，现在它继续这样发展。顺便说一句，这就是为什么在过去的四五年里，我意识到的一件事是，你知道，因为人类被经典地归类为**智人**（Homo Sapiens）。我实际上认为我们是**技术人**（Homo Technicus: 指通过技术迭代和积累来发展的人类），因为正是通过技术的迭代。是的，是的，没错。无论是文字、打字，你知道，但我们通过技术进行迭代。这才是真正的东西，它传递给后代，建立在科学之上，你知道，所有其他的一切。我认为这才是真正的关键。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And now that we've actually measured every single animal, there are a lot of animals that have more brain over body size. Um like that that that that ratio is in tilt of an elephant or of a dolphin or I forgot the numbers, but there are a bunch that are actually more advanced than humans, but they don't have opposable thumbs. And because of that, they never developed writing. So they can't actually iterate from generation to generation. And humans did. And then of course like the human condition was like it was this and then the industrial revolution then it went like that and now it's continued like this. By the way, this is the reason why in the last four or five years, one of the things I realized is, you know, um because of the classic uh uh classification of human beings as homo sapiens. I actually think we're homo because it's that iteration through technology. Yes. Yes. Exactly. Whatever version, writing, typing, you know, but it's we iterate through technology. That's the actual thing goes to future generations, builds on science, you know, all the rest of it. And that's what I think is really key.</p>
</details>

**Alex:** 是的。其他一些解释可能是，我们在白领工作方面有更多的训练数据，而不是像拿起东西这样的工作，或者有些人提出这种进化论的观点，认为我们使用对生拇指的时间比阅读的时间长得多。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. A couple other explanations could be that we have more training data on white collar work than sort of you know pick picking things up or or some people make this evolutionary argument that we've been using our disposable thumbs for way longer than we've been say you know reading</p>
</details>

**Reid:** 嗯，是的，那是蜥蜴脑。你的大部分大脑不是新皮层。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">well yeah it's the the lizard brain like most of your brain is not the neoortex</p>
</details>

**Reid:** 就像绘画和其他一切，这实际上非常非常困难。你找不到一只会画画的海豚。这可能是因为它们没有对生拇指，但也可能是因为大脑的那个部分没有发展。但你有数十亿年的进化，用于这些半自主的反应，比如战斗或逃跑，这在绘画出现之前就已经存在了很长时间。但我认为主要问题是，就像你说的，有电池化学问题。我不能，就像锂离子电池很酷，但它的能量密度相对于细胞中的ATP来说非常糟糕。对吧？你有所有这些机器人不工作的原因，但首先，大脑从来没有那么好。所以你有了像**发那科**（Fanuc: 机器人制造商）这样的机器人，它们制造装配线机器人。这些机器人工作得很好，但它们是高度确定性的。但一旦你进入多自由度，你需要让很多东西协同工作。而且资本支出，就像我需要10万美元才能让一个机器人叠我的衣服。我们有这么多额外的人可以做这项工作。经济上从来没有道理。但这就是为什么日本是机器人领域的领导者，因为他们雇不到任何人。所以，我不如去建造。真实的故事，我在日本打保龄球，他们有一个机器人，一个自动售货机机器人，会给你保龄球鞋，然后它会清洁保龄球鞋。对吧？你在这里永远不会建造那个，因为你会从当地高中雇一个人来做。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and like that's the like draw and paint and everything else which is actually very very hard. you can't find a dolphin that can draw or paint. And that's probably because they don't have opposable thumbs, but it's also like maybe that part of the brain hasn't developed, but you have like you have billions of years of evolution for these somewhat autonomous responses like fight or flight that's been around for a long long time well before drawing and painting. But I think the main issue is just like you have battery chemistry problems. Like I can't like it turns out like a lithium ion battery is pretty cool, but the energy density of that is terrible relative to ATP with cells, right? Like you have all of these reasons why robotics don't work, but first and foremost is the brain was never very good. So you had robotics like Fenoo, which makes assembly line robots. Those work really well, but it's like very deterministic or highly deterministic. But once you go into like, you know, multiple degrees of freedom, you have to get so many things to work. And the capex, it's like I need $100,000 to have a robot fold my laundry. And we have so many extra people that will do that work. The economics never made sense. But this is why Japan is a leader in robotics. because they can't hire anybody. So therefore, I might as well build true story, I went bowling in Japan and they had a robot to give like a vending machine robot that would give you your bowling shoes and then it would clean the bowling shoes, right? And it's like you would never build that here because you'd hire some guy from the local high school and he'd go do that.</p>
</details>

**Alex:** 是的，而且便宜得多，实际上也更有效。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. And much cheaper and actually more effective.</p>
</details>

**Reid:** 但这就是资本支出。当资本支出线和运营支出线交叉时，就会想：“哦，我应该建造机器人了。”所以这是你可能需要的另一件事。但如果成本下降，那么当然它就会有利于资本支出而不是运营支出。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But it's this capex like the capex line and the opex line when they cross then it's like oo I should build robots. So that's the other thing that you probably need. But if the cost goes down then of course it it goes in in favor of capex versus opex.</p>
</details>

### AI的本质：外推与局限

**Alex:** 我认为在机器人方面还有其他几件事需要深入探讨。一个是密度，即比特与价值的比例。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think there's other couple things to go in deeper on the robot side. So one is the density the the the the bits to value. Yeah.</p>
</details>

**Reid:** 对。所以，就像在语言中，当我们把所有这些东西封装起来，甚至包括言情小说，都有很高的比特与价值比。而在整个世界中，有很多东西，比如我们如何从所有这些比特中抽象出来，以及你如何抽象它们？还有一部分是**常识感知**（Common Sense Awareness），就像我看到GPT-2、3、4、5时，它是一个**学者型天才**（Savant: 指在特定领域表现出非凡才能，但在其他方面可能存在认知障碍的人）的进步。这些学者型天才很棒，但这并不意味着它就是学者型天才。但当它犯错时，就像一个经典例子，微软已经运行了多年的**微软智能体**（Microsoft Agents），它们之间进行长时间对话，就像让它们运行一年，看看会发生什么。它们经常会陷入“谢谢你，不，谢谢你。不，谢谢你。”一个月后，还是“谢谢你，不，谢谢你。”人类会说：“停下来！”对吧？就像它是一个简单的表达上下文感知的方式，说：“不，不，不，不。让我们保持高度的上下文感知。”即使这种进步很神奇，比如更好的数据、更好的推理、更好的个性化等等，上下文感知也只是它的一个代理。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right. So like in language when we encapsulated all these things even into like romance novels there's a high bits to value whereas when you're kind of in the whole world there's a lot of like how do you we abstract from all those bits and how do you abstract them? There's another part of it which is kind of common sense awareness like this is one of the things that like when I look at you know GBD2 3 4 5 it's a progression of sants right and the soants are amazing it doesn't mean the savant but but like when it makes mistakes like as a classic thing so Microsoft has had running for years now agents talking to each other long form like just like let's go for a year and do that and see what happens and so often they get into like oh thank you no thank you. No, thank you. One month later, thank you. No, thank you. Which human beings are like, stop, right? Like just like it's and that's like a that's a simple way of putting the context awareness thing of saying no, no, no, no. Let's let's stay very context aware. And even as magical as the progression has been, like much much better data, much much better reasoning, much much better uh personalization, etc., etc., context awareness only is a proxy of that.</p>
</details>

**Alex:** 是的，是的。我想深入探讨你关于医生的问题，因为Alex，我们刚刚发布了你关于软件吞噬劳动的演讲，我很好奇你对哪些领域会更多地采用这种副驾驶模型，哪些领域会完全取代工作有什么样的框架。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Yeah. I want to go deeper on um your question about doctor's read and because Alex, we just released one of your talks around you software eating labor and I'm curious where you how you what sort of frameworks you have for thinking about what spaces are going to have more of this co-pilot model versus what spaces it's going to be sort of replacing the work entirely.</p>
</details>

**Reid:** 我希望我能做到，我将使用一个大型语言模型来预测未来，但我会得到一个B减。也许我会得到一个B+的答案。我认为很多都像自然而然的，有一种拟态版本，就是“好吧，我信任医生。每个人都信任医生。”启发式是“你在哪里上的医学院？”显然，现在有三分之二的医生使用**开放证据**（Open Evidence: 指一种类似ChatGPT但专门摄取了《新英格兰医学杂志》等专业医学文献的AI工具）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I have I wish I could I'm going to use an LM to go predict the future, but I'm going to get a B minus. So maybe I'll answer I get a B+. Um I think a lot of it is like the natural like there there's this skumorphic version which is okay. Well, I I trust the doctor. Everybody trusts the doctor. The heristic is where did you go to medical school? Apparently, twothirds of doctors now use open evidence. Um, which is like chat GPT, but it ingested the New England Journal of Medicine have like a license to that.</p>
</details>

**Alex:** 嗯，就像ChatGPT，但它摄取了**《新英格兰医学杂志》**（New England Journal of Medicine: 世界顶级的医学期刊之一），并获得了许可。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, which is like chat GPT, but it ingested the New England Journal of Medicine have like a license to that.</p>
</details>

**Alex:** 是的，**丹尼尔·纳德勒**（Daniel Nadler: Kensho Technologies创始人）做得很好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, yeah, Daniel Nadler, good.</p>
</details>

**Reid:** 对吧？所以，是的。所以，似乎没有理由不这样做。就像我的七宗罪版本，我把它简化一下，就是每个人都想更懒惰，更富有。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, Ken, right? So, yeah. So, so that seems like there's no reason not to do that. Like my my seven deadly sins version, uh, I'll simplify it, which is like everybody wants to be lazier and richer. M</p>
</details>

**Alex:** 所以，如果这是一种让我能接触更多病人，做更少工作的方式，当然人们会使用它，没有理由不使用。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so if this is a way that I can like get more patients and do less work of course people are going to use this there's no reason not to but does it replace that particular thing and actually most of like the the software eats labor thing it doesn't actually eat labor right now the thing that's working the best is not like hey I have a product where everybody's going to lose their job nobody's going to buy that product it's very very hard to get that distributed as opposed to I will give you this magic product that allows you to be lazier obviously it's not framed this way like lazy and rich sounds kind of uh you know not not great but I'm going to let you work fewer hours and make more money. And that's that's a very killer combo. And if you have a product like that, um, and it's delivered by somebody that already has that heruristic of expertise, these are just going to go one after another and get adopted, adopted, adopted. And then eventually you're going to have cases like the one that you mentioned where if you don't use chat GPT when you get a medical diagnosis, you're insane.</p>
</details>

**Reid:** 但它并没有完全在人群中传播开来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But that has not fully diffused across the population.</p>
</details>

**Alex:** 嗯，它几乎没有传播。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, it's barely diffused.</p>
</details>

**Reid:** 不，我知道。是的。不，但你刚才说没有完全。我的意思是，部分原因每个人都开始这样做了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No, I know. Yes. No, but you were saying not fully. I mean, part of the reason everyone start doing it.</p>
</details>

**Alex:** 是的，百分之百。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes. 100%.</p>
</details>

**Reid:** 嗯，很有趣，因为它是历史上增长最快的产品。再说一次，它几乎没有。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, it's funny because it's the fastest growing product of all time. Again, it's barely, you know.</p>
</details>

**Reid:** 嗯，这就是为什么我坚信AI被严重低估了，因为在硅谷，你可能不会这么说。也许它被高估了，也许估值过高等等。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, that's why I'm convinced that AI is massively underhyped because in in Silicon Valley, you might not make that claim. Maybe it's overhyped. Maybe valuation, whatever.</p>
</details>

**Alex:** 我们都认为它没有被高估。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We all we all don't think it's overhyped.</p>
</details>

**Reid:** 嗯，但我认为一旦我在现实世界中遇到某人，我向他们展示这些东西，他们根本不知道。部分原因是他们看到了**IBM沃森**（IBM Watson: IBM开发的人工智能系统）的广告，然后说：“哦，那就是AI。”不，那不是AI，对吧？或者他们看到了假的AI。他们两年前看到了ChatGPT，它没有解决问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, but I think once I meet somebody in the real world and I show them this stuff, they have no idea. And part of it is like they see the IBM Watson commercials and like, "Oh, that's AI." No, that's not AI, right? Or they see the fake AI. They've seen chat GPT two years ago. It didn't solve a problem.</p>
</details>

**Reid:** 很有趣。我写过一篇博客文章。你知道，当你还是我在TrialPay的投资者时，我把它叫做“永远不要以现在来评判一个人”。这是一个错误，这是一个类别错误，很多大公司的人都会犯，但我的意思是这几乎是隐喻性的。我写这篇博客文章的方式是，我找到了一段**泰格·伍兹**（Tiger Woods: 著名高尔夫球手）的视频。他两岁半的时候，打出了一个完美的直球。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And uh it's funny. I I made this blog post. You know, back back when when you were my investor at Trial Pay, I called it never judge people on the present. And this is a mistake. It's it's a category error that a lot of big company people make, but I mean that almost metaphorically. And the way that I wrote this blog post was I found a video of Tiger Woods. He was two and a half years old. He hit a perfectly straight drive</p>
</details>

**Alex:** 他在《今夜秀》之类的节目上。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and uh he was on, you know, not the I think the Tonight Show or something.</p>
</details>

**Reid:** 有两种方式观看那个视频。你可以说：“嗯，我44岁。我能比那个孩子打得远得多。”这是正确的。或者你可以说：“哇，如果那个两岁半的孩子继续这样下去，他可能会非常非常出色。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And there were two ways of watching that video. You could say, "Well, I'm 44. or I can hit a drive much further than that kid, which is correct. Or you can say, "Wow, if that 2 and a halfyear-old kid keeps that up, he could be really, really good."</p>
</details>

**Reid:** 大多数人都是以现在来评判事物。是的。这就是为什么它被低估了，因为它就像他们在某个时间点尝试过。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And most people judge things on the present. Yes. And that's why it's underhyped because it's like they tried it at some point in time.</p>
</details>

**Reid:** 嗯，他们尝试的时间有一个分布，从概率上讲是在过去，然后他们会说：“哦，那对我的用例不起作用。它不起作用。”那是不好的。所以我认为它将主要围绕“更懒惰、更富有”这个概念传播开来。这就是很多事情得以发展的原因。我在那些非常大的公司中看到的较少，因为在非常大的公司中存在**委托-代理问题**（Principal-Agent Problem: 指委托人与代理人之间目标不一致或信息不对称导致的问题）。就像“好吧，我的公司赚钱了或省钱了。我是XYZ的董事。”我只知道我想早点下班并获得晋升。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um there's a distribution of when they tried it, like probabilistically it's in the past and like, "Oh, that didn't work for my use case. It doesn't work." And that's that's that's bad. But so I think it's going to diffuse largely around this like lazy rich like concept. And that's where a lot of these things have taken off. And I see it less at the very very big companies because you have a principal agent problem at the very big companies. Like okay my company made money or save money. I'm a director of XYZ. Like all I know is that I want to leave earlier and get promoted. Yeah.</p>
</details>

**Alex:** 这实际上对我有什么帮助？它帮助了公司这个虚无缥缈的存在。而在小型企业或个体经营者，或像我经营皮肤科诊所的个体医生，如果我能拥有五倍的病人，或者我是一名原告律师，我能获得五倍的和解金，那当然我会使用它，因为我能更懒惰，更富有。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And how does that actually help me? It helps the ethereal being of the corporation. Whereas at a smaller business or a sole proprietor or an individual doctor where I run a dermatology clinic and somehow I can have five times as many patients or I'm a plaintiff's attorney, I can have five times as many settlements. It's like, of course, I'm going to use that because I get to be lazier and richer.</p>
</details>

**Reid:** 是的。百分之百。

**Alex:** 我认为这是一个很棒的模型。

<details>

<p class="english-text">I think it's a great model.</p>

**Reid:** 顺便说一句，你让我想起了**伊桑·莫利克**（Ethan Mollick: 宾夕法尼亚大学沃顿商学院教授）的一句话，我经常引用：“你将使用的最糟糕的AI，就是你今天正在使用的AI。”没错。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">By the way, the other one you reminding me, uh, Ethan Mullik, uh, has a quote here that I use often that every Yes. The worst AI you're ever going to use is the AI you're using today. Correct.</p>

**Alex:** 因为它提醒你，明天再用它。

</details>

**Reid:** 是的，是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Yeah.</p>
</details>

**Reid:** 很多怀疑论者正是如此。他们会说：“嗯，我两个月前试过，它没能解决这个问题。所以它很糟糕。”那是因为你以现在来评判它。你需要进行外推。嗯，你不想在外推上走得太远，比如“哦，大型语言模型有这个。”我感觉，低估AI的人有两种：一种是一无所知的人，另一种是无所不知的人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And a lot of the skeptics, it's exactly this. It's like, well, I tried it two months ago and it didn't solve this problem. Therefore, it's bad. It's because you're judging it on the present. Like, you have to extrapolate. Um, and you don't want to get like too extrapolatory on like, you know, oh, LLMs have this. Like, you actually have I feel like the two types of people that are underhyping AI are people that know nothing and people that know everything.</p>
</details>

**Alex:** 这真的很有趣。就像那个表情包，你知道，那个傻瓜表情包，对吧？就像那些人，但它在，是的，就像分布的这一部分的人是正确的。通常，表情包是相反的。就像这些人很聪明，即使他们很笨。这些人很聪明，即使他们很聪明。这里的每个人，就像曲线的这一部分实际上是正确的，因为他们是那些正在使用它变得更富有、更懒惰的人。

It's like these part these people are smart even though they're dumb. These people are smart even though they're smart. everybody here like this is this part of the curve is actually correct because they're the ones that are using it to get richer and be lazier.</p>
</details>

**Reid:** 我还告诉人们，如果你今天还没有找到一个能帮助你解决重要问题的AI应用，而不是仅仅为你孩子的生日写一首十四行诗，或者“我的冰箱里有这些食材，我该做什么？”这些也可以做。但如果你还没有找到一个严肃的工作应用，那你就不够努力。

<p class="english-text">The other thing I also tell people is if you haven't found a use of AI that helps you on something serious today, not just write a sonet sonnet for your kid's birthday or you know I've got these ingredients in my fridge. What should I make? Do those too. But if you haven't for something like work for like something is serious about what you're doing, you're not trying hard enough.</p>

Like for example, I still think if I put in like how should Reed Hoffman make money investing in AI and I'll go try that again or I suspect I will still get what I think is the bozo business professor answer versus the actual game name of the game. But um everyone should be trying and I you know like for example we put when we get decks we put them in and say give me a due diligence plan. Right. If not everybody here doing that that's a mistake.</p>

**Alex:** 嗯，关于外推。显然，过去几年取得了令人难以置信的增长。你当然从一开始就参与了OpenAI。当我们展望未来几年时，一个更广泛的问题是，**规模法则**（Scaling Laws: 指模型性能随计算资源、数据量和模型大小的增加而可预测地提升的规律）是否会成立，或者我们能用大型语言模型走多远。我们是否需要另一种突破？你对这些问题有什么看法？

<p class="english-text">Um in terms of let's go back to extrapolation. Obviously the last few years have had incredible um growth. You you were involved of course with open eyes since the beginning. When we look for the next few years um is a broader question as to whether scaling laws will hold whether sort of the limitations um or how far we can get with with LLMs. um do we need another breakthrough of a different kind? What is your view on some of these questions?</p>
</details>

**Reid:** 所以，我们都在这个外推未来的宇宙中畅游。硅谷的一个伟大之处在于，你会听到像**奇点理论**（Theories of Singularity: 指人工智能发展到某个点后，其智能将超越人类，并以无法预测的速度自我进化的理论）、**超级智能**（Super Intelligence: 指在所有相关领域都远超人类认知能力的智能）理论、很快达到超级智能的指数级理论。我发现，通常的错误不是外推未来这件事本身，那很聪明，人们需要这样做，而且做的人太少了。我想我记得我喜欢你的帖子并帮助推广了它，如果我没记错的话。

<p class="english-text">So one of the things we you know we all swim in this universe of extrapolating the future. One of the things that's great about Silicon Valley and so you get such things as you know theories of singularity theories of super intelligence theory of exponential getting to super intelligence soon and what I find is usually the mistake in that is not the fact that extrapolating the future that's smart and people need to do that and far too few people people do I think I remember liking your post and helping promote it if I recall</p>

**Reid:** 但关键在于“那是什么曲线？”如果它是一个学者型天才曲线，那与“天哪，它是一个神化，现在它是上帝”是不同的，你知道吗？它就像“不，不，不，它将是一个比我们现在拥有的更惊人的学者型天才。”但顺便说一句，如果它只是学者型天才，那我们总有空间。总有空间留给通才、交叉检查者和上下文感知者等等。现在，也许它会跨越一个阈值，也许不会。你知道，我认为那里有很多不同的问题，但这种外推往往会变成“它是指数级的，所以两年半后就会有魔法”，而你会说：“嗯，看，它确实是魔法，但并非所有都是魔法。”这就是做事的方式。

You know, it's like no, no, no, it'll be an even more amazing savant than we have. But by the way, if it's only savant, there's always room for us. There's always rooms for the generalist and the cross checker and the context awareness and all the rest of it. Now, maybe maybe it'll cross over a threshold or not. maybe it won't you know like I think there's a bunch of different questions there but that extrapolation too often goes well it's exponential so in two and a half years magic and you're like well look it is magic but it's not all magic is the is the kind of way of doing it now.</p>
</details>

**Reid:** 所以我个人的信念是，大型语言模型的批评者犯了一个错误，我们可以讨论所有不同的批评者，“哦，它不是知识表示，它在素数上搞砸了，你知道，等等等等。”我们都。

**Reid:** 是的，也许有一些结构性的问题，即使在三到五年内，对大型语言模型来说仍然是一个难题。但AI不仅仅是“一个大型语言模型统治一切”。它是模型的组合。我们已经有了模型的组合。我们使用**扩散模型**（Diffusion Models: 一种生成模型，通过逐步去除噪声来生成数据）来完成各种图像和视频任务。顺便说一句，如果没有大型语言模型，它们也无法工作，因为需要本体论来表达“给我创建一个像星际迷航船长一样的Eric Torberg，去探索宇宙，与瓦肯人进行第一次接触”等等。现在用我们的手机就能做到，对吧？它会出现在那里，感谢OpenAI和Google，因为Google的模型也非常好，但它需要大型语言模型。但人们没有注意到的是，它将是大型语言模型和融合模型，以及我认为其他一些具有统一框架的东西。现在，一个有趣的问题是，这个框架是基于大型语言模型，还是基于其他东西？我认为这还有待确定，以及它达到智能的程度是一个有趣的问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Like, yes, maybe there's some structural things that over time, even in 3 to 5 years, will continue to be a difficult problem for LLMs. But AI is not just the one LLM to rule them all. It's a combination of models. We already have combination of models. We use diffusion models for various image and video tasks. Now, by the way, they wouldn't work al without also having the LLMs in order to have the ontology to say create me an Eric Torberg as a Star Trek captain, you know, going out to, you know, explore the universe and meeting first contact with the Vulcans and so forth, which, you know, now with our phone, we could do that, right? and it will be there uh courtesy open AI uh and you know VO because Google's model is also very good but it needs LM for that but the thing that people don't track is it's going to be LLMs and a fusion models and I think other things with a with a fabric across them now one of the interesting questions is is the fabric fundamental LLMs is the fabric other things I think that's a TBD on this and the degree to which it gets to intelligence is an interesting question.</p>
</details>

**Reid:** 现在，我认为有一件事是，你知道，我与所有批评者进行了深入交流，并不是因为我一定同意他们的批评，而是我试图找出洞察力的核心。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now one of the things I think is a Um, you know, like I I talked to all the critics intensely, not because I necessarily agree with the criticism, but I'm trying to get to the what's the kernel of insight.</p>

**Alex:** 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah.</p>
</details>

**Reid:** 就像我喜欢**斯图尔特·罗素**（Stuart Russell: 著名人工智能研究者）最近一系列对话中的一点，他说，如果我们能让这些模型的结构更可预测，那将大大缓解对“如果出了问题会怎样”的担忧。好吧，让我们尝试这样做。现在，我不认为输出的整个验证过程，就像逻辑上的，我们甚至无法验证代码，对吧？验证对我来说似乎非常困难。现在，他是一个聪明人。也许我们会弄清楚。但另一方面，“嘿，这是一个好目标。我们能让它更具可编程性、更可靠吗？”我认为这是一个好目标，非常聪明的人应该为之努力。顺便说一句，聪明的AI也是如此。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And like one of the things that I um loved about, you know, kind of a set of recent conversations with Stuart Russell was say, hey, if we could actually get the fabric of these models to be more predictable, that would greatly uh allay the fears of what happens if something goes a muck. Well, okay, let's try to do that. Now, I don't think the whole verification of outputs like like logical like we can't even do verification of coding, right? Like verification strikes me as very hard. Now, brilliant man. Maybe we'll figure it out. But the um but but on the other hand, the hey, this is a good goal. Can we make that more programmable, reliable? I think that is a good goal that people that very smart people should be working on. And by the way, smart AIs.</p>
</details>

**Reid:** 这就是数学方面的一些内容，就像如果你思考世界的基础。我的意思是，哲学是万物的基础。实际上，数学来源于哲学。它被称为**笛卡尔坐标系**（Cartesian Plane: 由勒内·笛卡尔发明的坐标系统），以笛卡尔命名。你知道，你是一个哲学家。你知道这一点，对吧？所以，你有哲学、数学、物理学，就像牛顿为什么要建立微积分来理解真实世界？所以，数学、物理学、物理学带来化学、化学带来生物学，然后生物学带来心理学。这就是这个堆栈。所以如果你解决了数学问题，那实际上是相当有趣的，因为**罗格斯大学**（Rutgers University: 美国新泽西州的一所公立研究型大学）的**康托维奇**（Contovich: 可能是指Rutgers的教授，但具体人名需核实）教授对此写了很多。我发现这部分非常引人入胜，作为一个前数学家，因为有一些非常非常困难的问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, that's some of the math side is like if you think about the the foundation of the world. I mean, uh, philosophy is the basis of everything. Actually, math cames from philosophy. It's called the cartisian plane after Decart. You know, you're a philosophy. You know this, right? So, you have you have uh philosophy, math, physics, like why did Newton build calculus to understand the real world? So, math, physics, physics gets you chemistry, chemistry gets you biology, and then biology gets you psychology. So, that's kind of the stack. So if you solve math, that's actually quite interesting because um there's a professor at Rutgers Contovich who's written about this a lot. Um and I find this part fascinating just as a former mathematician because there are some very very hard problems.</p>
</details>

**Reid:** 有传言说**纳维-斯托克斯方程**（Navier-Stokes Equation: 描述流体运动的偏微分方程）将被DeepMind解决，那将是巨大的突破。那是**克雷数学研究所**（Clay Mathematics Institute: 一个致力于推动数学研究的私人基金会）的千禧年大奖难题之一。

**Reid:** 但你知道**黎曼猜想**（Riemann Hypothesis: 数论中一个关于黎曼zeta函数零点分布的未解猜想），这不像没有评估。是的。对。如果它像，这就是为什么如果你看AI的进展，有**美国数学邀请赛**（American Invitational Math Examination: 一项面向高中生的数学竞赛），答案都是像三，都是整数，像0到9999是答案，然后当然你可以不断尝试不同的东西，然后你或者得到正确答案，或者没有，这非常非常容易做到。而一旦你开始进行证明。

**Reid:** 嗯，如果你解决了那个问题，我的意思是，那是**通用人工智能**（AGI: Artificial General Intelligence: 指能够理解或学习人类所能理解或学习的任何智力任务的AI）吗？不，因为通用人工智能的目标一直在变化。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>

<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">AGI is AI we haven't invented.</p>
</details>

**Reid:** 没错。没错。这就像一个推论，就像，你知道，如果你将要尝试的最糟糕的AI是今天，那么通用人工智能就是你明天将拥有的，对吧？这是同一种事情。但数学也是一个非常非常有趣的问题，因为你有这些东西。这不像解决高中数学，对吧？

<details>

<p class="english-text">Exactly. Exactly. It's the correlary to it's like, you know, if the worst AI you're going to try is today, well, a AGI is what you're going to have tomorrow, right? It's the same same kind of thing. But math is a very very interesting one as well because you have these things. It's not like solving high school math, right?</p>
</details>

**Reid:** 这就像如果你能够真正逻辑地构建一个证明，然后验证它。嗯，有一种编程语言叫做**Lean**（Lean: 一种形式化证明语言），就是为此而生的，那些东西也令人着迷。所以有很多不同的攻击向量，这是另一种思考方式。

<details>

</details>

### 意识、能动性与AI的未来

**Alex:** 令人着迷。正如你刚才提到的，Alex Reid，你主修哲学，但你对神经科学也非常感兴趣。有些人说，嘿，我们永远无法创造出拥有自己**意识**（Consciousness: 意识，指个体对自身和周围环境的感知和认知状态）的AI，因为我们不了解我们自己的意识。我们不了解我们自己的大脑是如何运作的。嗯，然后还有一个更广泛的问题，哦，AI是否会有自己的目标，或者是否会有自己的**能动性**（Agency: 能动性，指个体或系统自主行动和做出决策的能力）？你对围绕意识与AI的这些问题有什么看法？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Fascinating. So, as you just mentioned, Alex Reed, you're a philosophy major, but you're also very interested in deep in neuroscience. And some people say that, hey, we'll never create AI with its own consciousness because we don't understand our own consciousness. We don't understand how our own brain works. Um, and and then there's broader question as, oh, will AI have its own goals or will have its own agency? Uh, what what is sort of your view on on some of these questions surrounding consciousness relates to AI?</p>
</details>

**Reid:** 嗯，意识本身就是一个火球，我将对此说几点。我认为能动性和目标几乎是确定的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, consciousness is its own fireball, which I will say a few things about. I think agency and goals is almost certain.</p>
</details>

**Reid:** 嗯，有一个问题，我认为这是我们希望获得一些清晰和控制的领域之一，这有点像“什么样的计算结构将它整合在一起？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um there is a question I think this is one of the areas where we want to ex um have some clarity and control that was a little bit like the the kind of question what kind of compute fabric holds it together</p>
</details>

**Reid:** 因为如果没有它能够设定自己的最小子目标和其他类型的东西，你就无法进行复杂的解决问题。所以，目标设定和行为以及从中进行的推断，这就是你得到经典的那种情况，比如你让它最大化回形针，它就会试图把整个星球变成回形针。有一点肯定是旧计算机的特点，那就是没有上下文感知，这是我甚至担心现代AI系统的问题。但另一方面，如果你真的在创造智能，它们不会说“哦，让我只是尝试把所有东西都变成回形针”，它实际上并没有那么简单。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">because you can't get complex problem solving without it being able to set its own minimum sub goals and other kinds of things and so so goal setting and behavior and inference from it and that's where you get the classic kind of like well you tell it to maximize you tell it to maximize paper clips and it tries to convert the entire planet into paper clips and there's one thing that's definitely old computer that which is no context awareness something I even worry about modern AI systems but on the other hand it's like look if you're actually creating intelligence they don't go oh let me let like let me just go try to convert everything into paper clips it's like it's it's actually in fact not that simple in terms of how it plays now um</p>
</details>

**Reid:** 现在，意识是一个有趣的问题，因为有一些非常聪明的人，比如**罗杰·彭罗斯**（Roger Penrose: 英国数学物理学家，诺贝尔物理学奖得主），我很久以前采访过他，他写了**《皇帝新脑》**（The Emperor's New Mind: 罗杰·彭罗斯的著作，探讨意识与量子力学），说到数学家。嗯，你知道，他们说实际上我们的智能形式，我们的计算智能形式是基于量子的，这与我们的物理学运作方式有关，与像微管之类的东西有关。顺便说一句，这并非不可能，这是一个非常聪明的数学家提出的连贯理论，就像世界上最聪明的人之一，对吧？它属于那种“有其他人一样聪明，但没有人比他更聪明”的范畴。所以这是可能的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">now consciousness is an interesting question because you got some very smart people Roger Penrose um who I actually interviewed way back and on Emperor's New Mind, speaking of mathematicians um and um you know who are like look actually in fact there's some thing about our form of intelligence our form of of of computational intelligence that's quantum based that has to do with how our physics work that has to do with things like t tubulars and so forth and by the way it's not impossible like that's that's that's a it's a coherent theory from a very smart mathematician like one of the world's smartest right? Like it's kind of in the category of there's other people as smart, but there's no one smarter, right, in in in that convective. And so so that's possible.</p>
</details>

**Reid:** 嗯，我认为你不需要意识来进行目标设定或推理。嗯，我甚至不确定你是否需要意识来进行某些形式的自我意识。可能有一些形式的自我意识是意识所必需的。这是一个棘手的问题。哲学家们一直在努力解决这个问题，但效果不佳，只要有哲学记录以来就是如此，对吧？哲学家们同意这一点。我并不是说哲学家们会认为我是在贬低他们。他们会说：“是的，这是一个难题，因为它与能动性、**自由意志**（Free Will: 指个体在行动和决策时拥有自主选择的能力）以及其他许多事情相关。”我认为正确的做法是保持开放的心态。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um I don't think you need consciousness for um goal setting uh or reasoning. Um I'm not even sure you need consciousness for certain forms of self-awareness. There may be some forms of self-awareness that consciousness is necessary for. It's a tricky thing. philosophers have been trying to address this not very well for as long as we've got records of philosophy, right? And and philosophers agree. I'm not philosophers wouldn't think I was throwing him under the bus with this. They're like, "Yeah, this is a hard problem because it ties to agency and free will and a bunch of other things." And and I think that the right thing to do is keep an open mind.</p>
</details>

**Reid:** 现在，我认为保持开放心态的一部分是，**穆斯塔法·苏莱曼**（Mustafa Suleyman: DeepMind联合创始人，Inflection AI联合创始人）在过去一两个月写了一篇非常好的文章，关于半意识，那就是我们犯了太多错误，所有**图灵测试**（Turing Test: 一种测试机器是否展现出与人类智能无异行为的方法）的精彩之处在于，嗯，它和我们说话，所以它完全是智能的，等等。同样地，你也有谷歌工程师的那个有点疯狂的事件，他说我问这个早期模型它是否有意识，它说有，所以它就有。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now part of keeping an open mind I think u Mustafa Sulleman wrote a very good piece in the last month or two on like semi-consciousness which is we make too many mistakes all of the touring test that piece of brilliance which is um well it talks to us so therefore it's fully intelligence and all the rest and so similarly you had that kind of you know kind of nutty event from that Google engineer said I asked this earlier model was it conscious and it said yes so therefore it is</p>
</details>

**Alex:** 是的，证明完毕。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yes QED</p>
</details>

**Reid:** 你会说不，不，不。你不能被那种事情误导。例如，你知道，我认为大多数人在AI问题上执着于错误的事情。他们执着于气候变化问题，因为实际上，如果你以电力规模和可用性应用智能，你将有助于气候变化。你将解决电网和电器以及其他许多问题。就像不，这将是净超积极的。顺便说一句，你已经看到了它的元素。谷歌将其算法应用于自己的数据中心，这些数据中心是世界上调整得最好的电网系统之一。节省了40%的能源。我的意思是，仅仅是应用它。所以这是一个错误。但我认为其中一个领域是这个问题：

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you're like no no no It's like you have to be not misled by that kind of thing. And like for example, you know, the kind of thing that you know what what I actually think most people obsess about the wrong things when it comes to AI. They obsess about the climate change stuff because actually in fact if you apply intelligence at the scale and availability of electricity, you're going to help climate change. You're going to solve grids and appliances and a bunch of other stuff. It's just like no, this will be net super positive. And by the way, you already see elements of it. U Google applied its algorithms to its own data centers which are u some of the best tuned grid systems in the world. 40% energy savings. I mean just you just d and just applying it. So that's the mistake.</p>
</details>

**Reid:** 我们希望孩子们如何与AI一起成长？他们的**认识论**（Epistemology: 哲学的一个分支，研究知识的本质、来源、范围和局限）是什么？他们的学习曲线是什么？你知道，有哪些事情会影响到这一点？因为这类问题是我们希望在如何做这件事上非常有意为之的。我认为，如果你想问一个好问题，你应该努力得到好的答案，并且你可以做一些事情，并为之贡献好的答案，那是一个好问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But one of the areas I think is this question around like what is the way that we want children growing up with AIS? What is their epistemology? What is their learning curves? You know what are the things that kind of play to this? because that kind of question is something that we want to be very intentional about in terms of how we're doing it. And I think that's like like if you want to go ask a good question that you should be trying to get good answers that you could do something again and contributing good answers to, that's a good one.</p>
</details>

**Alex:** 是的。嗯，我听过最有力反对自由意志的论点就是我们是生化机器。所以如果你想测试某人的自由意志，让他们非常饥饿，非常愤怒，所有这些情况都与荷尔蒙有关。就像**去甲肾上腺素**（Norepinephrine: 一种神经递质和激素）会让你以某种特定方式行动，它就像一个覆盖。是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Well, the the most cogent argument that I've heard against free will uh is just that we are biochemical machines. So if you want to test somebody's free will, get them very hungry, very angry, like all of these things where it's just there's a hormone. It's like norepinephrine, it's like that makes you act a particular way, it's like an override. Yes.</p>
</details>

**Alex:** 所以你有了这个自由意志的东西，但你只要插入某种化学物质，然后砰的一声，它就改变了。

<p class="english-text">So you have this like free will thing, but then you just insert a certain chemical and then like boom, it changes.</p>

**Reid:** 你是说你不是**笛卡尔主义者**（Cartesian: 指笛卡尔学派的追随者，相信心物二元论）吗？你没有一个连接这两个句子的**松果体**（Pineal Gland: 大脑中的一个内分泌腺体，笛卡尔曾认为它是灵魂与身体的连接点）吗？

**Alex:** 我不知道。所以这是真的。我的意思是，就像饥饿一样，是的。我饿了。那是真的。是的。你知道，如果你正在开发超级智能，你真的想要这种有点愚蠢的覆盖吗？我的意思是，有时人们会入狱，即使他们完全正常，是因为他们非常愤怒。他们做了一些不符合性格的事情，但如果你考虑到这种自由意志被化学物质在血液中流动所覆盖的情况，那实际上并不算不符合性格，这有点疯狂。

I mean the reason why people go to jail sometimes that are perfectly normal is they get very angry. They do things that are kind of like out of character but it's actually not out of character if you think about this free will override of just like chemicals going through your bloodstream which is kind of crazy to think about.</p>
</details>

**Reid:** 听着，既然我们在一个极客播客上，我要说两件极客的事情。第一，经典的一点是人们说：“是的，我们是生化机器，但我们不要过于简化生化机器是什么。”那就像彭罗斯的量子计算等等。你在量子领域会遇到一些奇怪的事情，那就是它以概率双重叠加的形式存在，直到被测量。为什么测量中存在魔法？这种测量中的魔法是意识吗？你知道，等等等等。那里有很多东西。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Look, since we're on a geeky nerdy podcast, I'm going to say two geeky nerdy things are. One, the classic one is people say, "Yes, we are biochemical machines, but let's not be overly simplistic on what a biochemical machine is." That's like the Penrose, quantum computing, etc. And you get to this weird stuff in quantum, which is well, it's it it's of probabilistic dual superpositional form until it's measured. Why is there magic in measurement? And is that magic and measurement something that's conscious? You know, blah blah blah. know there's a bunch of stuff there.</p>
</details>

**Reid:** 另一个我认为有趣的事情是，我们看到哲学中**唯心主义**（Idealism: 哲学流派，认为意识或精神是现实的根本，物质世界由意识所创造或决定）的复兴。我们可能曾作为**物理唯物主义者**（Physical Materialists: 哲学流派，认为物质是唯一真实的存在，意识是物质的产物）认为唯心主义已经被驳倒，消失了。但实际上，人们开始说不，实际上存在的是思想，我们周围所有物理事物都来源于思想。显然，我们看到了这种版本的出现，因为你知道，我经常在硅谷被那些说“我们生活在一个模拟中”的人逗乐。我知道，你也知道。你会说：“嗯，你的**模拟理论**（Simulation Theory: 认为我们所处的现实可能是一个高级文明创造的计算机模拟）非常像基督教的**智能设计理论**（Intelligent Design Theory: 认为生命的复杂性无法通过自然选择解释，需要智能设计者）。它就像我有一些无法解释的事情。所以，因此是创造者，不，因此是模拟。不，因此是模拟的创造者。你会说不，不，不。但我，你知道。所以我显然不是一个唯心主义者，但这就是为什么我看到唯心主义正在复兴的原因。

<p class="english-text">The the other um thing that I think is interesting that we're seeing as a resurgence in philosophy a little bit is idealism. Like we would have thought as physical materialists that that we go no idealists were disproven. They're gone. But actually beginning to say no actually in fact what exists is thinking and that all of the physical things around us come from that thinking. And obviously we see versions of this because you know I find myself entertained frequently here in Silicon Valley by people saying we're living in a simulation. I know it. You know it. And you're like well your simulation theory is very much like Christian intelligent design theory. It's the I have things that I can't explain. So therefore creator no therefore simulation. No therefore creator of simulation. You're like no no no but I you know. So clearly I'm not an idealist but that's why I see some resurgence of idealism happening.</p>

**Alex:** 我怀疑，我怀疑我们会在解决意识的难题之前，解决各种定义的通用人工智能问题。

### 网络效应的持久性：LinkedIn的案例

**Alex:** 嗯，我想回到我们对话开始的LinkedIn，因为我们很幸运，或者我很幸运能和你一起工作多年。我们每周都会收到关于LinkedIn颠覆者的推介。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um I want to return to uh LinkedIn how we began the conversation because we were lucky to or I was lucky to work many years with you. We would get pitches uh every week about a LinkedIn disruptor</p>
</details>

**Alex:** 过去20年。是的。所以，没有什么能接近它。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">last 20 years. Right. Yes. And so and nothing's come even close.</p>
</details>

**Reid:** 不。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No.</p>
</details>

**Alex:** 所以这很令人着迷。我很好奇为什么人们低估了它的难度，人们对Twitter或其他看起来简单但实际上很难被取代并具有很强持久力的事物也有这种看法。这很有趣，你知道，OpenAI说他们将推出一项招聘服务，引用AI来帮助公司需求和工人供应之间找到完美的匹配。我很好奇你如何看待LinkedIn的持久性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so it's fascinating. I'm curious why people p sort of underrated how hard it was and people have this about Twitter too or other things that kind of look simple perhaps but are actually very very difficult to unseat and have a lot of staying power. And and it's interesting you know Open AI they said they're coming out with a job service to quote use AI to help find the perfect matches between what companies need and what workers can offer. I'm curious how you think about sort of LinkedIn's durability.</p>
</details>

**Reid:** 听着，我显然认为LinkedIn是持久的，但首先，我把它看作是人类、社会、行业。所以首先是哪些东西对人类有益，然后是对社会有益，然后是对行业有益。顺便说一句，我们发展行业是为了对社会、人类有益。这不是对立的。这只是你如何做出这些决定以及你在思考什么。所以我很高兴如果有新的、令人惊叹的事物能帮助人们，你知道，进行生产性工作，找到生产性工作，并让他们去做。我们将面临所有这些因AI技术颠覆而带来的工作转型，那将是太棒了。当然，如果是LinkedIn带来这些，那会更棒，考虑到我自己的个人技艺和我们所建立的成就感。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So look, I obviously think LinkedIn is durable, but first and foremost, I I kind of look at this as humanity, society, industry. So first and foremost is what are the things that are good for humanity, then what's good for society, then what's good for industry. And by the way, we do industry to be good for society, humanity. It's not an it's not oppositional. It's just a you know, how you're making these decisions and what you're thinking about. So I would be delighted if there were new amazing things that helped people um you know kind of uh make productive work, find productive work in make them do them. We're having going to have all this job transition uh coming from technological disruption with AI like it would be awesome. I of course would be extra awesome if it was LinkedIn bringing it just given my own personal craft of my hands and pride at what we built and all the rest.</p>
</details>

**Reid:** 现在，LinkedIn的情况是，你知道Alex在我的很多旅程中都与我同行，你知道，我向他寻求各种建议。嗯，LinkedIn是那种乌龟最终会成长为庞然大物的事物，因为多年来，硅谷普遍的传闻是LinkedIn是一个乏味、无聊、无用的东西等等。它将成为**Friendster**（Friendster: 早期社交媒体平台）。可能大多数听众不知道Friendster是什么。然后是**MySpace**（MySpace: 曾是全球最大的社交网站之一）。也许有些人听说过。对吧？你知道，然后当然我们有了Facebook和Meta，以及TikTok等等。LinkedIn的一部分是它建立了一个难以建立的网络，对吧？因为它没有照片分享那样的轰动和魅力。它没有那种轰动和魅力，你知道，嗯，你知道，就像你提到的七宗罪评论中的一点，嗯，当我2002年开始做那个的时候，是的，我把我的助行器留在了门口。嗯，我过去常说的是，Twitter是身份，我实际上弄错了，它是**愤怒**（Wrath: 指七宗罪之一）。所以它没有愤怒的成分。所以，嗯，所以，你知道，那个，你说LinkedIn是**贪婪**（Greed: 指七宗罪之一），很好，因为七宗罪，你知道，因为那是一种在很多人类中非常普遍的动机。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now the thing with LinkedIn and you know Alex was with me on a lot of this journey uh you know as I sought his advice on various things um the the LinkedIn was one of those things where it's where the turtle eventually actually in fact like grows into something huge because for many many years the general scuttlebutt in Silicon Valley was LinkedIn was the was the the dull boring useless thing etc. And it was going to be Frenster. Probably most people listening to this don't know what Fster is. Then MySpace. Maybe a few people have heard of that, right? You know, and then of course we got, you know, Facebook and Meta and, you know, Tik Tok and all the rest. And part of the thing for LinkedIn is it's built a network that's hard to build, right? Because it doesn't have the same sizzle and pizzazz that photo sharing has. It doesn't have the same sizzle and pizzazz that you know um you know like one of the things that uh you know you were referencing the seven deadly sins comment um and back when I started doing that 2002 yes I left my walker at the door um uh the the thing that I used to say was uh Twitter was identity I actually mistook it it's wrath right and so it doesn't have the wrath you know kind of component of it and so um and so the uh you know the the that and you said with LinkedIn LinkedIn's greed great you know because seven deadly sins kind of u you know because because that's you know a motivation that's very common across a lot of human beings</p>
</details>

**Alex:** 富有又懒惰。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">rich and lazy</p>
</details>

**Reid:** 是的，没错。所以，或者你知道，你用一种有力的方式表达，但简单来说就是更有效率，创造更多价值，并为自己积累一些价值。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yes exactly and so or you know you you're putting it in the punchy way but simply being productive yeah more value creation and acrewing some of that value to yourself</p>
</details>

**Reid:** 所以，嗯，所以我认为之所以很难创造出LinkedIn的颠覆者，是因为它是一个非常难建立的网络。实际上并不容易。而且，嗯，通过真正忠于它，你最终会得到很多人说：“嗯，这就是我为此而来的地方。”现在我有了这个人的网络，我们在这里一起协作，一起做事。这就是新事物必须具备的。嗯，你知道，当我看到GPT-4时，嗯，并且知道微软可以使用它。我打电话给LinkedIn的人，说你们必须进入房间看看这个，对吧？因为你需要开始思考我们如何用它更好地帮助人们，因为你从“这实际上是人们对硅谷不了解的一点”开始，因为你知道，普遍的讨论是“哦，你试图通过股权和所有这些收入赚大钱”，当然，商人试图这样做，但他们没有意识到的是，你从“你能突然创造出什么惊人的东西？”开始，其中一部分是很多这些公司都是这样开始的，你问“你的商业模式是什么？”他们说“我不知道”，他们说“是的，我们会努力解决，但我能在这里创造出一些惊人的东西”，这实际上是他们所说的硅谷的信仰和硅谷的知识的根本之处，我非常热爱、钦佩并身体力行。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and so um and so I think the reason why it's been difficult to create a uh a disruptor to LinkedIn is it's a very hard network to build. It's actually not easy. And um and by staying really true to it, you end up getting a lot of people going, well, this is this is where I am for that. And now I have a network of people with this and we are here together collaborating and doing stuff together. And that's the thing that a new thing would have to be. Um, and you know I uh you know I uh when I saw GBD4 um and uh knew that uh Microsoft had access to this. I called the LinkedIn people and said you guys have got to get in the room to see this, right? because you need to start thinking about what are the ways we help people more with that because you start with this is actually one of the things that I think people don't realize about Silicon Valley because you know the general discussion is oh you're trying to make all this money through equity and all this revenue of course you know business people are trying to do that but they don't realize is you start with what's the amazing thing that you can suddenly create and part of it is like lots of these companies like get started with and you go what's your business model you go I don't know like yeah we're going to try to work it out but I can create something amazing here and that's actually one of the fundamental like places of what they you know call it the religion of Silicon Valley and the knowledge of Silicon Valley that I so much you know love and admire and embody.</p>
</details>

**Alex:** 这实际上是我有一个问题。所以我要说一件事。这是对LinkedIn的巨大赞美。它是**反脆弱**（Anti-fragile: 指系统在面对冲击、波动、混乱时，不仅能抵抗，还能变得更强的特性）的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's that's actually a question that I have. So I'll say one thing. It's a huge compliment to LinkedIn. It's anti-fragile.</p>
</details>

**Reid:** 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes.</p>
</details>

**Alex:** 就像Facebook一样，“哦，没人再去那里了。”它就像瑜伽熊说的“太拥挤了，没人再去那里了。”“哦，那里有太多父母了。”总有新的出现。Snap是如何开始的？所有这些其他网络都是因为人们不想和他们的婴儿潮一代父母一起玩。嗯，我的孩子不让我关注他的Instagram，对吧？他不想用Facebook。所以LinkedIn经受住了所有这些。但你提到了一个我认为非常有趣的观点，那就是在Web 2时代，它就像“获得大量流量，获得惊人的留存率，你知道，微笑曲线，然后你就会想出如何变现。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that like Facebook, oh nobody goes there anymore. It's like the yogi bear and it's too crowded. Nobody goes there anymore. It's oh there were too many parents there and there's always been a new one. Like where did Snap like how did Snap start? like all these other networks started because people didn't want to hang out with their boomer parents. Um my my kid won't let me follow him on Instagram, right? It's like he doesn't want to use Facebook. So LinkedIn has has survived through all of that. But you referenced something that I think is a very interesting uh point which is back in like web two it was like get lots of traffic, get amazing retention, you know, smile curve and then you will figure out monetization.</p>
</details>

**Reid:** 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes.</p>
</details>

**Alex:** 就像现在没有发生那样。它不像“获得大量”。是的。ChatGPT就是这样，它每月20美元。是的。对。就像变现方式在订阅模式中非常非常清晰，而不是像“变得巨大”。是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And like that isn't happening right now. It's not like get lot Yes. It happened with chat GBT was like it's $20 a month. Yes. Right. like the monetization was kind of built in very very clear subscription versus like become giant. Yes.</p>
</details>

**Reid:** 建立一个庞大的。你认为AI会带来新的这类公司吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Build a giant like do you think there will be new ones of those with AI?</p>
</details>

**Reid:** 是的。而且会有新的高级模式。这是我们工具箱的一部分。现在，之所以更棘手，尤其是在你使用OpenAI时，是因为成本发生了一些变化。是的。对。现在是这样。是的。不，不。所以你就是不能。这就是为什么在PayPal，我们不得不改变，就像你知道的，因为你当时和我们很近，我们不得不改变为付费模式，因为我们想：“哦，看，我们的交易量呈指数级增长，这意味着成本曲线呈指数级增长，这意味着尽管我们已经筹集了数亿美元，我们仍然可以精确地计算出我们何时会破产。”对吧？因为，你知道，不，你不能有一个指数级增长的成本曲线。所以我认为这就是AI中一些不同之处的原因，因为你不能有一个指数级增长的成本曲线，至少没有一个随之而来的收入曲线。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes. And there will be new kind of premium. It's it's part of our tool chest. Now part of the reason why it's more tricky especially when you're doing open AI is because the the um like the cogs are changed a little. Yes. Right. For now. Yes. No. No. Like and so you just can't. This is one of the reasons why at PayPal we had to change to like we as you know because you were close to us there like we had to change to a paid model because we're like oh look we have exponentiating volume which means exponentiating cost curve which means despite having raised hundreds of millions of dollars we could literally count the we could point to the hour that we'd go out of business right because you know no you can't have an exponentiating cost curve. So I think that's one of the reasons why some of it has been different in AI because you like you can't have an exponentiating cost curve without at least a following revenue curve,</p>
</details>

**Alex:** 对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">right?</p>
</details>

**Reid:** 但这几乎没有乐趣。就像Pinterest一样。他们现在怎么赚钱？一家大型上市公司。就像那个时代有很多这样的公司，现在他们烧了很多钱。他们筹集了很多钱，但订阅收入从一开始就固定了。这就是基础。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But it's it's almost no fun. It's like Pinterest. It's like how are they going to make money now? Big public company. It's like there were a lot of these during that era and now it's like they're burning lots of money. They're raising lots of money but the subscription revenue is baked in from day zero and that's that's the fundament.</p>
</details>

**Alex:** 但他们不得不这样做，因为成本。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But they have to because of the cost.</p>
</details>

**Reid:** 他们不得不这样做。没错。是的。嗯，所以我正在等待像这样的一些新的公司出现，它可能会吸引七宗罪中的一个，新的对应物。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">They have to. Exactly. Yeah. Um, so I'm I'm waiting for like one of these like, you know, net new companies that appeals to probably one of the seven deadly sins that the the new counterpart.</p>
</details>

**Alex:** 是的。嗯，我很乐意和你一起做。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Well, I'd be happy to work on it with you.</p>
</details>

**Reid:** 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes.</p>
</details>

**Alex:** 嗯，这很令人着迷。有些人尝试了LinkedIn的不同角度。几年前我很好奇的一个想法是，你能在LinkedIn上获得简历，但不一定是推荐信。但就像简历具有病毒性一样，推荐信是反病毒的，人们不想把它们放在互联网上。如果有一个人们想要放在互联网上的数据集，LinkedIn在某种程度上会做到。但，是的，我认为大多数尝试这些的人都没有真正理解这些微妙之处。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, and it's fascinating. Some people have tried sort of different angles on LinkedIn. One that I was curious about a few years ago was sort of this idea of could you get um what's on LinkedIn is rums but not necessarily references. But the same way that résumés are viral, references are like anti or antimatic and people don't want them on the internet. If there was a data set that people wanted on the internet, LinkedIn would have would have done it to some degree. But uh yeah, I think most people who try these attempts don't kind of appreciate um sort of the subtleties of uh</p>
</details>

**Reid:** 我实际上，我的意思是，我们确实有相当于书籍封底推荐信的东西。是的，认可。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and I've actually I mean we do have the equivalent of book blurb references. Yes. Endorsements.</p>
</details>

**Alex:** 你没有负面推荐信。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You don't have a negative reference.</p>
</details>

**Reid:** 嗯，但顺便说一句，负面推荐信之所以存在，是因为社会关系复杂。这就是你刚才提到的负面病毒性。然后你还有复杂性，比如不仅仅是法律责任，还有社会关系以及其他许多事情。现在LinkedIn仍然是找到负面推荐信的最佳方式。我的意思是，这实际上是我使用LinkedIn来找出谁可能认识一个人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, but but by the way, part of the reason why negative references is you have complexity in social relationships. That's the negative virality point that you were just making. And then you also have complexity on like you know kind of not just legal liability but social relationships and a bunch of other stuff. Now LinkedIn is still the best way to find a negative reference. I mean that's actually one of the things that that I use LinkedIn to figure out who might know a person</p>
</details>

**Reid:** 我有一个标准的电子邮件。你可能收到过我很多这样的邮件，我发邮件给人们说：“你能给我评价一下这个人，从1到10分，或者回复我，打电话给我。”负面的。什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and I have a standard email. You've probably gotten a bunch of these from me where I've where I've I email people saying um could you rate this person for me from 1 to 10 or or reply call me. negative. What?</p>
</details>

**Alex:** 是的，是的。对。当你收到“打电话给我”时，你就会想：“好吧。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes. Yes. Right. And when you get a call me, you're like, "Okay,</p>

**Alex:** 甚至不需要接电话。是的。是的。我明白了。

<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">don't even need to take the call." Yeah. Yeah. I understand.</p>
</details>

**Reid:** 对。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right.</p>
</details>

**Reid:** 对。顺便说一句，有时当一个人回复10分时，你会说：“真的吗？”就像你认识的最好的人，对吧？但你寻找的是一系列的八九分。是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right. And by the way, sometimes you go when a person writes back 10, you're like, "Really?" Like best person, you know, right? But what you're looking for is like a set of eight nines. Yeah.</p>
</details>

**Alex:** 如果你得到了一系列的八九分，你可能仍然会打电话获取一些信息，但你会想：“好吧，我得到了一个快速的参考信息。”而顺便说一句，通常情况下，当你真正了解某人时，你会收到几个“打电话给我”，因为，我的意思是，这很快，因为电子邮件一句话，回复“打电话给我”。你就会想：“好吧，我明白了。”

<p class="english-text">But we can do this again. This is always fun. Yes.</p>
</details>

**Alex:** 是的，那太棒了。嗯，我很好奇，Reed，随着你在职业生涯中不断提升，拥有更多的机会，它们似乎在复合增长，尤其是在出售LinkedIn之后，你是如何决定将时间投入到最高杠杆的地方，你能在哪里产生最大的影响？

<p class="english-text">Yeah. That's great. the um I'm curious Reed as you've sort of continued to uplevel in your career and have more opportunities and they seem to compound especially you know post-selling LinkedIn h how have you decided where is the highest leverage use for for your time where can you have the the the the biggest impact what's your mental framework for</p>
</details>

**Reid:** 所以，我的意思是，我相信我们三个人都会同意，这是一个令人惊叹的时代。我的意思是，AI以及它对**技术人**（Homo Technicus: 指通过技术迭代和积累来发展的人类）的演变，以及生活中、社会中、工作中所有可能发生的事情的转变，都非常惊人。所以我尽可能地参与其中。它必须是非常重要的事情，以至于我才会停止做它。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so I mean one of the things that I'm sure I speak for all three of us is an amazing time to be alive I mean this AI and the transformation of what it means for evolving homo techn and what what is possible in life and in society and work and all the rest just amazing and so I stay as uh involved with that as I possibly can like it has to be something that's so important that I will stop doing that</p>
</details>

**Reid:** 你知道，在这其中，一部分是与**悉达多·穆克吉**（Siddhartha Mukherjee: 印度裔美国医生、科学家和作家，普利策奖得主）共同创立了Manusi，他是**《众病之王》**（Emperor of All Maladies: 悉达多·穆克吉的著作，一部关于癌症的“传记”）的作者，也是一些T细胞疗法的发明者。所以，例如，从他那里获得关于**FDA审批流程**（FDA Process: 美国食品药品监督管理局对新药或医疗器械进行审批的流程）的指导，那种事情会让我们所有人都尖叫着逃跑，对吧？作为一个例子。嗯，所以，你知道，那种事情，但还有，嗯，你知道，我认为真正重要的一点是，随着技术越来越多地驱动社会上发生的一切，我们如何让政府在技术方面变得更智能？所以，你知道，每个，嗯，你知道，每个秩序良好的西方民主国家，嗯，我做这个已经至少20到25年了。如果一位部长，你知道，或者来自民主国家的高级官员来寻求建议，我都会给他们。所以，你知道，就在上周，我在法国和**埃马纽埃尔·马克龙**（Emmanuel Macron: 法国总统）交谈，因为他正在努力弄清楚，我如何帮助法国工业、法国社会、法国人民？我需要做些什么？你知道，如果所有前沿模型都将在美国和可能在中国建造，那对我如何帮助我们的人民意味着什么？他正在做完全正确的事情，那就是我明白我有一个潜在的挑战。我该怎么做才能帮助我的人民？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you know now within that you know part of that was you know co-founding manusi with Sedart Mukerji who's the CEO emperor uh author of emperor all malades um inventor of um some T- cell therapies. So it's like like for example getting an instruction from him on the FDA process, you know, that's the kind of thing that makes us all run screaming for the hills, right? As a as an instance. Um and so uh you know that kind of stuff, but also um you know like one of the things I think is really important is as technology drives more and more of everything that's going on in society, how do we make government more intelligent on technology? And so, you know, every kind of um, you know, kind of well-ordered western democracy, um, I've done been doing this for at least 20 to 25 years. If if a minister, you know, or kind of senior person from a from a democracy comes and asks for advice, I give it to them. So, you know, just last week, I was in France talking with McCron because he's trying to figure out like, how do I help French industry, French society, French people? What are the things I need to be doing? you know, if all the frontier models are going to be built in the US and maybe China, what does that mean for how I help, you know, our people and so forth and and he's doing the exact right thing, which is I understand that I have a potential challenge. What do I do to help my people?</p>

**Alex:** 是的。

<p class="english-text">I've gone to six and a half days.</p>
</details>

**Alex:** 好的。我很高兴你平静下来了。你能够做到这一点的方式之一是，第一，它们是重要的问题，但第二，你有时会和朋友一起做项目，持续数十年。我们也许可以在这里结束。你对友谊思考了很多。你写过它。你谈论过它。我很好奇你发现了什么最值得注意或最令人惊讶的关于友谊的事情，你认为更多人应该欣赏，尤其是在我们进入这个AI时代，人们正在质疑下一代与朋友的关系会是怎样的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay. I'm glad you calm down. One of the ways in which you're able to do that one it's important problems but two you you work on projects with friends sometimes over over decades and you you maybe we'll close here. You've thought a lot about friendship. You've you've you've written about it. You've spoken about it. I'm I'm curious what you found um most remarkable or most surprising um about French where you think more people should appreciate especially as we enter this AI era where people yeah sort of are questioning you know the next generation what's there going to be relationship to friends</p>
</details>

**Reid:** 我实际上打算专门写很多关于这个的东西，因为AI现在带来了一些人们需要理解的非常重要的事情，那就是友谊是一种共同的关系，它不是“哦，你只是忠于我”或者“哦，你只是为我做事”。“哦，这个人是为我做事的。”嗯，有很多为你做事的人。你的公交车司机为你做事，你知道，但那并不意味着你们是朋友。朋友，例如，一个经典的说法是：“哦，我今天过得很糟糕，我去找我的朋友Alex，我想和他谈谈。”然后Alex说：“哦，天哪，这是我的一天。”我说：“哦，你的一天糟糕多了。”我们会谈论你的一天而不是我的一天，对吧？你知道，那种事情会发生，因为我认为朋友之间根本上发生的事情是，两个人同意互相帮助，成为最好的自己。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I actually am going to write a bunch about this specifically because AI is now bringing some very important things that people need to understand which is friendship is a joint relationship it's not a oh you're just loyal to me or oh you just do things for me oh this person does things for me well there's a lot of people who do things for you. Your bus driver does things for you, you know, like like but that doesn't mean that you're friends. Friends, like for example, like a classic way of putting is like, "Oh, I had a really bad day and I show up my friend Alex and I want to talk to him and then Alex like, "Oh my god, here's my day." I'm like, "Oh, your day is much worse." We're going to talk about your day versus my day, right? You know, that's the kind of thing that happens because what I think fundamentally happens with friends is two people agree to help each other become the best possible versions of themselves.</p>

**Reid:** 是的。顺便说一句，有时那会导致艰难的友谊对话。他们会说：“是的，你把这搞砸了，我需要和你谈谈。”对吧？它不是。

<p class="english-text">Yeah. And by the way, sometimes that leads to friendship conversations that are tough love. They're like, "Yeah, you're [ __ ] this up and I need to talk to you about it." Right? It's not</p>

**Reid:** 我告诉你，就像，你知道，整个奉承阶段和AI等等。不是那样的。它就像我如何帮助你？但作为其中的一部分，我在几年前在**范德堡大学**（Vanderbilt University: 位于美国田纳西州纳什维尔的私立研究型大学）做了毕业典礼演讲，主题是友谊，其中一部分是说，看，朋友的一部分不仅仅是Alex是否帮助我，而是Alex允许我帮助他，对吧？作为其中的一部分，这就是我如何成为一个更深层次的朋友，我从中学习东西，不仅仅是帮助Alex，那种共同的关系非常重要。你会看到各种各样疯狂的人说：“哦，我这里有你的AI朋友。”那就像不，你没有。它不是一种双向关系。也许是很棒的伴侣，就像非常棒，但它不是朋友。你需要明白，朋友的一部分是当我们开始意识到生活不仅仅是关于我们自己，我们是一个团队运动。我们一起投入其中。嗯，有时，你知道，友谊的对话是美妙而困难的，你知道，那种事情。我认为这才是真正重要的。现在，你知道，我们有了AI创造的这种模糊性，就像天哪，我必须很快写一些关于这个的东西，这样人们才能理解如何驾驭它，以及为什么他们不应该在短期内将AI视为朋友。

<p class="english-text">I tell you like, you know, the the whole syopency phase and AI thing and all. It's not that. It's like how do how do I help you? But as part of also the thing that I uh I gave the um commencement speech at Vanderbilt a few years back and was on friendship and part of it was to say look part of friends is not just does does Alex help me but Alex allows me to help him right and as part of that that's part of how I become a deeper friend I learn things from it's not just help that helping Alex that joint relationship is really important and you're going to see all kinds of nutty people saying oh I have your AI friend right here. It's like no you don't. It's not a birectional relationship. Maybe awesome companion like just spectacular but it's not a friend. And you need to understand like part of friend is part of when we begin to realize that life's not just about us that we that it's a team sport. We go into it together. Um that sometimes, you know, friendship conversations are wonderful and difficult, you know, and that kind of thing. And I think that's what's really important. And and now that you know we've got this blurriness that AI has created, it's like shoot I have to go write some of this very soon so that people understand how to navigate it and why they should not think about AI anytime soon.</p>
