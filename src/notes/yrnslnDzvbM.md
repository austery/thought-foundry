### SoFi 首席执行官 Noto 解读强劲财报
我们从业绩报告开始，首先是 PayPal。SoFi 的 CEO 安东尼·诺托（Anthony Noto）正在 CNBC 上。财报数据显示，SoFi 的每股收益（EPS）和营收双双超预期，每股收益超出2美分，营收超出约2000万美元。

<p class="english-text">We got some earnings. So, PayPal. I think Noto's on CNBC right now. I've seen the results. They beat on top and bottom EPS two cents EPS revenue like 20 million. But here's not and then we'll get into everything else.</p>
</details>

CNBC 主持人向诺托表示祝贺，并询问是什么在驱动这一增长，以及对2026年的展望。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Good morning to you. Congratulations on some nice earnings there. We're looking at the stock this morning. Help us understand what's driving this and then we can try to maybe look out into the future to understand a little bit better what 2026 may portend.</p>
</details>

诺托回应道：“谢谢你今天早上邀请我。我们在各个方面都取得了非凡的季度业绩。驱动我们增长的是我们独特的战略。我们是唯一一个在数字平台上可以满足你所有金融需求的地方，涵盖了你将做出的重大决策，如购买房屋或支付大学学费，日常活动如 SoFi Money 账户或为未来投资，或者在销售点需要一张签账卡。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Sure. Well, thanks for having me on this morning. We had an exceptional quarter in every way. What's driving our growth is our unique strategy. We're the only place that on the digital platform, you can get all your financial needs served across big decisions that you'll make like buying a home or paying for college, day-to-day activity like a SoFi money account or investing for your future or needing a charge card to pay at the point of sale.</p>
</details>

“这种多元化推动了非常强劲的会员和产品增长。我们的会员同比增长了35%，产品同比增长了36%，这体现在38%的收入增长上。我们上市已有17个季度，在过去的每个季度中，我们都实现了**40法则**（Rule of 40: 一种衡量软件或科技公司健康状况的指标，即收入增长率与利润率之和应大于40%）或更高，平均约为58%，这是将你的收入增长和 **EBITDA**（Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization: 未计利息、税项、折旧及摊销前的利润）利润率相加得出的。本季度这个数字是67。所以，这是持久增长、创新和品牌建设的结合。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That diversification has driven really strong member and product growth. Our members grew 35% year-over-year, products grew 36% year-over-year, and that manifests itself in revenue growth of 38%. We've been public for 17 quarters and every quarter of those last 17 we've achieved the rule of 40 or more we've averaged about 58% and that's taking your revenue growth and your ebidom market and this quarter was 67. So it's a combination of durable growth innovation and brand building.</p>
</details>

### SoFi Money：吸引新客户的“矛尖”
当被问及哪款产品是吸引新客户进入生态系统的“矛尖”时，诺托指出：“SoFi Money 是目前为止的矛尖之一。我们有600万会员。这是一个非常独特的产品，集支票和储蓄账户的优点于一身。我们提供高利率，目前约为3.88%的**APY**（Annual Percentage Yield: 年化收益率）。我们不收取任何费用，并提供奖励积分。你可以随时随地向任何人付款，可以通过电子邮件地址、电话号码、借记卡，现在还可以进行即时电汇。所以，我们努力提供最佳的储蓄和消费场所，并确保其安全、快捷、廉价。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Anthony, what is the product right now when you look at the multiple different products that you offer in terms of the tip of the spear that's bringing new customers into your ecosystem which then you're effectively selling, and upselling them other products? What is it that's happening here? Sure. So money is by far one of the things that are the tip of the spear. We have 6 million members. It's a very unique offering. It's the best of checking and savings in one. We give high interest about a 3.88% APY today. We charge no fees. We provide reward points. You can pay anybody anywhere that you would like. You can pay via an email address, via a phone number, via your debit card, via a you can now do instant wires as well. So, we tried to deliver the best place to save, the best place to spend, to do it safely, quickly, and cheaply.</p>
</details>

“除此之外，你还会成为会员，并获得免费的认证财务规划服务，因为我们正努力帮助你实现‘量入为出，投资结余’。如今，美国有一半的人不进行投资，这主要是因为他们没有可自由支配的收入来实现自己的目标。所以，这是我们的矛尖。另一款产品是 Relay。这两款产品，Relay 和 SoFi Money，都拥有超过600万用户，它们是我们的矛尖。然后我们推动了大约40%的交叉销售，本季度创下纪录，因为我们拥有广泛的产品线。我们利用所掌握的关于你的信息，帮助你更好地借贷、储蓄、消费和投资。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In addition to that, you also become a member and you get free certified financial planning because we're trying to help you spend less than you make and invest the rest. Half of the Americans in the United States don't invest today and it's primarily because they have no discretionary income to achieve their goals. So, that is at the tip of the sword. Another product, Relay. Both products are over 6 million products, both Relay and SoFi money. Those are the tip of the sword. And then we drive about 40% crossby. It was a record this quarter because we have this breath of products. We're using information that we have about you to help you borrow better, save better, spend better, and invest better. And so that is helping.</p>
</details>

### 竞争格局：从大银行手中夺取市场份额
在谈到竞争对手时，诺托明确表示：“这不是我的想法，而是我所知道的事实。我们每天都能直接看到资金的来源，它们确实来自银行。在美国，有超过5000家银行。大型银行拥有数万亿美元的存款。我们目前大约有330亿美元的存款，本季度新增了创纪录的30亿美元存款。这些存款来自我们国家最大的银行。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Who are you taking share from? If you were sitting around on a Monday morning with a whiteboard looking at sort of who you actually think of as your competitor set today, who is it? Because obviously there's the banks, there's a number of the digital platforms. I'm just curious what you would I won't answer. What do you think? Yeah. It's not what I think, it's what I know. We can actually see where the money is coming from directly every day, and it's really coming from the banks. In the United States, there's over 5,000 banks. The large banks have trillions of dollars of deposits. We're at about $33 billion of deposits today. We added a record of $3 billion of deposits. And those deposits are coming from the big banks, the largest banks in our country.</p>
</details>

“这是在 SoFi Money 产品上，正如我提到的，它是我们的矛尖。在投资领域，我们实际上是在创造新的投资者以及帮助新手投资者提升学习曲线。在学生贷款再融资方面，我们几乎没有竞争对手，因为大型金融机构并不真正提供这种产品。我想说，在抵押贷款方面，大银行不向普通大众客户提供抵押贷款。因此，在每个产品类别中，竞争对手都不同，但总的来说，是大型银行。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's on the SoFi money product, which as I mentioned is the tip of the sword. In invest, we're really actually creating new investors as well as novice investors and helping them get up the learning curve. Within student loan refinancing, we really don't compete against anyone because it's a product that's not really offered by big financial institutions. I would say in mortgage, the big banks do not offer mortgage to everyday Main Street customers. And so in each product category, the competitor is different, but overall, it's the big banks.</p>
</details>

### 拥抱 AI 与区块链两大技术超级周期
当被问及 PayPal 与 OpenAI 的合作时，诺托分享了他对技术趋势的看法：“当前正同时发生两个技术超级周期，它们都对金融科技领域和 SoFi 产生了具体影响。一个是人工智能（AI），另一个是区块链。本季度我们推出了 SoFi Pay，现在你可以通过一个**第二层区块链**（Layer 2 Blockchain: 在主区块链之上构建的协议，旨在提高可扩展性和效率）将美元从美国发送到墨西哥的某人，并将其转换为当地的法定货币比索。我们将把这项服务推广到全世界。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay. I don't know if you saw the news this morning and I don't know how early you've been up because I imagine you're on the West Coast, but PayPal and OpenAI just announced a partnership where you're going to actually be able to effectively pay for things using PayPal inside of Chat GPT going forward. And to me, this has huge implications for the entire sort of financial community because there's a question both of the opportunity set to effectively partner with some of these large language models and and chat bots, but there's also the possibility of remarkable amounts of disruption that could ultimately take place. How are you thinking about that? Sure. There are two technology super cycles happening at the same time. Both of which that impact the fintech sector and SoFi specifically. One is AI and the other is blockchain. We launched this quarter SoFi pay and you can now send dollars from the United States through a level two blockchain via SoFi to someone in Mexico and have it convert into the local fiat there in pesos. We'll roll that out throughout the entire world.</p>
</details>

“然后我们将推出 SoFi Pay 应用程序，它将允许你不仅通过区块链和**稳定币**（Stablecoin: 一种价值与某种稳定资产挂钩的加密货币）支付——SoFi 将会发行自己的稳定币——还允许你以任何你喜欢的方式支付。所以它是一种通用的支付能力。我们将在这些外国国家推出 SoFi 应用程序，以实现国际支付。我想说的是，关于这些与 ChatGPT 等合作的新闻稿，我们是在推出产品，而不是发布新闻稿。昨天有一家大银行发布了关于稳定币的新闻稿。让我们看看人们实际推出了什么，以及它们正在产生什么影响。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then we'll take the SoFi pay app which will allow you to pay not just via blockchain and stable coin which SoFi will issue but allow you to pay any other way that you would like to. So it's a universal payment capability. So, we're going to put the SoFi app in these foreign countries to allow international payments to be made. What I'd say about these press releases with Chat GPT and others is we're launching products. We're not putting out press releases. There was one yesterday about a stable coin with a big bank. Let's watch what people actually launch and the impact that they're having.</p>
</details>

“我们推出比现有机制更便宜、更快、更安全的国际汇款服务后，收到了美国消费者和我们会员非常积极的反应。所以你将继续看到我们在 AI 和区块链背后进行创新。有一件事我们没有谈到，那就是我们将成为美国第一家在我们的平台上推出购买、出售和持有加密货币的国民银行。到今年年底，我们将成为第一家提供此项服务的国民银行。我们将在第一季度推出稳定币，这将帮助我们真正推动更快、更便宜、更安全的支付。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The reaction that we got from US consumers and our members from launching international remittance cheaper, faster, and safer than the current mechanisms was really positive. And so you'll continue to see us innovate behind both AI and blockchain. One thing that we didn't talk about is that we will be the first national bank in the United States to launch buy, sell, and hold crypto on our platform. First national bank to offer that by the end of the year. We'll launch a stable coin in Q1 which will help us really drive faster, cheaper, and safer payments as well.</p>
</details>

### 市场反应与 PayPal 的重大举措
SoFi 的财报表现非常出色：每股收益超出预期22%，营收超出6%，新增95万会员，金融服务增长76%。这是一份非常亮眼的季度报告。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">These are the results on the top line for those that haven't seen it. You got a 22% EPS beat, 6% revenue beat, 950,000 members, or sorry, 76% financial services growth. And I mean it's is a pretty damn good quarter. They crushed it. I mean, Triple Beat, just like I said, they absolutely crushed it. On the surface, there is nothing to be mad at. I'm sure I'll nitpick and find something, but you can't be mad at these numbers. And they grew what? 950,000 new members. They're very close to getting a million a quarter.</p>
</details>

与此同时，PayPal 的股价上涨了15%。这不仅是因为其良好的每股收益和营收表现，更是因为它宣布了与 OpenAI 的合作，并首次派发股息。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">PayPal said the magic word. Open AI for PayPal. Why is PayPal up this morning, dude? They're up 15%. PayPal is up 15%. And the reason they're up is because yeah, it was a good EPS and revenue beep. But Andrew Chris or whatever his name is was like, "Nothing else is going to get this stock to go up. Let's just freaking mention Open AI and become an AI company and you were going to go up."</p>
</details>

PayPal 宣布了每股14美分的季度股息。这一举措意义重大，因为它使 PayPal 成为了所有股息 ETF 的主要候选对象。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Did they give a dividend, guys? I heard that they gave a dividend. Yeah, they've announced a dividend. They're listening. Look at that. You've been asking for this for a while, right? Been asking for it. They just became a prime candidate to be in every single dividend ETF. Company initiates a quarterly dividend of 14 cents a share. I mean, dude, that's it's a big deal. It's a big deal in my opinion.</p>
</details>

结合股票回购、股息、与 OpenAI 的合作以及超预期的业绩，PayPal 的股价得到了强有力的提振。其与 OpenAI 的合作将使其成为 ChatGPT 内部的集成支付伙伴。尽管目前尚不清楚会有多少人在 ChatGPT 上购物，但这无疑为 PayPal 增加了交易量，并提供了一个强有力的增长叙事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">They're buying back stock and they're doing divvies. And then they announced an opening eye partnership. They're going to be like an integrated payments partner inside of SHABT. I mean, you put all three of those together. Revenues beat by 7% or revenues up 7% year-over-year. They beat by 12% on EPS, beat by 2% on revenue. We all knew the stock was undervalued, so it just needed a little bit of a bolt. And the dividend and open eye partnership was enough, it seems, to make a move. Starting next year, PayPal user will be able to shop and check out directly in chatbt using merchants can list and sell their inventory there. PayPal will handle routing, validation, buyer protection, tracking, and dispute resolution for AI powered commerce. That is actually something if Chat GBT really wants to make shopping a thing that can significantly increase PayPal's transaction volumes. Now again, I'm not sure how many people are going to be buying on Chat GBT, but if there's any level of significant amount, that's going to be important. This open AAI thing can it's a narrative that can finally get people like, okay, this is I can see them in a different level.</p>

### SoFi 财报电话会议摘要
在随后的财报电话会议上，CEO 安东尼·诺托再次强调了公司的卓越表现和未来战略。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Thank you and good morning everyone. We had an excellent third quarter. Our one-stop shop strategy is firing on all cylinders as we continue to deliver exceptional financial performance while also investing in our business to drive durable growth and strong returns over the long term. In fact, our focus on product innovation and brand building has never been stronger. There's more happening at SoFi today than at any other time in my eight years with the company. We are stepping on the gas to accelerate the investment in our existing businesses and entering new areas like crypto and blockchain AI SoFi pay providing fiat and crypto banking services and so much more.</p>
</details>

诺托首先回顾了关键的增长数据：第三季度新增创纪录的9.5万名会员，总数达到1260万，同比增长35%；新增140万件产品，总数达1860万，同比增长36%。交叉销售率达到40%，创下2022年以来新高。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Starting with the drivers of our durable growth, we added a record 95,000 new members in Q3, increasing total members by 35% year-over-year. a slight acceleration to 12.6 million SoFi members. We also added a record 1.4 million new products, also representing an acceleration in growth to 36% year-over-year and over 18.6 million products. Crossby reached its highest level since 2022 with 40% of new products opened by existing SoFi members. Our cross by rate has increased in each of the past four quarters, demonstrating the effectiveness of our one-stop shop strategy.</p>
</details>

强劲的会员和产品增长推动了创纪录的调整后净收入，达到9.5亿美元，同比增长38%。其中，金融服务和技术平台部门的收入为5.34亿美元，同比增长57%，首次占总收入的56%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Our strong member and product growth powered our revenue growth in the third quarter. Adjusted net revenue was a record at $950 million, up 38% year-over-year. Together, our financial services and technology platform segments generated revenue of $534 million, which is up 57% year-over-year and now represents 56% of total revenue. This is the first time these segments have generated more than half a billion dollars of quarterly revenue.</p>
</details>

诺托对公司的未来充满信心，他表示：“在2026年及以后，我们将独特地从人工智能和区块链这两大技术超级周期中受益，而几乎所有其他行业都只能从其中一个中受益。凭借近1300万会员、我们无与伦比的技术能力、38.2亿美元的年化收入业务规模以及450亿美元的资产负债表，我们拥有坚如磐石的基础。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Despite these exceptionally strong results, I know that we are just getting started. The addressable markets across each of our products are massive in the United States, let alone in addition to international markets. In 2026 and beyond, we will uniquely start to benefit from both of the technology super cycles in AI and blockchain where almost every other industry only benefits from one. And with nearly 13 million members, the unmatched capabilities of our technology, and the business scale of $3.8 $20 billion in annualized revenue and a $45 billion balance sheet. We have a rock-solid foundation to build on. Given these dynamics, I've never been more optimistic about our prospects than I am today.</p>
</details>

他详细介绍了公司在品牌建设、产品创新方面的投入，包括与 NFL 最有价值球员 Josh Allen 的合作，以及利用区块链技术推出的国际支付产品 SoFi Pay。公司还计划在本季度重新推出加密资产的买卖和持有功能，并计划在2026年推出 SoFi USD 稳定币。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">During the third quarter, we launched an exciting new partnership with the NFL's most valuable player, Josh Allen, to promote the most valuable product and financial services, SoFi Plus. I'm pleased to report that this week we launched our first payment product that leverages blockchain technology to provide fast, seamless, lowcost, and safe international payments with the launch of SoFi Pay. I am also excited to share that this quarter we'll be launching actually relaunching the ability to buy, sell, and hold crypto assets which will give members access to dozens of tokens directly in our SoFi app. The SoFi Pay wallet will over time integrate SoFi USD stablecoin that we hope to launch in 2026.</p>
</details>

在人工智能方面，SoFi 推出了 AI 驱动的“现金教练”（Cash Coach）来帮助会员优化现金利用率，并计划明年推出更全面的“SoFi 教练”（SoFi Coach），为会员提供跨所有金融活动的洞察。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</p>
<p class="english-text">We've also launched the AIdriven Cash Coach to qualifying members. Here's how it works. From the home screen, members see a button saying cash to optimize. By tapping that button, the cash coach will look across both their SoFi and external accounts to see where cash utilization is suboptimal and provide them with personalized financial suggestions. Next year, we will launch a more comprehensive SoFi coach that incorporates insights across all areas of financial activity, not just cash, which will be able to help members understand how to spend less than they make and invest the rest.</p>
</details>

最后，诺托介绍了贷款业务的强劲表现和卓越的信贷质量，并宣布技术平台与北美最大航空公司之一的西南航空公司达成新的合作。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The result is excellent credit performance that continues today. In fact, during the third quarter, we saw our net charge off rates improve even as there has been moderate signs of stress showing up for some other companies. In fact, today we are incredibly excited to announce our newest partnership with one of the largest airlines in North America, Southwest Airlines, to power their rapid rewards debit card.</p>
</details>

### 市场最终反应
尽管 SoFi 公布了强劲的财报和乐观的前景，但其股价在开盘后出现下跌，一度跌破29美元。这再次印证了 SoFi 股票在财报发布后常见的“先涨后跌”模式。相比之下，PayPal 因其与 OpenAI 的合作和派息计划而持续走高，显示出市场对具有强大叙事和催化剂的股票的偏好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">SoFi is dumping 29.40. SoFi, baby. We knew it was going to happen. We all tried faking it. We all tried saying, "Oh, maybe this time is different." It's not different. No, you're right. At least today it wasn't different. Overall, on the quarter, stocks up about 3%. PayPal and UNH are moving a bit more. So, PayPal right here. We'll talk about PayPal. Now, PayPal was up 15. Now, it's up eight. I don't know what they're saying on the call, but it did lose a decent chunk of its gains.</p>
</details>
