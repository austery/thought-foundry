### SoFi 业绩强劲，CEO 详解增长策略

我们来看一些公司的财报，首先是 PayPal。SoFi 的 CEO Noto 现在应该正在 CNBC 上。财报显示，他们在营收和每股收益上都超出了预期，每股收益高出两美分，营收高出约 2000 万美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We got some earnings. So, PayPal. I think Noto's on CNBC right now. I've seen the results. They beat on top and bottom, EPS two cents, revenue like 20 million. But here's Noto and then we'll get into everything else.</p>
</details>

CNBC 主持人向 SoFi 的 CEO Anthony Noto 表示祝贺，并请他解读推动公司业绩增长的因素，以及对 2026 年的展望。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Good morning to you. Congratulations on some nice earnings there. We're looking at the stock this morning. Help us understand what's driving this and then we can try to maybe look out into the future to understand a little bit better what 2026 may portend.</p>
</details>

Noto 表示，这是一个非常出色的季度，增长的动力来自于公司独特的战略。SoFi 是唯一一个在数字平台上可以满足所有金融需求的平台，涵盖了从买房、支付大学学费等重大决策，到 SoFi Money 账户、未来投资或销售点支付卡等日常活动。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Sure. Well, thanks for having me on this morning. We had an exceptional quarter in every way. What's driving our growth is our unique strategy. We're the only place that on the digital platform, you can get all your financial needs served across big decisions that you'll make like buying a home or paying for college, day-to-day activity like a SoFi money account or investing for your future or needing a charge card to pay at the point of sale.</p>
</details>

这种多元化推动了会员和产品的强劲增长。会员同比增长 35%，产品同比增长 36%，最终体现在 38% 的营收增长上。Noto 提到，公司上市 17 个季度以来，每个季度都达到了**“40 法则”**（Rule of 40: 一项衡量 SaaS 公司健康状况的指标，即年收入增长率与利润率之和应大于或等于 40%），平均值约为 58%，本季度更是达到了 67%。这是持久增长、创新和品牌建设相结合的结果。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That diversification has driven really strong member and product growth. Our members grew 35% year-over-year, products grew 36% year-over-year, and that manifests itself in revenue growth of 38%. We've been public for 17 quarters and every quarter of those last 17 we've achieved the rule of 40 or more, we've averaged about 58%, and that's taking your revenue growth and your EBITDA margin. And this quarter was 67. So it's a combination of durable growth innovation and brand building.</p>
</details>

当被问及哪款产品是吸引新客户进入生态系统的“矛尖”时，Noto 指出，SoFi Money 是目前最主要的产品之一。这项独特的服务拥有 600 万会员，它将支票和储蓄账户的优点集于一身，提供约 3.88% 的高**年化收益率**（APY, Annual Percentage Yield），不收取任何费用，并提供奖励积分。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So Anthony, what is the product right now when you look at the multiple different products that you offer in terms of the tip of the spear that's bringing new customers into your ecosystem which then you're effectively upselling them other products? What is it that's happening here?
>> Sure. So money is by far one of the things that are the tip of the spear. We have 6 million members. It's a very unique offering. It's the best of checking and savings in one. We give high interest about a 3.88% APY today. We charge no fees. We provide reward points.</p>
</details>

用户可以通过电子邮件、电话号码、借记卡甚至即时电汇向任何人、任何地方付款。SoFi 致力于提供最安全、快捷、廉价的储蓄和消费平台。此外，成为会员后还可以获得免费的注册理财规划服务，帮助用户实现“支出少于收入，余钱用于投资”的目标。目前，美国有一半的人不进行投资，主要是因为他们没有可自由支配的收入。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You can pay anybody anywhere that you would like. You can pay via an email address, via a phone number, via your debit card, via you can now do instant wires as well. So, we tried to deliver the best place to save, the best place to spend, to do it safely, quickly, and cheaply. In addition to that, you also become a member and you get free certified financial planning because we're trying to help you spend less than you make and invest the rest. Half of the Americans in the United States don't invest today and it's primarily because they have no discretionary income to achieve their goals.</p>
</details>

另一款“矛尖”产品是 Relay。SoFi Money 和 Relay 这两款产品的用户都超过了 600 万。通过这些入门产品，SoFi 实现了约 40% 的交叉销售，本季度创下新高。公司利用用户信息帮助客户更好地借贷、储蓄、消费和投资。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, that is at the tip of the sword. Another product, Relay. Both products are over 6 million products, both Relay and SoFi money. Those are the tip of the sword. And then we drive about 40% cross-sell. It was a record this quarter because we have this breadth of products. We're using information that we have about you to help you borrow better, save better, spend better, and invest better. And so that is helping.</p>
</details>

关于市场份额的来源，Noto 明确表示，他们正在从传统银行手中夺取份额。他指出，美国有超过 5000 家银行，大型银行拥有数万亿美元的存款。SoFi 目前的存款约为 330 亿美元，本季度新增了创纪录的 30 亿美元，这些存款主要来自美国最大的几家银行。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Who are you taking share from? If you were sitting around on a Monday morning with a whiteboard looking at sort of who you actually think of as your competitor set today, who is it?
>> Yeah. It's not what I think, it's what I know. We can actually see where the money is coming from directly every day, and it's really coming from the banks. In the United States, there's over 5,000 banks. The large banks have trillions of dollars of deposits. We're at about $33 billion of deposits today. We added a record of $3 billion of deposits. And those deposits are coming from the big banks, the largest banks in our country.</p>
</details>

在投资领域，SoFi 正在培养新投资者和新手投资者。在学生贷款再融资方面，由于大型金融机构很少提供此类产品，SoFi 几乎没有竞争对手。在抵押贷款方面，大型银行通常不向普通大众客户提供服务。因此，尽管每个产品类别的竞争对手不同，但总体而言，SoFi 的主要竞争对手是大型银行。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's on the SoFi money product, which as I mentioned is the tip of the sword. In invest, we're really actually creating new investors as well as novice investors and helping them get up the learning curve. Within student loan refinancing, we really don't compete against anyone because it's a product that's not really offered by big financial institutions. I would say in mortgage, the big banks do not offer mortgage to everyday Main Street customers. And so in each product category, the competitor is different, but overall, it's the big banks.</p>
</details>

### AI 与区块链：金融科技的两大超级周期

当被问及 PayPal 与 OpenAI 合作，允许用户在 ChatGPT 内部使用 PayPal 支付一事时，Noto 认为这反映了当前同时发生的两大技术超级周期：人工智能（AI）和**区块链**（Blockchain: 一种去中心化的分布式账本技术）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I don't know if you saw the news this morning, but PayPal and OpenAI just announced a partnership where you're going to actually be able to effectively pay for things using PayPal inside of ChatGPT going forward. And to me, this has huge implications for the entire sort of financial community because there's a question both of the opportunity set to effectively partner with some of these large language models and chat bots, but there's also the possibility of remarkable amounts of disruption that could ultimately take place. How are you thinking about that?
>> Sure. There are two technology super cycles happening at the same time. Both of which that impact the fintech sector and SoFi specifically. One is AI and the other is blockchain.</p>
</details>

Noto 强调 SoFi 正在积极布局。本季度，SoFi 推出了 SoFi Pay，用户现在可以通过一个二层区块链网络将美元从美国发送到墨西哥，并自动兑换成当地的比索。公司计划将此服务推广到全球。SoFi Pay 应用未来将支持区块链、**稳定币**（Stablecoin: 一种价值与美元等稳定资产挂钩的加密货币）以及任何其他支付方式，成为一个通用的支付工具。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We launched this quarter SoFi pay and you can now send dollars from the United States through a level two blockchain via SoFi to someone in Mexico and have it convert into the local fiat there in pesos. We'll roll that out throughout the entire world and then we'll take the SoFi pay app which will allow you to pay not just via blockchain and stable coin which SoFi will issue but allow you to pay any other way that you would like to. So it's a universal payment capability. So, we're going to put the SoFi app in these foreign countries to allow international payments to be made.</p>
</details>

对于与其他公司合作发布新闻稿的做法，Noto 表示 SoFi 更注重实际推出产品。他提到，SoFi 推出的更便宜、更快捷、更安全的国际汇款服务获得了用户的积极反响。公司将继续在 AI 和区块链领域进行创新。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What I'd say about these press releases with ChatGPT and others is we're launching products. We're not putting out press releases. There was one yesterday about a stable coin with a big bank. Let's watch what people actually launch and the impact that they're having. The reaction that we got from US consumers and our members from launching international remittance cheaper, faster, and safer than the current mechanisms was really positive. And so you'll continue to see us innovate behind both AI and blockchain.</p>
</details>

此外，Noto 透露，到今年年底，SoFi 将成为美国第一家在其平台上推出加密货币买卖和持有服务的全国性银行。明年第一季度，公司还将推出稳定币，以推动更快、更廉价、更安全的支付。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">One thing that we didn't talk about is that we will be the first national bank in the United States to launch buy, sell, and hold crypto on our platform. First national bank to offer that by the end of the year. We'll launch a stable coin in Q1 which will help us really drive faster, cheaper, and safer payments as well.</p>
</details>

### 市场反应与财报数据分析

Amit: SoFi 的业绩非常亮眼。每股收益超出预期 22%，营收超出 6%。新增了 95 万名会员，金融服务增长了 76%。这确实是一个非常出色的季度。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> All right. These are the results on the top line for those that haven't seen it. You got a 22% EPS beat, 6% revenue beat, 950,000 members, 76% financial services growth. And I mean it's is a pretty damn good quarter.</p>
</details>

Steve: 他们做到了，三项指标都超预期。表面上看，这份财报无可挑剔。虽然我可能会吹毛求疵找些问题，但这些数字确实没法让人不满意。他们新增了 9.5 万新会员，离每季度一百万的目标很近了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Steve, what are your your thoughts as you're seeing this? They crushed it. I mean, Triple Beat, just like I said, they absolutely crushed it. On the surface, there is nothing to be mad at. I'm sure I'll nitpick and find something, but you can't be mad at these numbers. And they grew what? 95,000 new members. They're very close to getting a million a quarter.</p>
</details>

Amit: 是 95 万。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> 950. They're</p>
</details>

Steve: 哦，抱歉，是我读错了。9.5 万。我的错。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Was it 950? Did I read it wrong?
>> Oh, sorry. You're right. 95,000. My bad. My bad. Yeah.</p>
</details>

Amit: 等等，是 9.5 万。我以为是 95 万。这确实改变了一些情况，因为 95 万离一百万更近。不过这仍然是个不错的数字。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Wait 95,000 actually. I thought it was 950. That actually changes stuff because that was closer to a million. This is less closer to a million. It's still a great number. I did think they were closing in on a million though.</p>
</details>

### PayPal 的“魔法词”：OpenAI 与股息

Amit: 伙计，PayPal 说出了那个魔法词。你知道是什么吗，Steve？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Well, okay. So, we'll go deeper into SoFi, but dude, PayPal said the magic word. Do you know what the magic word is, Steve?</p>
</details>

Steve: OpenAI。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Hire. Open AI</p>
</details>

Amit: 没错。PayPal 今天早上为什么上涨？它涨了 15%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> for PayPal. Why is PayPal up this morning, dude? They're up 15%. You didn't see it?</p>
</details>

Steve: 不知道。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> No.</p>
</details>

Amit: PayPal 涨了 15%。原因是，是的，他们的每股收益和营收都很好，但他们的 CEO 就像是说：“没有什么能让这只股票上涨了，干脆提一下 OpenAI，让我们变成一家 AI 公司，股价就会涨。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> PayPal is up 15%. And the reason they're up is because Yeah, it was a good EPS and revenue beat. But Andrew Chris or whatever his name is was like, "Nothing else is going to get this stock to go up. Let's just freaking mention Open AI and become an AI company and you were going to go up."</p>
</details>

Steve: 他们派发股息了吗？我听说他们派发了股息。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Did they give a dividend, guys? I heard that they gave a dividend. I don't want to confirm that unless that is true. PayPal. Look at that. 14.59%.</p>
</details>

Amit: 是的，他们宣布了股息。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah, they've announced a dividend. Okay, cool. I mean,</p>
</details>

Steve: 哦，他们听进去了。你一直在要求这个，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> oh, they're listening. Look at that.
>> You've been asking for this for a while, right?</p>
</details>

Amit: 我一直在要求。他们现在成了所有股息 ETF 的首选对象。公司启动了每股 14 美分的季度股息。这可是件大事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Been asking for it. They just became a prime candidate to be in every single dividend ETF. Company initiates a quarterly dividend of 14 cents a share. I mean, dude, that's it's a big deal. It's a big deal in my opinion.</p>
</details>

Steve: 是的。现在我没什么可抱怨的了。他们回购股票，还派发股息。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. Now, I can't complain about anything. You've been saying they need a dividend for a long time.
>> Yep.
>> They're buying back stock and they're doing divvies.</p>
</details>

Amit: 然后他们还宣布了与 OpenAI 的合作关系，将成为 ChatGPT 内部的集成支付伙伴。把这三件事放在一起，营收同比增长 7%，每股收益超出预期 12%，营收超出 2%。我们都知道这只股票被低估了，所以它只需要一点点推动。股息和 OpenAI 的合作似乎足以让它动起来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And then they announced an OpenAI partnership. They're going to be like an integrated payments partner inside of ChatGPT. I mean, you put all three of those together. Revenues beat by 7% or revenues up 7% year-over-year. They beat by 12% on EPS, beat by 2% on revenue. We all knew the stock was undervalued, so it just needed a little bit of a bolt. And the dividend and OpenAI partnership was enough, it seems, to make a move.</p>
</details>

### SoFi 财报电话会议深度解读

#### 管理层发言：增长、创新与未来展望

Anthony Noto: 谢谢大家，早上好。我们度过了一个出色的第三季度。我们的一站式商店策略全面发力，在持续实现卓越财务表现的同时，我们也在投资业务以推动长期持久的增长和强劲的回报。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Thank you and good morning everyone. We had an excellent third quarter. Our one-stop shop strategy is firing on all cylinders as we continue to deliver exceptional financial performance while also investing in our business to drive durable growth and strong returns over the long term.</p>
</details>

事实上，我们对产品创新和品牌建设的关注从未如此强烈。今天 SoFi 发生的事情比我在这家公司八年来的任何时候都多。我们正在加大油门，加速对现有业务的投资，并进入加密货币、区块链、AI、SoFi Pay 等新领域，提供法币和加密银行服务等等。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In fact, our focus on product innovation and brand building has never been stronger. There's more happening at SoFi today than at any other time in my eight years with the company. We are stepping on the gas to accelerate the investment in our existing businesses and entering new areas like crypto and blockchain AI SoFi pay providing fiat and crypto banking services and so much more.</p>
</details>

首先，让我介绍一下本季度的关键业绩。从我们持久增长的驱动力开始，我们在第三季度新增了创纪录的 9.5 万名新会员，使总会员数同比增长 35%，略有加速，达到 1260 万。我们还新增了创纪录的 140 万个新产品，同样代表了 36% 的同比增长加速，产品总数超过 1860 万。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">First let me cover our key results for the quarter. Starting with the drivers of our durable growth, we added a record 95,000 new members in Q3, increasing total members by 35% year-over-year. a slight acceleration to 12.6 million SoFi members. We also added a record 1.4 million new products, also representing an acceleration in growth to 36% year-over-year and over 18.6 million products.</p>
</details>

交叉销售达到了自 2022 年以来的最高水平，40% 的新产品由现有 SoFi 会员开立。我们的交叉销售率在过去四个季度中每个季度都有所增加，这证明了我们一站式商店策略的有效性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Cross-sell reached its highest level since 2022 with 40% of new products opened by existing SoFi members. Our cross-sell rate has increased in each of the past four quarters, demonstrating the effectiveness of our one-stop shop strategy.</p>
</details>

我们强劲的会员和产品增长推动了第三季度的收入增长。调整后净收入创下 9.5 亿美元的纪录，同比增长 38%。我们的金融服务和技术平台部门共同创造了 5.34 亿美元的收入，同比增长 57%，现在占总收入的 56%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Our strong member and product growth powered our revenue growth in the third quarter. Adjusted net revenue was a record at $950 million, up 38% year-over-year. Together, our financial services and technology platform segments generated revenue of $534 million, which is up 57% year-over-year and now represents 56% of total revenue.</p>
</details>

除了实现持久增长，我们还实现了强劲的回报和盈利能力。第三季度，调整后的 **EBITDA**（未计利息、税项、折旧及摊销前的利润）创下 2.77 亿美元的纪录，同比增长近 50%。本季度我们的调整后 EBITDA 利润率为 29%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In addition to delivering durable growth, we delivered strong returns and profitability. In the third quarter, adjusted EBITDA was a record at $277 million, up nearly 50% year-over-year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 29%.</p>
</details>

我们多元化的业务独特地构建，以实现增长和回报的双赢组合。衡量成功的一种方法是“40 法则”计算，即收入增长加上 EBITDA 利润率。自上市以来，我们每个季度都超过了“40 法则”的基准。那是连续 17 个季度。在这段时间里，我们的平均“40 法则”得分为 58，使我们成为金融科技和更广泛的技术公司中的顶尖表现者。而本季度，我们达到了 67%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Our diversified business is uniquely built to deliver a winning combination of growth and returns. One way to measure the success is the rule of 40 calculation, which is revenue growth plus EBITDA margin. We've beaten the rule of 40 benchmark every quarter since going public. That's 17 straight quarters. Over that time, our average rule of 40 score is 58, making us a top performer among fintechs and technology companies more broadly. And this quarter, we hit 67%.</p>
</details>

在 2026 年及以后，我们将独特地开始从 AI 和区块链这两个技术超级周期中受益，而几乎所有其他行业只从一个中受益。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In 2026 and beyond, we will uniquely start to benefit from both of the technology super cycles in AI and blockchain where almost every other industry only benefits from one.</p>
</details>

上个季度，我谈到了我们正处在一个前所未有的时刻，加密货币、区块链和 AI 这两个技术超级周期正在同时发生。这些超级周期有能力彻底重塑金融服务的未来，我们已经迅速行动以利用这些机会。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Last quarter, I spoke about how we are an unprecedented point in time with two technology super cycles taking place in crypto, blockchain, and AI. These super cycles have the power to completely reinvent the future of financial services, and we have moved fast to take advantage of these opportunities.</p>
</details>

我很高兴地报告，本周我们推出了首个利用区块链技术提供快速、无缝、低成本和安全的国际支付产品——SoFi Pay。SoFi Pay 使会员能够通过利用一个二层区块链网络，无缝地将本地法币汇往国外，并将本地法币存入收款人的账户。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm pleased to report that this week we launched our first payment product that leverages blockchain technology to provide fast, seamless, lowcost, and safe international payments with the launch of SoFi Pay. SoFi Pay gives members the ability to seamlessly send money in local fiat abroad by leveraging a layer 2 blockchain network and delivering local fiat into the account of the recipient.</p>
</details>

我也很高兴地宣布，本季度我们将重新推出购买、出售和持有加密资产的功能，这将使会员能够直接在我们的 SoFi 应用中访问数十种代币。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I am also excited to share that this quarter we'll be launching actually relaunching the ability to buy, sell, and hold crypto assets which will give members access to dozens of tokens directly in our SoFi app.</p>
</details>

但这仅仅是我们雄心勃勃的加密和区块链产品路线图的开始，该路线图将在 2026 年继续变为现实。我对产品路线图、我们计划中的稳定币 SoFi USD 的众多用例，以及我们凭借独特的银行牌照、技术能力、产品组合和技术平台服务，以其他公司无法比拟的方式差异化稳定币的能力感到无比兴奋。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But this is just the beginning of our ambitious crypto and blockchain product roadmap that will continue to come to life in 2026. I could not be more excited about the product roadmap and the multitude of use cases we have for our planned stable coin SoFi USD and our ability to differentiate a stable coin like no other company given our unique bank license technology capabilities portfolio products and technology technology platform services.</p>
</details>

现在转向另一个超级周期——AI。我们继续在我们的业务中测试和实施多项 AI 应用。在幕后，AI 技术一直是简化我们运营以更好地服务会员的关键。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Turning now to the other super cycle AI. We continue to test and implement a number of AI applications across our business. Behind the scenes, AI technology has been key to streamlining our operations to better serve our members.</p>
</details>

我们还为符合条件的会员推出了 AI 驱动的现金教练（Cash Coach）。明年，我们将推出一个更全面的 SoFi 教练，它将整合所有金融活动领域的见解，而不仅仅是现金，能够帮助会员了解如何做到“支出少于收入，余钱用于投资”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We've also launched the AIdriven Cash Coach to qualifying members. Next year, we will launch a more comprehensive SoFi coach that incorporates insights across all areas of financial activity, not just cash, which will be able to help members understand how to spend less than they make and invest the rest.</p>

#### 问答环节：聚焦信贷质量与利率环境

分析师: 投资者在过去一个月左右一直在问的问题是关于消费者信贷。你们做得非常好，坏账率在下降，但你能否概述一下不同 FICO 分数段的消费者信贷健康状况？

<details>

Anthony Noto: 当然。首先要传达的信息是，我们的信贷表现非常好。我们的会员在每个产品上的表现都非常强劲。我们不断地根据市场渠道、定价与信贷批准之间的权衡以及贷款的单位经济效益进行调整。消费者贷款表现的强劲程度不言而喻，数据就在那里。你可以看到我们的净冲销率下降了，也就是改善了。

<p class="english-text">>> sure thank you Dan um the First message is our credit is performing very well. We have very strong uh performance by our members across each of the products. We're constantly making changes to what marketing channels we're in, the trade-off between pricing and credit approvals, um, the unit economics of a loan. The strength of the consumer loans performance speaks for itself. It's in the numbers. You can see our net charge offs declined, i.e. improved uh versus last quarter.</p>

分析师: 我的问题主要围绕利率环境，特别是利率下降。我想知道你们能否谈谈较低的利率环境将如何影响贷款方面的业务量组合，特别是在什么时点你们认为学生贷款再融资活动可能会出现大幅增长？

<p class="english-text">>> my question is predominantly around the rate environment, you know, decreasing rates if you think about the forward curve. I'm wondering if you guys could talk about how the the lower rate environment will affect the volume mix uh on the lending side and particularly you know at what point do you think there could be a pretty big spike in student loan refinance activity.</p>
</details>

Anthony Noto: 随着利率下降，我认为我们的业务只会变得更好。如果失业率保持在 5% 到 5.5% 以下，通货膨胀率为 3%，我认为我们处于一个非常好的环境中。随着利率下降，我们的学生贷款业务将显著受益。利率在过去三年里一直很高，联邦学生贷款利率也很高，我们可以为他们 7 万美元的贷款余额提供可观的节省。因此，我们肯定会从学生贷款再融资利率的降低中受益。

<p class="english-text">>> As rates come down, I think our business only gets better. If we stay with unemployment below five to 5 and a half% um and inflation's at 3%, I think we're in a really great environment. As rates go down our student loan business will benefit meaningfully. Rates have been very high for the last three years. Federal student rates are high and we can give them a significant savings on a $70,000 balance. So we'll benefit from lower rates in student loan refinancing.</p>

<p class="english-text">Jensen: We have labor shortages all over the world. If we had more workers, companies would make more money. If we were more productive, companies would make more money. When we make more money, we invest more money so that we hire more people. And so, it's very likely that the companies that use AI first, that use robotics technology first, will be the most successful first and then we'll end up hiring more people.</p>

你不会因为机器人而失业，你会因为使用机器人的人而失业。你不会因为 AI 而失业，你会因为使用 AI 的人而失业。看看今天的英伟达，我们 100% 的软件工程师都在使用 Cursor。我们的招聘速度比以往任何时候都快，因为我们创造的芯片比以往任何时候都多，开发的软件比以往任何时候都多，我们的生产力也比以往任何时候都高。

<p class="english-text">You're going to lose your jobs not to a robot. You're going to lose your jobs to somebody who uses a robot. You're gonna lose your jobs to somebody who uses AI. And so, if you look at NVIDIA today, we 100% of our software engineers use Cursor 100%. And we're hiring faster than ever because we're creating more chips than ever. We're developing more software than ever. We're more productive than ever. And it looks like the company's growing faster than ever.</p>
