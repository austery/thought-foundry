### 欢迎与诺贝尔奖得主对话

主持人: 欢迎。今天我非常高兴能与本周的诺贝尔奖得主，2025年诺贝尔物理学奖获得者约翰·马蒂尼斯进行这次“All-In”访谈。约翰，欢迎来到“All-In”访谈。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Welcome. Today I'm very excited for this all-in interview with this week's Nobel laureate, winner of the Nobel Prize in physics in 2025, John Martinez. John, welcome to the all-in interview.</p>
</details>

马蒂尼斯: 谢谢你们邀请我。我非常期待这次对话，也很乐意向大家解释这个奖项的意义。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, thanks for inviting me. I'm quite excited about this uh this talk and uh you know, love to explain to people about you know, what this prize is all about.</p>
</details>

主持人: 好的，各位听众。我想那又是一次史诗般的讨论。人们喜欢这些访谈。我能听他讲好几个小时。他确实在一分钟内就回答了你的问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, besties. I think that was another epic discussion. People love the interviews. I could hear him talk for hours. Absolutely. Oh, he crushed your questions in a minute.</p>
</details>

主持人: 我们正在向人们提供真实数据，以支持你自己的观点。你们觉得怎么样？那很有趣，很棒。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We are giving people ground truth data to underwrite your own opinion. What did you guys think? That was fun. That was great.</p>
</details>

### 诺贝尔奖与早期物理学兴趣

主持人: 诺贝尔奖是最负盛名的荣誉，尤其是在物理学领域，我认为这是可以授予的最高荣誉。你将载入史册。即将到来的颁奖典礼对你来说将是一次不可思议的经历。也许我们可以回顾一下你的历史，从头说起。我很想听听你是在哪里长大的，以及你是如何开始对物理学产生兴趣的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, the Nobel Prize is the most prestigious honor and particularly in physics that I think can be awarded. You're in the record books. It's going to be an incredible ceremony coming up for you. Maybe we could go back to the beginning in your history. I'd love to hear a little bit about, you know, where did you grow up and how did you get started with your interest in physics?</p>
</details>

马蒂尼斯: 我在加利福尼亚州的圣佩德罗长大，在那里度过了我的整个童年。我父亲是消防员，母亲则在家照顾我们。多年来，我一直对科学技术很感兴趣。我想说，其中一件事是，我的父亲虽然没有高中学历，但他非常聪明。他总是在车库里捣鼓各种项目。所以我从小就知道如何建造东西，这也能让你了解事物是如何运作的，这是一种经验主义的、实用的物理学观。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, well, so I uh I grew up in San Pedro, California, and uh, you know, grew up there my whole time. My my father was a fireman and my mom stayed at home, took care of us, and um, you know, through the years I was always interested in science, technology. I'm going to say one of the things is, you know, my my dad, you know, actually didn't have a high school education, but very smart person. He was always building things in the garage, various projects. So, I grew up kind of knowing how to build things, which also kind of tells you how things work, you know, kind of empirical view, you know, tactical view of how physics works.</p>
</details>

马蒂尼斯: 所以当我在高中学习物理时，我非常喜欢它，因为它背后有数学和概念，对我来说真的很有意义。我真的爱上了这门学科，然后去了加州大学伯克利分校，在那里学得很好，也很享受。我非常喜欢它。然后在我大四的时候，我上了一堂约翰·克拉克（John Clark）的课，他后来成了我的导师。我发现他当时正在研究量子力学和电子设备方面的东西，这对我来说听起来非常有趣。我想我可能预见到了某些事情可能会有所突破。所以我开始和他一起攻读研究生。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So uh when I took physics in high school, I actually loved it because there was actually some math behind it and concepts and you know really made sense to me and uh you know I I just really you know fell in love with the subject and then went to UC Berkeley and and did pretty well there and enjoyed it. Uh enjoyed it a lot. And then in my senior year at UC Berkeley I had a class from John Clark who was my adviser and found out what he was doing. and he was just starting to look at these quantum mechanics and electrical devices stuff and it sounded really interesting for me. I guess I have, you know, I guess I could see maybe when something maybe would would take off. So I started to to uh to to do the graduate school work with him.</p>
</details>

主持人: 你在伯克利读研究生了？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You went to Berkeley for graduate school.</p>
</details>

马蒂尼斯: 我在伯克利读研究生了，这通常是不建议的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I went to Gertie for graduate school, which you're not supposed to do.</p>
</details>

主持人: 我最初在加州大学伯克利分校（Cal）本科学习物理和数学。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I was originally a physics and math undergrad at Cal.</p>
</details>

主持人: 好的。我后来改了专业，实际上获得了天体物理学学位。有一些高年级数学课让我对数学专业完全失去了兴趣。有太多的证明，让我抓狂。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay. I changed my major later and actually got my degree in astrophysics. There was some upper division math class that really turned me off to math as a major. There was just so many proofs. It drove me nuts.</p>
</details>

马蒂尼斯: 对。对。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right. Right.</p>
</details>

主持人: 物理学总是令人兴奋的，但我喜欢在天体实验室工作，我实际上在劳伦斯伯克利实验室（Lawrence Berkeley Lab）工作过。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then physics was always exciting, but I liked uh working in the astro lab and I worked actually at Lawrence Berkeley Lab.</p>
</details>

马蒂尼斯: 哦，好的。是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh, okay. Yeah.</p>
</details>

主持人: 但你后来留在伯克利读研究生了，对吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But then you you stayed at Berkeley and went to grad school, right?</p>
</details>

### 宏观量子力学现象的探索

马蒂尼斯: 是的，我留在伯克利读研究生。在研究生院的几年后，我们启动了这个项目，我忘了确切的日期。有趣的是，这个问题实际上是由安东尼·莱格特（Anthony Leggett）教授提出的，他因氦-3（Helium-3）物理学获得了诺贝尔奖，我想是在2003年。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, I stayed at Berkeley, went to grad school. We started this project a couple years into grad school. I forget exact date. And what was interesting is this was a question that was actually posed by professor Anthony Leget who won the Nobel Prize for you know helium 3 you know physics uh in I think 20 2003</p>
</details>

主持人: 那是超流体吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">was that super fluid</p>
</details>

马蒂尼斯: 超流体氦-3。是的，没错。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</p>
<p class="english-text">super fluid helium 3. Yeah that's right.</p>
</details>

主持人: 所以他展示了，如果你把氦-3冷却到足够低的温度，它就会呈现出一种新的物理特性，关于它的运动方式和工作原理。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So he showed like if you put helium 3 cold enough it kind of almost has this new sort of characteristic with the physics and how it moves and how it works.</p>
</details>

马蒂尼斯: 它确实具有这种超流体行为，但由于氦-3更复杂的原子核，它表现出非常复杂的行为。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, it has a this super fluid behavior, but it has a very complicated behavior because of the more complicated nuclei of the helium 3. And</p>
</details>

马蒂尼斯: 这已经被发现了，人们花了一段时间才弄明白。他帮助发展了相关的理论。所以他非常有名，一个非常非常聪明的人。尽管他因此获得了诺贝尔奖，但氦-3物理学并没有太多后续发展。然而，他提出的导致我们实验的问题，却开辟了一个巨大的领域。这个问题是：**宏观物体**（Macroscopic Objects: 肉眼可见的、由大量原子组成的物体）是否表现出**量子力学**（Quantum Mechanics: 描述原子和亚原子粒子行为的物理学理论）特性？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">this had been discovered and people worked for a while to figure that out. And he, you know, helped develop the theory for that. So, he was quite wellknown, very, very smart person. And although he won the Nobel Prize for that, okay, there's not much helium 3 physics going on, but for the question that led to our experiment, okay, there's a huge field. And the question was, do macroscopic objects behave quantum mechanically?</p>
</details>

马蒂尼斯: 好的，一个宏观物体可能是一个小球。在我们的案例中，它是一个包含数十亿电子和数十亿原子的电路。那么，比如说，这个球的集体运动是否具有量子力学特性？现在，如果你想到把球扔向墙壁，它会弹回来。但是如果你把墙壁做得足够薄，球做得足够轻，那么它偶尔会因为量子力学定律而**隧穿**（Tunnel Through: 粒子穿过势垒的量子现象）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, and this is a macroscopic object might be a small ball. In our case, it's an electrical circuit with billions of electrons in it, billions of atom and is the collective motion of say the ball uh quantum mechanical. Now, you know, if you think about throwing throwing a ball against the wall, it's going to bounce off. But if you make the wall thin enough and the ball light enough, it'll then every once in a while tunnel through because of the, you know, laws of quantum mechanics. So, um</p>
</details>

主持人: 等一下，我们暂停一下。我认为这真的值得花点时间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">hold on, let's just pause on that for a second. And I think that's really worth spending a moment on.</p>
</details>

马蒂尼斯: 是的。太好了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Great.</p>
</details>

### 量子力学的核心概念：概率与波函数

主持人: 所以当我们谈论量子力学时，当我们谈论原子尺度上，像原子或比原子更小的粒子，它的相对位置、能量或运动时，我们必须使用概率来描述事物的存在位置。这就是20世纪初量子力学最重要的理解，对吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So when we talk about quantum mechanics, when we talk about the relative position or energy or movement of a particle at the atomic scale as small as an atom or smaller than an atom, we have to use kind of probabilities to describe where things are going to be. That was what was really kind of the big understanding of quantum mechanics in the early 20th century, right? is that there's</p>
</details>

主持人: 事物存在和运动的概率。它不像我们扔球那样是确定性的。当你处理非常非常小的东西时，事情会变得非常模糊，很难确定。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">the probability of things being where they are and moving as they're moving there. It's not like like deterministic like we can see with the ball that we throw around. When you get very very small things get very fuzzy and it's very hard.</p>
</details>

马蒂尼斯: 所以你偶然间触及了一个关键思想，但这非常重要。量子力学是为小事物理论而发展的。你知道，电子、原子，这些构成物质的基本组成部分，但它们非常小。如果你拿一个原子，它由电子和原子核组成。你知道，经典物理学认为它们会相互吸引，然后结合在一起，原子基本上就没有大小了。为什么原子有大小？好的，你知道，那是奇怪的事情之一，那是因为这个原子不是一个点粒子。我以前常对我的孩子们说电子是模糊的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So you hit upon upon the key idea here maybe by accident but it's very important. Quantum mechanics was developed for the theory of small things. You know, electrons, atoms, you know, things things that are that are the the fundamental constituents of it, but very small. And um you know, if you take an atom, it's made from electron and a nucleus. You know, classically, they attract each other and they would just, you know, combine together and then atoms basically would have no size. Why do atoms have size? Okay, that you know that that was one of the the strange things and it's because this atom is kind of not a a point particle. I used to say to my kids that the electrons were fuzzy. Okay.</p>
</details>

马蒂尼斯: 在量子力学中，它具有某种**波函数**（Wave Function: 描述粒子量子态的数学函数），是扩展的。你可以想象电子同时存在于原子核周围的各个位置。所以，这是一种非常奇怪的行为，但它是关于小事物的，当然，对于原子如何工作以及我们如何描述自然来说，这非常重要。所以量子力学最终成为一个领域，人们说它在理解小粒子在哪里、它们有多少能量、它们向哪里移动方面非常反直觉。基本上，我们最终发现我们必须使用这些函数。它不仅仅是一个单一的点，而是一个分布。它是一大堆位置，原子或电子可能在哪里存在一个概率。它也是关于它可能移动多快的概率。所有这些都变成了概率函数。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And and quantum mechanically it has some wave function and extended. You can think of the electrons being all around the nucleus at the same time. So um it it's just a very strange behavior u but of small things uh and of course very important as how atoms work and how we describe nature. So quantum mechanics ultimately became a field that people say is very non-intuitive in terms of understanding where small small particles are, the energy they have, where they're moving to and and basically we resolved to figuring out that we had to use these functions. It's not just a single point, but it's a distribution. It's a whole bunch of places and there's a probability of where the atom could be or where the electron could be. It's also a probability of how fast it might be moving. All of these things become probability functions.</p>
</details>

主持人: 然后你为此发展了一个数学理论，你知道，这需要你读到大学三年级才能真正掌握足够的数学来理解。但基本上，那是对的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And you develop a mathematical theory for doing this that you know takes you until your third year in university to really know enough math to understand that. But basically that's right</p>
</details>

马蒂尼斯: 这些形成了电子的波。所以你有一个波和原子核周围的电子，描述了电子是什么。这些有点像驻波，就像拨动琴弦一样。你知道，不同长度的琴弦，不同张力的琴弦会发出不同的音符，这些电子围绕原子核的振动可以在不同的频率下振动。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">these are forming waves waves of the electron. So you have kind of a wave and electron around the nucleus describing what the uh the electrons are. And these are kind of like standing waves, you know, it's like hitting a string. Uh, you know, if if different length strings, different tension strings form different notes, these vibrations of the electrons around the atom can vibrate at different frequencies.</p>
</details>

主持人: 所以与其把电子想象成在原子周围沿着预定路径移动，并且我可以在任何时间点知道它在哪里，不如把电子围绕原子想象成一个波。它是一个……它是一个描述它在哪里以及它在做什么的波。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So rather than think about an electron moving around an atom in a predescribed path and I can know where it is at any point in time, the right way to think about an electron around an atom is it's in a wave. It's a and it's it's a long there's a wave that describes kind of where it is and it's doing</p>
</details>

马蒂尼斯: 你有电子，你有吸引它的质子。所以整个波理论结合了这两者，你知道，它为你提供了原子如何工作的描述，而且是非常准确的描述。所以，另一个由此产生的特征是，微观尺度上的一切都由波函数描述，这意味着发生某种极端或非凡事件的概率很小。例如，斯蒂芬·霍金（Stephen Hawking）发现，粒子和反粒子可以凭空出现在太空中央，反粒子进入黑洞，粒子则射出。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and you have the electron and you have the proton attracting it. So the whole wave theory combines all those two and you know gives you a description of how the the atom works and quite accurate description too. And so one of the other kind of features that arises from the fact that everything at a micro scale is described by wave functions is that there's a small probability of something kind of extreme or extraordinary happening. Like the one example is Stephen Hawking figured out that you could have a particle and antiparticle come out of nowhere in the middle of space and the antiarticle goes into the black hole. The particle shoots off.</p>
</details>

主持人: 是的。而且这种事情发生的概率非常低，但它发生的次数足以让反粒子开始删除黑洞的一部分。这就是黑洞蒸发的方式，而这个理论……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. And that the probability of that happening is so low, but it happens enough that the antiparticle actually starts to delete part of a black hole. And that's how black holes evaporate and this</p>
</details>

主持人: 理论产生了所有这些有趣的事情。但你能告诉我们什么是**量子隧穿**（Quantum Tunneling: 量子粒子穿过经典上无法逾越的势垒的现象）吗？这是量子力学的另一个特征，它源于这些事物是波和概率函数的事实。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">theory all these interesting things. But can you tell us how what quantum tunneling is? So this is another one of these sort of features of quantum mechanics that arises from the fact that these things are kind of waves and probability functions.</p>
</details>

马蒂尼斯: 是的。所以，如果你有一个电子在空间中运动，撞击一面墙，假设它有一个小的波包或波函数。所以它不是一个单一的粒子。它有一定的范围。当这个粒子撞击墙壁时，量子力学表明，有少量这种波函数，或者说粒子，会穿过墙壁到达另一边。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. So if if you have um if you have an electron just traveling through space hitting hitting a wall let's say there's a little wave wave packet wave function to it. So it's not a single particle. It has some extent to it. And what happens is that when that particle hits the wall, quantum mechanics say there is some amount small amount of this wave function or if you like the particle going through the wall and then to the other side.</p>
</details>

主持人: 大多数时候它会弹开，但偶尔它会穿过去。你知道，这在日常设备中可以看到。如果你制造非常小的存储电路，你就必须担心电子隧穿和电荷从电容器中泄漏。它们有依赖于这些隧穿结的磁性存储器。所以这是一个非常著名的现象，如果你把这个屏障，这个绝缘体，做得只有10到20个原子厚，那么它就足够薄，可以穿透。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now most of the time it uh it bounces off but every once in a while it goes through. And you know this is seen in um uh everyday devices. This is not and as if you build very small um memory circuit you have to worry about electrons tunneling and charge leaking off your capacitor. Uh they have magnetic memories that depend on these tunnel junctions. So this is a very well-known phenomenon and if you make the this barrier this insulator just you know 10 20 atoms thick then that's thin enough for it to go through</p>
</details>

主持人: 穿过去。所以这正是如此有趣的地方。你可以实际预测有多少电子可能会穿过这些屏障，这些被称为绝缘屏障的东西，到达另一边，这真是令人难以置信。这就像穿墙而过，对吗？我的意思是，

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">to go through. So this is what's so interesting. Um you can actually predict the number of electrons that might tunnel through one of these barriers one of these insulating barriers as they're called over to the other side which really is crazy to think about. It's just like walking through walls, right? I mean,</p>
</details>

马蒂尼斯: 是的，就是这个想法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yeah, that's that's the idea.</p>
</details>

主持人: 是的。所以，回到你分享的故事，你当时还在读研究生，对吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. So, going back to the story you were sharing, you're in grad school, right?</p>
</details>

### 莱格特的问题与宏观量子行为

马蒂尼斯: 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">right?</p>
</details>

主持人: 然后莱格特提出了这个想法。也许你现在可以多分享一些，因为我们已经掌握了一些基本知识，当时讨论的是什么，也就是——

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then Leot proposes this idea. Maybe you can share a little bit more now that we've got I think a bit of the basics on what was discussed, which was</p>
</details>

主持人: 稍微放大一点来看，与其只考虑所有这些都发生在微观尺度上，它是否可能发生在更大的尺度上？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">zooming out a bit like rather than just think about all of this happening at a microscopic scale, is it possible for it to happen at a bigger scale?</p>
</details>

马蒂尼斯: 是的。我们一直在谈论量子力学是微观原子尺度上的物理学本质，但问题是，如果你制造一个宏观物体，它是否也会遵循量子力学定律？好的，这就是基本问题。事实证明，有一个非常自然的系统可以研究，那就是研究一个电气系统，观察电气系统中的量子力学，其中电流和电压，本质上是电振荡器的电流和电压，它表现得像经典物理学，还是具有这种量子力学性质？这就是问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. And again we've been talking about quantum mechanics is the physics nature at this microscopic atomic scale but the question was if you made a macroscopic object would it obey quantum mechanics also okay and then you know that was the basic question and it turns out that there's a very natural system to look at looking at an electrical system and look seeing for quantum mechanics an electrical system where the currents and voltages of essentially electrical oscillator does it behave like a classical physics or does it behave with this quantum mechanical nature to it? And that was the question.</p>
</details>

马蒂尼斯: 现在事实证明，当你思考量子力学时，你会想到量子行为，但到某个时候你必须测量它，这就会把它变成一个概率。有一个叫做**薛定谔的猫悖论**（Schrödinger's Cat Paradox: 一个思想实验，说明量子叠加态在宏观世界中的非直观性），在这个悖论中，你有一个放射性衰变，然后你让它发生，比如说放射性衰变时间的一半，然后你说，你有一个放射性衰变探测器，然后一瓶氰化物，它会杀死一只猫。然后你问，经过一段时间后，这只猫是处于死态还是活态？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now it turns out that when you think about quantum mechanics and thinking about well there's the quantum behavior but then at some point you have to measure it which then turns it into a probability. There's something called the Schroinger pat cat paradox where um in the paradox you have your radioactive decay and then you you you let it happen for let's say half of the radioactive decay time and then you say and then the in you have a ready detected decay a detector and then a bottle of cyanide which will kill a cat and then do you say you know after some amount of time is the cat in the dead in the live state. Okay.</p>
</details>

马蒂尼斯: 物理学家们，你知道，这是一个很好的问题。爱因斯坦提出了它，或者薛定谔提出了它。很多人都讨论过。但莱格特指出，这个悖论之所以成为悖论，是因为你可以相信像猫这样的宏观物体可以处于**量子叠加态**（Quantum Superposition State: 量子系统可以同时存在于多个可能状态的现象）。事实上，没有实验证据表明这可能发生。这就是他的观点。所以他说，人们应该测试这个，看看它是否是真的。作为一个刚学习量子力学的年轻研究生，我就想，哦，这是一个非常棒的问题，这是我们应该尝试做的事情，我们应该尝试在一个建议的系统上进行实验，以寻找量子力学现象。最初的提议是寻找隧穿现象。后来发现不仅仅是这样，但它确实是寻找隧穿现象。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And you know, physicists, you know, and this is this good question. Einstein brought brought it up or Shoner brought it up. A lot of people uh discussed it. Uh but Alleged pointed out that the reason this is a paradox is you can believe that a macroscopic object like a cat could be in a quantum superposition state. And in fact, there was no experime experimental evidence that this could happen. And that was his point. So um so he said well you know people should be testing this and let's see if it's true and uh as a as a young graduate student who just you know learned about quantum mechanics and it's like oh that's a really great great question that's something that we should try to do and we should try to do an experiment you know on on the suggested system uh to look for quantum mechanics. And the the original proposal was looking for the tunneling. Well, it turned out to be more than that, but uh the it look for tunneling.</p>
</details>

主持人: 让我用另一种方式来描述，你知道，宏观系统可以是我的整个身体。我能穿墙而过吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Let me just kind of describe another way is you know the macroscopic system could be my entire body. Could I walk through a wall?</p>
</details>

马蒂尼斯: 没错。然后我所有原子都处于完美时刻、完美位置的概率，你知道，能够穿过墙壁的概率是如此之低，以至于在这个或许多其他宇宙中都不会发生。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's right. And then the probability of all of my atoms being in the perfect moment, perfect position, you know, to to be able to kind of cross through the wall is so low, it would never happen in this or many other universes of</p>
</details>

马蒂尼斯: 这就是问题所在，大多数宏观物体，当你试图思考它们的量子力学时，那不会发生。好的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and and that's the problem is that most macroscopic objects when you try to think about the quantum mechanics that won't happen. Okay. So,</p>
</details>

主持人: 对。一个电子穿过屏障的概率很小，

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">right. There's a small probability one electron can cross over a barrier,</p>
</details>

马蒂尼斯: 但许多电子同时穿过的概率会越来越低，这使得在宏观尺度上很难观察到。而发生的情况是，如果你观察一个电路，那么参数变得有利于观察这种宏观行为。好的，很难深入探讨所有这些物理学，但基本上是因为你可以制造一个在微波频率下运行的电路。所以，你不是每秒尝试穿墙一次，而是每秒尝试穿墙五十亿次。好的。所以这样机会就多了很多。另外，量子力学中涉及的各种参数也都有利于观察这种现象。你必须正确地进行实验，但它确实有利于这样做。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but the probability that many cross over at once is lower and lower and lower and that makes it very difficult to see at scale. And what what happens is if you look at an electrical circuit then the parameters become favorable for seeing this kind of macroscopic behavior. And okay, it's hard to go into the the whole physics of all that, but it's basically because you can make a circuit that operates at microwave frequencies. So instead of you trying to go through the wall once a second, it tries to go through the wall five billion times a second. Okay. So then it's it's a lot, you know, more you know, you have more chances to go through. And uh uh the other thing is the just the various parameters that involved in quantum mechanics you know are favorable for seeing this kind of phenomena. You have to do the experiment right but uh it's favorable for doing that.</p>

### 超导体与约瑟夫森结

主持人: 所以你的实验的一部分是你创造了一个叫做**约瑟夫森结**（Josephson Junction: 由两个超导体之间夹着一层薄绝缘层构成的量子电子器件）。是这样吗？所以这是两个超导体之间有一个屏障。对。我大概12岁的时候就对超导体非常着迷。我去买了一个超导圆盘，钇钡铜氧化物。是的，没错。

<details>

<p class="english-text">So one of the parts of your experiment you created what's called a Josephson junction. Is that is that correct? So this is two superconductors with a barrier between them. Right. I got really fascinated by superconductors when I was maybe 12 years old. I I went and bought a superc conducting disc etum barium copper oxide. Yes, that's right.</p>
</details>

主持人: 从《大众科学》（Popular Science）杂志的背面买的，然后我去了加州大学洛杉矶分校（UCLA），弄到了一大罐液氮。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">From the back of Popular Science and then I went to UCLA and I got a a jug of liquid nitrogen</p>
</details>

主持人: 然后我把一块磁铁浮在圆盘上方。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and then I floated a magnet above the disc</p>
</details>

主持人: 因为**迈斯纳效应**（Meissner Effect: 超导体将磁场从其内部排出的现象），我在科学展览上展示了它，那一年我在科学展览上表现得非常好，因为我展示了这个非常……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">because of the Meisner effect and I had it at the science fair and I and I did very well with the science fair that year because I showed this really</p>
</details>

马蒂尼斯: 那是哪一年？是它被发现的时候吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What year was that? Was that when it was discovered?</p>
</details>

主持人: 应该是1991年。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Must have been 919.</p>
</details>

马蒂尼斯: 好的。是的，那足够接近了，很好。是的，最难的部分是弄到液氮。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay. Yeah, that was close enough that that was good. Yeah, the hard part is getting the liquid nitrogen. But</p>
</details>

主持人: 是的，我有一个朋友的爸爸是加州大学洛杉矶分校的医生之类的，所以他能够为我们的演示弄到液氮。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yeah, and I had a friend whose dad was like a doctor at UCLA or something like that, so he was able to get the liquid nitrogen for our demonstration.</p>
</details>

马蒂尼斯: 对。是的，那是最难的部分。好的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right. Yeah, that that was the hard part. Okay.</p>
</details>

主持人: 我一直对**超导体**（Superconductor: 在特定低温下电阻为零的材料）的物理学很着迷，也许你可以解释一下超导体的一个重要特性，因为它与电阻和电流流动有关，然后我们可以谈谈你的实验。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I've always been fascinated by the physics of superconductors and maybe you can just explain one of these important features of the of superconductors as it relates to kind of resistance and current flow and then we can talk about your experiment.</p>
</details>

马蒂尼斯: 所以，当一种材料变成超导时，所有的电子都会凝聚成一个状态。好的。现在，为了给你一个类比，它不是一个完美的类比，但很接近。如果你有一个普通金属，任何我们在室温下的金属，它就像一个电子气体。就像空气中的气体一样。然后当你冷却到超导温度以下时。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, so what happens is um when a a material goes superconducting all the electrons condense into one state. Okay. Now to just to give you analogy of how it's not perfect analogy it's close analogy. If you have a normal metal any metal we have at room temperature it's like a gas of electrons. It's like you know gas in the air. And then when you get below the superconducting temperature.</p>
</details>

主持人: 抱歉，我想我们应该解释一下。所以，你有一个金属，所有的电子都在四处移动。它们受到扰动。它们都处于不同的能量，不同的状态。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Sorry, I think we should just explain that. So, so you have a metal all the electrons are kind of moving around. They're they're perturbed. They're all different energies, different states.</p>
</details>

马蒂尼斯: 没错。不同的能量，不同的状态。你知道，有一些费米统计。我们不深入讨论，但它或多或少看起来像气体。你想象一下气体，然后当你把它冷却到某个温度以下时，它就会聚结成，比如说，像原子一样的固体，电子会聚结成**库珀对**（Cooper Pair: 在超导体中，两个电子通过晶格振动相互吸引而形成的束缚态），BCS凝聚态就是这个名字，所有的电子都像被锁定在一起，做着同样的事情。现在，它的好处是它们不像被冻结在原地，但它们有一个自由参数，允许所有电流，所有电子向某个方向流动，这就是超电流。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's right. Different energies, different states. You know, there's some firm statistics. Not go into that, but it's more or less looks like a gas. You think of a of a gas and then when you cool it below you know a certain temperature it it then coaleses into let's say a solid like like atoms will and the electrons coales into the something cooper cooper pair bcs condenset is the name where all the electrons are kind of locked together and doing the same thing. Now the nice thing about that it's not like they're frozen in place but they have a free parameter that allows them all the currents all the electrons to flow in some direction which is the supercurren</p>
</details>

主持人: 在**超导体**（Superconductor: 在特定低温下电阻为零的材料）中，这意味着一种材料被冷却到足以达到其超导临界温度。对吗？所以突然之间，所有的电子仍然可以移动。它们仍然可以产生电流，但是……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">in a superconductor meaning a material that's cool enough that it reaches its superconducting critical temperature. Right? So suddenly all the electrons can still move. They can still create a current, but</p>
</details>

马蒂尼斯: 但它们像固体中的电子一样一起移动，而不是像气体中的电子。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but they're they're moving together like they're in like in my analogy like they're in a solid instead of the gas.</p>
</details>

主持人: 而且因为它们一起移动，

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And because they're moving together,</p>
</details>

马蒂尼斯: 好的，当你研究所有物理学时，它们不会随机散射。它们只是作为一个整体移动。然后你就会得到一个超电流，例如，如果你制造一个超导环，那个电流基本上会永远在环中流动。这就是你用浮动磁铁看到的情况。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">okay, then then when you work through all the physics, they are not um you know, they aren't randomly scattering off things. They're just moving together. And then you get a supercurren where for example if you made a ring a superconductor superconductor that current would basically flow for forever around the ring. This is what you saw with the floating magnet.</p>
</details>

主持人: 对。那太有趣了。我一直认为，而且显然已经有公司围绕着制造无限电池的想法而成立，你可以理论上永远储存电能，因为电子只是在四处移动。如果它是超导的，它们就可以永远在这个电路中旋转。人们实际上确实使用大型超导磁铁来储存能量。当你做**核磁共振**（MRI: Magnetic Resonance Imaging: 一种利用强磁场和无线电波生成身体内部图像的医学成像技术）时，你是在一个装有液氦的机器里，里面有一个超导磁铁，它们给它充电，那个磁场基本上会永远存在。你知道，等待人们进去。这有点奇怪，你身处这个超冷磁铁中。但他们设计得很好。运作良好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right. That's so interesting. I've always uh thought and there's obviously been companies started around the idea of creating an infinite battery where you could store technically forever electricity because the electrons are just moving around. If it's superconducting it can they can just spin forever around that circuit. And people actually do use big superconducting magnets to store energy. And when you get an MRI that you're in a you're in a liquid helium machine with a a superconducting magnet, they charge it up and that magnetic field is basically there forever. Uh you know, waiting for people to to go inside it. It it's kind of strange to be in you're inside this super cold magnet there. But they've designed it very well. Works well.</p>
</details>

主持人: 所以这个约瑟夫森结是两个超导体。它们位于你创建的屏障，一个绝缘屏障的两侧。然后也许你可以解释一下这个实验以及你们测量了什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So this Josephson junction is two superconductors. They're on either side of a barrier that you create, an insulating barrier. And then maybe just explain the experiment and and what you guys measured.</p>
</details>

主持人: 这都是你在研究生院的时候完成的，对吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And this this was all while you were in grad school, right?</p>
</details>

### 约瑟夫森结实验与宏观量子现象

马蒂尼斯: 是的。是的。这个约瑟夫森结，因为库珀对必须隧穿过去，但它们是无损地一起隧穿过去。这实际上形成了一个电路中所谓的**电感器**（Electrical Inductor: 储存能量在磁场中的电子元件）。所以电感器通常是一个线圈，它在磁场中储存能量。这里，它只是储存电子隧穿通过这里的能量。所以它是一种我们称之为动能电感的东西，它在这种情况下发生，但这形成了一个非线性电感，并且与电路中的**电容器**（Capacitor: 储存电荷和电能的电子元件）一起，形成了一个电感-电容**谐振电路**（Resonance Circuit: 在特定频率下表现出最大响应的电路）。这就像你旧收音机里的滤波器，你有LC谐振电路来过滤你的信号并做任何事情。所以这是一个非常常见的微波和射频元件，你一直用它来制造电路。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Yeah. And and uh and this is this Jose junction because the Cooper pairs have to tunnel through it, but they kind of tunnel through it together without any loss. This this actually forms what's called an electrical inductor in circuit in circuits. So an inductor is normally a a coil of wire that stores energy and its magnetic field. Here this this just stores energy of the electrons tunneling through here. And so it's a it's something called we call a kinetic inductance and it happens with this but that forms a nonlinear inductance and with a capacitor in the circuit that forms an inductor capacitance resonance circuit which is in your old which is like in your radios you have filters of LC resonance circuits to filter your signal and do anything. So this is a very common microwave and uh you know radio frequency uh element that you use all the time to make electrical circuits.</p>
</details>

主持人: 所以我只想简化一下，你有这两个超导体被这个屏障分开。有一些隧穿现象，一些电子实际上正在穿过屏障到达另一边，然后你可以有效地测量所有这些不同的变化，当你改变温度时。你们把不同的电压状态输入到你们建造的这个电路中。你们看到、测量并证明的是，发生了一些非常离散或特定的变化，这些变化基本上证明了宏观尺度上的量子力学。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I just want to simplify that you have these two superconductors split by this barrier. There's some tunneling some of these electrons are actually going through the barrier to the other side and then you can effectively measure all of these different changes as you change the temperature. You guys were putting different voltage states into this circuit that you built. And what you saw and what you measured and what you demonstrated was that there were these very kind of discrete or specific changes that happened that basically demonstrated quantum mechanics at scale.</p>
</details>

马蒂尼斯: 没错。所以，这个电感电容谐振器，你把它看作是一个电荷和电流通过，但因为它涉及量子力学，它有一个波函数。所以这些东西存在一些不确定性，然后考虑到这个简单电路的工作方式，你可以证明量子力学，其中之一是隧穿，这在这里有点难以描述，但你可以看到隧穿。但我认为可能更容易理解的是观察它的能级。让我解释一下，当人们发现原子物理学并开始做这些事情时，他们激发了一种气体，从这种气体中发出的光会以特定的颜色或频率出现。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's right. So, so this inductor capacitor resonator which you just treat as a you is a charge and a current going through but because it's quantum mechanics there's this wave function to it. So there's some uncertainty in these and then given just the way that the simple electrical circuit works um uh you can then demonstrate the quantum mechanics one of the tunneling which is a little bit hard to describe here but you can see tunneling but I think the little bit easier thing maybe easier is to look at the energy levels of this and let me kind of explain that when people discovered you know atomic physics and started doing any doing this they um excited a gas of of you know some gas and the light coming out of that gas would be at certain colors of frequency.</p>
</details>

马蒂尼斯: 所以如果你走到外面，看到钠灯亮着，这些是黄色的灯，你会看到灯发出单一频率的光。或者现在你看到LED灯，它们会发出特定的频率。这是一种量子力学效应，即电子如何围绕原子运动。它们只在某些特定的频率下振荡。现在，经典物理学中，你会期望它以所有不同的频率螺旋式地围绕或螺旋式地进入原子核。所以，这就是你所期望的。但我们看到了这些离散的频率。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So if you go outside and you have the sodium lamps on, these are kind of the yellow lamps, you have, you know, kind of a single frequency coming out of that lamp. Or nowadays you look at LEDs, there are certain frequencies that come out of that. And this is a quantum mechanical effect that the how the electrons travel around the atom. There's only certain kind of frequencies that they oscillate at. Now, classically, you would expect there to be all different frequencies that it spirals around or spirals into the nucleus. So, that's what you expect. But we saw these discrete frequencies.</p>
</details>

主持人: 所以，通过测量这些离散频率，你现在有了证据。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so, by measuring those discrete frequencies, you now had proof</p>
</details>

主持人: 证明了宏观尺度上正在发生量子力学现象。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">that there was quantum mechanics happening at a macro scale.</p>
</details>

马蒂尼斯: 没错。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That That's right.</p>
</details>

主持人: 你发表了这项工作。当你发表这项工作时，引起了很多关注吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And you published this work. And was there a lot of attention when you published this work?</p>

<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This was in 1985 86.</p>

### 诺贝尔奖级工作的深远影响

主持人: 那时你接着做了什么？它当时被认为是开创性的、诺贝尔奖级的工作吗？这项工作问世时的情况是怎样的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What did you go on to do at that point? Was it considered groundbreaking Nobel Prize-winning work and what was the story at that time when this came out?</p>
</details>

马蒂尼斯: 是的。所以，你知道，那是一项重要的工作，人们注意到了它，但是，你知道，我们证明了量子力学是有效的，而且量子力学在宏观尺度上也是有效的，这很好，但是人们仍然可以争辩说，它有什么用呢？你要用它做什么？事实上，一项重要的科学突破的秘密在于它是否能引出其他实验、其他论文、其他发明等等。而这需要几十年的时间才能发生，因为它太新了，人们必须去做。所以我认为它当时是值得注意的，但并不一定是诺贝尔奖的工作，因为它当时有点奇怪，而且，你知道，你要用它做什么呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. So, you know, it was an it was an important piece of work and people noticed it, but you know, it it you know, we we showed that quantum mechanics worked and quantum mechanics worked on the macro scale, which was nice, but one could still, you know, argue, well, what is it good for? What are you going to do? And the in fact the secret of an important scientific breakthrough is does it lead to other experiments and other papers and other inventions and the like and uh that kind of took uh you know many decades to happen because it was so new and people had to do do that. So I would say it was noteworthy at the time but you know not necessarily you know something for a Nobel Prize because it was just kind of you know weird and went off and you know what are you going to do with it?</p>
</details>

马蒂尼斯: 但当时发生的事情非常有趣，在我论文答辩结束时，在加州大学圣巴巴拉分校（UC Santa Barbara）举行了一次会议，我第一次来到这里。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But what happened at the time was very interesting and at the end of my thesis time there was a conference in uh UC Santa Barbara where I came here for the first time.</p>
</details>

马蒂尼斯: 是的。他们正在讨论这个实验，但在最后一天，最后一场演讲是由理查德·费曼（Richard Feynman）发表的，他是一位非常著名的物理学家。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. and uh they they were talking about this experiment but the very last day the last talk was by Richard Feman very well-known physicist</p>
</details>

主持人: 当然，最伟大的，是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">of course the greatest yeah</p>
</details>

马蒂尼斯: 最伟大的，是的，没错。你知道，我有点崇拜他，读过他的书等等。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">the great yeah right you know I kind of idolized him and and read his his his books and whatever</p>
</details>

主持人: 他当时正在谈论利用量子力学进行计算，也就是建造一台**量子计算机**（Quantum Computer: 利用量子力学现象进行计算的设备）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and he was talking about using quantum mechanics for computation which is building a quantum computer</p>
</details>

马蒂尼斯: 所以他做了一个演讲，你知道，作为一名学生，老实说，我并没有完全理解所有内容，我的好朋友米歇尔·德沃雷特（Michelle Devoret）说，是的，当时有些事情可能还没有完全弄清楚，但之后他被人们团团围住，问他问题，因为思考如何利用这个基本定律进行计算是如此有趣。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so he gave a talk that was, you know, really kind of amazing. I'm going to be honest as a student. I I didn't quite catch everything and my Michelle dev my dear friend said yeah maybe some of the things wasn't quite figured out at the time but afterwards he was absolutely mobbed by people asking him questions cuz it's so interesting to think about taking this this you know basic law and actually doing computation with it</p>
</details>

主持人: 对。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">right</p>
</details>

马蒂尼斯: 我当时是一名研究生，所以我在外围，你知道，教授们都在里面，我只是一个卑微的研究生，所以我只能听到一点点，但我从中学到的是，这是一个很棒的问题，而且是值得你一生去追求的事情，因为它如此深刻，如此有趣，也许还很实用，等等。所以这真的激励了我。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and I was a graduate student so I was kind of at the outside ring you know you have the professor professors in close and whatever and I was just a lowly graduate student so I could hear a little bit but what I what I learned from this it was a great question and and something that would be kind of worth doing you know for your your life pro your life work because it's so deep and so interesting and maybe practical and the like so that really motivated me</p>
</details>

主持人: 是的，所以那个大想法就是利用量子力学和量子力学的这些特性来进行计算。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yeah so that big idea is to use quantum mechanics and these properties of quantum mechanics to do computing.</p>
</details>

马蒂尼斯: 是的，没错。我想说，在那之后不久，该领域的其他人变得更加具体，并展示了如何做到这一点。然后在1990年代初，大约五年后，彼得·肖（Peter Shor）提出了他的**因数分解算法**（Factoring Algorithm: 一种用于分解大整数的算法，在量子计算机上比经典计算机更高效），用它来解决一个现实世界的问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, that's right. And and I would say uh uh soon after that other people in the field got a little bit more specific and showed how you would how you would do it. And then it was in the early 1990s, maybe 5 years later, that Peter Shaw came up with this factoring algorithm to to solve a you know, a real world problem with it.</p>
</details>

主持人: 是的。人们花了一段时间才弄明白。它非常抽象，你知道，人们不太确定该怎么做。但就像我说的，我可以看到费曼周围的人群都在问他问题，这表明这是最有趣、最基本的问题，你知道，如何将量子力学与计算结合起来。这真的很了不起。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. And it took a while to people figure out. It was very abstract and you know people quite weren't sure what to do. But but like I said I could see that in all the the crowd around Fineman asking them questions that this was the most you know most interesting fundamental question you know how to combine quantum mechanics with doing computation. It's it's really amazing.</p>
</details>

主持人: 所以你几乎把这作为你一生的工作。你拥有一个非常好的职业生涯。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so you started to do that with your life's work pretty much. you go on to a very good career.</p>
</details>

### 职业生涯与谷歌量子实验室

马蒂尼斯: 是的。所以我的职业道路，当然，量子计算正在发展，我花了一段时间才真正全身心投入其中。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. So my career path um was of course quantum computing was getting developed and and it took me a while to really get go all in on it. Okay.</p>
</details>

马蒂尼斯: 是的。所以，发生的事情是米歇尔·德沃雷特来自法国CA，他去了伯克利，然后又回去了。我作为博士后去了那里，和他们一起工作。他们当时很年轻，不为人知，人们会说，你要去欧洲，你不会和美国科学界建立联系，但我知道米歇尔、丹妮尔·埃斯特维（Danielle Eststev）和克里斯蒂安·乌尔比纳（Christian Urbina），我一起工作的人，他们绝对是杰出的，他们拥有非常辉煌的职业生涯。所以我去了那里，因为我知道那很棒。我们继续进行这方面的实验。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. So um what happened is Michelle Devare was was from France from CA France went to Berkeley went back I went there as a posttock and worked with them and they were young and unknown at the time and people like well you're going to go to Europe and you're not going to get connected to US science but I knew Michelle and Danielle Eststev and Christian Abino the people I working with were absolutely brilliant okay and they've had a very illustrious a career. So I went over there because I knew that was great. And we continued to do experiments on this.</p>
</details>

主持人: 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah.</p>
</details>

马蒂尼斯: 然后在那之后，我回到了美国，在**国家标准与技术研究院**（National Institute of Standards and Technology, NIST）工作。碰巧就在戴夫·温兰德（Dave Wineland）和他的团队的办公室旁边，他们因原子物理学，你知道，进行量子计算而获得了诺贝尔奖。我与他们合作进行了一些实验，包括计数电子和计量学，然后又进行了其他实验。然后在90年代末，我再次全身心投入到建造量子计算机中。当时有可用的资金。理论上已经取得了足够的进展，美国政府开始资助这项研究，看看人们是否能做到。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then after that I came back to the US and I worked for the National Institute of Standards and Technology. And it turns out just down the hall from Dave Wland and his group who went a Nobel Prize for atomic physics for you know doing quantum computation. And I worked on some with doing experiments on counting electrons and working for metrology and then did other experiments. And then in late uh the '9s I I just again went all in on building a quantum computer. There was funding available at that time. It had progressed enough theoretically that the US government started you know funding this to see if people can do it.</p>
</details>

主持人: 所以在2014年几年后，你最终去了谷歌在圣巴巴拉的量子实验室。是这样吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so then couple years after 2014 I think you ended up at at Google's quantum lab in Santa Barbara. Is that right?</p>
</details>

马蒂尼斯: 我在加州大学圣巴巴拉分校（UCSB）待了大约十年，那段经历很棒，我把实验室从非常基础的研究发展到建造一台五**量子比特**（Qubit: 量子计算机的基本信息单位）然后是九量子比特的量子计算机。然后在那段时间里，谷歌对此产生了兴趣，我决定虽然学术界很棒，但要组建一个团队并长期维持他们来建造这台复杂的机器会很困难，而谷歌有资金。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I was at UCSB for um 10 years or so which was wonderful and built up the lab to go from very basic things to building a five and then 9 cubit quantum computer. And then during that time, Google got interested and I I kind of decided that although academia was great, it would be hard to get the team together and keep them together for a long time to build this complicated machine and Google had the money. Okay.</p>
</details>

马蒂尼斯: 是的。所以我们去了那里，我们刚开始的时候规模很小，主要是我加州大学圣巴巴拉分校团队的人，然后在2019年，我们发表了这项**量子优越性**（Quantum Supremacy: 量子计算机在特定任务上超越最强大的经典计算机的能力）实验，使用了53个量子比特，我们制造了很多量子比特，而且它们真的很好，速度很快，等等，这样我们就可以运行一些算法，一个数学算法，它产生了一些输出，这个输出在经典计算机上需要更长的时间来模拟和完成。它不实用，但它展示了量子计算机的力量。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. So, so we went there and we started off fairly small uh mostly from people coming from my UCSB group and then in uh 2019 we published this quantum supremacy experiment with 53 cubits where we made a lot of cubits and we made them really good and you know fast and whatever so that we could run some algorithm a mathematical algorithm that um what it produced some output uh that was took you know much much longer on a classical computer to to emulate and do that. It was not practical but it was a demonstration of the power of a quantum computer</p>
</details>

主持人: 它奏效了。也许你可以描述一下**量子比特**（Qubit: 量子计算机的基本信息单位），也许我们可以将如何从量子比特构建量子计算机与约瑟夫森结以及你早期获得诺贝尔奖的工作联系起来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">that it worked. Well, just maybe give your description of a cubit and maybe we can relate, you know, how do we build these quantum computers from cubits to the Josephson junction and some of the early work you had done that you ended up winning the prize for.</p>
</details>

马蒂尼斯: 简单来说，我们有金属线，金属线连接到这个约瑟夫森结上，它代表一个电感器流过这里。然后从这条线到那条线，我们有一个电容器。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So very simply, we have a metal wire and a metal wire that gets put together on this Joseen junction which represents a a an inductor flowing through here. And then from this wire to this wire, we have a capacitor.</p>
</details>

马蒂尼斯: 然后我们设置它以大约5GHz的手机频率振荡，以形成量子比特。好的，这个振荡的东西。然后在低温下，超导体，你知道，所有这些魔法，我们可以从中获得量子力学行为。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then we set that up to oscillate at about 5 GHz cell phone frequencies. Uh uh you know to to form the cubit. Okay, this oscillating thing. And then there's at low temperatures superconductors you know all this magic we can we can get quantum mechanical behavior out of that</p>
</details>

主持人: 然后你可以测量这种量子力学行为，创建一个表示，并用它来运行你的计算。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and then you can measure that quantum mechanical behavior create a representation and use that to run your computing.</p>
</details>

马蒂尼斯: 没错。你可以做的是，你施加微波脉冲来改变量子计算机的状态，改变它的振荡方式，然后我们把它连接到一个复杂的读出电路，最终弄清楚它处于什么状态。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's right. What you can do is you put on microwave pulses to change the state of the quantum computer, change the way it oscillates and then we connect it to um it's a complicated readout circuitry uh to you know in the end figure out what state it's in.</p>
</details>

主持人: 好的。然后你只是连接了一个这样的阵列，你只是使用电容耦合从一条线到下一条线来将它们耦合在一起，这比这更复杂，但这给了你一个好主意。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay. And then and then you you connect just an array of these and you just use capacitive coupling from you know one one wire to the to the next one to to couple them together and it's more complicated than that but that gives you a good idea</p>
</details>

主持人: 然后只是为了理解你的工作，你因此获得了诺贝尔奖，它展示了这种宏观尺度的量子力学现象。这是量子比特和电路设计的一部分吗？它是否为这种设计工作提供了信息或解释了它？是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and then just to understand your work that you won this Nobel Prize for that demonstrated this quantum mechanical phenomena at scale. Is that part of the design of a cubit and the circuitry? Did that inform that design work or explain it rather? Yeah.</p>
</details>

马蒂尼斯: 是的。那是最初最简单的电路。你知道，我们当时使用的是模拟模拟器，甚至不是我用计算机获取数据，但这已经是很久以前的事情了，你知道，它非常粗糙。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. It was the very basic simplest circuit. uh you know we were using analog simulators at the time not even the I took data with a computer but this is this is far back enough that you know it was very rudimentary</p>

马蒂尼斯: 是的，我可以谈谈这一点，但我想说，这个领域已经产生了许多其他关于如何建造量子计算机的想法，它是一个非常令人兴奋的领域，规模相当大，我想说科学也非常非常深入。为了让这些东西发挥作用，你必须发明许多不同的设备。你必须考虑材料。你必须制造它，建造复杂的控制系统。工程和物理学对我来说非常美妙。

<p class="english-text">yeah I I can talk on that but I would say um you know this field many other ideas on how to build a quantum computer has been generated and uh it is very exciting field quite large field and I would say that the science was very very deep too. To get these things to work you have to invent lots of different devices. You have to think about materials. You have to fabricate it, build complex control systems. Engineering and physics is is to me quite beautiful.</p>
</details>

马蒂尼斯: 只是告诉你一点关于我的事情，你知道，我从小就喜欢建造东西，作为一名实验主义者，我喜欢建造仪器，建造实验来展示这些。这对我来说是一个理想的项目，因为，你知道，从很早开始，我就想，好吧，让我们做这个伟大的物理学，但也要建造一些东西。通过说，我们必须做什么才能建造一台量子计算机？这让我知道我们必须测试什么物理学，以及我们必须建造什么样的事物，这就是我的思维方式。我更注重实践。所以这是一个非常适合我的领域，这就是，你知道，直觉上促使我在研究生院想做这件事的原因。我认为为了让它发挥作用，你必须进行大量的工程和技术工作，这真是太迷人了。

And by saying, well, what do we have to do to build a quantum computer? that kind of led me to know what physics we have to test and what are the kinds of things we have to build and that's just the way my mind works. I'm I'm much more practically oriented. So it was a perfect field for me to get in and that's kind of what you know intuitively led me to you know want to do this in graduate school.

### 量子计算的现状与未来展望

主持人: 我们今天在量子计算的演进中处于什么位置？所以现状如何？我们什么时候才能拥有普遍可用且普遍有用的量子计算机，能够做所有人们几十年来谈论的那些令人惊奇的事情？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Where are we in quantum computing evolution today? So what's the state? At what point will we have call it generally accessible and generally useful quantum computers that can do all of the amazing things everyone's kind of talked about for decades that one would be able to do quantum computers.</p>
</details>

马蒂尼斯: 没错。所以，目前我们大约有50到100个量子比特用于超导情况，但它们可以完全控制并运行真实的算法，做非常复杂的事情。它们还有很多其他系统可以做到这一点。我认为新来的，看起来不错的是中性原子，他们已经制造了大型中性原子系统，但他们仍在努力使门控控制得很好等等。但现在发生的情况是，我们可以运行真正的算法，人们有想法想要运行，但因为这些量子比特不完美，好的，它是一个模拟控制系统，从根本上说，这些量子比特有一些错误，有一些噪声，你只能运行如此复杂的项目，它足以撰写科学论文并尝试事物。偶尔人们会说他们做了一些难以计算的事情，那很好，但它们还不够大，不足以有用。它们必须变得更大，必须变得更好，噪声更少。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's right. So um right now we're we're about 50 or 100 cubits for the superconducting case but they they can be fully controlled and run real algorithms and do very complicated things. They have a lot of other systems that can do that. I think the the newcomer on the block which looks good is neutral atoms where they've made big neutral atom systems but they they're still working to get the gates controlled really well and the like. But what's happened right now is we can run genuine algorithms on that and people have uh h you know have ideas they want to run but because these cubits are not perfect okay you it's an analog control system and fundamentally these quantum bits have a little bit of error to it little bit of noise to it you can only run so complicated of a project and it's good enough to write scientific papers and try things out. Uh, every once in a while people say they've done something uh, you know, that's hard to compute and well that's fine, but they aren't really big enough to be useful yet. They have to get bigger and they have to get better, less noise.</p>

<p class="english-text">Do you have a point of view on the timelines? This is everyone's speculation and there's been more hype than reality.</p>
</details>

马蒂尼斯: 是的，炒作多于现实，而且很难。我以前不想猜测，但自从我创办了一家公司，我就可以这样做了。我们想做的是，以及许多其他团队的时间表是，在接下来的8到10年内做一些事情，大概是这样。但问题是，你知道，人们预测10年已经有一段时间了，所以，好吧，我们必须做到这一点。但我可以告诉你，就我们正在做的事情而言，我们已经确定了当前制造量子计算机的技术瓶颈。我们已经就此撰写了一些论文，我们正在与半导体行业的人合作，以更具成本效益和高质量的方式制造它，你知道，就像你制造这些GPU一样。我们认为，当我们成功时，我们可以非常迅速地扩大规模，所以在，比如说，10年的时间尺度内，大概是这样。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, there's more hype than reality and and uh, and it's hard. I used to not want to speculate that but since I started a company then I can do that and what we want to do and it's a timeline of many other groups is to do something in let's say in the next 8 10 years something like that but the problem is you know people are predicting 10 years you know for a while now so okay we we have to do that but um I can tell you for what we're doing is that we've identified by what are kind of the technology bottlenecks of the current fabric turn ways to make a a quantum computer. We've written some papers on it and you know we're working with people in the semiconductor industry to manufacture this in a much more coste effective quality way you know the way you make these GPUs or something and we think uh you know when we get that to work we can scale up very rapidly so in in a let's say 10year time scale something like that</p>
</details>

主持人: 在许多技术难度很高的领域，比如核聚变能源，甚至量子计算，由于人工智能（AI）的出现，它们在实现这些非常宏大的技术项目中的疯狂大目标方面正在经历深刻的加速。人工智能是否开始在解决量子计算历史上遇到的工程、材料科学、规模化、噪声问题方面发挥作用？你认为由于人工智能，性能改进正在加速吗？

<details>

<p class="english-text">in a lot of technically difficult fields like fusion energy perhaps even quantum computing. They are seeing profound acceleration in getting to their crazy big goals on these very big technical projects because of AI.

And do you think that there's an acceleration underway in performance improvements because of AI? there there may be um my partic and and and there's things we can maybe do modeling and the like. We also think what we can do is use the quantum computer and AI together to solve the problems better. So that that that's what our theory team is proposing. I used to work with Google quantum AI. That's what they're proposing. So there's a general feeling of that.</p>
</details>

马蒂尼斯: 可能有，我的观点是，在控制方面，如果你没有把系统建造得足够干净，并且你知道控制足够清晰，你就无法从中获得出色的性能。所以我在这里有点老派，致力于以这种方式建造它。当然，有些地方可以使用人工智能，你知道，在用于**纠错**（Error Correction: 识别和纠正计算或数据传输中错误的机制）的解码电路等方面。但有一点要提到的是，你知道，这些量子比特天生就非常嘈杂，你可能有时能对坏的量子比特进行100次操作，对好的量子比特进行1000次甚至几千次操作，然后它们就会失去记忆。你可以把它想象成**动态随机存取存储器**（Dynamic RAM: 一种需要定期刷新才能保持数据存储的计算机内存），你需要刷新它。你需要通过纠错来刷新它。正因为如此，你需要一百万个量子比特的量子计算机才能实现通用目的并解决真正困难的问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">My particular view though is that in terms of this control, if you don't build your system cleanly enough and you know that the control is clear enough, uh you're you're not going to get the the great performance out of it. So I'm a little bit old school here and and working on you know building it that way. There's certainly some elements where you can use AI, you know, in the decoding circuit for the the error correction and the like. But the one thing to mention to you is that, you know, these cubits are are naturally very noisy and you can maybe do sometimes 100 for bad cubits and maybe a thousand maybe few thousand operations before they kind of lose their memory. You know, you can think of it as like dynamic RAM where you have to refresh it. Well, you have to refresh it with error correction. And because of that, you're talking about a million cubit quantum computers to be general purpose and solve really hard problems. There might be some</p>

And the thing that scares me a little bit is, you know, last December the Google group published the latest results, which is really much nicer. They made some real improvement, but then China soon afterward published something kind of indicating they were, you know, on par or near par or something to it.</p>

Now, what we're doing with our our company is we're doing a new generation of fabrication of the devices. And I would cons consider in my my my research we had the simple fabrication with the original papers in 85 and then around 2000 we had more sophisticated fabrication and then for the quantum supremacy experiment we did something even more complicated other groups too but we want to do a similar jump in the fabrication and what's interesting about this is we're going to be using applied materials and the modern fabrication processes that they have which on 300 mm tools you know you can't get in China for example</p>

马蒂尼斯: 让我给你讲一点内幕故事。我们从一开始就知道这是一个重要的实验。我们获得了一些其他不太知名的奖项，对此我们非常感激。诺贝尔奖系统会组织诺贝尔研讨会，他们会召集某个领域的物理学家，比如量子信息学等，他们会让所有科学家发表演讲，他们想检查这个领域的活力，它有多大？然后，也许还有一些领导者，他们会思考，他们能做一次好的演讲吗？他们会是一个好的代表吗？

<p class="english-text">So let me uh give you a little bit of the inside story. Um you know if you we we've known that this was a important experiment from the beginning. we've obtained some other prizes that are you know much less wellknown and really appreciative of all that and you you what happens is the Nobel um um system uh put together Nobel symposiums where they get together physicists in a certain field which is quantum information and this kind of thing and they they give uh have all the scientists give talks and and they want to kind of check on the vi vitality of the you know of the field, how big is it?

马蒂尼斯: 所以米歇尔、约翰和我以前都参加过这些研讨会，我们知道发生了什么，至少我们被考虑过。但我只想告诉你，作为一名科学家，仅仅被邀请参加这些研讨会并被考虑，就是一种巨大的荣誉，你知道，而获得这个奖项简直令人难以置信，你不应该那样想。所以，你知道，我几年前就知道这件事了。事实上，老实说，过去当日期临近时，我就会想，哦，这会发生吗？然后你早上醒来，就会想，“哦，没发生。”然后你就会沮丧一整天。你知道，今年没发生。这是一种非常糟糕的态度。我一点也不喜欢那样。你知道，你不应该觊觎某个，你知道，极其困难的奖项，它只颁发给少数人。所以，今年发生的事情是，我花了几年时间才克服了这种心态，今年我只是把它忘了。

<p class="english-text">So um Michelle and John and I have been to these uh symposiums before and we kind of knew, you know, what was going on, you know, that at least we were considered. And but I I'll just tell you as a scientist just to be invited to these and be considered is a is a fantastic honor, you know, and and having getting the prize is just so kind of unbelievable that you shouldn't think that way. So, you know, I've known about it for a few years. And in fact, to be very honest, in the past when the dates have come around, it's like, oh, is this going to happen? And then you wake up in the morning and it's like, "Oh, it didn't happen." And you're kind of down for a day. You know, it didn't happen this year. And that's a very bad attitude. I I don't like that at all. And, you know, you you should not covet some, you know, insanely difficult uh prize that, you know, only only goes to a few people. So, what happened this year is I kind of worked through this over several years and this year I just kind of forgot about it.</p>

<p class="english-text">to be honest. I'm just so focused on doing this and especially when you start a company, you better be focused, right? So, I'm doing that. But one of the fields that I find, this is someone Ben Mazen at UC Santa Barbara is looking for exoplanets</p>

马蒂尼斯: 他们正在使用与我们正在做的事情有些相似的超导探测器。事实上，在1990年代左右，我帮助建立了那个领域，并与其他人一起做了五、六年、七年。但他正在以不同的方式做这件事。我真的很喜欢，你知道，我们一直在研究的这种仪器，他们的量子设备现在能够用于这些天文学探测器，并寻找这些。当然，这些天天文学领域有很多进展，包括**引力探测器**（Gravitational Detectors: 用于探测引力波的设备）和系外行星搜索，这对我来说真的非常迷人。而且它再次非常注重技术，人们正在建造好的探测器。这就是我喜欢的。好的。我喜欢建造仪器。所以这特别有趣。

<p class="english-text">and they're using superconducting detectors that are somewhat similar to what we're doing. In fact, in the 1990s or so, I helped, you know, helped establish that field with other people and did that for five, six, seven years uh to do that. but he's doing it in a different way. And I really like how, you know, this instrumentation, you know, that we've been working on is their quantum devices are are now able to um uh do these astronomy uh detectors and and look for look for these. And of course, there's so much going on in astronomy these way days with gravitational detectors and exoplanet searches and it it it's just really fascinating to me. And again it's very much technologyoriented where people are building good detectors. This is what I like. Okay. I like building building instruments. So that that's particularly interest.</p>
