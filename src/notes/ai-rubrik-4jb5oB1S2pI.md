### AI 自动化与数据分析在网络安全中的应用

How are you using AI automation or data analytics to really stay ahead here?

您是如何利用 AI 自动化或数据分析来保持领先地位的？

### Rubrik 的核心理念：网络攻击不可避免

The rubric is the security and air operations company we help our customers recover from, as you said, ransomware attack so that they can get back into the business without disruption.
Our fundamental thesis is cyber attacks are inevitable and every business has to have assumed breach.
Assume attack, posture and rubric helps them understand the risk of an attack.
And how do you recover from an attack so that your business is uninterrupted?

Rubrik 是一家安全和 AI 运营公司，我们帮助客户从勒索软件攻击中恢复，以便他们能够不间断地恢复业务。我们的基本理念是网络攻击不可避免，每个企业都必须假定已发生泄露。假定攻击发生，Rubrik 帮助他们了解攻击的风险，以及如何在攻击发生后恢复业务，确保您的业务不间断。

### AI 时代下的新挑战与 Rubrik 的解决方案

And on the east side, we are also helping our customers accelerate their journey, adopt more of their agent systems.
One of the big concerns around agents is agents can misbehave, they can hallucinate or they can get compromised by cyber actors.
So we are giving them a rewind button so that if agents take actions that are not desirable, they can just press the Divine button and undo the actions of misbehaving agents behind misbehaving agents as more companies adopt or implement AI, does that make them more vulnerable to attacks like ransomware?
Does that open up any vulnerabilities?

在 AI 方面，我们也在帮助客户加速他们的转型，采用更多的 AI 代理系统。关于 AI 代理的一个主要担忧是，代理可能会行为不当，产生幻觉，或者被网络攻击者利用。因此，我们为他们提供了一个“回滚”按钮，这样，如果代理采取了不期望的操作，他们只需按下该按钮即可撤销这些行为。

### AI 带来的机遇与风险

Obviously more air drops and more identical tops and actually creates a larger surface area of cyber attack because you have more software.
But at the end of the day, it is 100 times more opportunities and 100 times more risk on the risk side.
Now, agents can do ten X more damage in 1/10 of the time.
So business have to have to have the confidence that they can deploy agents, they can do air transformation, create an enterprise, deploy air walker without the risk of fire.
And that's what we are focused on.
How do we reduce the risk and give our customers more confidence to do the transformation?

显然，更多的 AI 部署和更多的 AI 应用实际上会因为软件的增多而扩大网络攻击的表面积。但归根结底，机遇是以前的 100 倍，而风险也是以前的 100 倍。现在，AI 代理可以在十分之一的时间内造成十倍的损害。因此，企业必须有信心能够部署 AI 代理，进行 AI 转型，构建企业级 AI 应用，而无需承担网络风险。这正是我们的关注点：我们如何降低风险，让客户更有信心地进行转型？

### 平衡创新与网络安全、数据隐私

Well, you really underscored the idea that I can be an asset here or it can really cause some real damage.
So how are you thinking about balancing innovation with cybersecurity and data privacy?

您确实强调了 AI 既可以成为一种资产，也可能造成真正的损害。那么，您是如何考虑平衡创新与网络安全及数据隐私的？

### 数据敏感性、完整性与可用性

Definitely the A's aim is to increase productivity, but on the risk side, only the right data can go to the right person on the right platform at the right time, and that is the organization's code.
We are helping our customers understand the sensitivity of the data, have integrity and availability of the data and their services.
And at the same time, if anything goes wrong, giving them a divine baton so that they are confident about deploying it in production, deploying agents to actually do real work.

AI 的目标无疑是提高生产力。但在风险方面，只有正确的数据才能在正确的时间传递给正确的人、正确的平台，这才是组织的核心。我们正在帮助客户理解数据的敏感性，确保数据的完整性和可用性，以及他们的服务。同时，如果出现问题，我们会提供一个“回滚”按钮，让他们有信心在生产环境中部署 AI，部署 AI 代理来完成实际工作。

### “回滚按钮”的功能与限制

When you offered them a rewind button. Does it rewind everything?
I mean, it raises all, you know, the issues that they want to clean up or is there some residue that simply can't be done away?

当您提供“回滚按钮”时，它会回滚所有内容吗？我的意思是，它是否会解决所有他们想要清理的问题，还是会留下一些无法清除的残余？

### 精准回滚：仅撤销不良操作

We give them a divine baton to completely undo the action of an agent.
But it has to be done surgically because you don't want to take good actions out.
And that's what we do.
We give them full visibility on what has happened and the ability to surgically undo only undesirable changes.

我们提供一个“回滚按钮”来完全撤销 AI 代理的操作。但这必须经过精确的操作，因为您不希望撤销了好的操作。这就是我们所做的：我们提供对已发生事件的全面可见性，并能够精确地撤销仅不良的更改。

### Rubrik 的技术实现：连接行动与结果

Interesting.
How exactly does that work?
The what we do is we give them a platform where we actually monitor all the changes by an agent and connect that back into the cyber resiliency platform that Google has developed over the last ten, 12 years so that you can connect the action to the effect and then ability to undo the effects.

有趣。这具体是如何运作的？我们所做的是提供一个平台，实际监控 AI 代理的所有更改，并将其与 Rubrik 在过去十到十二年中开发的网络韧性平台连接起来，这样您就可以将行动与其后果联系起来，并能够撤销这些后果。

### 网络安全领域的整合趋势

I want to ask you about consolidation in your space, in cybersecurity space.
There's been a lot of talk that this is a crowded space.
There are a lot of small companies, a lot of startups, and people have been waiting for waves of consolidation for a while now.
But we have an administration that is much more open to mergers and acquisitions than the previous administration.
How do you look at the landscape right now?
The competitive landscape are there are too many players right now.

我想问问您关于您所在的领域，网络安全领域的整合问题。一直有说法称这是一个拥挤的市场，有很多小公司、很多初创公司，人们一直在等待整合的浪潮。但是，我们现在有一个比前任政府更开放地支持合并与收购的政府。您如何看待目前的格局？竞争格局，现在是否玩家太多了？

### 区分传统安全与韧性市场

Traditionally cyber security the way the world was.
It is focused on prevention and detection of attacks.
And there are hundreds of vendors and tens of tools that average enterprise, 8200 tools they buy to prevent undetected attacks.
That space is super crowded.
Too many vendors, too much fragmentation is still a number of successful cyber attacks.
We are focused on the resiliency part of it where we are saying attacks will happen.
Are you ready to withstand an attack and keep your services up and running?
So our space is a new market, new segment in cybersecurity, which is rapidly growing, but the older cybersecurity segment around prevention and detection has a lot of vendors.

传统网络安全，就像过去那样，侧重于预防和检测攻击。有数百家供应商和数十种工具，一般的企业会购买 8200 种工具来预防未被检测到的攻击。那个领域竞争非常激烈。供应商太多，碎片化太严重，但成功的网络攻击数量依然不少。我们专注于韧性部分，我们认为攻击是会发生的。您是否准备好抵御攻击并保持服务正常运行？

### 整合的必要性与平台化趋势

There has to be consolidation because businesses can't deal with 80 tools from hundreds of vendors and constantly juggling and having these disconnected systems.
So you see Palo Alto Network, CrowdStrike and others are making big headways in creating platforms that can connect all aspects of the
infrastructure security around
prevention and detection.
Understood.

必须进行整合，因为企业无法应对来自数百家供应商的 80 种工具，并且需要不断地进行协调和处理这些不兼容的系统。因此，您可以看到 Palo Alto Networks、CrowdStrike 等公司在创建能够连接预防和检测方面基础设施安全所有方面的平台方面取得了重大进展。明白了。

### Rubrik 的发展策略：有机与非有机结合

So people, I need to ask you, are you looking to you know, are you are you canvassing the market and looking to maybe add on to what your current capabilities offer?
Are you in the marketplace, too?
Are you a buyer potentially?
Always we always look at our current roadmap and how do we accelerate this roadmap for our customers.
We are always looking for great team, great technology, great products to acquired and accelerate our roadmap.
We have taken this approach of organic and organic development and we want to holistically help our customers do the transformation, clear the enterprise with confidence.

那么，我必须问您，您是在考察市场，寻找可以添加到您现有能力之上的东西吗？您是否也在市场上？您有可能成为收购方吗？我们始终关注我们的当前路线图，以及如何为客户加速该路线图。我们一直在寻找优秀的团队、优秀的技术、优秀的产品进行收购，以加速我们的路线图。我们一直采取有机和非有机（收购）相结合的发展方式，我们希望全面地帮助客户进行转型，让他们有信心地清除企业内的风险。
