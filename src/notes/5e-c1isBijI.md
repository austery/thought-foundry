title: 为何中国文化中易生帝王视角？批判“雄才大略”与专制统治的本质
summary: 本视频深入探讨了中国文化中普遍存在的“帝王视角”现象，并批判了对“雄才大略”型君主的盲目推崇。通过剖析长城的功能、汉武帝对外战争的真实动机，以及李世民对待边疆民族的策略，揭示了专制统治下国家利益与民众福祉的错位。视频还对比了中西方在权力合法性法理基础上的根本差异，指出民族主义叙事如何将帝王行为包装成现代国家理性运作的产物，从而掩盖了其自私与残暴的本质。

### 引言：长城的双重功能与民族主义的叙事

大家好，我是Anthony。欢迎来到我的频道。今天我们继续聊聊中国的历史。在之前的视频中，我们首先讨论了长城的功能。长城不仅仅像主流叙事所宣称的那样，是为了防御外敌、保护人民，其另一个同样重要、甚至更为重要的功能是控制人民。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Hello everyone, I am Anthony. Welcome to my channel. Today we continue to talk about the history of China. In the previous video, we first discussed the function of the Great Wall. The Great Wall, not just as the mainstream narrative claims, to defend against foreign enemies, protecting people, its other equally important, even more important is to control the people.</p>
</details>

**民族主义**（Nationalism: 一种以民族为核心的意识形态，强调民族的认同、团结和利益）常常假设“我们”是一个整体，“我们”必然比“他们”更优越，因此无需考虑“我们”内部的真实情况。然而，内部的社会不公、压迫和贫困，往往比所谓的外部威胁更为严重。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Nationalism often assume that “we” are a monolithic group, “we” must be naturally superior to “them”, so there is no need to consider the real situation inside "us". However, internal social injustice, oppression and poverty often more serious than so-called foreign threats.</p>
</details>

因此，从秦汉到明清时期，人们最想逃离的，正是帝国制度所设置的各种“墙”，无论是实体可见的城墙、关隘，还是无形的**户籍制度**（Household Registration System: 中国古代用于管理人口、征收赋税和徭役的制度），以及沉重的**徭役**（Corvée: 古代国家强制公民无偿从事的劳役）和赋税。这些东西比国家认同更为重要，而这，也正是中国宏大叙事想要回避的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Therefore, from the Qin and Han Dynasties to the Ming and Qing Dynasties, what people want to escape from most, it is the various walls set up by the imperial system that, whether it is a tangible wall, a pass, or an invisible household registration system? Heavy corvée and taxes. These things are more important than national identity, and this, this is also what China's grand narrative wants to avoid.</p>
</details>

在上一期视频的结尾，我们也讨论了，整个20世纪，长城的意义并非一成不变。在历史的不同阶段，它被不断赋予新的符号和使命。它的象征价值，随着国家权力和意识形态的变化而流转，从一个阻碍现代化的封闭符号，到激发抗战精神的民族象征；从被边缘化的中国旧遗产，到再次成为“文化自信”的核心图腾。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">At the end of the previous video, we also discussed, throughout the 20th century, the significance of the Great Wall is not static. At different stages in history, constantly given new symbols and missions. Its symbolic value, as state power and ideology change, the circulating, from a closed symbol that hinders modernization, to the national symbol that inspired the spirit of the War of Resistance, from the marginalized old Chinese heritage, to become the core totem of "cultural confidence" again.</p>
</details>

长城的形象总是被现实的政治需求所塑造和改写。这也表明，民族主义的符号并非像它所宣称的那样，是天然的、超越时空的，它可能在不久前才被发明和创造出来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The image of the Great Wall always shaped and rewritten by realistic political needs. This also shows, symbols of nationalism, not as it claims, natural and beyond time and space, it may have been invented not long ago. Created. That's it.</p>
</details>

有人可能会说，**秦始皇**（Qin Shi Huang: 中国第一个统一王朝秦朝的建立者）和**汉武帝**（Emperor Wu of Han: 西汉第七位皇帝，名刘彻）修建长城是为了对抗**匈奴**（Xiongnu: 中国古代北方游牧民族），虽然给社会带来了沉重负担，但毕竟保护了人民的生命财产，他们抗击外敌的功绩不容否定。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Some people might say, Qin Shi Huang and Emperor Wu of Han built the Great Wall to fight against the Huns, although it has placed a heavy burden on society, but after all, protecting the lives and property of the people, their contributions in fighting against foreign enemies cannot be denied.</p>
</details>

### 汉武帝的“雄才大略”与民族主义的扭曲宣传

今天的视频，我们主要以汉武帝**刘彻**（Liu Che: 即汉武帝）为例，继续探讨这种民族主义宣传的扭曲。本视频也将收录在“历史与社会”这个播放列表中。如果您有任何想与我讨论和咨询的话题，可以通过我的邮箱预约。那么，让我们回到今天的话题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Today's video, we mainly take Emperor Wu of Han, Liu Che, as an example, let’s continue to explore the distortion of this nationalist propaganda. This video, it will also be included in the list of "History and Society". If you have anything you want to discuss with me and consulting topics, you can contact my email to make an appointment. So let's get back to our topic today.</p>
</details>

我们说，把**君主专制**（Autocratic Power: 皇帝拥有绝对权力的政治制度）权力的扩张等同于整个社会的进步，这也是中国社会看待历史的主流方式。例如，教育部编纂的七年级历史教科书第12课《汉武帝巩固**大一统**（Great Unification: 中国历史上追求中央集权、统一国家的政治理想）王朝》中，汉武帝就被视为一位“雄才大略”的皇帝。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We say that the expansion of authoritarian power, equivalent to the progress of the whole society, this is also the mainstream way Chinese society views history. For example, Lesson 12 of the seventh-grade history textbook compiled by the Ministry of Education, Emperor Wu of Han Consolidates the Unified Dynasty, the Han Emperor Wu was regarded as an emperor of "great talent and strategy".</p>
</details>

这节课的要点要求学生记住汉武帝为巩固大一统所采取的一系列措施：例如，削弱诸侯王和地方豪强的势力，因为这些人反叛朝廷，造成社会动乱；在思想上，**罢黜百家，独尊儒术**（Dismiss all other schools of thought and revere only Confucianism: 汉武帝时期董仲舒提出的思想政策，使儒家思想成为官方正统）；在经济上，推行**盐铁专营**（Salt and Iron Monopoly: 汉武帝时期国家对盐和铁的生产、销售实行垄断的政策）以稳定物价，改善了国家财政状况；当然，最重要的是在军事上持续打击匈奴，扩大了汉朝的疆域。教科书总结道，汉武帝的统一政策使西汉进入了鼎盛时期。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The main points of this lesson, students are required to remember a series of measures taken by Emperor Wu of Han to consolidate the great unification. For example, weakening the power of princes and local tyrants, because these people rebelled against the court, cause social chaos. In terms of ideology, all other schools of thought were rejected, and Confucianism was the only one respected. In terms of economy, we should promote salt and iron monopoly to stabilize prices. Improved the country's financial situation. Certainly, the most important thing is to continue to attack the Huns militarily. Expanded the territory of the Han Dynasty. The textbook concludes that, Emperor Wu of Han's policy of unification, the Western Han Dynasty entered its heyday.</p>
</details>

我个人认为，中国文化中皇帝的**谥号**（Posthumous Title: 帝王、贵族、大臣等死后，依其生前事迹所给予的称号）天然带有美化的含义，所以我更习惯称他为刘彻，而不是汉武帝。教科书的词汇和叙事风格，实际上是将整个国家的利益完全等同于皇帝的个人利益。刘彻的所作所为并非出于任何私心，而是对整个民族有利。但这是一种相当离谱且错误的误解。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I personally think, the title of the emperor in Chinese culture, natural beauty with a beautifying meaning. So I am more used to calling him Liu Che, rather than Emperor Wu of Han. The vocabulary and narrative style of textbooks, in fact, it is to put the interests of the entire country, completely equivalent to the emperor's personal interests. Liu Che's actions were not for any special purpose. It is beneficial to the whole nation. But this is a rather outrageous and wrong misunderstanding.</p>
</details>

### 帝王视角：原始的控制欲与自恋

中国历史上那些“雄才大略”的皇帝，都是成就一番伟业的强势君主。但即使从当时而非现代的视角来看，这种“雄才大略”也带有精神疾病的迹象。实际上，我们很容易发现，中国文化中最崇高的精神，都与权力紧密相关。最高的境界就是帝王心态，或者他们能自发地从帝王视角看待问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">An emperor with great talent and strategy in Chinese history, they are all powerful monarchs who have achieved great things. But even from the perspective of that time rather than modern times, this kind of great talent, it is also a sign of mental illness. Actually, we can easily find, the most noble spirit in Chinese culture, they are closely related to power. The highest state is the emperor's mentality, or they can spontaneously look at the problem from the perspective of an emperor.</p>
</details>

例如，**刘邦**（Liu Bang: 汉朝开国皇帝）的“大丈夫当如是也”，**项羽**（Xiang Yu: 秦末农民起义领袖）看到皇帝车驾时说的“彼可取而代之”。人们称赞这些人“志向不小”。**毛泽东**（Mao Zedong: 中华人民共和国主要缔造者）的诗词，也充满了这种帝王视角，例如“欲与天公试比高”、“数风流人物还看今朝”、“敢教日月换新天”、“看世界翻天覆地”等等。这种看似豪迈浪漫、大格局、大体量的胸襟，其实是一种非常原始的控制欲和自恋状态。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">For example, Liu Bang's "A real man should be like this", when Xiang Yu saw the emperor's carriage, he said "You can replace it". People praise these people for their little ambitions. Mao Zedong's poems, it is also full of this imperial perspective. For example, "I want to compete with the gods", "Look at today", "Dare to teach the sun and the moon to change the sky", "Look at the world turning upside down" and so on. This kind of broad-mindedness that looks heroic and romantic, big volume, big pattern, it's actually a very primitive desire for control and narcissistic state.</p>
</details>

当人们从审美和认知的角度进入这种帝王氛围，从皇帝的视角看问题时，很容易忘记人与人之间的利益边界。例如，人们倾向于认为刘彻发动的战争都是为了国家安全和社会的整体利益。他发动的战争太多，所以被授予**谥号**“武”（Wu: 意为武功显赫）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">When people look at it from the perspective of aesthetics and cognition, entering this imperial atmosphere, from the perspective of the emperor, it is easy to forget the boundaries of interests between people. For example, people tend to think, wars launched by Liu Che, all for the overall interests of national security and society. He started too many wars. He was given the posthumous title "Wu".</p>
</details>

然而，这些战争中相当一部分仅仅是为了满足他的个人欲望。例如，刘彻非常喜欢**大宛**（Dayuan: 古代中亚的一个国家，以产汗血宝马闻名）的汗血宝马，就像朝鲜的三将军非常喜欢迈巴赫一样。他派使者去购买，但被大宛拒绝，于是使者侮辱了大宛王，结果被杀。大宛并未威胁汉朝的安全，但刘彻仍然决定对大宛发动战争，一是为了得到那些宝马，二也是为了给他宠爱的妃子李夫人之兄**李广利**（Li Guangli: 汉武帝宠妃李夫人之兄，因武帝宠爱而多次被派去攻打大宛）创造封侯的机会。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">However, these wars, there are quite a lot, it's just to satisfy his personal desires. For example, Liu Che was very fond of the famous horses of Dayuan. It's like the three generals of North Korea like Maybach very much. He sent messengers to buy, but it was rejected by Dayuan. So the envoy insulted the King of Dayuan. The result was killed. Dayuan did not threaten the security of the Han Dynasty. But Liu Che still decided to launch a war against Dayuan, to get those BMWs. It is also for his favorite concubine, Lady Li's brother Li Guangli created an opportunity to be crowned a marquis.</p>
</details>

第一次战争没有得到西域诸国的支持，遭遇惨败，几乎全军覆没。但没过多久，刘彻又调集了另一支庞大的军队，发动了第二次战争。这支军队包括六万士兵、十万头牛和三万匹马。在屠杀的震慑下，西域各国纷纷投降。这次战争进行得比较顺利，战死的人不多，大宛人也被迫杀死了他们的国王，并献上了三千匹宝马。但由于汉军过于腐败，对待士兵恶劣，等到返回故土时，只剩下了一万名士兵，这三千匹宝马也死了三分之二。但刘彻仍然非常高兴。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The first war did not receive support from the Western Regions. Suffering a crushing defeat, almost annihilated. But no, how long did Liu Che mobilize another huge army? Start of the Second War. This army included 60,000 soldiers, 100,000 cattle and 30,000 horses. Under the shock of the massacre, countries in the Western Regions surrendered one after another. This war went relatively smoothly. Not many people died in the war. The Dayuan people were also forced to kill their king, and donated 3000 BMWs. But because the Han army was too corrupt, treating soldiers badly, wait until you return to your homeland, only 10,000 soldiers left. Two-thirds of these BMWs also died. But Liu Che was still very happy.</p>
</details>

对**南越**（Nanyue: 古代中国南方的一个王国，由秦朝将领赵佗建立）也发动了类似的战争。南越并未威胁汉朝的国家安全，攻打南越主要是为了满足刘彻的扩张欲望。值得一提的是，这两次战争中，汉军中充斥着罪犯和囚徒，可以说这是一支罪犯组成的军队。这也能解释为什么他们伤亡如此惨重，人命如此不值钱。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">A similar war was waged against South Vietnam. Nanyue did not threaten the national security of the Han Dynasty. The attack on Nanyue was mainly to satisfy Liu Che's desire for expansion. It is worth mentioning that, in these two wars, the Han army was filled with criminals and prisoners. It can be said that this is an army of criminals. This can also explain, why did they suffer so many casualties? Human life is so worthless.</p>
</details>

至于帝国为何有如此多的罪犯，我们在之前的视频中也谈到过，西汉的**酷吏政治**（Cruel Officials Politics: 指汉武帝时期，朝廷重用严酷的官吏，以严刑峻法治理国家）使得普通百姓一举一动都可能触犯法律。一旦违法，就如同成为国家的奴隶。当兵员短缺时，征发囚犯是一种非常经济省钱的方式。国家先给你定罪，然后只要豁免你的刑法，就能激励你作战。所以这支军队也是一支奴隶军队，而非公民军队。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">As for why there are so many criminals in the Empire, we also talked about this in the previous video. The Cruel Officials Politics in the Western Han Dynasty, make ordinary people, to the point where every move you make could violate the law. Once it is illegal, it's like becoming a slave to the country. When there is a shortage of troops, conscripting prisoners, it is a very economical way to save money. The state first convicts you of a crime, then just exempt your criminal law, it can motivate you to fight. So this was also a slave army. Not a citizen army.</p>
</details>

这也让我们联想到，在现代，俄罗斯帝国也频繁征发囚犯上战场。虽然俄军也赢得了许多战争，但这种将士兵视为纯粹消耗品和炮灰的军队，并不值得尊敬。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This also makes us think of, in modern times, the Russian Empire also frequently conscripted prisoners to fight in the battlefield. Although the Russian army also won many wars, but this kind of treating soldiers as pure consumables, and the cannon fodder army, not respectable.</p>
</details>

### 史家的隐晦批判与帝王战争的真实逻辑

正是因为刘彻时代的许多战争完全没有必要，所以**班固**（Ban Gu: 东汉史学家，《汉书》的作者）在《**汉书**》（Book of Han: 中国古代纪传体断代史，记载了西汉历史）中称赞刘彻的功绩时，主要集中在他设立**太学**（Imperial College: 中国古代的最高学府）和制定立法，以及**罢黜百家，独尊儒术**的文化事业上，而完全避而不谈他的军事功绩。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It is precisely because of the many wars during Liu Che's era, it's totally unnecessary. Therefore, Ban Gu praised Liu Che's achievements in the Book of Han, mainly focused on his establishment of the Imperial College and the formulation of legislation, in the cultural undertakings of abolishing all schools of thought, and completely avoids mentioning his military exploits.</p>
</details>

最后，班固评论道：“像汉武帝这样英明能干的君主，如果能把精力用在节俭上，那就太好了！”这很容易让我们想到**陈寿**（Chen Shou: 西晋史学家，《三国志》的作者）在《**三国志**》（Records of the Three Kingdoms: 记载中国三国时期历史的纪传体史书）中对**曹丕**（Cao Pi: 曹魏开国皇帝）的批评。陈寿先是说曹丕如何博学多才，如果能再开阔心胸，再多些德行和仁慈，那就完美了。这实际上是中国史家在帝王专制下，一种无奈而隐晦的批评。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Finally, Ban Gu commented: "A monarch as wise and capable as Emperor Wu of Han, if you can use your energy on frugality, that's great!" This makes it easy for us to think, Chen Shou's criticism of Cao Pi in "Records of the Three Kingdoms", let's talk about Cao Pi first. How knowledgeable and versatile! If I could be more open-minded, be more virtuous and kind, then it's perfect. This is actually what Chinese historians, under the imperial despotism, a helpless and obscure criticism.</p>
</details>

也许有人会说，抛开那些不必要的战争，汉朝对匈奴的战争，即使给社会增加了沉重负担，但它仍然保护了人民的生命财产。然而，我们仍然需要清楚区分刘彻发动的战争与现代国家的反侵略战争的本质区别。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Maybe someone will say, let's put aside those unnecessary wars. Han Dynasty's War against Xiongnu, even if it adds a heavy burden to society, but it still protects the lives and property of the people. However, we still need to clearly distinguish, the wars launched by Liu Che, anti-aggression wars with modern countries, the essential difference between.</p>
</details>

《**史记**》（Records of the Grand Historian: 中国第一部纪传体通史，由司马迁撰写）中记载的一件事就说明了这一点：与匈奴作战，与保护人民的权利毫无关系。《**汲郑列传**》（Biography of Ji Zheng: 《史记》中的一篇列传，记载了汲黯和郑当时的事迹）中记载：匈奴的一个部落前来投降汉朝，这让刘彻非常得意。于是刘彻下令用两万辆车去迎接。当时政府没有钱，只好向百姓借马。百姓也不傻，都把马藏了起来。刘彻非常生气，想要杀死长安县令。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">An incident recorded in the Records of the Grand Historian illustrates this. Fight against the Huns, it has nothing to do with protecting people's rights. The Biography of Ji Zheng says: A tribe of the Xiongnu came to surrender to the Han Dynasty. This made Liu Che very proud. So Liu Che ordered 20,000 vehicles to welcome. The government had no money at that time. I had to borrow horses from the citizens. The citizens are not stupid either. They hid their horses. Liu Che was very angry, want to kill the Chang'an County Magistrate.</p>
</details>

这时，**汲黯**（Ji An: 西汉大臣，以刚直不阿闻名）问皇帝：“匈奴投降，我们只需让沿途各县慢慢准备车马即可，为何要搞得全国上下动荡不安，让百姓奔走服侍匈奴呢？”刘彻听后沉默不语。匈奴到达长安后，在市场上购买货物，长安的执法官员却拘泥于法律条文，认为百姓向敌人贩卖货物，等同于犯了非法走私罪，一下子处死了五百多名商人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">At this time, Ji An asked the emperor, the Huns surrender, all we need to do is ask the counties along the way to slowly prepare their carriages and horses. Why cause unrest across the country? Let the people run around serving the Huns? Liu Che remained silent. After the Huns arrived in Chang'an, buying goods on the market, law enforcement officials in Chang'an are obsessed with the letter of the law, think that the citizens are selling goods to the enemy, it is equivalent to committing illegal smuggling. More than 500 businessmen were executed in one go.</p>
</details>

汲黯又问刘彻：“我们攻打匈奴，战死无数人，耗费亿万钱财，我以为陛下得到了匈奴的财物，会赏赐给阵亡将士的家属，以慰藉天下百姓的辛劳。即使不能做到这一点，也不应该把府库中的所有财宝都掏空，赏赐给匈奴，招募正直体面的人去服侍他们，让他们成为上宾。我们不应该用严酷的法律，杀害五百多名无知的百姓。陛下这是舍本逐末啊！”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Ji An asked Liu Che again, we are here to conquer the Huns, countless people died in the war, it cost billions of dollars. I thought Your Majesty had obtained the Xiongnu's property. Will be rewarded to the family of the deceased, to comfort the hard work of people all over the world. Even if you can't do this, nor should we empty all the treasures in the government warehouses. Reward the Huns, recruiting honest and decent people to serve them, make them the best. We should not use harsh laws. Killed more than 500 ignorant people. This is how you protect the leaves at the expense of the branches.</p>
</details>

但刘彻听后，认为汲黯是在胡说八道，不久后就将他罢免了。从这样一件小事中，我们可以清楚地看到帝国战争的真实逻辑和酷吏政治的真相。首先，皇帝为了自己的面子，允许匈奴进入京城，并命令百姓服侍他们。那么此时，匈奴至少不应该被视为国家的敌人，百姓与他们做生意，就不应该再被冠以走私通敌的罪名。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But after Liu Che heard this, I think Ji An is talking nonsense. He was dismissed soon after. From such a small thing, we can clearly see, the true logic of the empire's war and the truth about cruel politics. First, the emperor wanted to save his own face. Allowing the Huns to enter the capital, and ordered the people to serve them. Then at this time, the Huns should at least not be considered enemies of the state. Citizens do business with them, they should no longer be charged with smuggling and treason.</p>
</details>

然而，帝国政府却没有出台相应的临时规定来调整现有法律，百姓的法律义务和风险丝毫没有改变。这就给基层官员制造了一个两难困境：在这个模糊地带，他们不知道该不该执法。他们害怕上级追究，于是按照“宁左勿右”的原则，一律杀掉。在酷吏政治下，杀人太多，只能说是可以纠正和批评的小错误；如果杀人太少，那将是立场不坚定、原则性错误。所以，多杀人才是上策。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">However, the imperial government, however, no corresponding temporary regulations have been issued, to adjust the existing law. The legal obligations and risks of the people have not changed in the slightest. This creates a dilemma for grassroots officials: In this fuzzy area, they don't know whether to enforce the law. I am afraid that my superiors will investigate me. I killed them all in accordance with the principle of preferring the left to the right. Under the cruel politics, killing too many people, I can only say, it is a small mistake that can be corrected and criticized. If we kill less, that would be a principled mistake of not being firm in one's stance. So killing more is the best strategy.</p>
</details>

然而，对于百姓来说，这是一个无解的难题。你向匈奴贩卖货物，可能会被杀；你拒绝服侍他们，也会被杀。朝廷打败了匈奴，我的弱势地位不仅丝毫没有改变，反而有更多的人被杀。毕竟，在刘彻眼中，匈奴更具有**统一战线**（United Front: 政治术语，指不同政治力量为共同目标而结成的联盟）的价值。因此，攻打匈奴的出发点，与其说是为了保护人民的生命财产，不如说是皇帝将人民视为自己的私产，更谈不上保护人民的权利。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">However, for citizens, this is an unsolvable problem. If you sell goods to the Huns, you may be killed. If you refuse to serve them, you will be killed. The court defeated the Huns, not only has my weak position not changed at all, instead, there are more people. After all, in Liu Che's eyes, the Huns are more valuable for united front work. Therefore, the starting point of attacking the Huns was, it is not so much to protect people's lives and property, it's better to say, the emperor regarded the people as his private property, not to mention protecting the people's rights.</p>
</details>

### 专制帝王的“瞎折腾”与权力合法性的差异

事实上，这在古代中国皇帝那里也是常态。另一位同样“雄才大略”的皇帝**李世民**（Li Shimin: 唐朝第二位皇帝，即唐太宗），也是如此。《**贞观政要**》（Zhenguan Zhengyao: 唐代吴兢撰写的一部政论性史书，记载了唐太宗与大臣的对话及治国方略）中记载了一件非常相似的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In fact, this was also the norm for ancient Chinese emperors. Another equally talented emperor, Li Shimin, the same is true. The Zhenguan Zhengyao records a very similar event.</p>
</details>

据说当时许多突厥部落投降唐朝，李世民对每个首领都授予高官，五品以上的官员就有数百人，这个规模大约与当时已有的官员数量相当。每个突厥人都能得到大量的钱财和衣服，首领能得到更多的赏赐，甚至还有大量的土地和房屋。当时的梁州都督**李大亮**（Li Daliang: 唐朝初年名将、宰相）就批评李世民说，陛下应该把本国百姓的生计搞好，生活富足，周边民族自然会向往。而陛下的做法却是“以中国之租赋，养积恶之虏，益多益重，此非中国之利也”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</p>
<p class="english-text">It is said that at that time many Turkic tribes surrendered to the Tang Dynasty. Li Shimin granted high positions to each leader. There are hundreds of officials above the fifth rank. This scale is about the same as the number of officials already. Every Turk, you can get a lot of money and clothes. The leader can get more rewards, even a lot of land and houses. Li Daliang, the governor of Liangzhou at that time, criticized Li Shimin, saying that Your Majesty should put the people of your country first. My life is good. The surrounding ethnic groups will naturally yearn for. And His Majesty's approach is, "With China's rent, the vicious captive who accumulated evil, the more people there are, the better, and this is not good for China."</p>
</details>

也就是说，用中华百姓辛辛苦苦缴纳的赋税，去供养邪恶残暴的敌人，而且供养的人越来越多，这对中国并没有好处。然而，李世民并没有采纳这些意见。后来，李世民外出巡游，投降的突厥人相互勾结，袭击了他的营地。从此以后，李世民不再信任突厥人，并反思身边的人，说当初没有采纳**魏征**（Wei Zheng: 唐初名臣，以直言敢谏闻名）的建议，现在才意识到这种政策的劳民伤财。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That is, with the hard-earned taxes paid by the Chinese people, to feed the evil and cruel enemies, and there are more and more people to support. However, Li Shimin did not accept these opinions. Later, Li Shimin went out to travel, the Turks who had surrendered colluded with each other, attacked his camp. From then on, Li Shimin no longer trusted the Turks. Reflect on the people around you, said that Wei Zheng's suggestion was not adopted at the beginning, now I realize how wasteful and costly this policy is.</p>

中原百姓才是国家的根本。但这种反思非常虚伪，他的转变完全是因为突厥人想要发动政变杀死他，而不是突然领悟了那些大道理。因此，我们说，所有专制帝王都倾向于成就一番“大事业”，也就是所谓的“雄才大略”。而专制制度下的“大事业”，通常意味着“大折腾”。

<p class="english-text">The people of the Central Plains are the foundation of the country. But this kind of reflection is very hypocritical. His change of mind was entirely due to, the Turks wanted to stage a coup and kill him. Instead of suddenly realizing those great truths. Therefore, we say, all despotic emperors, they all tend to achieve great things. That is the so-called great talent. The great achievements under the autocratic system, it usually means a lot of trouble.</p>
</details>

至于为什么有些皇帝没有“折腾”，更多是因为客观条件不允许，而不是皇帝本人真的不想。例如，**汉文帝**（Emperor Wen of Han: 西汉第五位皇帝）和**汉景帝**（Emperor Jing of Han: 西汉第六位皇帝）没有像刘彻那样“折腾”，主要是因为西汉早期仍然存在能够制约皇权的力量，那就是功臣和诸侯王，他们尚未被完全清除，仍然活跃在政治舞台上，与皇权形成了三足鼎立的关系。

<p class="english-text">As for why some emperors did not make trouble, it's more because objective conditions don't allow it. It's not that the emperor himself really doesn't want to. For example, Emperor Wen of Han and Emperor Jing of Han, no messing around like Liu Che did, mainly due to the early Western Han Dynasty, there is still a force that can restrain the imperial power. That is, the meritorious officials and the princes, not yet eliminated. They are still active in the political arena. It formed a tripartite relationship with the imperial power.</p>

但随着他们逐渐被皇权削平、清除，皇权从百姓手中汲取财富的制度和能力越来越强。此时，出现像刘彻这样强势的君主几乎是必然的。或者说，任何一个人，当你拥有巨大的财富和大量的奴隶时，都很难忍住什么都不做。

<p class="english-text">But as they were gradually flattened and eliminated by the imperial power, the system and ability of the imperial power to extract wealth from the people, growing stronger. At this time, it is almost inevitable that someone will appear, a powerful monarch like Liu Che. Or anyone, when you have great wealth and a large number of slaves, it's hard to bear to do nothing.</p>

之所以这样的君主总是在中国历史上出现，首先在于权力合法性的来源问题上，中西方**法理学**（Jurisprudence: 法律哲学，研究法律的性质、理论和实践）有着完全不同的看法。**韩愈**（Han Yu: 唐代文学家、思想家）说：“人者生也，固若禽兽，圣人者立，然后知我生于宫室，食于稻粱……是故无大于仁义，无善于礼乐刑政。”

<p class="english-text">The reason why, such monarchs always appear in Chinese history, first, at the source of the legitimacy of power, in this issue, Chinese and Western jurisprudence have completely different views. Han Yu said: "When people are born, as solid as barbarians and beasts, saints stand, then I know that I live in a palace and eat grains of rice… Therefore, there is no greater way than benevolence and righteousness, "There is no better teaching than ritual, music, punishment and politics"</p>

也就是说，百姓如同禽兽般蒙昧无知，是圣人建立了制度，创造了生存条件，才使人得以生存。就像那首朝鲜歌曲《没有他我们活不了》一样。因为圣人对百姓的这种巨大救赎和恩典，所以法律的一切奥秘，只能由圣人垄断。这是中国法制反复重申和强调的基本原则。

<p class="english-text">That is, the people were as ignorant as animals. It was the saints who established the system. Creates conditions for survival, so that people can survive. Just like that North Korean song, We Can't Live Without Him. Because, this great salvation and grace of the saints to their people, so all the mysteries of the law, only the saints can monopolize it. This is the Chinese legal system, the basic principles that have been reiterated and emphasized countless times.</p>

正如**王毅**（Wang Yi: 中国外交官）所说，中西方法律理论基础的巨大差异，导致中国法文化无法想象这样一种制度：例如在**罗马法**（Roman Law: 古罗马的法律体系，对后世西方法律影响深远）中，即使强调皇权的崇高性，也必须首先承认皇权来源于人民和法律的授权，承认皇帝的意志具有法律效力，是因为皇帝行使了罗马人所有的法律权威。

<p class="english-text">As Wang Yi said, the great difference between the theoretical foundations of Chinese and Western law, this has led to China's legal culture, I can't imagine such a system. For example, in Roman law, even though the emphasis on the sublimity of imperial power, we must first acknowledge, imperial power comes from the authorization of the people and the law, recognize that the emperor's will has legal effect, because, the emperor exercised all legal authority over the Romans.</p>

中国民族主义总是将皇帝视为民族共同体的象征，它将前现代、专制政权下君主的行为，包装成现代国家理性运作的产物。例如，皇帝发动的对外战争，被描述为“保家卫国”；皇帝的开疆拓土，被神圣化为“民族尊严”；对边疆少数民族的压迫和征服，被美化为“统一的多民族国家”或“民族融合”；用“国家利益”取代“家天下”的逻辑，并试图与现代国家主权概念相连接。但这些都与事实相去甚远。

<p class="english-text">Chinese nationalism, always the Emperor, seen as a symbol of the national community. He compares the behavior of monarchs in a pre-modern and authoritarian regime, packaged as a product of rational operation of a modern country. For example, the foreign wars launched by the emperor, described as "defending the country". The emperor's territorial expansion was sanctified as "national dignity". Oppression and conquest of ethnic minorities in border areas, whitewashed as a "unified multi-ethnic country" or "national integration". Replace the logic of "family rule" with "national interests", and try to connect with the modern concept of state sovereignty. But these are far from the truth.</p>
