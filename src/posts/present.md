# Presentation: Test Framework Modernization Strategy

## Slide 1: Title Page

Test Framework Modernization: A Strategic Transformation

From a Simple Library Swap to a True Architectural Upgrade

## Slide 2: The Problem

Our Test Framework is Weighed Down by Technical Debt

Overly Complex: The current JBehave + CDI architecture involves over 27 separate database sessions and complex custom logic.

Difficult to Maintain: Only a few team members fully understand its inner workings, creating knowledge silos.

Slow Onboarding: It takes new members weeks to get up to speed, severely impacting development velocity.

Accumulated Risk: Every change feels like defusing a bomb; we are locked in by an outdated and fragile framework.

## Slide 3: The Initial Idea & The Roadblock

I Tried a Quick Fix: Just Replacing the JBehave Library

Initial Plan (Bedrock): Attempted to replace JBehave with Cucumber within the existing CDI architecture.

The Harsh Reality: We quickly realized this was like putting a new door on a house with a faulty foundation. The core problems—the complexity of CDI and chaotic database management—remained.

Conclusion: A simple library swap is just a band-aid; it cannot solve the fundamental architectural issues.

## Slide 4: Our New Approach: Specs Driving Development (SDD)

Architecture-First, AI-Assisted, Human-Led

Goal: Migrate to a modern architecture with Cucumber + Spring Boot 3.

Our methodology is simple and powerful:

Create the Spec: We start with clear documentation and architectural decisions, creating a "blueprint" for what needs to be built.

AI Generates the Code: We feed this blueprint to an AI, which generates the first draft of the new code, handling the repetitive, boilerplate work.

Humans Verify & Refine: Our developers then step in to review, test, and refine the AI's output. We maintain full control over quality and logic. This is Specs Driving Development.

## Slide 5: The Method

A Phased, Controlled Path to Modernization

Phase 1: Architectural Simplification

Replace 27 database sessions with a single DataSource Router.

Replace complex custom scopes and logic with standard Spring solutions.

Phase 2: Progressive Migration with SDD

Build an adapter layer to allow old and new systems to run in parallel.

Use Feature Flags as a safety net for instant rollbacks.

Apply the SDD Cycle: For each module, we create the spec, let the AI generate the code, and have developers validate it. This ensures a consistent, high-quality migration.

Phase 3: Full Cutover & Optimization

Decommission the old JBehave/CDI system.

Optimize the new framework for performance and stability.

## Slide 6: The Payoff

This is More Than Just a Technical Upgrade

Increased Efficiency: Onboarding time for new developers will be reduced from weeks to days.

Reduced Complexity: Configuration complexity is expected to decrease by 70%, making the code easier to understand and maintain.

Team Growth: The team will master industry-standard technologies like Spring Boot, enhancing our overall capabilities.

Knowledge Democratization: End knowledge silos, allowing more team members to contribute to the framework's maintenance and development.

A Foundation for the Future: Establish a solid, scalable "bedrock" for the future of our product quality assurance.

## Slide 7: Conclusion & Next Steps

"The best architecture is not the most complex one, but the simplest one that meets the requirements."

This modernization is our opportunity to challenge the status quo and embrace simplicity and efficiency.

Next Steps:

Complete a POC to validate the feasibility of a custom scope in Spring Boot.

Design a detailed data source routing solution.

Begin the pilot migration of the first module.

We ask for your support to embark on this critical transformation journey together.
